A young widowed father opening up about living with loss
Grieving.
It’s funny you mention dreams, Ben.
A few nights after our Mark died, I woke up at 2am to my son (then 15months) laughing hysterically in his sleep. Something he has never done before. It’s very odd. However I like to think, like you said yourself here, that daddy visited him or maybe he dreamt about his daddy throwing him up in the air or chasing him around the house.
I found that comforting.
I’m sure Desreen is always checking in with Jackson. She will be with him (and you) forever, and you will ‘know’ she’s there when you’re ready. Awesome shirt by the way Jackson!
Jackson looks lovely and how special that he knows his mummy is going to see him in his new shirt. Ben this is a good sign and as time goes on I hope he will always think his mummy will be watching over him. He is adorable xxxx
Your posts often just leave me feeling wordless. Yet I want to support you in your grief, and the incredible way in which you share it here, in your blog. I can’t imagine carrying the weight of grief for two. Just carrying it for one is tough enough. You have an amazing capacity to remain open to your loss, your son’s loss, and the different ways you are processing it. What a handsome, wonderful little guy you have. Wishing you both the best in your healing.
Firstly Ben, I think you are so brave to write this blog. I am so, so sorry to read what has happened to your beautiful family. It’s incredibly inspiring to hear a personal, honest, emotional account from a blokey. I’m sure this will help many, many people. Thank you.
My Dad died suddenly, aged 38, when I was just 10, he was fine one day and gone the next, so sudden, just taken from us. As I sit here writing this 23 years later (now as a parent) I am in tears as I can to some extent understand the loss you must be feeling but you also have the responsibility of grieving for your son too. Your strength is amazing and your son looks so lovely.
A while after my Dad died, I was helping my Mum hold a shelf as she unscrewed it and I felt this strong tug to the back of my t-shirt, no-one else was in the room but I had a strong sense he was there …perhaps saying “well done” for helping my Mum with the tasks he would have been doing. It happened once more a while later when I had a boy in the house that I wasn’t supposed to…just this tug…so strange…yet I had this immense feeling that he was there. I don’t know why your beautiful young wife was taken from you but I do believe she will be there to watch over you both.
My sister and I didn’t have any counselling when our Dad was taken but I do believe it could of helped, as although my Mum was the most fantastic single parent you could EVER wish for I still so got so angry sometimes, questioning God, questioning everything, blaming myself and throughout life I have always seemed to be looking over my shoulder waiting for another unimaginable sudden event to occur.
Your blog and support of “Grief Encounter” is just amazing such a short time after what has happened to you.
Your Jackson is a beautiful young man. I expect everyone was impressed with his gorgeous new shirt! I also have a two-year old son and know how inquisitive, adorable and amazing they are. I’m sure he will love hearing about all the wonderful stories and memories you have of his beautiful Mummy. x
My baby girl is less than 2 months old and I wonder what will she say in situations like this. Her mother passed away a month ago.
It really is a brilliant shirt.
Hi Ben,
Lovely blog. I am 31yrs old and recently lost my beautiful wife in February this year(2013) from an asthma attack.
The most painful thing was that it happened suddenly. We woke up fine on Saturday morning 23/02/13 after a fantastic night the day before. She was using her inhalers and then nebuliser and the next and final thing she said to me was to call the ambulance, but she collapsed after that and never woke up.
We have 3 wonderful sons together aged 18 months, 5 and 9.
I have found it incredibly difficult to cope with the grief, but I get my strength from the boys. Like you mentioned, there are days where you think you ‘re doing well only for the boys to say something about their mum that totally floors you.
I recently started seeing a bereavement counsellor through my work, and I have had 3 sessions. However, I don’t feel like its working, as I feel like I need men like you who have been through the same event, that can actually relate to my situation.
I need men that I can learn from, to cope with the really difficult times.
Thank you so much for this blog.
May God bless you and Jackson.

i just read all the conversation , the journey you have been pursuing is extremly interesting to me because as a tutsi from burundi it is the first time i hear about possible precolonial migration to europe and america , i always assume our ethnic grouping to be too small to retain their specificity within the african continent or beyond nevertheless i applaud the whole entreprise ,only i would like to add is that the tutsi as a group is a very loose concept nowadays , we do not have our own language or different culture from the surrounding people, the last vestige being the physical appearance , you will agree with me , cannot always be 100% .
anyway let me know how it all turn out

Why there will be more than enough swine flu vaccine to go around (AZN, GSK, NOVN, SNY, NVAX, SVA, INO, HEB, CVM, BPAX)
With federal health officials now stepping up efforts to be sure there is enough swine flu vaccine in the U.S., opportunities may be slimmer than the Street expects for all but five companies taking the lead in delivering them.
Count on Congress to take swift action when problems hit close to home. This week, six Senate pages are sick with flu symptoms that could be H1N1, or swine flu. It just so happens that this is the week the government suggested 159 million Americans get vaccinated.
Five companies are busy ramping H1N1 vaccine production for the U.S. market, in hopes of making them available in October.
Those companies are AstraZeneca plc (NYSE: AZN), GlaxoSmithKline plc (NYSE: GSK), Novartis AG (Nasdaq: NOVN), Sanofi-Aventis SA (NYSE: SNY) and Australia’s CSL Ltd.
Many also-ran companies also are preparing vaccine candidates, in the event they are needed. Those companies include Novavax Inc. (Nasdaq: NVAX), Sinovac Biotech Ltd. (Amex: SVA), Inovio Biomedical Corp. (Amex: INO), Hemespherix Biopharma Inc. (Amex: HEB), Cel-Sci Corp. (Amex: CVM) and BioSante Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Nasd BPAX).
Despite the big ramp in swine flu vaccine production, shares of most also-ran swine flu vaccine makers have been running for months, partly in anticipation that they, too, will see top-line benefits from major Western governments buying product from them, perhaps as early as this flu season.
A look at the numbers suggests the swine flu revenue available to the also- rans may be slim.
Federal health officials this week said pregnant women, health care workers and children six months and older should be first to get vaccinated — a group that totals about 159 million people. Bullish traders long many of the also-rans note that there will not be enough to go around: Only 120 million doses of the vaccine will be made available by the five approved manufacturers by fall.
But that may be more than enough to cover everyone who wants one. Many Americans either do not have access to the vaccines, or are happy to go without them. The CDC would like 90 percent of seniors and 60 percent of high-risk adults to receive flu shots. But in 2006-2007, only 66 percent of seniors and 35 percent of targeted young adults ever received them, despite that year being an active flu season.
For those who think that adults will make sure their kids get the shot, the data suggest otherwise. Children may be the population that lags most when it comes to getting inoculations. According to the CDC, fewer than 15 percent of kids in the U.S. get all of their recommended vaccines. According to the most recent CDC data available, the most aggressive state when it comes to inoculations is Massachusetts, where more than a quarter of kids received all the shots they are supposed to have.
Access to vaccinations is only part of the problem. Among the wealthy, there are parents who are choosing not to give their kids their recommended shots, for fear of side effects. Plus, some parents believe their kids are safe, because all the other kids are getting their inoculations (which the data suggest is not the case).
True, the CDC will likely put out an all-out press blitz to get kids immunized against swine flu. But based on past efforts, an aggressive adoption rate may be 60 percent of the targeted population — or about 95 million.
Adoption among senators likely will be high. For everyone else who needs one and makes the effort to get one, there likely will be more than enough to go around — Mike TarsalaWe created Pandora to put the Music Genome Project directly in your hands

"Our friend who preceded mo told

Jnmcs Vick, in his excellent Floral
Guide, gives tho following practical
directions for somo autumn work in the
flower garden:
There is a little garden work that
CAN bo dono to much octtcr advantage
now than nt any other time, whilo there
i somo work that .must bo attended to
in tho autumn, or left forever undone
Wo will endeavor to givo our readers
somo ideas on theso two classes of
.work.
It is a good time, in the pleasant
tall weather, lor arranging beils ol her
baceous plants, such as hollyhocks,
delphiniums, pnjonias, etc. Knots can
bp ilivnlou without injury, and generally
with great health to tho plants. Lilies,
and hardy bulbs, can also bo removed
and replanted ns as soon as tlio leaves
begin to ripen. Plants that nro some
what tender in tho North, such ns trito
mas, pamas, grass, etc., and any othor
tender plants that it would bo desirable
to save over tho winter, may bo secured
in pits or cool cellars. A simplo pit is
secured by removing the earth for say
two feet, over which is placed a hot-bed
frame and s.ish. Even hoards or matn
will answer for covering. Give air dur
ing fino weather.
General improvements in tho garden
should bo now made, for our springs
arc short and unpleasant. Dig up and
put in order every vacant bed, ns it will
not only facilitato spring work, hut do
tho sou gooil and havo a neater appear
ance than if loft rough and weedy.
All bulbs and plants that die down
to tho ground in autumn may bo pro
tected by covering tho surfaco of the
earth with leaves, manure or straw, but
plants that retain their leaves during
winter will not bear this kind of pro
tection. A few evergreen bows thrown
over tho bed, a Httlo straw between tho
plants, or somo light, open covering of
this kind, is nil thoy will bear without
danger of smothering nnd rotting.
AUTUMN SOWING.
Most pcoplo havo observed, no doubt,
that self-sown seeds, that is, seeds that

is true of sovoral kinds, and particular
ly ol those, that sutler uudor exposure
to our midsummer suns. Tho reason
is that self-sown seeds get a very
healthy growth in the spring, vegetat
ing as soon as frost is gone, and are
good sized plants at the timo wo usually
put seeds iu -tho ground, even if they
do not start in tho fall. Thoy thus
mature and flower during tho cool
weather of spring. Tho clarkias and
Hemophilus and annual larkspurs aro
noted examples. There are also several
varieties of hardy annuals that do
well with spring sowing, that will bear
autumn sowing in tho open ground, nnd
reward us with early spring flowers.
Sweet alyssum nnd white- eandy-tuft
will givo us nbundanco of whito for

shady soil tho portulao may bo sown in
autumn with good success. Seeds of

>> Monday, October 13, 2008
I am not much of a runner as the treadmill does not excite me at all .I hate following the motion of a machine with a pace depending on your strength (or weakness). Running outdoor is neither stimulating as pollution irritates me. Since I have transferred from one club (gym) to another several years back, what I truly enjoyed most was the group exercise where I get the chance to share my exhaustion and relief with my gym buddies at the end of each workout I may be a solitary person, but when it comes to working out, I prefer to sweat out with friends which I always look forward to everyday.
Out of nowhere, Jonas convinced me to join the Adidas King of the Road (KOTR) which I nonchalantly agreed. Initially, I registered for 5k while 21k for Jonas. We later decided to both join 10k instead. Reason being, I pestered Jonas on the effect of abrupt increase to 21k as this is just his second time to join a marathon. He on the other hand convinced me to run 10k as I have already tried 7.5k last year. Meaning, we have 4 singlets (ahihihihi).
Come October 11, 2008, Jonas and I were physically and emotional ready to hit the road together with thousands of eager runners. Different personalities were present, known and unknown, but with one common goal : to run. When the gun was fired for the 10k race, everyone started running. I couldn’t trace my pace, despite the polar watch RS200 SD that I bought a day before just for this event, as my eyes was preoccupied with those in front of me who were running so fast and those behind me who were zooming past me. I wanted to follow the pace of my fellow runners but I just couldn’t do such. Instead, I opted to walk, sometimes slow and fast in between jog and run. Buendia flyover, which is a familiar lane for all people who travel to and from the south area, was the most challenging road I’ve ever passed. Heading towards half the 10k, saw Jonas already wearing the blue straw in his neck ( proof that he has reached half of the race)going back to Buendia flyover. Seeing the exhaustion in my face, my husband lovingly motioned that I skip on the fence and just go back with him. My body wanted so much to stop, but my heart turned out to be stronger than my body at that point in time. Geeh, got slight relief when the marshall handed to me the blue straw which I proudly put into my neck. 5k more and I will reach the finish line. Going back to Buendia flyover, I bumped into a gym buddy, Rhoze Lim who was with a pro runner. We were given a tip that going up a hill is easier and less tiring if you jog at a very slow pace, and so I did. The mere sight of Jollibee from Buendia flyover somehow gave me a sheer anticipation that I was nearing the finish line. Few minutes more, saw the flow of sweating runners being cheered by quite a few onlookers. And there I was, heart pounding, eagerly running towards the lane for Female participants. I made the 10k for 1 hour and 18 minutes.
With this milestone, I am now determined to run (indoor and outdoor) and hit the gym. Don’t you want this too?

Gorzelanny moving to the 'pen
PITTSBURGH -- Left-hander Tom Gorzelanny is the odd-man out of the starting rotation with the return of Carlos Zambrano on Wednesday at Pittsburgh. Zambrano rejoins the rotation after slightly more than a month as a setup man. Gorzelanny is 2-5 with a 3.66 ERA.
"Gorzelanny had a throw day on Saturday," Cubs manager Lou Piniella indicated. "We didn't use him [Sunday], but he's ready to go today and he's in the bullpen and he'll pitch in the middle to long role to start with and we'll see how he goes."
Gorzelanny expressed a preference to stay in the rotation, but will do whatever it takes to help the team.
"Whatever they need me to do is what I'm going to do," Gorzelanny said. "I felt like I've pitched well and look forward to continuing to do that now. Whatever they need me to do I'll be able to do."

Review for HomeAid Orange County, Inc., Irvine,Prologue
Something is tied up in that cage. Two arms, pinioned with rope at the wrists against the cold iron bars, spread-eagled like Christ on the cross. It might be a man, thought little about the figure suggests as much. Its head hangs down upon its chest, limp as if unconscious, though it is not. The hair is a tangled mass, matted and filthy. It is dressed in nothing but a pair of ragged brown trousers tied on with a cord, like the loincloth of a savage. The light from a single candle highlights ribs that jut obscenely beneath wasted flesh, and flickers over a spectrum of bruises from old yellow to deep burgundy, a horrific watercolor on skin. Its breath, which is ragged, forms a white cloud that hangs about its head – it is November, and it is naked in the cold. Here is less a man than a beast, made so, we must acknowledge, by other men who have something of the beast about them, if not in their appearance, then at least in their souls.
But no man is responsible for that face. No, that mangled, misshapen approximation of a human visage goes beyond the art of man to create – with knives, with fire, with acid. No, God made that face. And God alone is responsible.
The eyes of that face are closed, as if they cannot bear to look upon their own misfortune. A body broken, a life destroyed, a dignity laid waste. And it is fortunate, too, that they are closed, for who could bear to look into their wild depths, and find a soul fully conscious of its own demise; who could see such a thing, and be unchanged by it?
All is silent in that tent that holds the cage, as if the fabric shuts out the joy of the world, just as it shuts in this example of misery. All is silent, except…
It hears, for it cannot shut his ears as well as its eyes, it hears… music. Borne on the air, a mélodie floating, insinuating itself between the pain and the despair. The strains of a violin, and a child's voice, a girl's voice, as pure and sweet as cold clear water to a thirsty man.
"The arms of my love are like home,
Where safe he'll keep me always,
His kisses melt the winter snow,
His smile drives away the clouds.
And when I wander far afield,
Through loneliness and fear,
I'll think always of my love, and home.
Of my love, my home..."Others now saying Reyes not likely to be traded
“They should make the effort and try to sign him, for sure,” Carlos Beltran told The Post, about the Mets and Jose Reyes. “I don’t know what’s in his mind, but players like him, they don’t come too often.”
According to the 8,000 people who voted last week week, the Mets should offer Reyes a five-year deal worth around $85 million, possibly with a sixth-year option that could bring the value over $100 million.
Last week, in response to Darren Meenan’s Don’t Trade Reyes campaign, I wrote, “I still think there is very, very little chance the Mets trade Reyes, despite certain people in media who are hellbent on getting us all riled up about it.”
In addition, based on what I’ve heard from people close to the Mets and on other teams, I’ve been saying for more months how I don’t understand why fans and media feel it is a forgone conclusion Reyes will be traded. To me, this has always been the easy, pessimistic, fatalistic response and a great way for talk show hosts and print media to gin up debate.
So, it’s nice to finally see mainstream reporters and columnists coming around, like Adam Rubin at ESPN, who said yesterday, “It now appears highly likely the Mets will keep Reyes at the trading deadline,” and Joel Sherman of the New York Post, who added Sunday, “The more I talk to Mets officials, the more I get the feeling they will not (trade Reyes).”
Exactly. However, long term, it’s tricky.
Last year, at this point in the season, Jose was batting .246 with just 16 extra base hits, as he worked his way back from leg injuries and a thyroid issue. There was zero talk of signing him to an extension. In fact, I heard from lots of fans and media who questioned whether he could ever play a full season healthy; if he was strong and mature enough to retain; and whether or not he should be traded last off season.
Now, here we are, a year later, he’s on fire, playing great, and looking like a National League MVP, and fans want him back at the tune of five or six years and roughly $16 million a season.
Just like it’s not effective to trade someone at the low point of their value, it’s probably equally unwise to pay someone at the possible peak of their value. The question is, is five-years, $80 million fair, given what Jose does for the team on field, at the ticket counter, in terms of marketing, excitement, etc., not just based on what he has done, but also what he’s capable of doing going forward.
Also, what’s the plan without Reyes? I put A LOT of stock in to knowing he can play in New York, he can handle the pressure, he understands expectations, knows the media, and his performed well in spite of it all. What’s more, most fans love him. To me, those two things have major value, especially when you consider the number of big-time players who come here and are a bust. There will be no learning curve for Jose. He’s already a star in New York.
Therefore, if I had to put money on it, I’d bet he and the Mets eventually agree to a five-year, $95 million deal with an option, similar to what Ken Rosenthal suggested earlier this week on FoxSports.com.
The thing is, and we always seem to forget this part of the equation, does Jose Reyes want to re-sign with the Mets?HTC’s One, which was announced less than a month ago, will hit the Taiwanese market this week according to a local Taiwanese publication. For reasons we don’t understand, it’ll have 16 GB of storage.
Young people own phones and tablets these days, but not credit cards, so they can’t buy apps. That’s why gift cards exist, and they’re soon going to come to the UK.
ZTE’s USA CEO told FierceWireless in an interview that the company doesn’t want to throw money away on advertising. Their operator partners will do that for them.
Google is going to copy Opera Mini’s compression service and stick it inside Chrome, which can only be a good thing for people on slow wireless networks.
LG has just announced that they’ve shipped over 10 million phones that have 4G LTE support. That means they’ve been shipping less than 750,000 units/month. Is that good or bad?
That brand new 8 inch Samsung Galaxy Note, apparently the South Korean device maker wants to sell a million of them every month. Is that reasonable? We think so!
Google’s CFO just dropped a bombshell. He said that the next few phones from Motorola are going to be drop dead boring and unimpressive. Hell of a quote!
The head of Android engineering at Google just reiterated the company’s stance that Motorola being treated the same as every other Android partner. Is that true though?
Aptina has just announced two new camera sensors, with one being a 12 MP part, while the other does 13 MP. What’s cool is that both can capture 4K video at 30 FPS.
An as yet to be announced phone from LG just got leaked. It’s called the Optimus LTE III, and it looks a lot like a Galaxy S II. It even has the same flip cover as the GS3.>Some">

Key Clash Lucio v Zlatan Ibrahimovic
This promises to be an engrossing battle of wits between the connoisseur's centre-half, Lucio, and Ibrahimovic, whom many English critics have accused of having style over substance. Lucio is a counter-attacking Brazilian who is more than willing to venture forward, while Ibrahimovic matches elegance with an imposing physical threat.
Touchline duel José Mourinho v Josep Guardiola
What could be better, the clash of philosophies between the pragmatic Mourinho and the cavalier Guardiola? 'Pep' to his players, Guardiola managed to outwit Sir Alex Ferguson in last season's Champions League final in Rome and is seeking to spring the same trick on Mourinho. The Portuguese has it all to prove after Inter were eliminated in the second round last time around while Guardiola continues to ride a wave of Catalan acclaim after collecting a quadruple of trophies in his first year in charge.
Talking tactics
Mourinho faces the dilemma of having to contain a three-man attack, an uncommon phenomenon in Italy. He must not leave centre-back Walter Samuel exposed to the destructive pace of wingers Lionel Messi and Thierry Henry, and could have to sacrifice a man in midfield - which begs the question of why he intends to field Javier Zanetti in the centre. Barcelona will adhere to the tried and tested template, Xavi and Andres Iniesta supporting a peerless attacking trident.
Team details
Inter Milan (probable, 4-4-2): Júlio César; Maicon, Lúcio, Samuel, Chivu; Stankovic, Zanetti, Snejider, Motta; Eto'o, Milito.
Barcelona (probable, 4-1-2-3): Valdés; Alves, Puyol, Piqué, Abidal; Touré; Iniesta, Xavi; Messi, Ibrahimovic, Henry.

I was worried when “Year’s End” began with Oliver Queen (Stephen Amell) spending most of the first quarter of the episode asking his family members why they stopped celebrating Christmas after he and his father were lost at sea and presumed dead. I was worried because A) the answer was bleeding obvious, (family gatherings were suddenly kind of a bummer), and B) I was afraid we were going to get a syrupy “True Meaning of Christmas” themed episode that ended with a Hallmark-card moment of the Queen family standing around a 10-foot blue spruce and toasting with eggnog. In fact, however, “Year’s End” turned out to be ARROW’s most action-packed episode yet, and it leaves the series in a nicely dark place as it heads into its midseason break.
The action this week comes in the form of mysterious new vigilante who wears a darker version of the hooded costume Oliver wears, and is apparently just as much of an archery enthusiast. This vigilante executes several of the criminals from “The List,” who Oliver had already paid a visit to. While Oliver’s tactic is to intimidate list-dwellers into turning themselves in to the police, or giving back their stolen money, the new archer simply kills them with an arrow to the chest. Thanks to the investigative prowess of Detective Quentin Lance (Paul Blackthorne), the police are quickly made aware that this second archer is a copycat, but the Police Commissioner (Robert Moloney) doesn’t seem to care, and wants Det. Lance to arrest whichever vigilante is most convenient. Lance doesn’t care for this, lets the Commissioner know it, and is promptly tossed off the case. It’s lucky for Oliver that he chooses this time, while incognito as the hooded vigilante, to reach out to Det. Lance for help in locating the new archer. A suddenly frustrated Det. Lance is now in the mood to offer up some evidence to help Oliver find the bad guy.
After that, ARROW keeps the action coming at a fast and furious pace this week. Aside from the two executions of criminals, there’s a much-needed scene where Oliver follows the trail of evidence to the new archer vigilante, only to find his destination contains a booby trap and there’s a bomb set to blow up the building. The extra money that went into ARROW’s explosion budget this week was well spent, because the scene is tense and looks pretty cool, with Oliver using an explosive arrow to free himself and jump to safety, only one brief step ahead of the fireball.
Also we get another round of flashbacks to the island where Oliver had been held prisoner, which brings more action, and also more information about the island and its purpose, (although, in a nice touch, by the climax of “Year’s End” it’s not clear that the information we were given is actually true). Edward Fyres, (Sebastian Dunn), and his scary goon Deathstroke, (Jeffrey C. Robinson) return to torment castaway Oliver, (still recovering from torture at their hands earlier), and they capture Oliver’s enigmatic benefactor Yao Fei, (Byron Mann).
I was concerned that ARROW was going to bring these characters ahead in the timeline by placing them in present day Starling City to torment Oliver again, but that doesn’t happen in “Year’s End”, and I think it’s a wise choice. It’s good for Oliver to have a real antagonist (Fyres) in the Island timeline as well as a different one (in the form of this new archer vigilante), in the present day, and give the audience more time to speculate what, if any, connection exists between the two. I was pleased with the arrival of the new archer vigilante, and the reveal that he is, in fact, Malcolm Merlyn (John Barrowman), who also spends his time antagonizing Oliver’s mom, Moira Queen (Susanna Thompson) when he’s dressed in civvies. Malcolm Merlyn, and his newly established archery skills, gives ARROW a strong, recurring villain, which this series has badly needed since the beginning. I also like that Malcolm has the same exact skill-set and outfit as both Yao Fei and Oliver, and seems to know all about what the island was and why Oliver wound up there, which suggests that there’s a deeper explanation for why this “Robin Hood” leitmotif is so prevalent in the world of the show.
Some other things I really liked about “Year’s End”:
- The way the show’s writers used a dinner party scene to tease the possibility of identifying Oliver’s vigilante alter ego as something other than “The Hood Guy,” (which, among other things, would make this show so much easier to write about). One character suggests identifying the vigilante as “The Green Arrow” and Oliver (!) is the one who shoots it down as “Lame.”
- At the Queen family Christmas party, Oliver, Laurel (Katie Cassidy), and Tommy (Colin Donnell), discuss whether it’s weird for Oliver to see his ex-girlfriend and best friend as a couple. The goofy, nervous laughter after Oliver says, “It’s not weird at all” was a really nice tension-breaking moment for the show. “Year’s end” didn’t linger too much on this love triangle compared to last week’s episode, but what little it did show us was effective.
- Susanna Thompson’s standout performance as Moira Queen, a character who’s probably the most complicated of any on the show.
- The perfect visual combination of modern and gloomy ambience that the city of Vancouver brings to “Starling City.”
I was a little less pleased about the way ARROW hasn’t quite sold me on Oliver’s skills behind the keyboard. For a guy who was trapped on an island without modern conveniences for five-years, (a lifetime when we’re talking about keeping up with the advancement of technology these days), we’ve seen him set up a high-tech computer system for himself in his secret lair, and in previous episodes he knew how to use it expertly to find out essentially anything he wanted to bolster his vigilante career. “Year’s End” finds him, out of costume, taking a black arrow that’s been illegally removed from a police evidence locker to Felicity Smoak (Emily Bett Rickards), in order to have her get on her computer and find out where it was manufactured. Obviously ARROW wants us to spend more time with Felicity Smoak, (not unreasonably, since she’s charming and brings some decent comic relief to the proceedings), but I’ll buy Walter Steele (Colin Salmon), using her as his personal private detective, not Oliver, who supposedly can do this stuff himself.
“Year’s End” concludes with Malcolm Merlyn kidnapping Walter and taking him to parts unknown, while promising to Moira that he’ll be returned unharmed at a later date, (which seems wildly unlikely, given what we now know about Malcolm Merlyn). We also learn that Moira was complicit (although reluctantly) in Oliver’s original abduction and torture, and that something similar might be in store for Walter. And we get a scene in the hospital between Oliver, (recovering from injuries sustained fighting the new archer vigilante), and his sister Thea. (Willa Holland), which comes about as close as possible to my much-feared Hallmark card ending, where the two siblings resolve to stop reliving the pain of the past and just accept each other for who they are now. That isn’t the true meaning of Christmas as far as I know, but it’s a nice sentiment for a show about people paying emotionally for the sins of their parents, and as a fitting end note to a strong first half of ARROW’s debut season, I certainly won’t argue with it.

Why? Is the TV viewer 30 times more profitable for the advertiser? Is advertising to the TV viewer so much more impactful? No, the economic value difference can’t be explained by the different potential impact for advertisers but by the simple economic balance between demand and supply. There is a much tighter relationship between demand for TV spots and supply than with the demand and supply for Online advertising. Why? Because marketers still haven’t figured out the true value of viewers in both these channels, so the majority sticks with what they are used to. And this is TV. And it might get them some tickets from NBC or the media companies to some of the more interesting Olympic events. But to be fair we can't forget that there is objectively a much higher supply for Online space than for TV spots. Both these factors drive the tremendous value difference, not any ROI driven intelligence.Hello again, I’m wondering where I can find some good tutorials on how to make high quality web designs for websites, products for themeforest. Any tutorials or books that would teach me how to create web designs at standards that themeforest would accept and even designs that would sell good on the themeforest marketplace. I’m prepared to go all in edu-mode(to learn what ever i can get my hands on) on this, but I’m not sure where to start.
Just to be clear, I do have some design background, and even a product on themeforest right now. But let’s face it, there’s still a long way to go. So I am asking the great community here, authors that design and code their products here, for some feedback: where did you learn your skills? any book that you might want to recommend? any tutorial website? or .. what ever you can share, would be much appreciated.
Thanks!
Ciprian
Not sure if you knew about this but this website has helped lots of people a lot you might want to check it out.
There’s no such book that will help you increase your “designing” skills in my opinion. Although they help you understand the principles and history, for all design related books i’ve read it’s always just that. What works best is to keep practicing.
svdnl said
Thanks, And I agree with practice, practice, practice. But still, there are books out there that give a very big hint on what to do when designing, what the new standards are and tips and tricks for photoshop, how to do certain stuff and what goes in a high quality design world. There’s even a collage for design and web design courses, etc. You get the ideea. I’m looking for some books you might be able to point out, useful books like the 3 smashing books or websites like tuts+ web design.
Thanks,
Ciprian
Hi Ciprian,
Here is what I recomand.
First I think tutorials available over the WEB are covering just the tehnical part of the design. Will learn you only how to create the design, but not to make it high quality.
So for this first part you will need to practice and practice untill you learn all the tehnical tips and trics of the design software you will use.
Then from my point of view the high quality comes from the details. And that is what you need to study. And the details can only be learned by analizing other designs (not only websites designs, also out world designs , nature, photos, arhitecture, interior design..etc ) and study the small details that make things perfect (shadows, colors, sizes, arangements, spaces, textures, and the way they combine togheter).
For example the WEB part, analizing great websites designs, or illustrations from the web galleries or showcases like dribbble and others, you can get a lot of details from them. See how the simplest websites design can create a huge impact because of the small hidden details they have, like fonts, colors, spacing, borders and photos puted in the right places to impress visually.
Also I think that you must find your own style, your own vision about design, not try to create things that allready exists, try to take only the best details of the things you see, and put it together in an original way. This will define your style.
Hope this helps.
It’s just some personal thinking, and some things I am doing now.Top Definition

Regardless of their goals—losing weight, staying competitive or simply staying active—runners of all stripes will want to spend time with sports medicine specialist and avid runner Vad’s (Back Rx) engaging and highly informative new book. Centered around five concepts (there’s no one way to run, incorporate strength training, train for endurance, monitor your diet, rest), Vad offers a mix of practical advice and research to prove his points. Beginning with the biomechanics of running, Vad helps readers determine their running style, select the best shoes for the task, and correct their form. Should things go awry, he offers suggestions for dealing with common injuries, such as shin splints and Runner’s Knee. Simple, effective exercises focusing on specific muscle groups that don’t require a gym membership, as well as pre- and post-run stretches help readers get into optimum shape before hitting the road by incorporating Pilates and yoga. Vad’s 10-day training approach to marathons incorporates his concepts for casual runners as well as those focused on bucket list events, such as the Boston Marathon, with a day-by-day schedule to help ensure they’re able to rise to the challenge. Vad’s mix of common sense and science adds up to a healthy, thoughtful approach to one of America’s most popular fitness activities. (Apr.)

Forum RulesTwo.
Conodonts are widely regarded as some of the most successful vertebrates that ever lived, evolving some 500 million years ago and thriving for close to 300 million years before being wiped from existence by the Triassic-Jurassic extinction event.
Their teeth, while small, were undeniably unique. For one thing, the were incredibly sharp; the fossilized teeth pictured up top belonged to a conodont species named Wurmiella excavata, and are the sharpest teeth ever discovered. The tips measure just 2 micrometers across. (The word "conodont" is derived from the Greek konos, for "cone," and odous/odont, for "tooth.")
But sharp is not always a good thing. As paleobiologist Philip Donoghue and his research team explain in the latest issue of Proceedings of The Royal Society B, "high sharpness renders the elements demonstrably vulnerable to wear and breakage." How, then, did conodonts like W. excavata go about eating, without smashing their razor sharp chompers to bits?
To find out, Donoghue and his team created computer models of W. excavata's teeth to understand how they might have functioned without being crushed like chalk. And it turns out these "chompers" didn't do much chomping, at all.
Nature News gives us a tidy summary of the team's findings:.
The team's findings hint at how such sharp (albeit delicate) teeth could have evolved in the first place. Without the jaw muscles to make an action like chewing possible, conodonts had to evolve structures sharp enough to translate even the tiniest of motions into powerful, food-shredding force. In doing so, however, W. excavata evolved teeth that would be completely impractical in the mouth of a bigger creature, or one with more muscular jaws.
How, then, did future vertebrates come to develop the teeth that we're all familiar with today? Did different dental structures emerge independently as the need for pre-digestive food-processing became necessary for survival (a common hypothesis), or did they somehow manage to evolve from the razor-sharp serrations of creatures like conodonts? It's exciting to imagine how modeling techniques like the ones used by Donoghue's team will improve our understanding of vertebrate dental evolution in the years to come.

Kitchen Rebels
I'm pretty sure that I'm rebellious by nature. Conflict doesn't bother me. Cooking can be an area that seems to be all about rules and the "best" way to do things. Sure there are hard and fast rules when it comes cooking, but not as many as some would suppose. I'm constantly being told on shows or books that the "right" way to crack an egg is on a flat surface. I REFUSE!!! Whenever I have cracked an egg on a flat surface, it gets egg on the counter... Is it really so hard to crack it on the side of the bowl it's going in (which will have to be washed anyway)? I don't know when the last time was that I pushed a shard of shell into the egg that I had to take out of the bowl. So I say "Go and boil your bottoms, you sons of silly persons!"
Is anybody with me? What rules do you flaunt? Or are one of the people who feels that rules were made to be followed?:
1. The first bite

I gazed over the Yorkshire moors. They were beautiful with their swaying purple heather and the wild ponies that galloped across it. This was where I belonged. I was never going to leave it. I loved my home. The deep blue sky was dotted with stars. I smiled and turned back to my house. The stone cottage reflected the twilight sky. I entered the house and went into the kitchen where my mother was cooking.
"We have rabbit stew for tea," Mother said. I smiled and headed upstairs to my bedroom.
We had just finished our supper and we heard a loud howling noise. It sounded like an animal in pain.
"Holly, I want you to go and make sure none of the sheep have been harmed" we didn't have many sheep but the sheep we did have lived on the moors with the wild ponies. In the summer, I often looked after the village sheep and goats. I had taught myself to ride horses and I could ride any wild pony. I left the house and headed over the field. I saw my school. I enjoyed school. We did reading, writing and arithmetic. I was good at all of them. Our school only had two classrooms, one for older students and one for the younger. Our class had a map of the empire and a picture of her majesty, Queen Victoria. Mother and father thought that she was an excellent queen. The empire was immense.
I scanned the moors. I couldn't see anything. Then I noticed a huddled mass. I headed over. It was a sheep. There was blood all over its wool and it was kicking in pain. It let out one final strangled bleat and died. Its glazed eyes bored into mine. I wasn't listening. The moor was so quiet anyone would be heard. I searched around for this deadly creature. Then it sprang. It had burning eyes and it pulled back its muzzle to reveal razor long fangs that glistened with saliva. Its breath stank of blood and decay. Its fur was black and coarse. I felt its claws on me. I closed my eyes. I was going to die. All my life left to live and this was how it was going to end. I was fifteen and there was so much that I wanted to do. I closed my eyes and waited for the pain. It came and I blacked out.
I opened my eyes. Concerned faces surrounded me, including my mother and father. I felt dried blood on my head. I staggered to my feet. My dress was covered in blood but I was practically unharmed. Except for three long claw marks down my left arm.
"What happened Holly?"
"It was a huge beast. A wolf I think. It killed a sheep and then it attacked me," I said, breathlessly, reliving the attack.
"Come on Holly. We're taking you home. It's not safe around here" I nodded. My mother led me away while my father stayed with the other men. I didn't tell anyone about the jagged bite mark on my wrist. I didn't want to remember. Besides, with an animal attack like that it was hardly surprising to have a few scars.

The Avenel, N.J., holding company is the parent of Northfield Bank, which has 12 branches on Staten Island, plus locations in Brooklyn and New Jersey.
The latest results by Northfield Bancorp for basic and diluted earnings per common share compared to $0.09 for the final quarter of 2010 and $0.33 for that entire year.
Net income in 2011 totaled $16.8 million.
John W. Alexander, chairman and chief executive officer of Northfield, said: "We are pleased to report that in 2011 Northfield earned the highest net income in the company's 124 year history and reported our highest annual earnings per share as a public company.
"We again experienced strong loan growth which allowed us to manage our net interest margin in a low-rate environment by continuing to shift our asset mix from lower yielding investments to loans."Dominican University nuns helped educate and keep the peace on the West Side in the 1960s
Sustained by their faith
Sister Jeanne Crapo stands about 4-feet-11. It's hard to think of someone physically assaulting a nun, especially one the size of Crapo. But that's what occurred in March 1965 when she and several other nuns hosted a civil rights march from Dominican University in River Forest to downtown Oak Park. About 500 people, including students and faculty, marched in solidarity with civil rights workers in the South. The Oak Park procession coincided with the Montgomery to Selma, Ala., march for voting rights on March 7, 1965, a day that would become known as "Bloody Sunday."
The Selma march crossed Edmund Pettus Bridge, where marchers were met by state and area police, who used tear gas and billy clubs on the group, which totaled approximately 600, many of whom were hospitalized after the attack.
The Oak Park procession did not experience that level of violence, but Crapo, who grew up in Montana, vividly remembers what happened to her. They started at Dominican (then Rosary College) and headed east on Division Street to Harlem Avenue. The procession moved south to Lake Street and then on toward the post office at Kenilworth. The sisters marched and prayed in silence, and another prayer took place in front of the post office. When a woman approached Sr. Jeanne, she expected her to ask a question. Crapo and the other nuns were dressed in full habit, unmistakably recognizable.
"She gave me a very sharp shove in the street," she recalled. "I think God held me up. I did not fall down. I was a little shaken, to say the least. It gave me a sense of that kind of violence that was terrible."
Crapo came to Dominican in 1961, as did Sister Mary O'Donnell, who had recently graduated from a college in Montana.
O'Donnell, who taught physics, and other nuns from the university took part in civil rights demonstrations in Chicago during the 1960s. In the summer of 1966, several nuns were asked by West Side leaders to help quell racial tensions sparked by the Chicago Freedom Movement. Some of the nuns had been teaching Sunday morning bible school on the West Side since the early 1960s. When tensions exploded in 1966, Dominican's nuns, who were familiar with the community, were called to the West Side by some of the Sunday school parents to help restore order.
O'Donnell recalled going to the West Side and seeing truckloads of Army soldiers - like something out of World War II.
"We went down to Roosevelt Road and here were all these military soldiers in helmets with bayonets and I'm thinking, 'My Lord, where am I?'"
A native of Boston, O'Donnell also worked with others nuns and faculty members to organize social outreach programs for black children, including those living on the West Side of Chicago. Beginning in 1967, they organized a program to bring children from the city to the college for the summer. They were able to secure four buses from Catholic Charities for transportation.
O'Donnell credits another sister, Margaret Niemeyer, for the idea of using the campus for the children and letting them use the swimming pool. O'Donnell recalled that many, if not all, of the kids had never before left their neighborhood or ventured out of the city. They weren't allowed to swim at many of the city's park facilities because of segregation.
But now that they had a place for the children to play, they needed staff, O'Donnell recalled. Many of the nuns, who were also teachers at the college, along with some of the secular faculty, volunteered to help with the program, which lasted four years. The modest program attracted support from other areas of Dominican and surrounding community.
O'Donnell recalled the children asking at the end of each summer if she and the others would come back. There wasn't any question whether they would, she said. O'Donnell and the other faculty had to teach classes in the fall, so they ended up setting up a storefront at 18th Street and Wabash to host programs for children and the community. O'Donnell credits many with helping to launch and maintain the program.
"It was the people in the area," she said. "You can't just look at one or two names, there were hundreds."
O'Donnell and Sister Margaret Niemeyer ran the program for its four-year duration.
"It wasn't easy. I gave up my summers to stay around and work, but it was something I just couldn't let go," O'Donnell said. "But never have I regretted it. It was one of the most enriching experiences of my life."
O'Donnell was a student at Dominican before returning as a faculty member. So was Sister Clemente Davlin, who grew up on Chicago's South Side. Though she's been at Dominican for more than 30 years, hers is one of the shortest tenures.
After finishing college, Davlin returned in 1970 to Dominican, which at that time had started a program to aggressively enroll black and Hispanic students. But growing up in Chicago, Sr. Clemente was aware of segregation going on in the city. She taught at predominantly black DuSable High School on the South Side for a year in the mid-1950s.
"That had a big effect on my life because I love kids, and we had a wonderful principal who valued them. She went out and got new furniture for some of the rooms. And I remember some of the students going to her and asking, 'Are you going to send that back to the store?' And she said, 'No, that's for you.'"
The sisters all spoke of being raised by open-minded parents. Sr. Jeanne, who grew up in Montana, recalled as early as the second grade, hearing negative comments about blacks. She remembers telling her father what she heard. Her father also made an effort to have her family visit the few black families in their neighborhood, so she could see that what people were saying in her class was not true.
"He just stood up, and you could see the fire in his eyes, and said, 'I will not have that kind of language in my house. No more of that talk. My parents both grew up in Chicago, and I never heard a word against anyone."

My trip to Florida next week.
Sleeping with the AC on super freezing but being cozy under blankets. Nothin’ better.
**********
What are you thankful for today?
I’m not sure I’m quite over that you are thankful for the smell of cigarettes 😉
x10 that last one – sleeping under blankets with AC – but also, the first time it finally gets cool enough to sleep with the windows open!
haha yeah – it’s probably not the healthiest things to like :/ but I’ve never smoked a cigarette in my life sooo there’s that! haha
I don’t know that I’ve ever known anyone who LIKES the smell of cigarettes -that doesn’t smoke, besides myself! So that was fun for me to read. Some of them just smell nice.
“Instagram Filters” haha I feel the same way 😛
I actually totally understand liking the smell of cigarettes! I think it is a gross habit and something I’ve never done and will never do, but something about the smell (not too close though lol)…I just kind of like it. Glad I’m not the only strange one in that area
I used to hate the smell of cigarettes, but I kind of got used to it after hanging around my school’s theater long enough.
Train gods!! Love when they’re on my side. No better feeling than a perfectly timed cross over to the express or local!! well maybe if there was an open seat when you got there!
Love your blog! XO
Great List! I love that saying too, I definitely need to focus more on my blessings! I’m thankful for so much! Have a great Thursday!
I’m thankful for sunsets on the beach, cuddling, days that go faster than I plan and green juice! Thanks for sharing! xo
I’m definitely thankful for Fall! I’m much more an Autumn/Winter girl.
Have a great time in Florida! xoxo
I did a post almost identical to this on Monday and reading through yours put the biggest smile on my face. It’s amazing when we start to really think about everything we have to be thankful for. We’re all so, so blessed. <3
Here’s my thankful list for the day!
Most important is my grandma, who died 2 years ago. I miss her very much, and am thankful for the years I had her in my life.
thankful for a trip to the {florida} beach the next 4 days- miss my Long Island beach days!
Right now, I am thankful that we can fight with God, and He allows us to. It’s just amazing to me that God would allow us to “throw punches,” stay by our side and still love us through our “kicking and fist shaking.” (And, He’s good, so we can be reassured that our loss, His victory, is really what we want anyway.)
I’m thankful for…
my husband
my family
my friends
the bible study we host
that God’s will and God’s plan is much bigger than my feelings or emotions

athisfeetdaily.blogspot.comAre you a sucker for a soprano? Do you go bananas for a good baritone? Do you consider yourself an appreciator of a nice aria?
If opera is your thing then our first site today should be sweet music to your eyes.
Operabase.com is a database of all the operatic information you could hope for. On the opening page select your language - a nice touch for those not wanting to surf in English - and it is currently being translated into 20 languages!
As a database tool this website boasts the ability to search the details of over 35,000 opera performances since August 2005.
Search by either performance, artiste or company using the links in the left hand panel, then fill in the search criteria accordingly.
A nice touch when searching for names is the "sounds like" option, since you may have just heard the name mentioned on the radio and not caught it properly.
Next up is a suggestion that was sent in by Faydra Fisher - and knowing she uses this site, I am hoping for an invitation to dinner!
Allrecipes.com is actually a site we looked at about a year ago, but it is well worth another mention as it is one of those continually evolving websites that is worth bookmarking and returning to again and again.
With featured recipes and seasonal dishes displayed on the opening page, the design of this website is really welcoming, and very easy to navigate. You can search for a particular dish using the search box at the top, or browse through the collections using the "Popular" menu on the left.
All recipes are clearly explained with a picture to illustrate what the end product should look like before you tuck in.
One feature I really like is that you can choose to search by ingredient, either to be included, or not included. Just click ingredient search by the search box and then list the things you have in the cupboard, or do not like and do not want to use.
Next up, a great site I found for those of you looking for an alternative side to London.
Whether you are visiting, living in London, or just want to learn some of the quirky secrets of the city, Londonlostandfound.com is the place to go.
The idea of this website is to uncover the alternative side of London.
The pages list all sorts of hidden treasures such as free stuff to do, hidden museums, little known galleries and art instillations, and much more. The sections are listed across the top, making navigation a breeze.
From arts to unusual there is something for everyone, with links to buy tickets where appropriate.
Just have a browse and see what you unearth, a little like walking through the city itself.
My favourite section is under Unusual. Scroll down to unusual ideas and then click the link Lost in London - 50 secrets.
Here you can read about the Area 10 community art project or an Edwardian bookshop in Marylebone.

And finally, with the new Windows platform right around the corner you are going to need a place to go for support. Rather handily Beverly from Xpforum.info got in touch about a site that she helps run that should do the job nicely.
This site provides a free and friendly place to get advice about all those niggly little questions that need answering, and some of the bigger issues that have you simply pulling out your hair with frustration.
There is a comprehensive technical library and extensive FAQs about Windows XP - and there is even support offered for Microsoft's new Vista platform. It should be good advice too, since Beverly tells me that the Xpforum people have been part of the beta testing team for the platform.
Use the navigation panel on the left to jump to the various sections. It is a standard forum layout so finding your way round should be quite familiar. You will need to register if you want to post your own questions or offer advice to others.

Thank you very much!
I have a file that has names listed in it. I need to figure out how to read each name and have it printed out on the screen.
I know how to read columns of numbers one by one, but when I try to do a name it doesn't grab the whole thing. I searched the board and found a few tips, but it still takes each letter and pulls it and puts it on the screen in its own line. How can I make it grab the whole word, print it, and then go to the next?
I think I'm missing something simple.
If a single name contains no whitespace then the >> operator of the input stream will do what you want. If a name contains whitespace (first and last name for example), then you must use getline to read an entire line and then extract multiple names manually. It's difficult to determine what would work adequately if I don't know what the file looks like, can you post a relevant piece of the file?

So it is pretty much just a list... or it can be any list for that matter.
In this case, you can easily read the names:
This assumes that you have an open file called infile.This assumes that you have an open file called infile.Code:
#include <string>

}
}
-Prelude
Just to point out:
string::c_str() also returns const char*
>string::c_str() also returns const char*
What does that have to do with an ostrstream? The std::string class doesn't even come into the picture since ostrstream works with char pointers. ostringstream withs with std::strings.

Sorry for the mistake chris ;P
What compile errors are you having? How bout some code yo.
>I'm still having some mean problems with that getline command.
Make sure that you include <string>, that is where the std::string class as well as the getline function are declared. They are both in the std namespace as well. Post your code and the errors you are getting and we can help more.
-Prelude
Very beside any point, but funny fact, Prelude.. I accidentally clicked on your profile and discovered your birthday is 6 days before mine.. Perhaps a completely inane fact, but interesting (to me) nonetheless.
Here's the code. I'm still learning so I'm sure this isn't pretty. I been adding and subtracting parts, the part with Preludes code is mangled, i've been playing with it so ti's def not correct now.
I'm trying to take a file, open it read off a word, then add it into the string and execute it in dos. then go back and take the next word in the file and put it into the string and execute it in dos. I know there are progs that already do this, but I want to learn how they work.
I can make it work with a file with one word in it. It will take the file and insert it and execute, but I don't know how to read from a list.

September
Todd Helton’s final appearance at Coors Field began ominously. The visiting Red Sox posted a three-spot in the top of the first, threatening to blow the Rockies away. Eventually, they would—but not before the 40-year-old first baseman had his say.
Batting fifth in the order, Helton came up with the bases empty and one down in the bottom of the second. He dug in against Jake Peavy, a longtime rival during the right-hander’s days with the Padres, and one of Helton’s favorite pitchers to face. Helton was 16-for-46 (.348/.392/.674) versus Peavy with six doubles, three home runs, and only five strikeouts. The 1.066 head-to-head OPS was Helton’s best among all pitchers that he’d seen at least 50 times. And, as Helton prepared to say good-bye, he improved it.
On the third pitch of his first at-bat, Helton clubbed a big fly into the right-field stands, drawing the Rockies to within two. His next trip to the box came an inning later, this time with the bases loaded and one out. Helton drove in his second run of the night with a sacrifice fly, which preceded a ground-rule double by Nolan Arenado that knotted the score at 4-4.
By the time Helton stepped to the plate again, the Red Sox had surged ahead with three runs each in the fourth and fifth. But the man of the hour was undeterred. He drove a double to the opposite field, sending Michael Cuddyer, who started the home half of the fifth with a walk, all the way around for his third RBI of the night.
Unfortunately, that was all the scoring the Rockies would do. The Red Sox tacked on five more runs in the top of the eighth, four of them on a Will Middlebrooks grand slam, to take a 15-5 lead. Moments earlier, Helton entered the Coors Field batter’s box for the last time.
The last pitcher Helton faced in Denver was a former teammate, Franklin Morales, with whom the first baseman embarked on the run to the pennant in 2007. Then a 21-year-old rookie, Morales helped the Rockies to victory in six of his eight regular-season starts. Helton chipped in at least one extra-base hit all five times Morales took the hill that September. But last night, when they reunited as foes, Morales blew him away.
Thus, Helton’s Coors Field career ended with a strikeout, followed by a standing ovation as his daughters took away first base before the top of the ninth. He’ll leave behind a .345 average and 227 career home runs in Coors Field. And he’ll take with him a horse on which to ride into the sunset.
Quick Hits from Wednesday
Here’s a trivia question for you to chew on: Who was the first player to nab Rickey Henderson on a steal attempt? To head off any confusion, the answer is a catcher, not pitcher Paul Splittorff, who was the first player to catch Henderson stealing. Splittorff fooled Henderson with a pickoff throw that was relayed to second base in time to record the out.
If you don’t know the answer to that question (which you’ll find at the end of this section), it’s a little extra incentive to file this one away, in case Billy Hamilton follows in the Hall of Famer’s footsteps.
Hamilton began his big-league career 13-for-13 on steal tries, which surprised virtually no one considering the prowess he displayed on the basepaths during his trek through the Reds farm system. The center fielder made his third start in The Show on Wednesday afternoon with the Mets in town and Daisuke Matsuzaka toeing the rubber.
With a methodical approach and a relatively slow delivery from the stretch, Matsuzaka has struggled to control the running game throughout his time in the States. Coming into this outing, 85 of the 104 players who had attempted to steal with Matsuzaka on the mound made it. Earlier in this game, Jay Bruce, who singled in the second and walked in the fourth, swiped second both times he reached first.
Bruce began the day with five steals in eight attempts on the year and 34-for-60 in his career. He’s no speedster, but he took off one pitch after he saw Matsuzaka’s mechanics from the stretch for the first time. On that one, Matsuzaka gave his catcher no chance by missing two feet outside with a curveball. The second time Bruce ran, he missed well inside with a fastball. Slow mechanics are one thing; for Matsuzaka, hitting the target is half the battle.
At any rate, Hamilton reached on an infield single with two away in the bottom of the fifth. (The ball actually beat him to the bag on the play, but first-base umpire Brian Gorman decided to make things interesting.) The rookie didn’t wait long, bolting for second on the first pitch to Shin-Soo Choo. Fellow first-year big leaguer Juan Centeno wasn’t having it, which brought us this bit of analysis from Reds manager Dusty Baker:
“That’s why it’s called ‘stealing,’ sometimes you get caught stealing.”
The 23-year-old Centeno, a defensive wizard with a .661 minor-league OPS, gunned down 56 percent (34 of 61) of would-be base stealers in Double-A and Triple-A before earning his promotion. He never crossed paths with Hamilton in the minors, because the Reds’ and Mets’ upper-minors affiliates don’t share leagues. But now, they’ll forever be bound: Hamilton’s first big-league CS on the basepaths is also Centeno’s first from the squat.
If Hamilton sticks around long enough to one day surmount Henderson’s total of 1,406, Centeno will usurp the historical footnote presently owned by six-time Gold Glover Jim Sundberg, who nailed Henderson on July 1, 1979.
Perhaps the only thing more surprising than Hamilton being caught with Matsuzaka on the bump is that the right-hander worked around both of the steals he permitted to log 7 2/3 scoreless innings in a perilous ballpark. With that effort, Matsuzaka outdueled Reds ace Mat Latos in a 1-0 decision that could prove pivotal to the Reds’ bid for home-field advantage in the wild card playoff game. The Pirates also lost, 4-2 to the Cubs, but the Reds squandered an opportunity to gain ground and remain a game back with only three—all head-to-head showdowns with the Bucs—left to be played.
***
Speaking of relishing the spoiler role—Kyle Lohse did on Wednesday, too. The first-year Brewers notched his first shutout in a Milwaukee uniform by two-hitting the Braves. Best of all, Lohse needed only 89 pitches to do it.
Carlos Gomez’s first-inning long ball was all the help Lohse would need, and the swift, two-hour-and-31-minute contest might’ve been over even more quick were it not for the scuffle that ensued. Freddie Freeman and Brian McCann took umbrage with Gomez for hot-dogging the blast, and McCann blocked the outfielder’s path to the plate. That cleared the benches and resulted in Gomez and Freeman getting the boot from home-plate umpire Paul Nauert.
With one of the Braves’ best bats done for the day, Lohse sliced through the rest of the lineup with only a couple of harmless hiccups. Andrelton Simmons’ bunt single leading off the first and Evan Gattis’ knock in the home half of the seventh were the only baserunners he allowed. Lohse struck out five along the way.
Not only was this Lohse’s first gem of the year, it was also only his second complete game since April 21, 2011, when he two-hit the Nationals. The 34-year-old has now gone the whole nine innings in two of his last three starts, giving the Brewers some late-season return on their three-year, $33 million pre-season investment.
BREAKING: The A’s have lost two straight games.
Seriously, though, that’s big news these days. When Oakland last dropped back-to-back contests, Bob Melvin’s team was 3 ½ games behind the Rangers, Coco Crisp had only 12 home runs, and Kurt Suzuki’s return from the nation’s capital was a day away.
More precisely, it was August 23, and the Orioles had just downed the Athletics 9-7 at Camden Yards. Since then, Suzuki has rescued his first big-league organization from a precarious lack of depth behind the dish, Crisp has swatted 10 more long balls, and the A’s have turned the Rangers, division favorites just five weeks ago, into wild-card hopefuls on the outside looking in.
Jered Weaver, always a tough customer at Angel Stadium, ground Melvin’s offense to a halt yesterday afternoon, permitting just five hits, all singles, in seven innings of one-run work. Weaver, who skipped his previous start with forearm tightness, fanned only two, but he also issued just one walk, threw first-pitch strikes to 20 of the 27 hitters he faced, and kept the visitors off the board until the top of the sixth. Fourteen of the 21 outs he recorded came on fly balls tracked down by a Mike Trout-less outfield that featured J.B. Shuck, Collin Cowgill, and Kole Calhoun from left to right.
The Angels got on the board first in the last of the fourth on an RBI fielder’s choice by designated hitter Josh Hamilton. But the winning tallies came two innings later, the fruits of a small-ball attack helped along by a fielding miscue from the league’s most efficient defensive team. Dan Straily issued a leadoff walk to Chris Iannetta, after which Andrew Romine put down a sacrifice bunt. The A’s failed to grab the out the Angels were offering them, as first baseman Daric Barton mishandled the throw. Then, with two runners available to be moved up, Scioscia gladly offered the A’s another out. This time, Oakland successfully took it, but after Iannetta was erased at the plate on a fielder’s choice, Erick Aybar singled home Romine and an infield hit by Hamilton plated Shuck.
That was all the support Weaver, Dane De La Rosa, and Ernesto Frieri needed to clinch the series for the home team, which won Tuesday’s middle match behind a four-hit shutout from Jason Vargas. The wins were meaningless for the Angels, who were long ago eliminated from post-season contention, but their efforts could make the Athletics’ task more challenging next month.
Among American League squads, only the Red Sox, 53-28 at Fenway Park this season, boast more home victories than the 52-29 A’s, whose skipper emphasized the benefit of playing in friendly confines to CBS Sports’ Scott Miller. Oakland is now two games behind Boston in its quest to secure home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.
Defensive Non-Play of the Day
You’re not supposed to be able to record an out by tagging a player with an empty hand. But hey, if they let you do it, you might as well do it:
Thanks to Bill Baer (@crashburnalley) for the GIF.
And, while we’re on the subject of non-plays, here’s a rarity: a three-base error by an infielder. The only saving grace for Starlin Castro is that the beneficiary, Pedro Alvarez, would not score.
What to Watch for on Thursday
It’s the last non-15-game slate of the regular season...

The scoring is wrong on the Castro play; the runner slowed almost to a stop a second but continued to third when the outfield lollygagged it in collecting and then returning the ball to the infield. Two errors on the play.

DVD Review: The Young Victoria (2009)
In director Jean-Marc Vallee's painterly portrait of a royal as a young woman, Emily Blunt gives an Oscar worthy performance in her embodiment of Queen Victoria from the ages of late teen to early twenties.
A far cry from the dour images of a queen in mourning with which we are usually presented, it's important to note that this work is titled The Young Victoria since as producers Martin Scorsese, Graham King and Sarah Ferguson express, it's a period of the Queen's life that has never before been featured on film.
And this time around in precisely the right blend of accessibility and reverence for history in ensuring it will appeal to a wider demographic than the “period picture people,” we're able to celebrate the woman's fiercely independent spirit as well as her first encounters with power when her uncle King William perishes and she becomes Queen as well as love when she finds herself stunned that she's fallen for her cousin and intended suitor Prince Albert (Rupert Friend) in what could've been the poster couple for arranged marriage.
Although the young Belgian prince is sent to visit Victoria prepped with knowledge of her favorite operas, novels, and personal preferences memorized as though he were to be tested on them at a later date, soon when he lets his guard down, the two realize that they have much in common in feeling like pawns to be studied by others and pushed around a larger chess board.
Eager to play the game with her, Albert begins to correspond with Victoria by letter, unable once she is made queen to ever propose marriage to her unless she is the one to pose the question, which results in a loyal, sweet and drawn out courtship as Victoria must attend to the matters at hand when the young woman seeks counsel in the Prime Minister Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany).
Unsure of whom she can trust, yet knowing that once she's in charge she intends to see little of her selfish mother (Miranda Richardson) and the tyrannical beast in charge of her affairs – Conroy (Mark Strong) – Victoria struggles with everything from party politics to an assassination attempt by the time she's reached her early twenties.
Although it has a more contemporary and breathable feel than some of its period predecessors even including the excellent “herstory” film The Duchess, Victoria is steeped in history such as the highly detailed journals of Her Majesty, adapted by Oscar winning Gosford Park screenwriter Julian Fellowes in a way that ensures you're more engaged than you were in, say, Sofia Coppola's experimental Marie Antoinette.
Overall, the film remains one of last year's underrated and overlooked treasures along with fellow Sony period releases featuring a strong female role including Bright Star and An Education -- the latter of which received far more Oscar attention but little audience recognition.
Featuring one of Emily Blunt's strongest turns to date, The Young Victoria comes highly recommended in a beautifully transferred DVD featuring behind-the-scenes production extras, deleted and extended footage along with a look at its Oscar winning costumes and art.Detroit

Half an hour after Dek was born, just after I got out of the shower, I felt something I had almost forgotten existed, a chill. It was still pretty warm out, but that early morning air for the first time felt comfortably cool.
In rainy season, when we moved into our house, I was reveling in how pleasant the weather was and how comfortably cool I was feeling. An expat I had just met was telling me her problems with getting her air conditioner fixed and I commented that it was lucky it wasn’t very warm right now. That’s how I found out that it was still super warm for her, and she had been in Thailand way longer than me. So I felt pretty awesome because I had been worried about the heat and adapting to it before we moved here.
It turns out that the thing I find more difficult than heat is bugs. Not big interesting looking giant scary bugs. Those don’t bother me. I’m not scared of large insects, and there are a lot of those. I just don’t like the little biting kind, like mosquitoes, and red ants, and other insects that I had pleasantly forgotten existed living in southern California as long as I have. For one thing, the mosquitoes can make you sick, Aaron had Dengue fever for two weeks during rainy season, so I just really don't like them.
There are ants everywhere here. There is a colony of black ants that has dug in under our house through the concrete and cleared the grout from between the tiles in order to get in. But those ants don’t bite, at least, they don’t have venom, so I don’t mind them all that much.
I thought, my first few weeks here in Thailand that I could never get used to everyone driving on the wrong side of the road. It was just way too weird. Last week I was watching a movie and the person pulled out of a parking lot onto the right hand side of the road and my gut twisted waiting for them to get hit by oncoming traffic. It took a few minutes for me to realize that they were on the right side of the road in America, and that I had truly gotten used to driving on the left hand side of the road.
I now check the water level in the holding tanks on a regular basis, and never take for granted that there will be water flowing when I turn the tap. Between a very inconsistent water supply from the city, requiring water to be delivered in a truck every few days to fill our tanks, and issues with the pump, we’ve gone days with no water in the house, and I have learned that running water is something that requires far more attention than I ever use to give it.
The one time, so far, I just sat down and cried and said, “I want to go home,” was when I tried to have the truck come out to fill our water tanks. They either didn’t understand me, or just didn’t want to come out on the day before the holiday. When I had someone with better Thai call for me they said it was too late to come today, but they would come tomorrow, which I knew wasn’t true, because no one does anything on the King’s birthday. So we had to go 2 more days without water after being without it for half a day already. It was pretty frustrating.
The absence of running water on occasion has taught me how thoroughly used I have gotten to using the sprayer beside the toilet. It really doesn’t feel clean now to just wipe with tissue and not use water to clean myself first. People in North America are just really disgusting and have no idea. I know I didn’t.
I bow my head and put my hands together now when greeting people, out of habit, even my Western friends. That felt pretty silly when I was learning it, but it’s really pleasant way to greet people it turns out.
I’m getting used to honey on my pancakes, when we make them, instead of maple syrup. Because I’m a purist and if I can’t buy the real stuff I’m not going to eat the super expensive fake maple flavored syrup that I can buy here. That's ok though, because the honey here tastes amazing. Ever tasted honey made from the nectar collected from longan flowers? It's pretty fantastic.
I’m starting to forget what good ice cream, and chocolate, taste like. A word of advice? If it says chocolate on the package, and it also looks like it was made in Thailand, skip it. Just don’t even put it in your mouth. It will save you the trouble of spitting it right back out again, it’s that bad. I had the misfortune of once trying something that was labeled “hazelnut chocolate wafer”, which tasted more like wax and sand than anything else. I’ve stopped buying the imported chocolate very often, because more than $2 for a little taste of chocolate starts to add up after a while, especially when you consider that two people could eat a whole meal at a Thai restaurant for that much, depending on what they ordered. But I'm getting better at cooking Thai vegetables, hint, barely let them cook at all, and the food here is amazing.
I guess you could say I’m adapting, and making a life here, and that’s a good thing since it looks like we're going to be here for quite a while.
Love these peeks into your life! Do you read my sister's blog? She has some similar and some different adventures in Ethiopia.
I love this too! :)
I miss you, though! I think of you every time I drive right past your old street on the way to Vista High (and lacrosse practice).
I did check it out. I like how she makes the distinction between people who consider her a friend, and being treated like a celebrity. It's the same here, we call it stays symbol though. Some people consider us that.?

Cushioned laptop sleeves, water-resistant keyboard shields and computer privacy screens may seem like Scrooge’s idea of a gift list, but the December holidays are an excellent time to consider thoughtful yet practical gifts that can help protect some of your loved ones’ most prized possessions. They’re like the digital-era equivalent of socks, ties and other stocking stuffers – and they really come in handy when travel mishaps happen.
I once got jostled as I climbed aboard a bus at Boston airport and dropped my carry-on bag containing a Dell notebook, destroying the machine. During a turbulent flight, I spilled a Coke on an Acer netbook, frying the device’s insides. Given that travel tech tragedies can be quite painful – both emotionally and financially – it’s worth considering the following products to help protect your gear from rough handling on planes and trains.
When you
need to cushion a laptop from falls
G-Form, a company that primarily makes athletics gear such as knee pads for cyclists and skateboarders, offers the Extreme Shield for Laptops, made from a flexible material called Poron XRD that can absorb severe shocks. A reporter at the Boston Herald recently stuffed a laptop inside one of these sleeves and dropped it onto a concrete floor from waist height several times -- and the computer survived. Models are available for 13in, 15in and 17in laptops.
When your
keyboard is prone to spills
Many laptops don’t come with spill-proof keyboards, which is unfortunate because liquid entering through the keys’ gaps is one of the most common causes of computer malfunction. But silicone and plastic covers – which are made for nearly every size and shape of laptop – slip over the keyboard to shield entry points while still allowing you to type as normal, though some people may need time to get accustomed to the feel. When shopping, keep an eye out for well rated brands such as Softleaves, Goliton and Zagg.
When your
tablet is your travel workhorse
Some travellers use an iPad as their mobile computer instead of a full-featured laptop, but the iPad is a delicate device. Even Apple’s Smart Cover, sold separately from the tablet, doesn’t shield the back of the device. To protect a second, third or latest generation iPad, consider the dual-sided Joy Factory SmartSuit3, which safeguards the iPad’s aluminium backing against dents with its faux-leather cover, while a screen protector mimics Apple’s three-part flap Smart Cover by also folding back into a Toblerone shape to double as a support stand.
When you
need to physically secure your laptop
Laptops and tablets won’t fit into standard hotel safes, which is why it is sensible to secure it to a physical object in your room using a cable lock. The electronic accessories company Kensington sells cable locks that attach to laptops and tablets (even those that lack the built-in security slots for attaching these cable locks), and the cables can be looped around a rod in a hotel wardrobe or fixed piece of furniture. Another company, Maclocks, has models for the MacBook Air and the newest version of the MacBook Pro, both of which are too thin to support built-in security slots.
When you’re using a laptop next to
the wandering eyes of strangers
Made for notebooks, tablets and smartphone screens, 3M Privacy Filters use a thin plastic film to hide your on-screen information from anyone looking at device from a side angle, without interfering with its visibility as you look at it straight on. Having been available for Windows-based laptops for a few years, versions for Apple notebooks, tablets and smartphones became widely available this year.
When
you’re carrying secure information on your device
Earlier this year we wrote about password-management tools that let you use encrypted passwords to prevent strangers from accessing your data. To make it impossible for a thief to read your laptop data, you can also encrypt some or all of your device’s files by downloading encryption software from companies like Check Point. An alternative, or supplementary, protective measure is to only keep important information -- or a copy of important information -- on a USB flash drive, which you can keep on your person, making it harder for others to steal or damage. Verbatim’s Tuff-‘N’-Tiny USB drive resists dust, liquids and static charges as well as falls from great heights. For testing, I dropped one in a mug of tea and later tossed it on the floor. It survived both calamities, which is impressive for a device that works with all Windows and Mac USB ports. Memory sizes range from two to 32 gigabytes, and prices vary correspondingly.

The Indiana Senate is considering a resolution that would require presidential candidates to show an official birth certificate.
The Indiana Senate is considering a resolution that would require presidential candidates to show an official birth certificate. The resolution’s author, Indianapolis Senator Mike Delph, says he doesn’t think it’s unreasonable to ask candidates for commander-in-chief to show the same proof as people trying to get a driver’s license.
“We are trusting in the word of individuals and the major parties, but we are also trying to verify by having documentation filed with the application to get on the ballot,” said Delph.
Delph says the resolution isn’t an attack on President Obama, citing questions about John McCain’s qualifications during the 2008 campaign. The measure currently being considered only puts the issue in a summer study committee, but former Barack Obama presidential campaign state chair Kip Tew says even that’s too much.
“I just think it’s a complete waste of time. I don’t think that the legislature ought to be spending its time studying an issue that’s well settled,” said Tew.
A committee will vote later this week on whether to put the resolution before the full Senate.NORTHFIELD, Minn. – Akemi Arzouman (Jr./Irvine, Calif./University) went 8-for-11 from the field and tallied a game-high 21 points, but the Carleton College women’s basketball team was unable to complete its upset bid against rival St. Olaf College. The Knights were unable to wrest control of the President’s Cup, falling 65-60.
Carleton (2-14, 1-12 MIAC) shot 49 percent as a team but was hampered by 24 turnovers. The Oles (12-4, 9-4 MIAC) made just 35 percent of their field-goal attempts, yet came out on top, thanks in part to a 14-4 advantage on the offensive boards.
The score was tied 19-19 midway through the first half, when St. Olaf looked to pull away with a 14-1 run lasting six minutes. The Knights refused to go away and benefitted from a fast break three-pointer by Skylar Tsutsui (Fy./Northridge, Calif./Harvard Westlake School) and an Arzouman layup to pull within 35-29 at the break.
Carleton continued to chip away at the deficit and used a 13-2 spurt to build its largest lead of the contest, 48-41, with 8:52 remaining in the contest. Arzouman scored eight straight points for the Knights during that stretch.
The visitors responded and the lead exchanged hands over the next seven minutes before Tsutsui connected on a three-pointer to give Carleton a 57-56 lead with 2:02 still to play, but it was all St. Olaf down the stretch as the Oles scored the next eight ponts en route to their fourth straight win in the series.
Tsutsui finished with 13 points, and Jenny Ramey (So./Cottage Grove, Minn./New Life Academy) added 11 for Carleton.
Mackenzie Wolter scored 17 points to lead St. Olaf.
Carleton travels to Gustavus Adolphus College next Wednesday, Jan. 25 for a 7:30 tipoff. The game can be heard on KDHL 920AM in the Northfield/Faribault area and worldwide via Knights Online.Tuesday, December 02, 2008
Phillies don't offer arbitration - maybe due to last year?
The Phillies did not want Jamie Moyer and Pat Burrell to take them to the cleaners legally through the arbitration channel next year that is. Both players had a great season and given what happened to the Phillies last year with Ryan Howard getting a big surprise with a 10 million dollar salary for the year made the Phillies shy away from the table this time around.
The Phillies have made it plain to see that they don't want Pat Burrell anymore. Why? That is a great question, he is an underrated player by the team even though he is the guy that the Phillies thought would carry the team some years ago. Here is how he ranks up there amongst left fielders in the National League:
Burrell is ranked as the 31st best outfielder in CBS Sportsline 2009 Fantasy rankings, they say he is streaky. The Phillies never really were a contender for Matt Holliday, he is ranked #1 by the CBS Sportsline '09 ranking. The Phillies now seem content with putting just about anyone out in left field next year, and it probably won't be Mr. Pat Burrell at any price. Again I ask why? Pat has got the Philadelphia attitude of winning down 'Pat' he doesn't complain and he understands what it takes to win and contributed to the Phillies post season wins really well last season. How about some loyalty by the Phillies, Pat is a lifelong Phillie, if anyone deserves some payback from the team it would be to him in my opinion.
Moyer: he is probably in the last year of his pitching career next year he is worth the money you give him just in experience to the other pitchers and he is one of the only players that signs autographs before the games that I've ever seen. In this day of the millionare stuckup ballplayer, he is a real gentleman. I don't mind paying to see a ballgame when I see the class that Jamie Moyer exudes everyday.

Can Leave the World Council of Churches
The hierarchs of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia, led by their newly-elected First Hierarch, Metropolitan Hilarion of Eastern America and New York, took part for the first time in the Council of Bishops of the Russian Orthodox Church, which met last week. During one of the intervals between sessions, Metropolitan Hilarion gave an exclusive interview to RIA News. Andrei Zolotov spoke with him.
—Vladyka, in your report here on the first day of the Council you emphasized that it was your first time here, and that, therefore, much was new and incomprehensible to you. Nearly three days of the Council have passed. What are your impressions and feelings now?
—Firstly, this is a joy because we, the hierarchs from abroad, are sharing such fellowship with our brethren. Of course, we are not acquainted with many of them. But I think that many of the Russian hierarchs also do not know one another, because of the fact that many have been consecrated only relatively recently. This is a joy because we are working together and are able to learn more about the life and administration of the Church here, of those problems that exist here, and those problems that are common to the whole Church. The feelings that arise when we make the acquaintance of hierarchs and converse with them, when we discover such brotherly love and understanding, move us to compunction. We see that these men, whom we did not know except from one remove, learning of them from photographs or one news item or another, are quite remarkable. And now we share a fraternal fellowship. This is an edifying process.
—You said in your report that you are not removing from the agenda the question of the withdrawal of the Russian Orthodox Church from the World Council of Churches. Were there any deliberations regarding this, either in the working groups or in the anterooms of the cathedral?
—There has still been no official discussion. But many hierarchs have approached and expressed their agreement with this; they were gratified that this question was brought up. And really, the people of God are everywhere awaiting this. It would ease our position considerably abroad, where many—clergy and laity—have gone into schism because of this very question. If membership in the World Council of Churches is reconsidered—perhaps we could have observers there as does the Roman Catholic Church—this would probably have a positive affect upon the attitude of many people who feel that past participation in the World Council of Churches and other similar cases of ecumenical interaction have passed the bounds of what is permissible. If this could be corrected, it would be a great joy for the whole Church.
We must not fear that our witness to Orthodoxy will be in any way diminished. On the contrary, when people see that the Orthodox Faith is confessed in our people's life, it will attract them. That our Church changes nothing, that it continues the apostolic, patristic teaching and all the Traditions of the Church—this is precisely what attracts people in the West away from Protestantism and Catholicism. They see that the Church does not alter its doctrine or its practice depending on modern trends; rather, everything that was set forth by the Savior and the apostles is maintained in Orthodoxy. It is because of this that people come to Orthodoxy. And this will continue in even greater measure, because in contemporary Protestant churches, and in Catholicism itself, the falling-away has been great.
—Speaking of the growth of Orthodoxy, the question of missionary activity has also been raised at the Council. You have your own experience of mission amid the non-Russian-speaking, heterodox milieu. What, in your view, is important for mission in the modern world?
—Firstly, what is needed is internal mission. We need to return our Russian people to Orthodoxy—those who have yet to receive Holy Baptism, who still have not come to faith. This is an immense task. And our objective in the West is similar, because we must first work with our own flock. With our youth, when there are mixed marriages among them, for example. In that case it can happen that they gradually drift away from the Church. Perhaps the husband or the wife will convert to Orthodoxy, but often this does not have a lasting, positive affect. Assimilation is also a great problem. For this reason, we are working with our youth, to strengthen them in the Church. But we also bear witness to those outside. We are always ready to receive them if they have a sincere intention to come to Orthodoxy. We prepare them, we lead them through the process of catechesis, and then we receive them—either through Holy Baptism, or sometimes through Chrismation.
It is not our practice, as it is among certain religious groups, to go from door to door, etc. No. People learn about Orthodoxy from literature, from their friends, through family contacts, through religious publications. People come by various routes.
—Even before your election as First Hierarch of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia you traveled to Latin America, trying to bring back those who had gone into schism. What today is the situation of those who went into schism from the Russian Church Outside of Russia after the reunification with the Moscow Patriarchate.
—In Latin America there has as yet been no progress. There are not many clergy there; only several priests in a few countries, such as Brazil, Argentina and Chile, for example, have left. I spoke with them all. They told me why they felt compelled to leave. Of course, they were isolated. Their bishop died several years ago, and we were unable to find a replacement for him immediately. Now there is a bishop [a new bishop of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia was consecrated for Latin America literally on the eve of the Council of Bishops—RIA News], but prior to this there was no archpastoral oversight in situ. And they felt that the questions they raised received no response. I think that this happened because they were ill informed. And perhaps their isolation tended to preserve old concepts, understandings of the past, when the hierarchs here in Russia were objects of mistrust. Perhaps because they had no opportunity to visit Russia and see the change that had taken place here, that the Church is entirely free. But the question of ecumenism is disturbing to many. In Australia also, those who departed pointed precisely to the fact that the Moscow Patriarchate belongs to the World Council of Churches. This is the main reason why they left.
—Vladyka, experience here in Russia shows that the same people who have protested membership in the World Council of Churches are the ones who are pushing for the canonization of Ivan the Terrible, etc.
—Of course there are extremes. But I am speaking about ordinary parishioners who are troubled by this. There are people who will never be satisfied and will always seek reasons for this. But they do not constitute a significant part of the faithful.."*.
Alen A350 Air Purifier
Alen Corporation is a relative newcomer to the air purifier business. In 2005, they pushed their way into an already
crowded field with a series of air purifiers designed to meet most consumers needs. The Alen A350 is one of the products
central to this line. With electronic controls, HEPA filtration, and a lifetime warranty, the A350 has made an immediate
impact on the air purifier market.
What I like about the Alen A350
The A350 comes equipped with push-button, digital controls. The
interface is user friendly and self explanatory.
Weighing just over 18 lbs., this unit is lightweight and compact. The ABS body blends easily
into any surrounding decor, and the A350 is one of very few units that can be mounted to the wall.
Though Alen does not use any sort of trademark to signal how quiet this unit is, the A350 is nearly
inaudible on the lowest setting. It is so quiet on the first setting that aside from the clean air coming
out of the exhaust vent, you wouldn't know it was running. On the second setting the noise level does pick up,
but not so much that it would disturb anything. On the two higher settings the noise levels are similar to comparable
models set on high.
Like all models that Alen produces, the A350 is easy to use and maintain. Use is
simple and straightforward while maintenance consists of removing the front cover, pulling the
filter out and putting a new one in its place. The entire process took me about 30 seconds. The
filters are not particularly expensive and come packaged with the HEPA filter and pre-filter together.
Additionally, should the pre-filter become clogged with debris before the time to replace it, it is fully washable or can be vacuumed off.
The A350 is energy efficient and easy on the wallet. It is Energy Star rated and uses about as much electricity as a
standard light bulb.
One key component to all Alen air purifiers is the warranty. The A350 comes with
Alen's standard Lifetime Warranty. With proper filter replacement (every six months), Alen
ensures that should their product malfunction or ever go on the fritz, you will be covered.
This kind of peace of mind is nearly unmatched in the industry.
What I do not like about the Alen A350
Though the Alen does come with a lifetime warranty, keeping your warranty valid is contingent
upon replacing the filter every six months. This is reasonable when compared to similar air purifiers.
Just remember to keep your receipts!
While its particle filtration may be excellent, the thin layer of activated carbon on the backside of the HEPA filter
is hardly enough to adequately handle odors, smoke or VOCs. Alen attempts to address this by offering a smoke/odor
filter which can be purchased separately.
On the top two speed settings the Alen A350 is not particularly quiet. While the lower
two settings place it ahead of its competitors, on the higher settings it falls back into the rest of the pack.
Overall, the Alen A350 is an excellent unit. For consumers seeking excellent particle filtration results
for medium to large rooms this model is an excellent fit. The price, ease of use, convenience, efficiency and
lifetime warranty all make this a very attractive product. However, those who need odor, smoke or VOC filtration
should consider another model.

We have the series as \[\lim_{n\to \infty} (\frac{1}{\sqrt{n^2+1}}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{n^2+2}}+....\frac{1}{\sqrt{n^2+n}})\] Obviosuly each of the term is less than 1/n \[\frac{1}{\sqrt{n^2+1}}< \frac 1 n \] \[\frac{1}{\sqrt{n^2+n}}< \frac 1 n\] so whole series sum will be less than \[\frac 1 n + \frac 1 n ....\frac 1 n\] note that there are n terms And if you notice each of the term is greater than 1/(n+1) \[\frac{1}{\sqrt{n^2+1}}>\frac{1}{\sqrt{n^2+2n+1}}\] \[\frac{1}{\sqrt{n^2+n}}>\frac{1}{\sqrt{n^2+2n+1}}\] so we have \[\frac{1}{n+1}+\frac{1}{n+1}....+\frac{1}{n+1}<\frac 1 {\sqrt{n^2+1}}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{n^2+2}}....+\frac{1}{\sqrt{n^2+n}}\] \[<\frac{1}{n}+\frac{1}{n}.........+\frac{1}{n}\] Now apply the limit \(n\to \infty\) \[\lim_{n\to \infty}(\frac{1}{n+1}+\frac{1}{n+1}....+\frac{1}{n+1})<\] \[\lim_{n\to \infty}(\frac 1 {\sqrt{n^2+1}}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{n^2+2}}....+\frac{1}{\sqrt{n^2+n}})\] \[<\lim_{n\to \infty}(\frac{1}{n}+\frac{1}{n}.........+\frac{1}{n})\] Evaluate the limits for lower and upper bound. If you get the same limit, then by sandwich theorem, you'll be able to prove. Could you try @grayd<<Here is a list of the various Marian Shrines located in the United States.

This list a Marian shrines in the USA is amazing! I would have never guessed there were so many. I grew up in Southern Illinois, not far from the Our Lady of the Snows shrine in Belleville. It is so beautiful and peaceful there. I have not been back since "World Peace Day" mass back in 1995 or so... I miss it! Your list would make a great starting point for planning a personal cross country pilgrimage...
Would it be OK for me to repost this at my own blog (with full credit to you and a link back to your blog, of course!) My blog is "Felix at Fifty: a Blog About Food, Faith, Family and Finding Fulfillment at (and after) Fifty." Link in my signature below. Please let me know - thank you!
Yes you certainly may share this list. I'm glad you enjoyed it!DIRECTOR PETER HUNT
"ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE"
Peter Hunt was perhaps one of the most integral members of the James Bond team, using his vast skills as a film editor and director to help create a pace and style that helped to launch a phenomenon that still touches the world some two and a half decades after the film series began..
Unfortunately, after that film he left the folds of Bondage, turning his directorial sights to other films. One can only hope that someday he will be persuaded to return to the series, and help further the series he helped to create. Our conversation begins with the director's assertion that the impact of James Bond was every bit as significant to the sixties as the Beatles.
Q: My feeling has always been that what the Beatles did for music, James Bond did for film.
A:.
Q: Cut to the chase.
A:.
Q: One question I've always pondered, is Terence Young's statement in one of the Bond fanzines that Goldfinger was in serious production and editing trouble, when the decision was made to shoot Thunderball quickly, release it first, and then release Goldfinger about six months later. But Young supposedly made editing suggestions that saved Goldfinger.
A: [laughs] I don't know anything about that, but I don't think that can be true, because Thunderball was going through litigation at that time. Remember, it belonged to Kevin McClory. That was one of the ones that didn't belong to Broccoli, Saltzman and United Artists at the time, because Fleming had written the book Thunderball from a screenplay which Kevin McClory claims--and he won the case--he and Jack Wittingham wrote, which was not a book, but because they could never get it lifted off as a film...Fleming had run out of ideas, or was running out of ideas, and said, "Oh, I might as well write and publish this as a book," and then of course McClory said, "You can't do that. You haven't even said that I contributed to it or Jack Whittingham did." They had a big court case, which I think was settled out of court, and then of course the screen rights became Kevin McClory's. If you look at the titles of Thunderball, Kevin McClory is the producer. After Goldfinger there was some talk where everyone debated whether they should do Thunderball or one of the others.
Q: I had read that they were planning on doing On Her Majesty's Secret Service after Thunderball.
A: Originally, yes, which I was going to do. I was promised the film after Thunderball, but they found themselves in a contractual mix-up with other directors on hand, and I got pushed out into the cold, because it was going to be my first film. Eventually, though, I did do it, because what they did...you see, On Her Majesty's Secret Service should have come before You Only Live Twice in the series of events that Fleming wrote. At the end of On Her Majesty's Secret Service the wife is killed, and then in You Only Live Twice he is sent to Japan to extract revenge from Blofeld, and the series went on from there. But they did it the other way around and altered the ending of You Only Live Twice. At that time, in fact, I know they had branched out and had put several directors under contract to do other things for them, and they decided they wouldn't do the other things, and they found themselves either having to pay off these other directors or use them. So they were used in various ways for other things. For instance, Lewis Gilbert, whose editor I had been for many years, was signed to direct You Only Live Twice, which is how that came about. But Thunderball interested me insofar that until the court case was settled, they wouldn't touch it at all, and the case was still going on while we made Goldfinger, so I don't know what events he is talking about.
Terence was extremely instrumental in the whole style of the films. He was extremely encouraging to me in our early style of Dr. No and From Russia With Love, and one cannot underestimate the personality of Terence that was interjected into the character of James Bond and Sean Connery's playing of it in the early films. There's no doubt about it, and he was the right man for the job at the time; a very good filmmaker. He's getting on a bit now, I suppose, like us all [laughs].
Q: Bond was so different for its time. As far as you're concerned, how did the whole thing come about?
A:.
Q: I guess the production problems you faced on Dr. No were actually beneficial.
A: not very long ago with Raiders of the Lost Ark.
Q: I was going to add that I thought Dr. No really seemed to capture the flavor of the Saturday morning serials.
A: That's right, it did. It projected itself backwards, rather than forward, and it worked remarkably well and that's the luck of the draw. Sometimes you need a tremendous amount of luck.
Q: When you get to From Russia With Love, it looks so different....
A:.
Q: Thunderball was not one of the best films....
A: NO......
Q:....but they could have James Bond Does Dinner as a plot and it probably would have done the same amount of business.
A:.
Q: From your point of view, how did production of From Russia With Love go?
A: It was the third film of the deal made between the producers and United Artists. Dr. No was a big success, even Call Me Bawana wasn't a bad success. Bob Hope once told me that it was the only one of his films at that time that had made him money. We were in great, confident spirits at that time, and while we couldn't go mad, I don't think there was a problem regarding production or money. If we needed another day or some extra shots, we got them and did them. So the production was a far better laid out production, although it was entirely the same crew. I think that's what happened, and that there was a great deal more confidence. We were also much more respected by the studio then. They no longer thought of us doing a little crappy picture [laughs]; suddenly we were the big boys, and demanded all sorts of things.
Terence, I think, was a little nervous, because it was the second one and he wasn't sure how it was all going to come out. He soon overrode that, and the confidence came back, helped, in no small way, by one of the definitive fights of all time on the train. The carriage was built on the set, and we had three cameras filming that scene, which was great. The scene took a lot of manipulating in the cutting, but anything good almost always does.
Q: The editing in that scene is fantastic.
A: Again, I was much more confident by then. I now knew that what I had done was good and that it had worked, so there was no holding me back.
Q: The interesting thing about From Russia With Love is that it seems to stick out from the rest of the series, in a good way, while the pacing is just incredible.
A: The pacing was the most important thing. If you analyze the story, it's an impossible one. Why did they go by train? Why didn't they take an airplane? [laughs] It had to move fast in order to hold you. The whole idea of the Bond films--and I don't know if they haven't lost a bit of that now--was that they were paperback films, as it were. They were the sort of thing that the commuters and the average guy working in New York and living outside read on the train. They were his fantasy world because of the way Fleming wrote them. They were all about good wine, well-dressed spies, and all that sort of thing. He brought into the book style great lengths of description regarding the shoes and the cotton shirts, ties, the food that James Bond was eating, and the beautiful girls, and all that--if you analyze it--incredible, but superficial grammar that rubbed off the page onto all of these people, and they were enjoyable because of that. I think we had to get the same thing into the films. My feeling was always that one should make the films seriously, but never take them seriously, if you see what I mean. The humor of the thing has to come out of the film itself. You can't sit down and say, "How can we make this funny?" In other words, it has to be there and work itself out.
Q: Unlike what Roger Moore so often did.
A: Absolutely. I love Roger, he's a lovely man and I've done three films with him, but he was never my idea of James Bond. In fact, I think that one of the better of the films, and of course I would feel that way, was On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Did you enjoy it?
Q: I rank it as number two, right behind Goldfinger.
A: [laughs] I'll accept number two. Had George Lazenby been more sensible, and had Broccoli and Saltzman been more sensible with him, I think he would have made a very credible Bond. He was a great looking guy and he moved along very well, although he wasn't really an actor. He was a model who had not done any acting before that. I think if things had gone the other way, he would have gone on to be a very good Bond. I'm sure they're not going to worry. They've made a fortune anyway [laughs].
Q: Before we move on to OHMSS, let's backtrack a little more. What was your view on the production of Goldfinger?
A: I got a little angry with Goldfinger, because I didn't think it was being made properly. In fact, I did quite a lot of work on that insofar as second unit shooting.
Q: Why did you feel it wasn't being made properly?
A: I just didn't feel that it was coming out the way it should have been coming out. We changed the theme a bit, there was a different director...I just felt it wasn't quite right. I must say that from the producers' point of view, they must have thought the same thing too. They really let me have a much freer hand on that in every way, and I was able to bang and boost that about. The whole car chase was actually a good lesson in editing. It was cut and edited and made to be entirely different from the way it was shot. It was very interesting, actually, but you wouldn't know, of course. Again, one of my favorite sayings is "Thank goodness the audience hasn't seen the script."
Q: How was it originally staged that was different from what we saw?
A: It was very poorly done, in my opinion, but eventually it came out right. As I say, that's all part of filmmaking, I guess. Oh, I remember another reason it was so tough. I had given up smoking, and I was a real bull in a china shop at that time, saying, "No, no, no, no. That's not the way it should be done." I was very autocratic about it all, although in fact it worked in the film. I had to pummel it into the same sort of style that the other two films were; taking what I was given and shaping it like the other two. It was not coming out like them, and my confidence was based on what I had already done. I must say, because it's definitely true, that those two producers always stood behind me very well. They were extremely cooperative and extremely appreciative of all the hard work I did. It is hard work, especially when you consider that the films are ninety percent hard work and ten percent cleverness. They were extremely hard work, and some were more difficult than others. Goldfinger was one of them. But as it worked out, it became one of the better ones. It had a good cast, which I also had in On Her Majesty's Secret Service. I insisted on having a very good actress, and got Diana Rigg. Even all the smaller parts were very good actors, and that makes all the difference. Go back to Dr. No, for instance, all the people sitting around debating about everything were all local actors from Jamaica, and when we were cutting it together we had to put in all new voices. It was an amateur acting society, and for economic sakes they were used. Again, that's just to emphasize the point that as the films got more competent, they got bigger budgets and better casts. Using a barometer, Dr. No was such a success, that you simply had to go up with the next film and become more popular. Goldfinger, like On Her Majesty's Secret Service, had a good story.
Q: I would imagine that something like Thunderball was an editing nightmare.
A: I don't know if it was a nightmare, but it was certainly a challenge. There were moments, I suppose, where I had nightmares [laughs] about what we were going to do with it. It was the biggest film of the lot. Funnily enough, it doesn't matter to the audience. It's whether it captures them or not. It was the most successful at the time, and it was also the most expensive. I think the final negative cost was about eleven million dollars, which was a tremendous amount of money in those days. Of course there was a tremendous amount of underwater material, which is very difficult to edit and to make move along and make a good story out of it. Underwater by its nature is slow and therefore trying to keep a pace going all through it is the difficult thing. Actually, I'd love to do Thunderball again in the future, which, of course, they eventually did [as Never Say Say Never Again].
One thing I said at the time of Thunderball and again later on, was that we had to be careful that we didn't become imitators of our imitators, because by then everybody had gotten on the bandwagon, so we had to be very careful of copying them, because that would have been a disaster. But they seem to have outlived everything and gone on and on and on, although they've changed tremendously. They're not the sort of thing that Ian Fleming wrote.
Q: Although they seem to be trying to get back to it now.
A: They keep trying. They always run On Her Majesty's Secret Service before they begin a new one, and wonder why they can't get back to that.
Q: Did you enjoy Thunderball?
A: I liked the film, particularly the underwater material, because it was a great challenge to me as editor, and I was out in the Bahamas with them, and a great deal of responsibility was laid on my shoulders by them in the making of the film, and in the finishing of it. I don't think Terence really saw the film until much later on, because he was off doing another film. Then, of course, I went on to became a production associate for Cubby on Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, which didn't move fast enough for me. I didn't actually edit it, I'm afraid. By that time I was preparing On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and I didn't want to find myself becoming involved in that capacity, because once you get involved with the editing, it takes up a great deal of the time.
Q: What was your experience on You Only Live Twice like?
A: There were always problems on all of the Bonds for various reasons, because they were tremendously ambitious and it wasn't always possible to do what the written word said; what people imagined. It was a compromise, like most films are.
Q: I thought the film had one of the most disjointed stories.
A: Yes, it was, I'm afraid. It was great for me, because I spent six months in Japan and did all the second unit on it, all the aerial stuff, the helicopter fight..all of that, which was great to make and get done, and it was a tremendous training ground for me for when I came in for On Her Majesty's Secret Service, so all that worked out. And it was a successful film. The problem with it, however, is that it was difficult to put You Only Live Twice in the same style as all the others, because he got married--you had to make that look beautiful, and it was--you had the settings in Japan, and all that stuff, and you had a whole different culture, so it became a whole different style in a way, which is why I think you felt it was disjointed.
Q: I also thought that it had gotten a little too big, if you know what I mean. Things like the scene, no matter how funny it may have seemed at the time, when the helicopter picks up the car with a magnet and drops it in the ocean, seem to be a bit too much.
A: [laughs] I shot all of that in Japan. They had a fit when I flew that over the harbor. They wouldn't let me fly it over Tokyo, but they did let me fly over the harbor. They didn't think I was going to get quite so close to all the buildings. It was a little on the fantastic side, and I think that's the thing about the film. It's a merge between the fantastic and the real and the beautiful, like the wedding, which was very realistic and beautiful, and yet we suddenly pushed into the fantasy-action material. It had two different tiers, as it were, and it didn't really juxtapose together quite evenly. So I can understand what you're saying.
Q: Let's talk about On Her Majesty's Secret Service.
A: Another challenge. Each one was a challenge. That was the thing. I suppose it was a slightly bigger challenge, but by then I had done a great deal with the films, and was very confident and happy in my role. Of course it was a great challenge finding a new actor to play James Bond.
Q: Frankly, I'm rather amazed that you were able to convince the producers to let you go back to a more serious style of Bond film, particularly after the success of the previous films.
A: I'm delighted you felt like that, because I wanted to make it different; I wanted it to stand out from the other films. It was my picture, not anybody else's. It was a very good story, too, and very different. I had the luck, I suppose, to have skiing, which we'd never done before. Up until then, and even today, distributors said that they didn't like snow pictures, because they all think they're going to be a disaster for one reason or another, although I did a snow picture in Canada called Death Hunt, and it was very successful.
Q: What was truly wonderful was the fact that the script went back to the original Fleming novel.
A: During the entire shooting schedule I had a copy of the paperback of the book, where I had written various notes and things, and I was very insistent that we stay with the story of the book.
Q: But why? As I said, the rest of the series tended to drift away from the novels.
A: It was just that it was a good stories; a very fine one. I don't know how much it really stands apart from the others, because it's difficult for me to look at it in the way that you are, and unfortunately I don't think I can comment on that. I took the book, combined with various ideas I had of my own, banged our heads and made the film. I didn't think about the previous Bonds or anything else like that. I knew that it was certainly a Bond film, and we had to make it into a good story.
Q: Were you intimidated by the fact you didn't have Connery?
A: I would have loved to have Connery, because if we had had him, it would have been the best of the lot. But at that time we couldn't, so there was really no point in wishing that we could.
Q: I would just think that at that time, most people would be saying, "Jeez, Connery helped make the series. What are we going to do without him?"
A: I'm sure they did. They're notoriously known for not making their minds up, and I think we were like two weeks off of shooting, when one had to say, "Who are we going with? We're supposed to be starting, but we haven't got a Bond yet," so it got almost to the last moment before the decision was made. The decision to use Lazenby was not left in my hands, but they did say to me, "Can you do it with him?" And I said, "Yes, I can. Let's get somebody we can all agree on," because United Artists, Broccoli and Saltzman were the ones who had to say yes or no.
Q: Lazenby, I felt, turned out to be quite good as Bond.
A: Oh yes, he was very good. And I had a big job directing him, even though he seems to think he wasn't directed, and it was quite a job to make him Bond. But he took it and did it, and that's the important thing. I'm not questioning how difficult it was, because that's part of the director's job. You don't just stand up there and say, "Cut, action," and that sort of thing. You've got a lot more on your plate than that. It was a difficult job, but the answer for me was that it worked, and it worked for the producers as well.
Q: In Bondage, the magazine of the James Bond 007 Fan Club, Lazenby was quoted as saying that he wasn't directed in the film, and that you weren't even talking to him.
A: I don't know why he should say that, because it's quite untrue. You can't possibly have a new, young, guy who has never been an actor and not talk to him. You simply can't do it. I had to tell him where to go and what to do. The whole thing with him is that he changes his mind all the time. But he had to do what I wanted him to do. Indeed, we had long conversations during and before we even started shooting. I wouldn't have gone with him if Diana Rigg hadn't assured me that she liked him enormously at that time before we started shooting, and that she would do everything to help and work with him.
Q: He also noted how he and Rigg did not talk to each other.
A: I think it's a measure of the man's personality. He changed about all over the place, when it all went to his head. You must remember that he was an ordinary little guy from the backwoods of Australia and he was suddenly thrust into a very sophisticated area of filmmaking, and it was very difficult for him. I had to do certain things that directors have to do. For instance, one of the best things he ever did was when she's shot. We got up there at eight in the morning, I insisted he was on set, I sat him in the car and made him rehearse and rehearse all day long, and I broke him down until he was absolutely exhausted, and by the time we shot it at five o'clock, he was exhausted, and that's how I got the performance. He thought that was me being unpleasant to him, but I couldn't say, "Now, listen George, I'm going to do this because it's the best way to get you to react." Maybe I did things like that all the way through, because I knew how to get emotions out of him, but he didn't seem to think that that was fair.
Q: It really is a film that you should be proud of.
A: Thank you very much. I really am. I must say that I'm always complimented, because I get good notices every time it's run on television. Funnily enough, I don't know if it's me, but I believe they're giving it better notices now than they did when it first came out twenty years ago.
Q: Which leads me to my next question, why the heck did you leave the series?
A: At the end of that film, they didn't know what they were going to do, whereas prior to that we had gone on, and on and on. But the team sort of broke up and went on to other things. Then Broccoli asked me to come back for Diamonds Are Forever, but at that time he and Saltzman were fighting and I was involved with something else. I told them that if they moved the production date I might be able to, but they couldn't and so they went with Guy Hamilton. I did, however, get a beautiful review from Pauline Kael on that, who said, "The one thing missing from this film is Peter Hunt" [laughs]. Then, again, Cubby asked me when I was doing Death Hunt, and I couldn't. So each time he came to me, I couldn't do it for one reason or another, although I would have liked to, therefore the cycle broke, as it were. I did have heavy involvement in six of them, which must mean I brought something to the films. If Lazenby had done Diamonds, then I may have done it, as well as the next two, and I wouldn't have done anything else and whilst I've often been disappointed about things I wanted to do that never came off, I've done some films that I'm awfully proud of which are out of the Bond idiom, away from the protected society of Broccoli and Saltzman and all that. It was very protective for me, and very nice and good, but I was able to go off and make my own films, like Gold and Shout at the Devil, both starring Roger Moore, which I'm proud of and which were very different from Bond.
Q: To wrap this up, I thought it was disappointing that you weren't hired to direct Never Say Never Again.
A: Well, there hangs a story. I would have offended Cubby if I had done it. That whole situation was very poor in their thinking, and I think if I had done it, they would have thought that I was a traitor. We had talks about it, but I wouldn't have taken it for that reason.Meta Battle Subway PokeBase - Pokemon Q&A Login Register All Activity Questions Unanswered Tags Users Ask a Question Rules Chat What are the differences between crunch and bite, in the ANIME ? 0 votes just curious anime asked Dec 18, 2011 by ~Infinity Please log in or register to add a comment.

Greenlining Report on Foundation Board Diversity
As promised yesterday, the Greenlining report on diversity of foundation boards is now available. here are the key findings from the report:
- One out of four board members of 46 largest foundations in the United States are people of color, including: 8.0 % who are Latino; 12.5% who are African American and 4.5% who are Asian American
- 28.3% of the top 46 foundations have no people of color on their boards at all, including: 56.5% have no Latinos; 37.8% have no African Americans; and 69.6% have no Asian Americans
- Foundations with diverse boards are also overwhelmingly the most diverse in their grantmaking; 47.1% of all grants to people of color-led organizations in 2005 were made by the foundations with the top 10 most diverse boards

I am looking for an example of a nonprofit foundation giving a "grant" to another nonprofit foundation to award to a researcher.
In the past, this researcher has received an annual stipend from a
donor advised fund, which has been channeled and administered through the nonprofit foundation. (They take 10% as an administrative fee.)
Now, the researcher has been approved by a private foundation to receive a stipend, but, he is not a nonprofit or working under a nonprofit.
How can the researcher receive the monies, and everyone preserve their nonprofit tax status?
Thank you for your assistance.

IntroductionHeadache and neck pain are extremely common chief complaints in the emergency department. One study found that “symptoms involving head and neck” was the sixth-most common ED diagnosis, seen in 2.2% of ED visits.1 The estimated 1-year incidence of neck pain alone can be more than 20%.2 The majority of patients with headache and neck pain do not have a life-threatening problem. The challenge for emergency physician is to recognize signs of cervical artery dissection in patients presenting with head and neck pain. Early identification and treatment of dissection reduces the risk of stroke and death.While the overall incidence of cervical artery dissection is very low, it is a common etiology of stroke in adults younger than 50, causing up to 10% of the cases.3 Incidence has increased in the past decade, likely due to improved imaging modalities. The incidence of spontaneous cervical arterial dissection is 3-5 per 100,000.4 The incidence of traumatic cervical artery dissection is 1 per 1000.4 Cervical arterial dissections most commonly occur in the carotid arteries, followed by the vertebral arteries.PathophysiologyDissection is caused by an intimal tear leading to bleeding into the vascular wall, which can lead to vessel occlusion, thrombus with subsequent distal emboli, aneurysm formation, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Arteries are most prone to dissection when they are stretched over bony prominences. Carotid artery dissection most commonly occurs 2 cm above the bifurcation of the common carotid artery, where the extra-cranial portion of the internal carotid artery travels over C2-3. Vertebral artery dissection most commonly occurs at C1-2, due to compression of the vessel against the C2 cervical foramina during head rotation, and at C5-6, where the artery enters the transverse foramina.4 Compression of the vessel can cause blood to pool and clot in the vessel, then subsequently embolize to distal vessels, resulting in ischemic stroke.
Clinical PresentationEarly presentation of cervical artery dissection can be very subtle and overlaps with more common causes of headache and neck pain like tension headache or musculoskeletal neck pain. Up to 80% of cervical artery dissections are preceded by trauma to the head or neck.3 Dissection has been associated with chiropractic manipulation, weight lifting, roller coasters, and wrestling.5,4 Blunt and penetrating neck trauma may also cause cervical artery dissection. However, the inciting incident may be so benign that the patient may not even remember it. Dissection has been reported following activities as innocuous as shaving, vomiting, yoga, massage, nose blowing, and swimming.3 Symptoms usually start immediately after the traumatic event, although some patients may not experience any symptoms for a week. The average time from traumatic event to onset of symptoms is 2-3 days.6 What further complicates the diagnosis is that the typical ED evaluation of a new headache – non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the head and possible lumbar puncture – will miss most cases of dissection. Ischemic stroke occurs in up to 86% of all dissections and is the presenting symptom in 72%.6 The mean age for carotid artery dissection is 47, and that for vertebral artery dissection is 40.7.7 About 5% of patients have underlying vascular abnormalities such as fibromuscular dysplasia, Marfan’s syndrome, or osteogenesis imperfecta.4Carotid artery dissectionWhile affecting only 8% of patients, the triad of headache, ipsilateral oculosympathetic paresis, and contralateral stroke symptoms is very concerning for carotid artery dissection.4 Oculosympathetic paresis (also referred to as a partial Horner syndrome) is defined as ptosis and miosis without anhidrosis. This phenomenon is caused by ischemia or compression of sympathetic fibers that run from the internal carotid artery plexus. Facial sweating is preserved because the external carotid plexus is not affected. Almost a third of patients have a partial Horner syndrome.5Headache is present in up to 75% of patients.7 The headache of carotid artery dissection may be gradual onset or thunderclap, and it may resemble prior migraines. The quality of the headache is neither sensitive nor specific for carotid artery dissection. Up to 50% of patients have a history of prior migraines or other similar headache.3 Some patients complain of facial or scalp pain rather than headache. Neck pain is typically located over the anterolateral aspect of the neck, up to the jaw and even the ear. Dysgeusia (abnormal taste) is only seen in up to 7% of patients, but when present, is very specific for dissection.4 Neither bruits nor pulsatile tinnitus is sensitive or specific for dissection. Signs of stroke develop in most patients. The most common distribution for cerebral ischemia is the middle cerebral and anterior cerebral arteries. Cranial nerve palsies are present in about 10%.4Vertebral Artery DissectionPatients with vertebral artery dissection present with unilateral headache with signs and symptoms consistent with lateral medulla ischemia. Lateral medulla ischemia, also known as Wallenberg syndrome, is characterized by dysmetria, ataxia, ipsilateral hemiplegia, and contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation.3 Patients may complain of double vision, dizziness, and vomiting, often referred to as “cerebellar signs.” It is important to distinguish between “blurry vision” and “double vision.” Many patients in the emergency department will report blurry vision on review of symptoms, which is likely just presbyopia. Specifically ask about double vision or visual field cuts. The presence of either of these should raise the concern for neurologic deficits.Most, but not all, patients with vertebral artery dissection have a headache.7 Headache is severe, unilateral, and often posterior-occipital. Whereas patients with carotid artery dissection may present with a wide variety of types of headaches, the quality of the headache in vertebral artery dissection is much more consistently unilateral and severe.7 Almost half of patients have neck pain of gradual onset. Less commonly, patients will present with isolated neck pain and no headache. On exam, patients may have neck tenderness with palpation. Do not be falsely reassured by reproducible neck pain when it comes to evaluation of vertebral artery dissection.When compared to carotid artery dissection, vertebral artery dissection is more likely to affect younger patients. It is more common in women and in patients with chronic migraines.Diagnostic studiesOnce you suspect cervical artery dissection, choosing the appropriate imaging modality is key. The usual approach to a new headache in the emergency department is a non-contrast head CT and possible lumbar puncture. Unfortunately this may miss uncomplicated cervical artery dissection, leading to delays in the diagnosis and subsequent stroke or death. Historically, cerebral angiography has been the “gold standard” for diagnosis of dissection. Angiographic findings suggestive of dissection include intimal flaps, pseudoaneurysm, and luminal stenosis or occlusion.3 However, cerebral angiography is less commonly used today due to the invasive nature and the risks of the procedure. Conventional angiography has been replaced in the ED by the faster and more readily available magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and computed tomography angiography (CTA). In some populations, the introduction of MR and CT has increased the rate of diagnosis of cervical artery dissection up to 10-fold.8 Ultrasound has been studied in cervical artery dissection, but it is less sensitive than CTA or MRA. The largest series comparing MRA to traditional angiography found a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 99% for carotid artery dissection and a sensitivity of 20% and a specificity of 100% for vertebral artery dissection.9 Accuracy of CTA has improved over the past decade with the use of multi-detector CT scanners, with a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 100%.10.Emergency Department ManagementThe management of patients diagnosed with cervical artery dissection begins with evaluation of candidacy for fibrinolytic therapy with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). This should be done in consultation with a neurologist. Dissection patients were included in the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke IV tPA trial (NINDS).11 No adverse bleeding events were seen. There was slightly less neurologic improvement seen in the dissection group compared with the non-dissection group (but still greater than the control group). Most patients with dissection present much later than the 3-hour symptom window for tPA, and the dissection must be limited to extra-cranial vessels in order for tPA to be considered. Emerging research suggests that endovascular stenting may also improve neurologic outcomes in dissection patients in the acute phase of stroke.12 Admit all patients with cervical artery dissection to a telemetry-monitored hospital bed, as even patients who are relatively asymptomatic from their dissection may progress to ischemic stroke with devastating neurologic deficits.The long-term treatment of cervical artery dissections is anti-platelet therapy with aspirin 325 mg daily or anticoagulation with warfarin with a goal INR 2-3 for 3-6 months. Both have been shown to reduce the progression to ischemic stroke. No study has ever shown a significant advantage of anticoagulation over anti-platelet therapy.13 In one study, treatment of traumatic dissection with anti-platelet or anticoagulant therapy reduced the incidence of stroke from 64% to 6.8% for carotid dissection and from 54% to 2.6% for vertebral dissection.14 If the patient is not a candidate for tPA, then a heparin drip should be started in the ED. Once the patient is admitted, the neurologist can then determine whether the patient will ultimately be on aspirin or warfarin. Blood pressure goals in the acute setting have not been clearly established, but pilot studies recommend permissive hypertension of the systolic blood pressure up to 200 mm Hg.4 ConclusionHeadache and neck pain are common chief complaints in the emergency department. While they are usually of benign etiology, they might represent early symptoms of a cervical arterial dissection. Dissection needs to be considered in any young patient who presents with neurologic symptoms or signs. Important clinical clues that suggest dissection include any focal neurologic deficit in the setting of headache, facial pain, or neck pain. A partial Horner syndrome should heighten your suspicion. In every case, emergency physicians should question patients about any preceding trauma, and be sure to tell them it doesn’t matter how trivial that trauma might seem. Typical screening tests like non-contrast CT and lumbar puncture may miss an uncomplicated dissection. When dissection is suspected, CTA neck is the next appropriate test. Making the diagnosis is critical, as progression to stroke can be reduced by appropriate therapy. Long term anti-platelet or anticoagulation therapy is recommended.

North Olmsted
A man who for years helped many students and community members blossom in the arts had a memorial garden dedicated to him Saturday at North Olmsted High School.
A group of admirers formally dedicated the memorial garden to longtime North Olmsted High School band director John Kepperley, who also was active in school musical and theatrical productions, as well as various community organizations.
North Olmsted High School senior Grace McDougall helped spearhead the work on the garden as part of earning her Girl Scout Gold Award, the highest honor a Girl Scout can earn.
She said doing a project involving someone who helped her and her interest in music was an easy move.
“I unfortunately never got to experience having Mr. Kepperley as a teacher,” she said. “However, I knew him because of all of my musical involvement, and he was a very involved member of the community. The first time I met him was at an all-city orchestra I am involved in, Strolling Strings. It was playing a concert for Kiwanis. Mr. Kepperley was a member of Kiwanis, and after the concert he came up to me and he told me he thought I was a very talented violinist, and we proceeded to have a half-hour conversation about music.”
McDougall said it is nice being able to blend her love of music with the desire to help the community and honor Kepperley.
“Music has been a huge part of my life,” she said. “I have played the violin since age 4, and the flute/piccolo since the fifth grade. Therefore, when it came time to do my Gold Award, I wanted to do something with music because I believed this was the best way that I could impact the community. I decided to build a garden for Mr. Kepperley because I wanted to honor him, and give back to him just like he had always given back to our community.”
She also said many other people and organizations played a role in the project.
“My Gold Award Project advisor was Mr. Curt Meike,” she said. “He was the person that helped me design the garden and coordinate donations. At the school I worked with (North Olmsted police school resource) Officer (Jim) Carbone, and he helped with the the actual logistics of the garden, and the steps I had to go through with the school. The people that helped me to plant the garden were Officer Carbone, the North Olmsted High School Environmental Club, Mrs. Whitehouse, Ms. Kilbane and my mom. The organizations that donated to the garden were the Environmental Club, North Olmsted Kiwanis, Zergott Landscaping, Sunbeam Gardens and Lowe’s Greenhouse. So far there has been a very positive reaction to the garden, and many people have told me that they love it.”
McDougall said the the garden contains many flowers, and the majority of them have a music-themed name (Conductors Limelight, trumpet vine, bellflower). She added a plaque has been ordered to go in the garden to honor Kepperley. In the future, the Environmental Club and Officer Carbone will maintain the garden, she said.
McDougall said she is doing other music-related work for her award, something Kepperley would appreciate.
“Additionally for my Gold Award I am having a musical workshop at the library sometime this winter,” she said. “At the workshop I will be making musical instruments with the children that attend, and I will be teaching them some fundamental things about music. I truly believe that music should be a fundamental part of all children’s upbringing, just like it was for me. I don’t know where I would be without my musical experience, and I want all children to have this experience.”
Paul Schumann, who along with his wife, Julie, were longtime friends of Kepperley and his family and worked with him on many community projects, said the garden is an appropriate honor.
“It’s something really nice and a great way to honor him,” Schumann said. “He was taken from us too soon and we miss him.”DAN ROBERTS (Roberts_D at COM.BMS) wrote: : Can anybody recommend a 3D molecualr Modeling program that would run on a : MacIntosh??....Thanks for your help!!!!!!!!...Dan : : <<<<INTERNET ADDRESS>>>>Roberts_D at BMS.COM : : Dan Roberts : BRISTOL-MYERS-SQUIBB PHARM.

6 CommentsThere is a rare gem in Sunday’s New York Times in the business section. Former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, Dr. Christina Romer, has provided a balanced honest, accurate and concise summary of the arguments concerning the minimum wage. Given that a significant rise in the minimum wage was one of President Obama’s main initiatives in his recent State of the Union Address, this brief analysis should command a wide audience.Two qualities of this essay particularly commend it.First, as Dr. Romer identifies the several economic effects of the minimum wage, she takes care to estimate their relative magnitude. Yes, a rise in the minimum wage will produce unemployment, it will produce higher prices as business businesses pass higher labor costs on to consumers, and it will therefore conduce to inflation—but how much, compared to the redistributional benefits it may bring?And second, Romer points out that there are other ways, better because more precisely targeted ways, to produce the same benefits as the minimum wage. So she puts the issue in its proper context.If you want a quick lesson on an important, complex and often politically distorted issue, here’s your chance. 5, 2013The Minimum Wage Explained

Dear Gender sensitive and Reader,
Right off the bat, many of you may read this question and be perplexed with the idea of male breasts. But the truth is that all men have breasts! There is breast tissue behind the nipples of a male's chest. Breast cancer occurs quite infrequently in men, accounting for only 1 percent of all male cancers, and less than 1 percent of all breast cancer cases. In 2012, it is estimated that approximately 2,190 new cases of male breast cancer will be diagnosed in the United States. Male breast cancer is extremely rare for boys under 18. The average age of a male breast cancer patient is nearly 65 years old.
Male breast cancer usually presents in the form of a small lump, similar to female breast cancer cases, and the microscopic structure of the tissue in male breast cancer is identical to female breast cancer. Treatment is also identical for both genders. The main difference between male and female breast cancer is in prevalence — breast cancer is about 100 times less common among men than among women.The prognosis (outlook) for men with breast cancer was once thought to be worse than that for women, but recent studies have found this to be false. In fact, men and women with the same stage of breast cancer have a fairly similar outlook for survival.
For the young reader — do not fret. When boys go through puberty, their breasts often grow, becoming swollen and tender. This is totally normal, and gradually goes away. Abnormal causes of enlarged breasts in men (a.k.a. gynecomastia) can include a hormonal imbalance, certain diseases or tumors, and estrogen therapy. What makes you think that you might have male breast cancer? Have your breasts grown? Have you discovered a lump or bump in one or both breasts? Are you having bleeding from the nipple? Lumps or bumps in the breast or bleeding from the breast are more concerning.
While no one knows why some boys or men get breast cancer and some don't, here are some factors that may increase a person's risk:
- Aging
- A family history of breast cancer
- Inheritance of certain genetic mutations
- Use of certain hormones (in particular, those that contain estrogen)
- Klinefelter's syndrome (a condition in which a boy is born with an extra X chromosome)
- Exposure to radiation
- Heavy alcohol use, which can contribute to liver disease (another risk factor)
- History of testicle injury or infection, or undescended testicles
- Obesity
If you are still concerned, it is important that you tell a parent or someone you feel close to (e.g., another family member, a friend's parent, or a school nurse). S/he may be able to provide support and take you to a health care provider, perhaps someone you've been seeing for a long while, and/or someone you like and can trust.
You mention that you're afraid of talking with your parents about this. Remember, they likely care a lot about you and would want you to have peace of mind. Even though this is hard, it's important to do, and can be a way to create closeness. Perhaps you can say something such as: "Mom or Dad — Can I talk with (your health care provider's name) about... I know it may sound weird... breast cancer in men? I know men can get it, and I want to make sure that I don't have it... because I'm a little worried that I do." If not your parents, perhaps another trusted family member can help you make an appointment, and maybe even go with you. When you have a major concern such as this one, it's really important to get it checked so that you can either take action or allow yourself to let go of your worry.

"This is our city! Whoever they send here, we're gonna catch them, we're gonna cook them, and we're gonna eat them!"
This movie is just terrible. In some parts it's a hilarious unintentional comedy while in other parts it's just a awful, blatant Mad Max rip-off. Paying homage to a movie franchise is one thing, but basing your characters, storytelling, dialogue and pretty much everything else makes your movie a rip-off. Not even Bob Hoskins can save this movie and that's usually his "
"6.10.
Takes itself way too seriously and runs too long. I liked Rhona Mitra a lot in this movie but she didn't have that good material to work with. "
"
:0 I can honestly say this is like nothing I've ever seen. It mixes a futuristic world, cyber punk and medival settings together. The results are something to see. And with english horror director Neil Marshall (Dog Soldiers, The Descent) in charge it's also fantastically directed. It's only a little shallow and has a let down of an ending. Otherwise this is just a fun, creative flick that everyone should check out."

The problem with this is it's first thirty minutes. It's kind of a slog to actually get to the point where the film becomes fun. Once it actually kicks into gear it's consistently entertaining and a great action spectacle, possibly one of Marshall's best directed efforts. "

A disappointing movie
“After 'Dog soldier' (which was allright) and 'The Descent' (which was quite good), I was getting quite interested in Neil Marshall's work. But this one was rather disappointing. The story and the action scenes were rather boring. But there are some good points : the beginning is quite nice and Rhona Mitra is quite charming. Also, it is very violent ! I don't know how many people in how many different ways get killed in close-up! There are even a dead rabbit and a dead cow.... To conclude, it is nothing great or original but it is still worth a look, especially if you enjoyed Marshall's previous efforts.” read more

Chef Gordon Ramsay is many things, but “asshole” probably tops the list. He’s angry, demeaning, explosive and uses the f-word in more ways than I could have imagined. But he also may be a genius. He demands excellence and, time after time, people rise to the occasion. It’s that — his clear, obscenity-laden vision — that fuels my man-crush and has me seeking Ramsay wherever I can find him.
Hell's Kitchen
Hell's Kitchen — the reality show and cooking competition — is deep in its ninth season and, as usual, it’s showcasing moody, trash-talking chefs getting their asses handed to them by Ramsay, all in hopes of becoming a head chef at one of his restaurants. It airs on Fox on Mondays at 8 pm.
Gordon's Great Escape, Ramsay's Best Restaurant, Kitchen Nightmares
Ramsay has several TV shows that are better than Hell’s Kitchen, and you can find three of them on Netflix. There’s Gordon's Great Escape, which has him traveling the world in search of great food and finding himself out of his depth. There’s Ramsay's Best Restaurant, which has him pitting great British restaurants against each other. But the best on Netflix is probably the U.K. version of Kitchen Nightmares, which takes viewers across Britain as Ramsay attempts to rescue failing restaurants in a week, then returns later to see how they’ve done.
Gordon Ramsay Makes It Easy, A Chef For All Seasons, Cooking For Friends
In the throes of my man-crush, I’ve picked up three of Ramsay’s cookbooks in the past month: Gordon Ramsay Makes It Easy, A Chef For All Seasons, and Cooking for Friends. They all advocate local and seasonal ingredients and, excitedly going through them, I’ve more than once used one of Ramsay’s signature expressions: “F--- me!”In Memory of
William "Bill" F. Hurd
April 2, 1935 - March 21, 2013
William F. Hurd, age 77 of Branchport, NY passed away Thursday, March 21st, 2013 surrounded by his loving family at Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Hospital in Penn Yan.
William was born in Canandaigua, NY on April 2nd, 1935, the son of the late Robert and Elizabeth VanEpps Hurd. He served in the US Army from 1958 to 1960 and retired from the US Army Reserves as a Staff Sergeant with 30 years of service. He worked for 41 years for Penn Yan Boats, 3 years as a NY State Fire Inspector, and for 6 years with the Penn Yan School District. Bill was a member of the Branchport-Keuka Park Fire Dept. for 60 years, where he was past fire chief from 1973-76. He served as Deputy Fire Coordinator from 1976 to 1998, was a member of the Yates County Fire Chiefs Association and was past director of the Northern Central Fireman's Association. Bill was also a member of the Loyal Order of Moose Penn Yan Lodge 2030 and the American Legion Post 355. Bill enjoyed hunting and playing cards with his family. He loved NASCAR and watching ESS Sprints, and Lance Yonge Racing.
Bill is survived by his loving wife, Jean Moss Hurd; children Robin (Thomas) Davie, Anthony (Cheryl) Hurd, Mindy (Loren) Johnson; Six Grandchildren; seven Great Grandchildren; sister, Linda Hurd (Paul) Colvin; sister and brother in laws; Janet (David) Hopkins, Judy (Anton) Dinehart, and Joanna (William) Whipfrey.

If we’re being accurate, Ache Records began twelve years ago with the release of a CD by the Vancouver band Hooray for Everything! But accuracy doesn’t always make good history. So, this month we’re celebrating the tenth anniversary of the label’s inception and the release of the second record to have the imprint Ache 001, the debut 7” by Victoria’s Hot Hot Heat.
“Ache was started to release records by friends,” says Dixon, a fact demonstrated by the local focus of the early catalogue. “Hot Hot Heat wanted to do a record and I thought people should hear their music. Simple as that.” The concept of beginning a label to promote friends’ music has changed its form over the last decade, but is still at the core of the Ache ethos.
“The label is a forum for different ideas about what music can be, and how it can function without any rules of genre, or concern for commercial success.” In this way, each release has expanded the community of friends the label seeks to promote. Whereas the label was originally intended as an outlet for pre-existing friends, it has
become a way of making new friends worldwide -- releasing music from Sweden (Kid Commando), The Democratic Republic of the Congo (Konono No 1), Japan (2up) and elsewhere.
Furthering this idea of intentionally subverting generic expectations and bringing new friends together, Ache has a split 7” series called Div/orce. Intentionally pairing bands and artists playing sonically different styles, the series highlights the common spirits of freedom and individuality found in music created by people unrestricted by a desire to fit into any existing template.
Dixon, who cut his musical teeth in the punk rock community of Vancouver, was frustrated and ultimately disappointed by what he felt to be a perversion of the original essence of punk rock. “What had at first seemed to be an arena for like-minded individuals being and doing whatever felt right artistically, musically and personally, just turned out to be a place with a different set of rules, arguably narrower than the rules of
the ‘outside world’ we were supposed to be rebelling against.”
The feeling Dixon had as an adolescent discovering records that changed his outlook on music and life by chance, word-of-mouth, or other bands’ liner notes is the same that has driven Ache Records since the beginning. Like a friend showing you his newest find in the racks at Track Records or something picked up from a basement show on tour, each Ache release comes with a feeling of excitement and hope that it might move you and, if even slightly, change your idea of what music is.
Ache Records is a friend to music lovers, designed to bring us together and give us something new and exciting. Next time you see him, why not give a tenth anniversary tin trinket to your friend Andy? Please leave your twelfth anniversary silk gifts at home, though; they don’t fit with the history we’re telling.

Photo Credit: A♥ via Compfight
When you are not the person you thought you’d be keep the following things in mind:
- A wise person once told me that where you’ve been should be a paragraph, and where you’re going should be a book. So just remember that where you’re going is far more important than where you’ve been.
- Don’t stop dreaming. It’s in the world of dreams that the impossible becomes possible, imagination runs riot and great ideas are born.
- Believe in the love you hear about in music lyrics and see in movie scenes. If it wasn’t real the musicians wouldn’t sing about it, the writers wouldn’t write about it, and the movie makers wouldn’t make movies about it.
- Fall in love even though I haven’t yet. I’m told there’s nothing like it.
- Don’t worry too much about the empty mailboxes, traffic jams, unreturned phone calls, broken hearts and piles of debt. If surfing has taught me anything it’s that the conditions always improve.
- Learn how to do something new every year. Last year I learned how to surf. This year I learned how to snowboard. If you kept learning something every year until you were old, you’d never be bored with your life.
- Stop waiting for permission to be extraordinary. By waiting for permission you’re denying the the world the gift of your brilliance. The fear of losing the things they don’t even have keeps so many people from taking the chances that open up a world of possibilities.
- When things are really bad, remember that waves come in sets. Usually it’s going to be better than it’s ever been before when it’s really bad.
- There are no answers in darkness. There have been days when I wondered if it would be better if I didn’t wake up up tomorrow. In those moments of hopeless, despair, and great fear, remember that you can’t always trust the voice in your head.
- Try an extreme sport at least once in your life. Everybody should feel the thrill of a nerve rush.
- Ride a wave or a 1000. There’s nothing quite like it. But explaining it to you is like trying to describe an orgasm to somebody who has never had one, even though I’ve tried with many of my words.
- On that note, find a passion that lights your eyes up, something that you can’t imagine your life without, something that defines you.
- Don’t settle. People will try to convince you to live life according to a timeline. By 25 you should do this, by 30 you should do that, etc, etc.
The logic becomes a bit ridiculous when you realize that we could end it by saying “by 90 you should really in the cemetery.”
- Put your best foot forward with everything you do because good enough is not an acceptable standard.
- Life is not a race. The only thing waiting for you at the finish line is death, so don’t be in such a damn hurry.
- Look for a dare to be great situation. They’re all around us.
- All it takes is one good wave. After all the false starts, brick walls, failures, and setbacks, the only thing people are going to remember is your moment in the sun. You’re only crazy until everything you’re doing starts to work, but most people don’t have the courage to stay the course.
- Don’t trade temporary approval for a lifetime of mediocrity. Make a short time sacrifice for a long term gain and you’ll live without regret.
- Eliminate toxic people from your life since you become the byproduct of the ones you surround yourself with.
- Forgive the people who have hurt you. It’s probably weighing you down more than it is them.
- If you have siblings admire them for their greatness. My sister is charismatic and likable in a way that I’ve never been. I’m more of an acquired taste.
- Don’t ever forget about the people in your corner. Maria Brophy is a friend that has single-handedly had more of a profound impact on my journey through the blogosphere than anybody.
- Don’t give up on things just because they’re hard. Those are usually the things most worth accomplishing.
- Share your crazy wild eyed dreams only with the people who inspire you to chase them. Avoid talking about them with those who infuse doubt, disbelief or encourage you to chase ordinary.
- Remember that conventional wisdom will produce conventional results.
- When you wipe out, shake it off, and paddle back out to the lineup. If you’re not in the water, you’re not going to catch any waves.
- Build something with your own two hands. Find your castle in the sky. It will be one of the most rewarding things you ever do.
- Believe that you will have a moment that makes them stand back and say “wow.”
- Take advice with a grain of salt or shot of tequila. Even mine.
- If you find an Indian person surfing, call the humane society and let them know you have found an endangered species. If she’s attractive and female give her my phone number.
- Stand on the edge of your comfort zone early and often. It’s how progress occurs.
- When you feel like the situation is hopeless, take one more step forward, give it one more day and remember that your circumstances today don’t determine what’s possible tomorrow.
- Even if you die the richest man in the cemetery, remember that nobody leaves this world with a thing in their pockets.
- When you get derailed on your journey, don’t be afraid to take the scenic route.
Today at the age of 34, I’m certainly not the person I thought I would be. But when I compare the person I thought I would be with the person I could be, I see far greater to potential to be extraordinary in the latter. So, I’ll finish with a quote I heard from George Elliott “It’s never too late to be you might have been.”

A post at HLit got me thinking about locative hypertexts, which are meant to be read in a particular place.
Monday, Liza Daly shared an epub demo which pulls in the reader’s location, and makes decisions about the character’s actions based on movement. Think of it as a choose-your-own-adventure novel crossed with a geo-aware travel guide. It’s a brief proof-of-concept, and the most exciting part is that the code is free for the taking under the very permissive (GPL + commercial-compatible) MIT License. Thanks, Liza and Threepress for lowering barriers to experimentation with ebooks!
‘Locative hypertexts’ also bring to mind GPS-based guidebooks as envisioned in the 2007 Editus video ‘Possible ou probable…?’1:
Tim McCormick summarizes:
In the 9-minute video, we get mouth-watering, partly tongue-in-cheek scenes of continental Europe’s quality-of-life — fantastic trains & pedestrian streetscapes,independent bookstores, delicious food, world-class museums, weekend getaway to Bruges, etc.– as the movie follows a couple through a riotous few days of E-book high living.
On their fabulously svelte, Kindle 2-like devices, they
- read and purchase novels
- enjoy reading on the beach
- get multimedia museum guides
- navigate foreign cities with ease
- stay in multimedia contact with friends and family
- collaborate with colleagues on shared virtual desktops while at sidewalk cafes
- see many hi-resolution Breughel paintings online and off that I’m dying to see myself
etc.
Multimedia guidebooks2 are approaching this vision. Combine them with (also-existing) turn-by-turn directions, and connectivity and privacy will be the largest remaining obstacles.
So then what about location-based storytelling? I got to thinking about the iPhone apps I’ve already encountered, which are intended for use in particular places:

I don't even normally like ice cream, but Graeter's is another story! It's so rich and those chunks of chocolate are delicious! I wouldn't recommend the cookies as much, but ice cream and ice cream cakes are yummy! Black raspberry chip is their specialty flavor.
Graeter's made fame by the chocolate chip ice-cream they developed. However, they have let quality slide and now function on reputation more than innovation. The ice-cream remains competent but not special. It is just another parlor. The backed goods are poor and worse each year. Be careful you do not purchase day old stale rolls. The candy on the shelve is just mass produced junk repackaged in the house label. Overpriced and mediocre. It is heartbreaking to have this once proud shop go down the tubes.
I am a very picky about my ice cream growing up in Milwaukee and Cincinnati where ice cream is truly an art form. Graeter's has been featured on Oprah. It is expensive ice cream but well worth the price. The ice cream is hand dipped -- no air! Anything chocolate chip is AMAZING. Chunks of chocolate await you in every bite. Black Raspberry Chip is amazing.
Nothing greater than Graeter's for ice cream. A long standing home-town institution, this is the place to go for the famous black raspberry ice cream filled with chunks ( not chips!) of dark chocolate. Friendly staff is always willing to give you a taste of a flavour if you are undecided. Tables on one side allow you to sit comfortably while you enjoy a bowl or cone. Chocolates and other sweets can be purchased by the pound. My own favourite treat is toffee chip swimming in a pool of dark chocolate sauce. Totally awesome!

Do you want new jobs in your community? With layoffs and businesses closing, who doesn’t? The standard formula is to offer big corporations subsidies and tax breaks. Throw in lax environmental and labor standards, and you may win the new-jobs sweepstakes—until another city offers a better deal. There’s another way—build your economy from local assets. Worker co-ops, in particular, are enjoying a resurgence. The Mondragón cooperatives in Spain started up to provide jobs during an economic slump; today, they employ 100,000 worker/owners. In the South Bronx, a new green worker co-op is reselling salvaged building materials. In Cleveland, co-ops will soon be servicing the city’s most stable employers—hospitals and colleges. These businesses employ the poor and keep jobs local. Many have a distinctly green tinge. Instead of flying off to distant shareholders, the profits go to the worker/owners who keep them circulating close to home.
The YES! Take on Work in the New Economy∞∞∞∞∞∞∞ <you> myself the greatest fool in  [[sic]] me..
I have nothing more to say — and this time, no favour to ask — Altho I am wretchedly poor, I have managed to get clear of the difficulty I spoke of in my last, and am out of debt, at any rate.

The School Nutrition Association (SNA) wants every student to “Be a Star with School Breakfast.” March 4-8 is National School Breakfast Week –a time to celebrate the many benefits of breakfast and encourage children to try breakfast at school. According to SNA, school meals are intended to help “safeguard the health and well-being of our nation’s children.”

There’s no doubt that breakfast plays a key role in helping children be their very best because it gets their day started on the right track. Deemed as the most important meal of the day for all ages, breakfast is especially critical for our school children. Studies show that children who eat breakfast every day, whether at school or at home, have:
- Higher test scores
- Better behavior with less need for discipline
- Improved attendance rates and less tardiness
School breakfast is a good value at less than $2 per meal and it’s also ideal for busy families trying to get out the door quickly in the morning. This federally assisted meal program began as a pilot program in 1966, following the success of the School Lunch Program, and became permanent in 1975. School districts and independent schools that choose to take part in the breakfast program receive financial assistance for each meal they serve. In return, they must serve breakfasts that meet established nutrition requirements, and they must offer free or reduced price meals to eligible children.
What’s for breakfast?
School breakfasts must provide, on average over each school week, at least one fourth of the daily recommended amounts of protein, iron, calcium, and vitamins A and C. In addition, new nutrition standards released in 2012 also call for limiting calories based on the age of children being served to ensure proper portion size, and reducing the amounts of saturated fat, trans fat, and sodium. To meet these standards, schools are offering more fruits and vegetables, increasing whole-grain rich foods, and switching to fat-free or low-fat milk. Although school breakfasts must meet food group and nutrient requirements, local school nutrition professionals decide the specific foods to serve and how they are prepared.
Beginning July 2013, the required school breakfast meal pattern will include:
- Fruit: 1 cup
- Milk: 1 cup, either low-fat plain or fat-free flavored or plain milk
- Grains: 7-10 oz per week for grades K-5, with minimum 1 serving at breakfast (8-10 oz for grades 6-8 and 9-10 oz for grades 9-12). At least ½ of grains must be whole grain-rich
- Meat or meat alternative: Schools may substitute 1 oz of meat or meat alternative (egg, cheese, legumes, nuts, yogurt) for 1 oz of grains after the minimum daily grains requirement is met.
Check out these fun and nutritious sample breakfast menus from SNA – just remember to watch portion size, instead of singling out a specific ingredient such as high fructose corn syrup. Everyone needs a healthy start to the day, so make it a challenge in your household to eat a healthy breakfast every day—either at home, or send your child to try out school breakfast!

My family and I left yesterday for a seven day cruise to the Caribbean. While I am looking forward to this nice little vacation away, it was a little bit stressful to have to prepare for taking a baby on a cruise.
Babies have so much gear and so many necessities, that I wanted to make sure that I had everything I could possibly need. Just in case. A cruise is a unique situation, because unless it’s here with you on the ship, you really can’t get it anywhere else.
I am confident in the preparation that I did do and I’m sure that this cruise will be great and I will be able to enjoy my family.
Maybe even a little bit of alone time!
- Pack Days in Advance 1 of 5I know that's tough with the busy schedule that most moms have. But by packing early (or at least setting stuff out) you have plenty of time to add to your suitcase if you have forgotten something on the original pack. I've already added at least five items to Avery's suitcase since I originally packed. I'm sure I'll have to add a few more before we leave!
- Check With Your Cruise Line About What Baby Activities and Items They Offer On-Board 2 of 5Many cruise lines offer baby items on board so it is less for you to have to pack. Royal Caribbean offers a portable crib for your room for baby to sleep in. They also have toys for your baby to play with so you don't have to bring your own. You might also want to check out the baby activities on board to help you plan. I was so excited to see that Royal Caribbean offers childcare for babies 6-36 months. It will definitely help me get some one-on-one time with both my husband and Harlan.
- Don’t Forget the Important Documents 3 of 5Have your baby's birth certificate or passport ready in a nice folder so that it is easily accessible. I know that seems like a no brainer, but with so many other things to think about, this is one of the most important. They won't let you on the cruise without it and you certainly don't want that to happen! Make copies of all your important documents just in case!
- Don’t Forget the Essentials 4 of 5I packed all of our baby essentials in a separate bag so that I could get to them easily. Many cruises don't offer diapers, wipes, swim diapers, or baby food. I bought a bunch of the squeeze baby pouches so that I can easily feed Avery on the go. I bought a brand new pack of diapers and wipes so that I could easily throw them in the suitcase without everything scattered around. If your baby has a special lovey, throw that in their as well. You want to make sure that you have everything that you need for your entire cruise stay. We are brining our stroller on the ship to easily get around with Avery.
- Relax 5 of 5Get your mind at ease while you are getting ready for your trip. You are going on a cruise after all. Sure it may be a much different experience now that you have a little one to look after, but it's a vacation. And vacations are supposed to be fun! If you've chosen a cruise line that is family friendly, you will be sure to be able to do the things that you want to do and that your baby will find fun as well.

The AP is reporting that a U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit could delay next week’s special election in the 20th CD.
Here’s the story:
ALBANY — A U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit could delay next week’s special election in the 20th Congressional District because military and overseas absentee voters might not have enough time for their votes to be counted.
The complaint says the Department of Defense has determined that overseas voters need at least 30 days to receive and return ballots. The DoD recommends at least 45 days.
In New York, a special election must happen within 30 days of the governor calling for it. The ballot for this vote was certified March 11.
Republican Jim Tedisco is running against Democrat Scott Murphy in the March 31 election.
The state Board of Elections is still reviewing the complaint. No court date has been set.
Calls to the Department of Justice weren’t immediately returned.
Democratic candidate Scott Murphy issued the following statement:
“Scott Murphy wants to ensure every vote counts in this special election, especially the votes of our fighting men and women in uniform overseas. Scott supports any action to ensure their votes are counted.”
GOP candidate Jim Tedisco issued a release in support of the lawsuit.
“I applaud President Obama for directing the Justice Department to ensure our State BOE provides America’s courageous service men and women who defend democracy every opportunity to ensure their right to vote is safeguarded,” Tedisco said.
“Not only should their votes count and voices be heard, America’s heroes deserve our full appreciation and thanks for the sacrifices made in service to our grateful nation. Protecting the right of our military members to have their votes counted is our fundamental responsibility to those who have sacrificed so much, so many could remain free,” Tedisco stated.
“Even since our nation’s founding, the right to vote has been an integral part of our democracy. The Democrat Commissioners at the State BOE should be ashamed of themselves for not supporting an effort to ensure 2,000 members of our military residing across the 20th district can have their votes counted. My opponent should put aside his past anti-military comments and join me in calling for an extension,” Tedisco said
“Surely, asking for an extra seven days so the courageous men and women who defend our democracy and preserve our way of life is not too much to ask for,” Tedisco concluded.

November national food holidays & where to celebrate in Flagstaff
November is *the* month when it comes to national food holidays – as it has the biggest of them all: Thanksgiving, a day dedicated to sharing delectable foods like oven roasted turkey, homemade cranberry sauce, stuffing and pumpkin pie. What’s not to love. There are several other food holidays this month too that you can eat your way merrily through. Here’s a list of a few of them and where to celebrate in Flagstaff…
Nov. 6: National Nachos Day – Go deluxe on your nachos today and eat the fire roasted jalapeno and bacon nachos at Criollo (16 N. San Francisco). These bad boys have cherry wood smoked bacon, asadero and jack cheese, roasted jalapeños, black beans, and house-made salsa.
Nov. 11: National Sundae Day – While I think Sundae Day should always be on a Sunday, it’s not. That’s okay, try Flagstaff’s new sweet spot that lets you create your own sundaes with anything you want: YogurtU (1061 S. Plaza Way – behind Panda Express). This place lets you serve yourself to however much frozen yogurt you want (try the cake batter flavor) and top it with a salad bar of ingredients from sprinkles to gummy bears and everything in between. Genius!
Nov. 14: National Pickle Day – Celebrate right with a fried pickle from none other than Café Pickles (7 N. San Francisco). Order ‘em as an app for a different but delish dish that will satisfy the taste buds.
Nov. 16: National Fast Food Day – No need to go to a national chain, pop on in to the locally owned and operated Louie’s Chicken Shack (2116 E Route 66 and the new location on Milton). These guys do a nice job on their chicken strips. They’re fresh and well-seasoned. They just opened up their second location in October, about a year and a half after opening their first location, so they must be doing something right!
Nov. 17: National Baklava Day – Eat this Mediterranean dessert made with phyllo dough, nuts, butter, sugar and a sweet syrup at Greek Islands (109 E. Phoenix Ave.). This hole in the wall serves up a nice sticky layered dessert that makes the perfect ending to your meal here.
Nov. 21: Gingerbread Day – Have none other than a gingerbread man for a treat today. Bookman’s Café (1520 S. Riordan Ranch St.) sells soft, chewy and oh so sweet gingerbread men that will delight your inner child spirit and your taste buds.
Nov. 24: Thanksgiving – If you’re looking to give mom and break and go out to eat, The Cottage Place (126 W. Cottage Ave.) does a fabulous upscale Turkey Day five course feast. Do make reservations early, as they do book up quickly. Call 928-774-8431 to reserve.
Nov. 28: National French Toast Day - Being this falls on a Monday, celebrate a day early with Sunday brunch at Josephine’s (503 N. Humphreys St.). Order the brioche french toast topped with bananas flamed in rum brown sugar sauce topped with pecans.

Dear Colleagues,
In early April we suggested immediate consultations in order to work out a coordinated approach to stabilize the Ukrainian economy and ensure stable deliveries and transit of Russian natural gas in accordance with contractual terms.
Over a month has passed. Consultations with the representatives of a number of non-EU countries have taken place in Moscow, in which our partners told us they completely shared our concerns over the situation with Ukrainian payments for gas deliveries from the Russian Federation, and risks arising from insufficient amounts of gas being kept in Ukrainian underground storage.
As regards EU countries, we have only had one meeting in Warsaw with a delegation led by European Commissioner for Energy Günther Oettinger, attended also by Ukrainian representative Yuri Prodan. Unfortunately, we have to say that we have not received any specific proposals from our partners about how to correct the situation with the Ukrainian buying company, so that it can meet its contractual obligations and ensure reliable transit.
Moreover, the situation with payments for Russian gas has only worsened over this period of time. Gazprom has not received a single payment for gas supplied to Ukraine, and the total debt has grown from $2.237 billion to $3.508 billion.
And this despite the fact that Ukraine is in receipt of the first tranche of the IMF loan, a sum totaling $3.2 billion.
Given the circumstances, the Russian company has issued an advance invoice for gas deliveries to Ukraine, which is completely in accordance with the contract, and after June 1 gas deliveries will be limited to the amount prepaid by the Ukrainian company.
I would like to emphasize once again that we were forced to make this decision. The Russian Federation is still open to continue consultations and work together with European countries in order to normalize the situation. We also hope that the European Commission will engage in the dialogue more actively in order to work out specific and fair solutions that will help steady the Ukrainian economy.[lin_video src= service=syndicaster width=480 height=510 div_id=videoplayer-1368590225 type=script]

| Associated Press | Story updated at 12:40 AM on Tuesday, October 25, 2005 KNOXVILLE, Tenn. - Tennessee running back Gerald Riggs Jr. will miss the rest of the season after injuring his right lower leg and ankle.
Riggs, the team's top rusher, was hurt in last week's 6-3 loss at Alabama. A statement from the team late Monday said "Riggs definitely will miss the remainder of the 2005 football season." Earlier in the day, coach Phillip Fulmer said he didn't know the extent of the injuries.
Doctors were still evaluating Riggs, and officials had no other details about the injuries.
Riggs leads the No. 23 Volunteers (3-3, 2-3 SEC) with 530 yards rushing on 127 attempts and ranks seventh in the Southeastern Conference with an average 88.3 yards rushing a game. Riggs has scored three touchdowns.
"I'm going to allow the UT Sports Medicine staff and team of orthopedic surgeons to continue directing my care," Riggs said in a statement. "I think that gives me the best opportunity to return successfully from this injury."
Riggs, the son of Atlanta Falcons all-time leading rusher, Gerald Riggs Sr., was hurt at the end of a 24-yard run in the fourth quarter when he was tackled and rolled out of bounds. It was his longest run of the season.
For the game, he led the team with 68 yards on 18 carries. He was named to the first team All-SEC list in the preseason.
Another first-team selection, cornerback Jason Allen, dislocated his hip two weeks ago in the Georgia game and will miss the season.
Riggs started every game this season after waiting three years to become Tennessee's main ball carrier. He had 1,107 yards rushing last year while splitting time with Cedric Houston.
He ends his college career 13th on Tennessee's all-time rushing list with 1,893 yards.
Riggs' backup, redshirt freshman Arian Foster, will likely start Saturday against South Carolina (4-3, 2-3).
Meanwhile, starting defensive end Parys Haralson was released from University of Tennessee Medical Center on Monday after spending the night for observation and treatment for a fever and sore throat.

Technical Abstract:
Phytophthora infestans, the cause of late blight, has rapidly overcome major (R) gene resistance in potatoes. A population of short-day adaptedouted at harvest. In 1998 and 1999, 69 clones were tested for their reaction to late blight in replicated plots on Aroostook Farm, Presque Isle, ME. Percent infected foliage was estimated three times towards the end of the season and used to compute area under the disease progress curve. correlation between field resistance and the detached leaf assay was very low (0.18<r<0.24). Some clones from this population are highly resistant to the US-8 strain of P. infestans and represent another source of breeding material for developing late blight resistant varieties in the future. However, very late maturity, short dormancy, poor tuberization, and low fertility levels may limit the usefulness of this germplasm in northern U.S. latitudes.From All-Creatures.org

DANIEL, GOD'S MAN IN THE FIELD (PART VIII)
A SERMON ORIGINALLY DELIVERED AT
THE HIGH HILL UNITED METHODIST CHURCH
AND
THE FEDERATED CHURCH OF ATHENS
20 AUGUST 1989
By Frank L. Hoffman, Pastor
Scripture References:
Exodus 10:3
Daniel 4:28-37
Matthew 23:1-22
Preparation Verse: (Exodus 10:3)
And Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him, “Thus says the Lord, the God of the Hebrews, ‘How long will you refuse to humble yourself before Me? Let My people go, that they may serve Me.’ ”
Last week in our study of the Book of Daniel, and in our look at part of the account of Simon the Samaritan, we saw the effect that our pride can have on our relationship with God.
God does not like the prideful state of any of us, and He gives us warnings, just as He did to Nebuchadnezzar and Simon; and if we do not heed those warnings, God will take action, as we shall see today.
Let's return to Daniel, beginning with verse 4:28, and remember that last week we saw that God had warned Nebuchadnezzar in a dream: that if he remained in his pride, He would make him like one of the grazing animals of the field..'
God has had enough.
Whatever staying grace was still with Nebuchadnezzar, from the previous warning, has now been removed.
The punishment is being executed..
As strange as it may seem to us today, there is a mental disease called boanthropy in which the affected person believes himself to be like a grazing animal and acts accordingly. This condition also has been observed in modern times.
However, the physical changes taking place in Nebuchadnezzar's body are proof of God's intervention.
God designed humans to eat fruit, nuts, seed, and soft vegetables.
Our bodies are not designed to eat animals or to graze like cattle, so God had to have made some internal physiological changes in Nebuchadnezzar's digestive system, too.
Another fact that we should observe is that part of Nebuchadnezzar's pride was caught up in the food that he ate, and in his utter disregard for the lives and well being of the animals who suffered and died to satisfy his lust and pride.
Now, he has been condemned to live and eat with these animals, and is a vegetarian/vegan like them.
And we have seen other similar examples in our study of God's Word, though not with this kind of diet change.
When King Saul failed to listen to God, He removed His Holy Spirit from him and gave him an evil spirit.
Do you remember a few weeks ago, when we were talking about our attitude when partaking in the Lord's Supper, that Paul wrote of many who had become sick or died from coming before the Lord with an arrogant and unrepentant attitude?
Such an affliction, like that which has befallen Nebuchadnezzar, is not unusual when viewed spiritually, and could also reflect a type of food poisoning for eating animal foods.
The type of disease might be unknown, but not the fact of being afflicted.
And as societies turn from God and become insensitive to His true word, they also become afflicted.
In the Middle Ages the people tried to blame everything that was wrong on cats; thus they killed them, and the rat and mouse populations became a plague upon them, and then the fleas on the rats and mice developed a plague known as the Black Death; and as we know, many thousands died.
Today, as a result of our immoral behavior, and saying that what is evil is good, we have been given the plague, as it were, of AIDS. For even if AIDS existed before, it would never have been transmitted to others, if we had followed a lifestyle consistent with God's will.
If we continually turn against God, we can most assuredly expect to get His wrath, the ultimate being eternal damnation in hell.
What happened to Nebuchadnezzar is not unusual, but it did have its results:
34a. "But at the end of that period I, Nebuchadnezzar, raised my eyes toward heaven, and my reason returned to me, and I blessed the Most High and praised and honored Him who lives forever;
Think about what Nebuchadnezzar just said. At the end of the seven year period, his reason, as a man, returned to him; but he nevertheless had full understanding of the term of his sentence, the events taking place, and the reason for it.
If he did not have this understanding, he would not have praised and honored God.
Nebuchadnezzar was brought to repentance.
Listen to his praise of God:
34b..
Nebuchadnezzar's reason returned to him after his repentance, not before.
In his animal reason, he repented.
We should be very careful not to discount God's relationship with all of His creation.
Just because we don't understand something doesn't mean that it isn't real or doesn't exist. God's ways are not our ways, and His understanding is way beyond ours.
And most times, when we truly repent, God will restore the things that were taken away, but not always right away. Sometimes it may even take years.
When we are truly repentant, we also are not really concerned about having things restored; we just want our relationship with God restored.
And that is when we seem to get the other as well.
37. "Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise, exalt, and honor the King of heaven, for all His works are true and His ways just, and He is able to humble those who walk in pride."
Nebuchadnezzar is saying that his punishment was just, for it brought him to repentance.
We are not playing some game.
Our life relationship with God is for keeps.
The more we know about God and His heavenly will, the more we are responsible for.
Thus in our New Testament lesson for this morning we saw, and will see, that Jesus is much more stern and angry with the religious leaders, because they should know better.
Let's take another look at Matthew 23, beginning at verse 1:
1. Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to His disciples,
Notice the subtle distinction being made here. Many have gathered around Jesus, but only the disciples are the true believers and followers of Christ.
Similarly, not all who call themselves Christians, or who go to church, are true believers and followers of Jesus Christ.
Jesus continues:
2. saying, "The scribes and the Pharisees have seated themselves in the chair of Moses;
By their outward actions, the religious leaders have placed themselves as equal to Moses in teaching and interpreting the Law, which is the role of a religious leader; but they were also to set an example through their lives..
These Pharisees required the people to follow every minute regulation and custom of their Law and tradition, but they themselves would violate them in secret.
Remember that nothing that is done in secret will remain secret forever. Sooner or later it will come to the light, and everyone will know what was done.
5. "But they do all their deeds to be noticed by men; for they broaden their phylacteries, and lengthen the tassels of their garments.
These phylacteries are small square leather boxes containing four pieces of parchment on which are written passages from the Law, and they are held upon the forehead and arm by leather straps.
All who were religious would wear them, but the Pharisees would make theirs very broad and conspicuous in order to attract attention to themselves, as if to say, "See how religious we are!"
And in similar manner they would lengthen the tassels on their garments. The tassels were there to remember and live by the 613 commandments in the Law. The length of the tassel added nothing.
All of this outward show was done because of their pride. Thus, Jesus was angry with them.
6. "And they love the place of honor at banquets, and the chief seats in the synagogues,
7. and respectful greetings in the market places, and being called by men, Rabbi.
And this too is pride.
8. "But do not be called Rabbi, for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers.
This is why you have heard me say, "Call me Frank"; for I would much rather be called Frank and have you see me as your pastor because of my relationship with you and with God, than to be called Pastor and have you see me as a hypocrite.
This holds true for any other position as well.
9. "And do not call anyone on earth your father; for One is your Father, He who is in heaven.
10. "And do not be called leaders; for One is your Leader, that is, Christ.
11. "But the greatest among you shall be your servant.
12. "And whoever exults himself shall be humbled; and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted.
People generally become prideful when they are not completely comfortable in their positions.
They need a title and notoriety in order to feel somewhat secure.
But true comfort and assurance doesn't come this way.
True comfort and assurance comes from believing and trusting in Jesus Christ.
And once we arrive in this relationship with our Lord, our former worldly desires will pass away and won't matter anymore.
But the Pharisees didn't understand, so Jesus has to bring them down from their prideful state.
Listen to what He said to them, and also consider if He may be speaking to us, even now.
13. "But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you shut off the kingdom of heaven from men; for you do not enter in yourself, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in.
Not only were these leaders denying the truth themselves, but they prevented others from accepting it as well; for they knew that if they accepted the truth, they would also have to give up their prideful position.
A few Pharisees, such as Paul, Nicodemus, and Joseph, did accept the truth, and the whole world knows of them and their good works; but very few of the ones who rejected Jesus Christ are known by name.
So you be the judge; who was more honored: those who rejected the truth for fear of losing their honor, or those who gave up their pride to accept the truth?
14. ["Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you devour widows' houses, even while for a pretense you make long prayers; therefore you shall receive greater condemnation.]
For their own personal gain, they used their official position to take advantage of the widows.
15. "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you travel about on sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves.
The proselytes were essentially pagans who knew nothing of the Hebrew Law before encountering these religious leaders; thus they both heard what they said and observed how they acted, and followed in their footsteps, utilizing certain of their cultish practices to accomplish even more than the Pharisees for their personal gain..
But when you know the truth and submit your will to the Lord, there is no longer any need to swear that you will do something; for you automatically do what God wants you to do.
It is only when we are hypocrites and untrustworthy that we are obligated to swear that we will do something.
Jesus Christ continues and pronounces four additional woes against these religious leaders because of their falseness.
If we would only learn to do God's will, He would never have to pronounce His woes against anyone.
Living in the world system of hypocrisy and pride only keeps us in bondage. In Jesus Christ we can live freely.
All He wants us to do is believe on Him, and repent, and live our new lives in Him forever and ever, as the truly loving, compassionate, and peacemaking children of God He has called us to be.

Chris Wyles and Samu Manoa Cross the Line in Heineken Cup Action.
Chris Wyles scored a crucial try for the Ospreys in front of 40,000 fans at Wembley Stadium to give Saracens a 31-26 Heineken Cup win. Wyles almost began the game in perfect fashion after it looked like he a scored in the corner, but it was judged that he was brought into touch. He would eventually get his try in the second half after some good work by himself and his teammates that eventually say Wyles cross the line. Saracens coach Andy Farrell made special note of Wyles effort to race back after being involved in the ruck to come back and get the ball. Wyles played the whole game for Saracens while Hayden Smith is out with a broken hand. Hanno Dirksen didn’t dress for the Ospreys.
Video highlights of the match, including Wyles try, can be seen here. (Note: if you watch the players’ reaction you can see Chris Wyles give Hayden Smith his new nickname-Frankensteing.)
It was almost as perfect of a day for Samu Manoa who also scored a try and played 80 minutes in the Heineken Cup. Manoa crossed the line in the 55th minute, but it wasn’t enough as Northampton lost to Castres 41-22. Samu started at Number 8 in a match mired with two yellow cards for the Saints.
Also in the Heineken Cup, Chris Biller made his first start and played the whole game for Bath. Biller was instrumental in the only try of the game, creating some space for Matt Banahan to score. Highlights of the game can be seen here.
Staying in the Heineken Cup, Taku Ngwenya started and played 80 minutes as Biarritz lost to Benetton Treviso 30-26. Biarritz are continuing to struggle both in the Europe and in France.
Neither Seta Tuilevuka (Montpellier) nor Tommy Seymour (Glasgow) played in Glasgow’s 20-15 victory. Tuilevuka should be returning soon from injury.
In the Amlin Challenge Cup, Kevin Swiryn started and played 80 minutes for Agen as they lost to Sale 29-14. Highlights of Agen’s tries can be seen here. Agen play Toulon on Tuesday, but Swiryn is not in the lineup.
Scott LaValla didn’t make the game-day squad for Stade Francais as they ran over Crociati (Romania) in the Amlin Challenge Cup.
Returning to England and the RFU Championship, Mike MacDonald started and played 80 minutes for Leeds Carnegie as they squeaked out a 14-13 victory against the Cornish Pirates. Highlights of the match can be seen here. Robbie Shaw was out and not dressed for Leeds, as was Andrew Suniula for the Pirates.
Shawn Pittman was not in the London Welsh squad that lost to Nottingham 26-10. It is unclear if Pittman is injured.
Two Americans saw action in the annual Varsity Cup as Derek Asburn started for Oxford while Jason Law came off the bench to earn Blues. Oxford won the match 28-10.
Inaki Basauri saw his streak of consecutive starts come to an end as he didn’t dress for Perigeuex in their 26-0 loss to Mont de Marson.
Todd Clever continues to sit out as Suntory beat the Ricoh Black Rams 26-24.

Post comment as a guestAmerican soccer player, David Testo, formerly with the Columbus Crew, has come out as a gay man, making him the first former MLS player to do so. And, to make things more interesting, and open, his former team, the Montreal Impact, say they knew he was gay when they signed him. my whole life, my whole career. Living the life of a professional athlete and being gay is incredibly difficult....It saps all your energy to you, in addition to having to perform, to having to play.
David Testo, who played college soccer for the University of South Carolina, is the first American pro soccer player to come out of the closet. Although he is not with an MLS team right now, he is not retried, and were he to sign with another team, he would be the first openly gay active player in the big five leagues. Still I gather from his interview, David Testo is just happy to be open and honest and out..
Welcome out, David.
Homo HQ is sending you your Official copy of the Gay Agenda, as well as the obligatory Toaster Oven for coming out.
All kidding aside though, this has been quite the fall for people coming out of the closet. Actors like Zachary Quinto and Sean Maher, politicians like Cathleen Galgiani, comics like Oliver Callan, athletes like Jed Hooper and Gus Johnston, reporters like Dan Kloeffler. We're here, we're queer, we're coming out.

welcome to the fam
With each famous person coming out, it leaves more and more lgbt kids with a smile on their face, instead of fear.As the man said, "Don't think, you'll only hurt the ballclub."
Her questions and my answers:
1-Who was your mentor growing up? What about now?
I can't say I've ever had an Obi-Wan-Kenobi style mentor, but I've learned an awful lot from people with names like Katie-Bar-The-Door, Mister Muleboy, Bellotoot, Susan, my brothers Tom and Steve, but first and foremost Robert Osborne.
2-If you had a shopping spree at one store, which store would it be?
My very favorite store, Amazon.com.
3-If you could own any pet, what would you have, and what would you name it?
Why, this little doggie right here ...
4-If you could start any business, what would you start?
Monkey Business, of course.
5-Dream vacation spot?
Anywhere Katie-Bar-The-Door is.
6-If you started a charity, what would it be for?
I'd like to give essays about movies to all the little children of the world. Or food. Food would also be good.
7-What's on your Christmas list this year?
After eight straight Christmases on the road, spending Christmas at home. Everything else is icing on the sugar cookies.
8-What are/would you be for Halloween?
Rich.
And my eight questions:
1) You're walking down the street when a talking penguin asks you for a movie recommendation. Assuming you're wearing your favorite shoes, which pair are you wearing?
2) If you had to live one day from your life over and over again, which musical instrument would you learn how to play?
3) This one courtesy of Eddie Izzard: Cake or death? [see it below]
4) Which is your favorite railroad in a game of Monopoly?
5) Tapas in Barcelona or moules et frites in Paris?
6) If you were nougat, would you want to be covered in milk-, dark- or white-chocolate?
7) If you could be any character from a movie, who would be your co-star?
8) You're coming to bat in a major league game for the first time—what's your theme song?

Dang it, I forgot about Amazon!
:(
Your questions are MUCH more interesting. haha. I always blank on stuff like that.
:D
Actually, you asked very good questions -- they set me on a train of thought all day!
Those were the same questions I got asked. haha.
now thats sad.
Or maybe I wasn't supposed to make up new questions. Following directions was never my strong suit.
Actually, that's not true. I'm very good at following directions. I just have no sense of direction. I could get lost on my way to the grocery store ...
If you want to ask more questions, don't hesitate. As I tell Katie-Bar-The-Door all the time, "Ask me a question, I'll tell you anything."
You know, as long as it's a question I don't mind answering ...
Haha nope you did it right. I did it wrong.
I get lost ALL the time. haha.
Alrighty!
I'd just say you were right and go with that.
As Katie, who's a computer analyst, would say, "That's not a mistake, that's a feature!"
What fun!
1) I never wear shoes when I talk to a penguin.
2)The pipe organ. It seems appropriate as I go mad.
3) Any nougat?
4) E&J. Huh,what?
5) Paris, always.
6) LOL, silly man.
7) Cinzia Zaccardi (Sophia Loren) to Tom Winters (Cary Grant) in 'Houseboat.'
8) Oops, I did it again.
Thanks, MM. : )
Oh, the Amazon answer kills me. You know I work in an independent bookstore, right?
Am I supposed to answer all 16?
First 8
1 - Carol Mooney. Or possibly Gandalf.
2 - Powell's City of Books, which is not the story I currently work for, but hey, it's the largest bookstore in the world.
3 - a bassett hound named Bill
4 - the dream book store my wife and I first decided on when we met that wouldn't sell John Grisham or Emily Dickinson
5 - Bridalveil Falls, Yosemite
6 - give championships to under-funded, under-talented baseball teams by taking them from New York
7 - books, books, and, oh yeah, more books - just like every year
8 - I was Elwood Blues last year because I had to pull off something I could wear at work - perhaps this year, I'll go back to the black trenchcoat, black fedora and lightsaber and be a member of the Jedi mafia
Monkey's 8:
1 - my Calderas, if I ever get them fixed
2 - the tuba - what could be sexier than a middle aged guy playing the tuba, right?
3 - cake
4 - Reading
5 - Paris all the way
6 - dark chocolate
7 - Jane Fonda, circa 1966/67/68
8 - well, I walked up the aisle to the Imperial March, but I think I'll go with "Now I'm a Man" by DVDA from Orgazmo
Oh, the Amazon answer kills me. You know I work in an independent bookstore, right?
I did not know that, although I wasn't thinking of books from amazon.com, but movies. I like to hold the book in my hands before I buy it, and it's almost always an immediate gratification purchase -- something I've read about or thought of and I want to read it now.
You can only get that in a bookstore ...
Movies on the other hand, in this area at least, the selection is limited to more recent stuff. My last movie purchase was William S. Hart in 1916's Hell's Hinges which recently became available for under $10 after being available only as part of an $80 collection of early stuff I have to admit I wasn't particularly interested in.
Ok, nobody asked me, but I'm going to answer anyway.
1. We'll if I'm walking it's probably my sneakers. Otherwise its a gorgeous pair of magenta outrageously high heels.
2. Well not a guitar, it would mess up my manicure. And not the clarinet, which I already know how to play (badly). I'll have to go with piano despite it's lack of portability.
3. Death. No, no, wait!!! Cake. As long as it's low cal or really delicious.
4. Gotta take a ride on the Reading.
5. Tapas in Barcelona. Mussels make my tum-tum unhappy.
6. Dark. White chocolate is an abomination, and milk chocolate is just a cop-out.
7. William Powell of course. "Can you reach the water?"
8. Love Shack by B-52s, or Mercy by Duffy
(1) The ones with rubber souls of course
(2) Guitar, because it's infinite!
(3) I'll take ... cake -- thank you very much
(4) The Reading RR, on account of it's more lit'ry
(5) Tapas; because if I said moules et frites I'd be bluffing, and I hear it's never a good idea to bluff the Mythical Monkey
(6) Now don't be messing with my chocolate, sonny -- milk chocolate's the American Chocolate, it's the patriotic chocolate; i was practically raised on stale Hershey bars; it's in my soul & in my blood, milk chocolate is just ... just ... just don't be messing with my chocolate, that's all i'm saying
(7) Gail Patrick and I'm not lying
(8) A Dying Cubs Fan's Last Request
Speaking of the Cubs, Who, Katie-Bar-The-Door and I went to Wrigley Field when were in Chicago back in September. Great seats, too. Upper deck, fifth row, under the press box, an arm's length from the television camera guy. Beautiful day. A nice breeze blowing out. Aramis Ramirez crushed a home run.
Of course, the Cardinals won, 7-1, with Adam Wainwright picking up his 20th win, but we ignored that.
By the way, I encourage everybody to toddle on over to The Mouth O' The Mule to read his answers to this fine quiz. Just click here.
As for me ...
1) Favorite shoes of all-time? The first pair of Allen Edmonds black wing-tips I ever bought. Currently -- a beat-up pair of penny loafers.
2) Before I die, I want to learn Spanish and guitar, so Spanish guitar.
3) I'm thinking, I'm thinking ...
4) The B&O, of course!
5) Tapas in Barcelona. That was a pretty good day. Why couldn't I get that day over and over ...
6) Milk chocolate, although I like white chocolate. Dark chocolate is the abomination.
7) Myrna Loy, since I'd be William Powell in The Thin Man.
8) I'd like to say "Voodoo Chile" by Jimi Hendrix, but I'm afraid the Beatles' "Help!" would be more accurate.just finished this last night. FINALLY. so happy this painting is done with.

holiday postcard assignment
this assignment is for one of my classes. objective: create a holiday themed post card. of course i chose christmas. what better idea than to do a piece for a class and then use it as a card to give to family and friends? it was a no brainer. this was my sketch.
cheesy maybe but i can't seem to do a piece without animals or trees in it.
this was the final inked:
for once i actually start feeling confident in my piece but at the same time terrified to start the painting...

A couple of quick comments for now: As I speculated here on the blog, it looks like "Believe In America" -- the new subtitle for the paperback version of his book No Apology -- will be Romney's campaign slogan. Also, in his announcement video (filmed at UNH Durham campus) Romney is wearing the same casual plaid dress shirt he is wearing on the cover of that book. I can't help thinking that he bought a drawerful of the same shirt after some focus group approved it.The Harper Collins Pub: Climbing & Mountaineering Narrative is a great way to sit back, calm down, and study something new.

Technical Abstract:
A new and very effective approach in selecting antagonists for mixtures with superior biocontrol potential to the individual antagonist has been developed. Microorganisms selected for the mixtures were isolated from exposed apple tissue in weekly intervals during the last 5 weeks before harvest. They were classified and grouped to nutritional clusters on the basis of utilization of 95 carbon sources in Biolog plates using MicoLog and MLCLUST programs, respectively. Yeasts were dominant at all isolation times. Bacteria were isolated only occasionally. All isolates were screened for biocontrol potential against P. expansum on Golden Delicious apple. The most promising antagonists from different clusters were paired, with preference given to those colonizing the same fruit, then colonizing different fruit but at the same time of isolation, and finally to those colonizing various fruit at various times of isolation. From 21 yeast antagonists tested in 13 combinations, four had superior control to the individual antagonists. A combination of antagonist isolates T5-D3 and T5-E2 was consistently superior to the individual application in controlling blue mold on apples. Nutritional profiles of these antagonists based on utilization of 35 carbon and 33 nitrogen sources revealed significant differences in carbon catabolism. These differences caused niche differentiation and allowed populations of both antagonists to flourish in the same wound. This was confirmed by a high level of coexistence in de Wit displacement series, and close to the unity relative yield at all antagonist proportions tested. Combining antagonists on the basis of niche differentiation appears to be an effective method of improving biocontrol of postharvest and probably other diseases.Concluding this years Seattle Jewish Film Festival, Noodle suffers from a too-cutesy name that belies a serious subject: undocumented workers who have few rights in the (relatively) affluent countries where they pick our fruit and scrub our toilets. The 6-year-old Chinese son, dubbed Noodle, of one such worker gets stranded in Tel Aviv when his mother is deported. Speaking about five words of Hebrew, the kid (BaoQi Chen) falls under the reluctant protection of a cynical flight attendant (Mili Avital) who, at 39, is childless and twice widowed. And shes got issues with her sister, her brother-in-law, and their messy divorce. Does she have time to be a temporary mother? Does she want to be? Should she adopt Noodle, or dump him out on the street? Though world-weary and fatalistic (for good reason), our heroine finds in the kid just a tiny cause for optimism. And no one seems more surprised than she. Cinerama, 2100 Fourth Ave., 622-6315,. $7$10. 9 p.m. BRIAN MILLER
Sun., April 13, 9 p.m., 2008In a rare public comment, Mr Evans said the economy was in good shape “supported by sound fundamentals and robust growth in Asia.
“However, growth is expected to remain modest and uneven, with some sectors performing more strongly than others, and this will contribute to consumers and businesses remaining cautious in the near term." The comments from the former federal Treasury secretary were made in a letter issued to Westpac shareholders yesterday.
Mr Evans said the bank expected confidence to gradually improve and eventually lead to some increase in activity and a rise in lending growth.
“That said, the recovery is likely to be moderate in the short term, particularly as the timing of an upturn in business credit remains uncertain."
Banks have been struggling to grow their revenues over the past year, as households and businesses pay down debt and borrow less.
Total credit provided to the private sector by financial intermediaries rose 0.3 per cent in May, after being flat in April, to be a modest 3.1 per cent higher over the 12 months.
Business credit, which showed tentative signs of a recovery in February and March before falling in April, rose by just 0.1 per cent in May.
Business lending is 1.5 per cent lower over the year.
“Within this environment Westpac is well placed; the significant investment in our networks and our people in recent years has seen all our divisions in solid shape," Mr Evans said.
In the letter, which was co-authored by chief executive
“Retention of customers is also excellent," he said. “Overall, we believe the group is in a strong position to deal with the challenges of the environment and to continue delivering quality returns for shareholders."
Mr Evans, who is to step down from his position at the bank’s annual general meeting in December, said his successor,

Last Updated: May 12, 2011
 Roland Wiley, AIA from RAW International.
From a regulatory framework, what needs to change so that we can facilitate a transportation system that supports healthier, more functional and more livable neighborhoods?
Transit station area safety, security, and access standards need to cover a minimum ¼ mile radius. Pedestrian accessibility and safety improvements must be implemented on the streets leading to the transit stations in order to increase the perception of safety and walkability for potential transit users.
How can we maximize our investment in the next round of transportation improvements?
We can maximize our investment in the next round of transit improvements by insuring that the proposed alignments and station locations for new systems offer the very best connectivity and convenience for transit users. For example, the Crenshaw Line as planned features a northern terminus at the Exposition Line and a southern Terminus at LAX. It is imperative that the design of the transit user's experience transferring from the Crenshaw Line to the Expo Line is seamless, safe, and convenient. Likewise, at the LAX station, the design of the transfer system from the Crenshaw Line to the Airport transit system (people mover, tram, etc.) must be seamless and convenient to insure maximum use by business travellers and commuters.
Vision is also a key component in maximizing our transit investments. In many of the historically underutilized urban communities, transit investments could have a profound transformative impact in the economic development of the station area. The planners of the alignment and station locations should be careful not to be "short sighted" in realizing the development potential of station areas.
From a global perspective, how far behind/ how far ahead is California?
From a national perspective, California is at the leading edge of transportation improvements. I believe that like China and Japan.
What do you most enjoy right now, when it comes to our current transportation system? What's working well? What's the 'baby' you don't want to throw out with the murky bathwater?
I think the greatest asset of our current transportation system is its potential. Our local system has the potential to develop into a well-connected network that reaches from Thousand Oaks to the Inland Empire. However, a connected network that vast will require a number of transit lines that offer comparable travel times to that of a personal vehicle.
In order to get people out of their cars to use public transit, we must be able to offer safe and convenient travel options. It is important that the people of Los Angeles continue to support Metro's Long Range Transportation Plan, and it is important that Metro continues to search for conventional and unconventional funding sources to sustain the program.
What is your vision for the year 2050? Share a glimpse of a day-in-your life as it relates to your personal mobility.
A Day in My Life in the Year 2050:
a. I wake up in the morning to a beautiful sunrise, use my waterless urinal, and take a high pressure steam shower.
b. My wife and I are to meet some friends in San Francisco for the day.
c. My sons check in on us via a virtual imaging device. We also use a scanning devise to check all of our vital health functions (heart rate, blood pressure, etc.)
d. We take a self-guided Public Transport Vehicle (PTV) to Leimert Park from our home. By entering the address of our destination, the driverless vehicle is able to navigate flawlessly from our house to a quaint coffee shop in Leimert Park. The PTV drops us off in front of the coffee shop and heads off for another fare. Utilizing the self-guided PTV is like a utility, and we are billed by miles traveled. This self-guided PTV technology has developed into a highly successful alternative to the conventional personal car and driver. There are now dedicated lanes on most major streets which allow these vehicles to travel throughout the city without experiencing traffic tie-ups due to human error. After a healthy breakfast with coffee, my wife and I walk to the nearby Leimert Park subway station. We use our transit pass to gain access to the platform. Our friends in San Francisco are coordinated to our current location via the GPS device on our phone. We take the Crenshaw Line to the Expo Line to Union Station. We catch the 9:30am High Speed Train to San Francisco. During the comfortable train ride to San Francisco, we take in the beautiful scenery of the California landscape. It also gives us the opportunity to share our experience with our grandchildren through our virtual communication device.
e. We arrive in San Francisco in time for a late lunch with our friends. We take the subway from the train station to a quaint restaurant in Chinatown. After a wonderful meal, we get another public transit vehicle to look at a few architectural gems around the city. The PTV drops us off at a nearby subway station, and we take the subway back to the High Speed Train Station. We say good-bye to our friends and head back to Los Angeles.
f. I take a nap on the train ride back while my wife talks on the phone (some things never change). Our son checks in on us to make sure we are OK. The PTV drops us off at home at around 8:00pm, in time to see the LAKERS game.
Today was a good day.?
Memorable Mobility Experience:
One of my more memorable transit experiences was my very first subway ride. On my first trip to New York City, I arrived at JFK Airport and took the "train from the plane". Although the connection from the airport to the New York Subway system was a bit disconnected, I was impressed by the fact that I could make it all the way to Brooklyn from the airport without the need for a taxi or a bus. The subway ride for me was a gymnastic balancing act between hanging onto my suitcase and hanging onto the pole to support myself. The train driver announced each transit stop, but you had to be a seasoned New Yorker to translate the garbled words coming out of the PA system, which were a mix of a thick New York accent and a poor speaker system.
The transition from the subway station below to the portal at street level was one of the most exhilarating experiences of my life. I will never forget the wave of New York urban energy that swept over me the moment I landed at the top of the stairs with my suitcase on the streets of Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn. The sidewalks were alive with activity, as it was a hot summer afternoon and everybody was out on the streets. Coming from Indiana, I had never seen so many people walking on the streets, so many walk- up mom and pops stores, so many cars jockeying their way through the congested streets. There were even musicians with steel drums playing on the sidewalk, which created a melodic backdrop to the kinetic energy of the streets. If it weren't for my suitcase, I could have walked those streets for hours!!
In hindsight this environment would be described today as a transit oriented district. It featured the following components:
a. Transit Station
b. Density - 4 to 6 story multi-family housing units.
c. Mixed use - retail at the ground floor
d. Eyes on the Street - Residential uses above the ground floor provide for 24 hour surveillance.
e. Great Streets - sidewalks wide enough to accommodate people and activities or amenities..Sampson Sharp
The East Liverpool Tribune
Feb. 26, 1906
THE SHARP FUNERAL
The beautiful Masonic ritual service was observed yesterday afternoon when the remains of the late Sampson Sharp were laid in their last resting place in Riverview cemetery. The funeral services were held in the Masonic lodge room and were presided over by Worshipful Master C. H. Shell, assisted by the Rev. T. W. Lane, pastor of the First Methodist Episcopal church, a member of the order.
After the services in the hall the remains were escorted to the cemetery, the special escort of Masons being H. A. Knoblock, Thomas Arbuckle, George Grosshans, G. Bendheim, W. T. Burton and Fred G. Croxall.
Sampson Sharp was born September 25, 1822, in the city of Bradford, Yorkshire, England, where he resided until a young man. He then turned his attention to the mining industry, which avocation he followed in various capacities until the year 1851, when he followed the tide of immigration that was flowing into the United States and located at Pittsburg, Pa.
His practical knowledge of mining was soon sought after and he was called to Salineville in the year 1851 to develop the first mines located on the line of the C. & P. railroad.
He remained in charge of this property until 1876 when he located in East Liverpool, O., and entered into the wholesale and retail coal business, where he resided until September, 1902, when on the death of his wife he took up his home with his son, George H. Sharp, of Jonesville, Mich., where the declining years of his life was spent.
He was married in Shonecliff church county of Durham, England, October 7, 1844, to Elizabeth Woodward, from which union eight children were born five of whom survive as follows: Mrs. W. S. Maple, of Allegheny City, Pa.; Mrs. Jas. A. Watkins, Monessen, Pa.; Mrs. W. A. Rhodes, Waynesburg, O.; Jas. W. Sharp, of East Liverpool, and George H. Sharp, of Jonesville.
He joined the Masonic fraternity in the early sixties and had been an active member ever since.Back to Blog
SANTA CLARA, Calif., Sept.1, 2000 - Santa Clara University, for the 11th consecutive year, today was ranked second among all public and private regional universities in the West by U.S. News & World Report magazine.
In its annual ranking of the "Best Colleges" in the U.S. released today, the magazine gave the Catholic Jesuit university in Santa Clara an overall score that ranked it seventh among all 504 U.S. public and private regional universities - comprehensive universities that offer a range of undergraduate programs as well as master's degrees.
SCU had the highest average graduation rate - 81 percent - and the highest freshman retention rate - 91 percent - among all western regional universities. Its retention rate was the third highest in the entire country, and its graduation rate was the nation's 5th best among regional universities.
Nationally, the retention rate - the percent of freshmen who enroll in their sophomore years - is approximately 75 percent. The graduation rate is the percent of freshmen who complete their degree in six years.
For the 2000 fall term that begins Sept. 18, the Santa Clara University received 5,940 applicants for the approximately 1,000 undergraduate spots, the highest number of applicants ever.
In a new ranking this year of undergraduate business programs, US News ranked SCU's Leavey School of Business 57th (of 134 ranked), which was good enough for the No.3 spot among all California universities, behind the University of Southern California and UC/Berkeley, and for a Top 10 ranking among the 26 western undergraduate business programs ranked by the magazine. the 2000-2001 academic year.
Other Bay Area colleges also were ranked.
Among national universities - institutions that offer doctoral programs - Stanford University ranked sixth, University of California at Berkeley 20th, and the University of San Francisco was listed in the top 115.
Among the 112 public and private regional universities in the West, St. Mary's College of California was ranked ninth, and San Jose State University, while not in the top 25 among all schools, was ranked 9th among public regional universities in the West.
The magazine's rankings relied on: academic reputation, graduation rates, class size, retention of students, faculty resources, student selectivity, financial resources and alumni giving.
Texas was again included in the western region by the magazine, and Trinity University in Texas was again ranked first among regional universities in the West.

Cheyenne, Wy – Despite some opposition the Wyoming House of Representatives gave final approval to a bill that sets up a wildlife trust fund. The bill as it leaves the House puts 15 million dollars into the trust and only allows 200 thousand dollars to be spent in a year. Several spoke against the bill which prompted Cheyenne Representative Dan Zwonitzer to say the trust fund is a chance to be progressive and save wildlife.
Riverton Representative David Miller does not believe the bill helps wildlife as it puts more land in the hands of government.Should You Find Out Your Baby's Gender During an Ultrasound? Tina Fey and Tori Spelling Say No
Tori Spelling and Tina Fey are both sporting baby bumps these days, though both have said that they are not going to find out the gender ahead of time. Kate Hudson is just relying on an old superstition to tell her her baby’s gender.
I had to know what I was having. I didn’t find out until a month before my first was born that I was having a boy. With my other two, I had to know if I could use hand-me-downs, or if I was going to go shopping for pinks and purples!
But, some people choose to wait until the delivery room to find out if they are having a boy or a girl. Why?
Well, most say it’s the last big surprise. Others already have one of each, so they are prepared for either gender.
Really, babies give you enough surprises: the gender is hardly the last big surprise. And there isn’t that much gender neutral baby stuff out there.
Did you find out what you were having ahead of time?

10 Feb 2013 23:48 GMT | Politics, Africa, France, Tunisia
The secular party of Tunisian President Moncef Marzouki has withdrawn its three ministers from the country's government, saying that its demands for changes in the cabinet have not been met.
The decision on Sunday by Marzouki's Congress for the Republic Party deals a further blow to Prime Minister Hamadi Jebali's government, already weakened by last week's assassination of secular opposition leader Shokri Belaid.
"We have been saying for a week that if the foreign and justice ministers were not changed, we would withdraw from the government," Samir Ben Amor, a Congress for the Republic Party official, told the Reuters news agency.
"This decision has nothing to do with the prime minister's decision to form a government of technocrats," he said, referring to Jebali's declared intention to name a non-partisan cabinet to run day-to-day affairs until elections can be held.
Jebali has himself.
Jebali's terms
If the team was accepted by parties represented in the country's constituent assembly without being put to a vote, he would remain on as prime minister, Jebali said.
Moncef Marzouki, Tunisia's president, warns of forces that are intent on disrupting the country's peaceful movement to democracy
Otherwise, he said, he would resign.
Jebali first made the announcement on Wednesday, hours after the Belaid's assassination outside his home by an unknown assailant.
Ennahda rejected that idea soon afterwards..
"So will the prime minister convince Ennahda to back his proposal? It’s going to be extremely difficult for him to do that. If Ennahda refuses his offer, Tunisia will just plunge into further uncertainty."
Ennahda demonstration
Sunday's developments came a day after thousands of supporters of Ennahda demonstrated in Tunis.
The demonstrators chanted "The people still want Ennahda" and "The revolution continues" as they marched along the central Avenue Bourguiba on Saturday.
Some of the protesters shouted anti-French slogans.
The government has accused France of meddling over critical comments by Manuel Valls, French interior minister, who denounced the killing as an attack on "the values of Tunisia's Jasmine revolution".
"France get out!" and "The people want to protect the legitimacy" of the government were among slogans chanted by Ennahda long-time President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, close to the French embassy.
Ennahda had called supporters to gather in central Tunis to show support for the constitutional assembly, whose work on a new constitution suffered a severe setback when leftist parties withdrew their participation following the killing of Belaid.

The process is quite complicated, but my base layer was a deep, blood red nail color. Over that, I painted the crosses and skulls with a nail striper. Then I filled in any open gaps with a glittery blue nail polish. Voila!
Products used: KISS, Julep, and RevlonThe world of literary critical discourse is governed by one central imperative: to expound. Every point must be developed, every quote “parsed”, every nuance and inflection (whether of tone, dialect, or syntax) “unpacked” to find a maximum density of critical material. This is an industry that thrives on complexity, with the assumed premise that (usually) great works of literary art (though “greatness” or “privilege” are now much debated, and do not hold the currency they once did) are “complex organisms”, in need of a specialist’s expert appraisal. Whether it is a Deconstructionist or a Formalist reading, we can generally expect complex reactions and complex schematizations, and essential simplicity and simplistic reactions to be avoided like the plague.
How strange, then, to hear Paul Padgette make the following remark about Gertrude Stein’s Tender Buttons (TB) in the New York Review of Books: “You either get it or you don’t.” The breathtakingly blunt simplicity of this statement cuts right to the central critical crux that runs through the bulk of what has been written about TB; can it be criticized (as in, expounded upon) or can it not? Those that do engage in criticism of TB almost always do so within some contextual framework: Stein-as-Cubist, Stein-as-feminist, Stein-as-language manipulator. Others, like Padgette, are reduced by the extreme opacity of Stein’s text to a bare assertion that the text is too hermetic to be “parsed” in the normal way. It is interesting to note that the “dissidents” (as opposed to the “contextualists”) are often great fans of TB (as Padgette is), but evidently believe that the work either holds some “ineffable essence” or else must be read, first-hand, to be appreciated. That Stein’s fans (literary critics, no less), would lobby against critical discourse is a tribute both to the power and the singularity of her work.
The contextualists have a problem, too. Because TB is determinedly non-referential, any attempt at contextualization must also be rooted in an acknowledgment that the work is beyond a single contextual interpretation. As Christopher Knight noted in a 1991 article, “One can locate it in the long history of nonsense literature…in the French Cubist movement…in the Anglo-American tradition of literary modernism…and in that relatively new artistic order— the post-modern.” What is so baffling to literary critics is that, more often than not, one cannot “turn to the text” in order to verify these kinds of assertions. TB’s sense (or non-sense) is determined largely by who happens to be reading it; it is extreme enough to stymie but not as extreme as, say, Finnegan’s Wake, which by general consensus need only be touched by Joyce specialists. Simply put, there is enough sense in TB to make an attempt at locating it, but not enough so that any stated “location” could be feasible to large numbers of critics or readers. Thus, to this day, the pattern holds; dissidents argue against interpretation (and for first-hand experience), contextualists argue (with foreknowledge of “defeat”, in the sense that no contextual argument about TB in almost a century has seemed to “stick”) for a specialized interpretation. As Christopher Knight concludes, TB “embodies all…traditions even as it can be said never to be completely defined by any of them”.
The most influential writing about TB seeks to straddle the line between dissension and contextualization. Richard Bridgman’s Gertrude Stein In Pieces, more frequently cited than most Stein critical tomes, adopts something of a centrist stance. Bridgman makes clear that the ineffable quality of TB is not lost to him; the book is “all but impossible to transform adequately into normal exposition”(127) and “unusually resistant to interpretation”(125). Bridgman’s use of the word “transform” in this context is very relevant. Just as Stein’s language experiments transform conventional vernacular usage, so “normal exposition” would have to transform Stein’s language back into something resembling a normal vernacular. Bridgman’s work also points out the central critical dilemma surrounding TB; it is “all but impossible” to expound upon, but the “ineffable essence” that makes it so compelling also becomes a goad to try and expound nonetheless. “Adequately” also points to the manner in which TB turns literary critics back on themselves; critics are forced to confront the limitations of their own methodologies, criticize themselves and their own competence. Stein makes critics feel “inadequate”, and it seems likely that, were she here to see the bulk of TB criticism, this would have pleased her.

Of those brave enough to “jump into the ring” with Stein, none does so with more panache than Marjorie Perloff. Perloff’s attack on the “locked semantic gates” of TB is multi-tiered and determinedly contextual. In “Of Objects and Readymades: Gertrude Stein and Marcel Duchamp”, Perloff posits a space for Stein’s experiment alongside Dada-ists Duchamp and Jean Arp, while also granting its unique nature and inscrutable texture. Though this texture seems interpretation-proof, when Stein, for instance, talks about a carafe (“A kind in glass and a cousin, a spectacle and nothing strange…”(3)), Perloff claims that “Stein’s verbal dissection(s) give us the very essence of what we might call carafe-ness.” For Perloff, Stein is not talking “around” objects, but using language to “dissect” them, in much the same way that Picasso and Braque dissected objects, using Cubist techniques to put them back together. Or, in the same manner Arp and Duchamp “dissected” the nature of works of art by presenting “readymades”.
It would seem that Perloff’s use of the word “dissection” would make a Cubist analogy more apropos than a Dada one. TB, however, is so much like a Rorschach blot that almost anything can be made to “fit”, and the more perceptive contextualiats, like Bridgman, realize this and foreground their assertions with a central disavowal. Perloff goes on to say, “to use words responsibly, Stein implies, is to become aware that no two words, no two morphemes or phonemes for that matter, are ever exactly the same.” It could be stated, without too much hyperbole, that a discussion of literary “responsibility”, as regards TB, is an extreme stretch. This leads to the major problem contextualists have in dealing with TB; no two of them seem able to agree about even the most general framework. Thus, reading contextual criticism about TB is like looking at snowflakes; no two contextual critics say the same thing, which makes “grouping” a problem and talking of a “majority” an impossibility.
Perloff saves her most provocative card for last; she says, “long before Derrida defined difference as both difference and deferral of meaning, Stein had expressed this profound recognition.” This is a plausible interpretation, and it would seem likely that others might come to similar conclusions. However, this is not the case. Virgil Thomson takes the more centrist tack that “if (Stein’s) simplifications occasionally approached incomprehensibility, this aim was less urgent…than opening up reality…for getting an inside view.” Between Thomson and Perloff, we get opposite ends of the contextualist stance, as presented in criticism. From Perloff, we get definite, authoritatively presented analogies (Duchamp, Arp, Derrida) that seek to situate Stein and her work in a specific literary and aesthetic context. In fact, Perloff’s approach is both more definite and more authoritative than the vast majority of approaches that have been made to TB. From Thomson, we get a very anti-authoritative sentiment, which leans towards an abject-seeming generality; Thomson talks of getting an “inside view” of reality, but he cannot commit to a single or singular definition of what this reality is. He does not join in with the dissidents who argue against critical interpretation and/or the ineffable quality of this text, and in fact somewhat boldly claims to surmise Stein’s “aim”; yet, though the “why” is accounted for in his interpretation, the “what” is lightly brushed aside in a platitude. Considering that Thomson is writing, like Paul Padgette, in the prestigious New York Review of Books, it is remarkable that a platitudinous statement in this context seems par for the course. Few knew what to do with Stein and her work during her lifetime; it appears that little has changed.

BizReport : out from Janrain password fatigue is on the rise among online shoppers.
For retailers, requiring logins so that a website visit can be more personalized and potentially result in higher purchase totals, is a good thing. For the shoppers, however, the need to remember passwords and logins for a number of different sites is taking away from the shopping experience - even though many do like the personalized aspects allowed by the logins.
Social login is one solution. It allows shoppers to use their existing logins from Facebook, Twitter and other sites rather than creating a new login for each retail site visited. The problem? Not all retailers offer this option.
According to the Janrain study:
• 92% of shoppers have abandoned a website rather than recover lost login information
• 4 in 5 say they offer 'bad' information when creating a login for a retail site
• 67% of shoppers like website personalization
• 65% of shoppers are more likely to revisit a site using social login; 52% are already using social logins

When Keeping It Real Goes All Wrong: 10 Reasons Rap Artists Die Broke!
Comedian Dave Chappelle was famous for his wicked timing, uncanny humor and delivery of numerous jokes and skits during his three year run with a hot tv show.
One infamous skit was the “When Keeping It Real Goes All Wrong!” segment. In these classics portrayals, some ignorant person was always seen as “Keepin’ It Real” and “Aint nobody gonna chump me,” boasting to only loose it all in the end.
Well, the rap industry is no different.
From (as they would boast) blunts and broads, to ménage a’ trois, the average rapper or wanna-be rapper, puts his being cool or keepin’ it real before being paid.
They usually fail to realize that the Bentleys, blunts and broads, and bling bling, cost green-green, i.e., dollars and Benjamins.
I fight with clients all the time in their wanting to have bling-bling rims and teeth rather than keeping the bling-bling in the bank and a retirement fund.
I have advised or worked with the likes of Afrika Bambatta, Kurtis Blow, DMX and Rakim on a few matters. These guys seem to get it and understand the history of Hip Hop and what it originally stood for back in the day.
But, they will tell you they have struggled with the meaning of this new generation and how they handle bizness.
Not long ago, in a NY Times interview, Jay-Z truthfully shared that there are only 10 guys in the rap game making real money.
If you listen carefully, and examine the rap game, most are broke and fronting.
Many will ask you if they can borrow your house or phat ride for an appearance on MTV’s Cribs. Or for use in a music video.
With that being said, here are the 10 Simple Reasons Rap Artists Die Broke:

And Seattles defense isn't the reason Wilson played good....its the fact that he actually IS good. And the "people just remembers the end of the year which is why they are high on Wilson" is definietly a 49ers fan comment....winning 9 straight to make the playoffs doesn't really count as "the end of the year" when its more than half of the season...Wilson in the long run will be by far the best of the 3 QBs.

Technical Abstract:
The response of semiarid grasslands to small, non-colonial herbivores has received little attention, focusing primarily on the effects of granivore assemblages on annual plant communities. We studied the long-term effects of small and large herbivores on vegetation structure and species diversity of shortgrass steppe, a perennial semiarid grassland with a long evolutionary history of grazing by large herbivores, but considered marginal habitat for small mammalian herbivores. We hypothesized that 1) small herbivores would affect less common species through selective but limited consumption, 2) large generalist herbivores would affect more abundant species and proportions of litter-bare ground-vegetative components of the general structure through non-selective herbivory, 3) herbivore effects on plant richness increase with increasing aboveground net primary production (ANPP) because rare species would be more abundant in wet years. Plant community composition was assessed over a 14-year period in pastures grazed at moderate intensities by cattle and in exclosures for large (cattle) and large- plus-small herbivores (additional exclusion of rabbits and rodents). Exclusion of large herbivores affected litter and bare ground and basal cover of abundant, common, and rare species. Additional exclusion of small herbivores, did not affect rare components of the plant community, but had indirect effects on abundant species, decreased the cover of the dominant grass Bouteloua gracilis and total vegetation, and increased litter and species diversity. There was no relationship between ANPP and the intensity of effects of either herbivore type on richness. Exclusion of herbivores of two different body-sizes had primarily complementary and additive effects which promoted changes in vegetation composition and physiognomy that were linked to increased abundance of tall and decreased abundance of short species. Both herbivores promoted recovery of short grasses after intense droughts, providing resilience to the shortgrass steppe and contributing to the long-term maintenance of basal cover of total vegetation. Our finding shows that small mammalian herbivores had disproportionately large effects on plant communities relative to their small consumption of biomass. Even in perennial grasslands with a long history of intensive grazing by large herbivores, non-colonial small mammalian herbivores should be recognized as an important driver of grassland structure and diversity.Conflict Resolution
[edit] Suggestions for members of the greater Noisebridge community who are having problematic interactions in or relating to Noisebridge
[edit] Personal Confrontation:
Is someone bothering you? Talk to them about it -- and be excellent while doing so.
This is a pretty important step, and it usually has the desired effect. It should not be skipped if at all possible.
[edit] Get Support:
Did that not work? Or are you afraid to approach the other person? Ask someone else around the space who you like and/or trust. Maybe they can come along with you to talk to them, or talk to them as your proxy.
[edit].
[edit] calm one-on-one talks, and almost all of the rest can be solved by a series of mediated discussions. If mediation is unsuccessful, or if what is going on appears to be part of a larger pattern, the mediator may suggest that you bring your problem to a Safe Space Working Group for discussion.
[edit] Advocate:
Discussing personal conflicts at the larger group level is not really considered all that excellent. On the other hand, a small supportive group environment more specifically committed to calm discussion and de-escalation can help defuse a problematic situation. If the parties involved cannot reach a resolution by talking with each other, or with the help of a mediator, the mediator can suggest calling a meeting of the Safe Space Working Group to involve other community members to help resolve the conflict. If you try to follow these suggestions, that would be totally excellent.
Before a problem with an individual is brought to the level of calling a meeting of the Safe Space Working Group, someone must step forward to act as an advocate for the individual, even if that individual happens to be widely disliked. It is all too easy for conflict to make people act in ways that they later regret. There are sufficient people around the Space who are willing to act as advocates at the group level (see list of mediator volunteers on the Mediation wiki page).
[edit] Reporting Misbehavior
If you wish to report harassment anonymously or privately, you can send a message to secretary@noisebridge.net (or contact one of the people who have volunteered as a mediator on the Mediation page.)Media

However, we can find reasons to be thankful, and chief among these is that, whenever such events happen, there are those among us who rise to the occasion and set their fears, even concerns for personal safety, aside to help their neighbors.Most notable among these is Kentucky State Police Trooper Rick Conn. A resident of Rolling Acres, Conn was driving by when he was injured by the blast. Despite this, he still found the strength to escape his vehicle and go to the aid of a mother trying to flee the flames with her child. Only after the mother and child were safe did Conn collapse from his own injuries.Words are woefully inadequate to describe such sacrifice, or to express the admiration an entire community feels for Conn because of his actions. It is easy to label Conn a hero, only to feel the term inappropriate because of its overuse on so many other occasions.But while Conn's actions are certainly the most striking, there were others who rose to the challenge Monday presented and proved their mettle in the face of adversity. We think of the emergency workers, the police and firefighters who rushed to the scene of this hellish inferno and delivered what assistance was possible. We also think of the doctors and other hospital personnel who even now are treating the wounded and saving lives. Finally, we think of the relief agencies that did not waste a minute before offering their services to help the victims overcome their loss.If asked, all of these people would probably say they were just doing their jobs. The rest of us are glad they are there to do them.Yes, it is shocking, and deeply troubling, to be reminded of the fragility of life, of how an otherwise ho-hum Monday morning can be ripped apart in an instant by forces unseen and unexpected.But there is also comfort in the knowledge that when such tragedy does occur, help is not too far away.- The Floyd County TimesVeterans Affairs Secretary

Sometimes I would get praise for doing something good and other times I would get punished for, say not returning home before curfew. But what is the best way of raising your child? Diana Baumrind's work has led us to establish three main classes of parenting styles: Permissive, authoritarian and authoritative. Permissive parents are the softies. Their children have a great deal of freedom, hardly and punishment, and a great deal of affection. Authoritarian parents are the "mean" ones. They are very strict and tend to show little affection. Authoritative parents are the best! They set a happy median between the two styles and usually lead their children through a very happy and stable life.
Another category of parenting is uninvolved where parents tend to totally neglect their children's positive or negative behaviors. None the less parenting is a very difficult concept and can be a very hard challenge. Many generations have shaped these styles but it is up to the individual in what to do. So how do you think parents should raise their children? Should it be different in different circumstances or just universal for everyone? There are many parenting books out there today but only real-life experience enlightens the best parenting.
I think if parents took the mindset that parenting needs to be done in order to teach their children how to be productive and pleasant members of society, our world would be better off. Parents need to only be strict and punish their children when they are actually doing something wrong, not when they are doing something that the parent necessarily doesn't want them to do. For instance, my mother used to get upset sometimes when I would practice drums at "inconvenient" times for her. I would never get upset with a child for doing something creative and healthy for their development, even if it's inconvenient for me. I will either ask them to stop for a few minutes or I would go somewhere else. I guess that is a more authoritative approach.PORTFOLIO (2)

Cardiff Blues (13) 18 Try: Robinson, Lewis Pens: Blair (2) Cons: Blair
Munster kept their 100% record in this year's Heineken Cup by holding off gritty Cardiff Blues in Limerick.
Two Denis Leamy tries helped Munster lead 14-3 after 19 minutes but Jamie Robinson's breakaway try cut the Irish side's lead to 20-13 at the interval.
Barry Murphy's try extended Munster's advantage but Mark Lewis replied with a Cardiff touchdown and Robinson then should have notched another Blues try.
Munster regained control and Alan Quinlan's try ensured the bonus point.
Blair's early penalty put Cardiff ahead but Munster responded emphatically with Leamy barging his way past a weak Nick MacLeod tackle to score the game's opening try in the seventh minute.
Munster had already showed their intent by turning down a couple of straightforward penalty chances, instead opting to turn the screw on the Cardiff defence.
Blair missed a great chance to cut Munster's lead to a point in the 18th minute and things got worse for Cardiff when Peter Stringer's quick thinking set up Leamy's second try moments later.
Seeing Leamy pleading for the ball, Stringer took a line-out throw on the edge of the Blues 22 and the number eight charged over for an opportunistic try.
Blair and O'Gara then swapped penalties to leave Munster in firm control at 17-6 ahead.
However, completely against the run of play, Cardiff got back into the game when Barry Murphy's wayward midfield pass enabled Jamie Robinson to claim a breakaway try just before half-time.
Blair's conversion cut Munster's lead to 17-13 but O'Gara had time to add another penalty in first-half injury-time after Martyn Williams had been sin-binned for killing the ball in a ruck.
Murphy atoned for his mistake by scoring Munster's third try on 48 minutes after Stringer had disrupted the Cardiff scrum in the Welsh team's 22.
However, Cardiff's superb defence kept them in the contest and they showed attacking potency of their own when Martyn Williams' looping pass set up a try for replacement Mark Lewis which cut Munster's lead to 25-18.
After Blair had missed the conversion, Jamie Robinson squandered a glorious chance to put Munster under real pressure by knocking on in midfield when a third Cardiff try looked certain following a superb Martyn Williams break.
Munster played the final 10 minutes in Cardiff territory but the bonus-point try wasn't secured until the final play of the game when a 10-man drive saw Quinlan barging his way over the line.

Referee: Joel Jutge (France).There’s a key line of dialogue towards the beginning of Hunted: The Demon’s Forge, a pivotal point in the game’s opening hour. Big sweaty bald man Caddoc and foxy Elf chum E’lara are strolling through a ruined temple one morning when they’re accosted by an enormous pair of spectral bosoms.
“Hi you guys, I’m Seraphine,” husks the enormous pair of spectral bosoms, not in precisely those words. “See that funny green crystal on the plinth with the skeleton slumped against it? That’s a deathstone, and it can bring you unimaginable riches and power. Why don’t you pick it up?”
Our heroes glance at each other. “But it’s a deathstone,” ventures Caddoc, after a pause. “Next to a dead body.”
Erik Wolpaw could have done more with the material, but I chuckle nonetheless, and that chuckle says a lot. To be precise, it says: “Thank the gods. Hunted: The Demon’s Forge may be a game where sultry waifs who have trouble seeing their own belly buttons foist ominously-named artefacts on passers-by. It may be a game with runes and loincloths and monsters that look like wrestlers draped in radioactive Pot Noodle.
“And it may be a game where the man speaks Cockney because dude, that’s way manlier than regular English, while the woman talks posh because mate, everybody knows that elves are posh. But it retains just enough wit and insight to realise how truly ludicrous all this truly, truly is.”
When VGD spoke to InXile Entertainment president Matt Findley last March about the Californian studio’s new action role-player, he was careful to distinguish between Hunted’s “dark fantasy” and the so-called “high fantasy” of games like Baldur’s Gate. The difference will probably be lost on those to whom one set of pointy ears or hats is much like another, and when Findley splits hairs during our hands-on months later, observing that Hunted is towards the “darker end” of dark fantasy, we’re tempted to roll our eyes and suggest he turn the gamma up.
Actually, InXile is quite right to labour the point. High fantasy is magisterial, severe in its parsing of lore, humourless. But dark fantasy – dark fantasy can afford to crack jokes, and therein lies its redeeming value. Zooming in on the grubbily amoral and ingloriously violent aspects of fantasy’s founding myths creates a marvellous potential for absurdity. Take Hunted’s serial mistreatment of non-player characters – beloved of RPGs like Dragon Age, they’re lucky to last a minute here before the hammer comes down.
At one point in our session, for instance, an imposing bloke in a horned helmet instructs Caddoc and E’lara to commandeer an Orc – sorry, a Wargar catapult before it wipes the town of Dyfed off the map. He then follows the pair into the main square and dutifully walks under a falling house, expiring in a puff of dispersing organs.
Caddoc and E’lara are a good fit for such brutally unfeeling comedy: they’re mercenaries, wandering Hunted’s sumptuously arrayed world with no higher aim than making money, and when Seraphine’s dad, the grotesquely obese mayor of Dyfed, proposes that they scour the catacombs for the source of the Wargar threat, haggling quickly commences. By this stage Caddoc and E’lara have already (secretly) agreed to collect magical crystals for Seraphine herself, trading them for new abilities and magic by interacting with the wisps of unearthly light that dot the path ahead.
Hunted may look like a meat-grinder, a ham-fisted experience-cruncher in the old dungeoneering tradition, but the level structure is redolent of latter-day third-person action titles like Gears of War – a cinematic corridor where sword-fights and brain-ticklers jostle for a share of your attention. Nor does it suffer from the comparison – indeed, there are things Epic’s designers could learn from this game, like how to make room for exploration without losing your thread.
Entering Dyfed’s lower levels, Caddoc and E’lara encounter an enchanted door shaped like an enormous stone head, which hints at the legendary door-opening properties of a certain blue flame. A single side-passage soon leads us to the phenomenon in question, but it also takes us past a secondary objective – a tomb packed with tasty mythical weapons, unlocked on production of four mystic runes.
Pushing a little further down the passage, which eventually loops round to the talking door, we find the runes tucked into crevices and alcoves (along the way, Caddoc narrowly escapes being eaten by a giant spider in a solitary burst of QTE mashing). Back at the tomb, there’s a skeletal warrior to duff up before swiping the prize.
Next to such gentle triumphs of arrangement and pacing, the combat can feel a little crude. The shoulder cam shooting seems ill-advisedly prominent for a game set in Ye Olden Days – however buffed, double-buffed or laden with spiky bits, bows and crossbows can’t rival the impact and, well, the bass of gunpowder weaponry. The two-button melee system meanwhile is badly in need of a lock-on of some sort, or failing that a strafe modifier – I’d often find myself turning my back on a foe when I meant to circle him, shield raised against his blows.
That’s thinking about the mechanics in isolation from the co-op functionality, though, on which much of Hunted’s entertainment value is predicated. Caddoc and E’lara skew towards hand-to-hand and ranged combat respectively – her primary weapons are longbows, while he favours cleavers and maces – and set pieces draw out each character’s strengths in simple but successful ways.
There’s a boss battle at the close of our demo, for instance, which kicks off as a cover shoot-out, E’lara stuffing wall-top goons full of exploding purple arrows while Caddoc does his best to look threatening with a bog-standard crossbow. Eventually the Wargar mage at the heart of it all throws a tantrum, descends to ground level and starts teleporting around the arena, tossing fireballs. The balance between partners thus shifts – Caddoc wrecking faces, E’lara reacquainting herself with the beauties of the evasive roll.
If one character is downed, the other has a few seconds to revive him or her by tossing a resurrection vial. Last year, we feared that letting players patch each other’s wounds from afar would take the risk out of splitting up, but in practice, having to face a needy comrade and hit B button during a brawl is engagingly hazardous. Only a handful of healing and resurrection potions can be carried around at once, visible on the character models themselves in a Dead-Spacey twist. All told, anybody worried that InXile has taken the easy way out with co-op should quit their wittering.
Besides the old revival juice, the glue holding Caddoc and E’lara together is magic. Lightning bolts and tornadoes have obvious applications, but you can also use them to power up or “battle-charge” your partner, which is probably a good way to forge lasting relationships online. Elemental spells also facilitate tag-team moves, because nothing says “let’s go for a pint afterwards” like turning somebody to ice so your mate can shatter them with a hammer.
Co-op is available in online and splitscreen flavours. Apparently there's a level creator waiting in the wings, too.
Actually, Hunted’s handling of spells tells you a lot about the game as a whole – about its blend of cleverness and stupidity, of cliche, meathead action, black irony and elegance. Fireballs are the “default pistol” in a wizard’s arsenal, but the ones you’ll call on here behave just a little differently – they roll like grenades, and require a touch more finesse of the player than is usual.
And when you’re working in genre fantasy, and attracting comparisons with the likes of Gears of War, those little flashes of individuality are crucial. Hunted won a few headlines last year by promising to “bring back” the classic dungeon-crawler, but we’re more excited, in the end, by how InXile has brought it forward.
Hunted: The Demon’s Forge is out on 1st June in the UK and 3rd June in the US.
Just so you know, in the final sentence you incorrectly label the game “Hunted: The Demon’s Soul,” instead of “Demon’s Forge.”

Recital is First New York Performance for Canary Island Ensemble
New York, March 20, 2009.—The Teobaldo Power String Quartet received a vibrant, warm, and enthusiastic response from the audience in its first New York concert, which was held in The Great Hall of Shepard Hall at The City College of New York (CCNY). The quartet, which is based in the Canary Islands and was formed more than a decade ago, consists of Javier Morales López and Irina Sánchez, violinists, Patrick Doumeng, viola, and Johanna Kegel Zamora, cellist. The New York concert was the first stop on a global tour that would also take the group to Beijing and Tokyo.
The concert was co-sponsored by the Septennium initiative of the Viceconsejería de Cultura of the Government of the Canary Islands, the CUNY Dominican Studies Institute and the City College Department of Music. Among those present were the Viceconsejero de Cultura of the Canarian Government, Mr. Alberto Delgado, and Korstiaan Kegel, representative of the Septennium Program, a Canary Islands initiative to promote science and culture.
Also attending were: Dr. Hugo Morales, a member of the CUNY Board of Trustees; Dr. Alexandra Logue, CUNY Interim Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs; Eduardo Selman, Dominican General Consul in New York City, Professor Stephen Jablonsky, Chair of CCNY’s Music Department, and Professor Ramona Hernández, Director of the CUNY Dominican Studies Institute.
The concert featured performances by Canarian composers Enrique Guimerá Corbella, Luis Cobiella Cueva, Dori Díaz Jerez, José Brito, Juan M. Marrero, and Teobaldo Power. The repertoire was new to the audience, which got to experience a very diverse sample of chamber music by Canarian composers.
In her welcoming remarks for the recital, Professor Hernández highlighted the historical and cultural links between the Canarian and the Dominican peoples. She noted that it is a history still largely untold.
The Canary Islands were the last place in the Old World Christopher Columbus stopped before arriving on La Española, now the Dominican Republic and Haiti. In addition, settlers and technicians from the Canary Islands helped launch the sugar industry on La Española in the 16th Century. The flow of immigrants from the Canary Island to Santo Domingo continued into the 18th Century, and many Dominicans today are direct descendants of Canarians.
Mr. Delgado, the Viceconsejero de Cultura, talked about the very special meaning of the event, referring to it as an expression of the Canarian culture to the rest of the world, and also as a gesture of Canarian reciprocity with Hispanic American countries like Venezuela, Uruguay, the Dominican Republic and Cuba, which in the past had received Canarian immigrants.
About SEPTENNIUM
In 2008, the Canary Islands Government launched a new plan of action that will be a decisive move in favor of the main sectors linked to innovation: Science and Culture. Over seven years up to 2014, projects and activities from these areas of knowledge will be given special backing making a difference so that the Canaries achieve a position of eminence in these areas on the international scene. Septennium is therefore a special effort by the Government over a certain period of time, backing up Culture, Science and Innovation as strategic sectors. Support for the ‘Teobaldo Power String Quartet’ of The Canary Islands is part of this initiative. For additional information, visit..

posted by Matt Ward on Sep 20, 2011.
The emergence of responsive design is changing the way that many people think about web design. In this article, we will look at what this might mean for the future and consider the possibility that it is finally time start moving beyond the division of the mobile web and start thinking of a unified and device-independent web.
So here we are, well into the second half of 2011. Some might even say we are in the home stretch, already looking toward what 2012 will have to offer. In this moment, it seems that everywhere you turn somebody is writing about responsive web design. Several days ago, Andy Clarke even went so far as to tweet
From now on, if it’s not responsive, it’s not web design.
Now, I don’t particularly agree with this all-encompassing statement, and in a previous article I discussed some of the potential caveats and pitfalls of responsive design. That being said, however, this responsive movement strikes me as being more than just another tool in the toolbox. Statements like Andy’s plainly suggest an entire paradigm shift within the community (or at least part of the community).
For those who adopt it, responsive design doesn’t just change the way we create websites, it changes the way with think about creating websites. That’s pretty revolutionary.
Instead of creating a “normal” site and a “mobile” site, we are now looking at the possibility of creating a single site that “responds” to its context and offers up different layouts, based on the amount of pixel space that is available. Exactly how we do this is still up for debate in some areas. Yes, media queries are going to be part of the solution, but there are still all kinds of questions surrounding other elements, such as images and advertising.
Still, by all indications, the responsive movement is here to stay, and I cannot help but wonder if its arrival means that we can finally start moving beyond the concept of the mobile web.
It’s A Flawed Term Anyhow
I’ll confess: I’ve never really liked the term “mobile” anyhow. It just seems semantically wrong to me. In my somewhat literal mind, my iPhone is not mobile at all..
And so, by this definition, my iPhone is not a mobile phone at all. It’s a cellular phone, which connects to other devices through a wireless network. The only thing mobile about the entire situation is me and my ability to carry the phone from location to location.
Of course, I recognize that I am arguing—probably very much in vain—in the face of the established vernacular. People have been calling their cell phones “mobile” for years now and I have no expectations that my little rant here will do anything to change that. In fact, one of the largest providers of cellular telephone services in Canada is actually called Bell Mobility.
So, when it comes to how we talk about our phones, there is little chance that we will actually get away from the term itself.
But that doesn’t mean we still need to maintain this fragmented sense that somehow the “mobile” web is a disconnected or separate entity from the “normal” or “desktop” web (which is just as problematic of a term).
Looking at Behaviours
At first glance, there seems to be an initial assumption that, if people are using their handheld devices to access the web, they must be doing so “on the go”. Maybe this means riding the city bus, or taking a cab ride through downtown New York (I hear that’s an adventure). From a certain perspective it does make sense; these devices allow us to bring the web to places it could never have gone before. If we accept this assumption as truth, it is easy to infer that people who are accessing our sites via these devices will be in a rush, simply because of where they are (or where they are passing through). This, in turn, can lead to assumptions about how content should be designed.
Yet, more and more, I am reading about research indicating that a large percentage of “mobile” internet usage is actually happening in the home, rather than out there in the oh-so-busy world. One article states that the percentage may be as high as 43%. This amounts to almost half of the total usage and, based on my own behaviors, makes total sense to me.
I use my iPhone at home all the time. I might be downstairs in our basement watching TV, and come across something that I want to look up. Or, I might suddenly remember I need to send and email or check the some stats of some sort (traffic or MLB standings, for instance). If my Mac is up on my desk and my iPad upon my nightstand (or, more likely, in the hands of my daughter), I’ll just whip out the iPhone and search for the desired information that way.
The interesting thing to note is that these actions are based on exactly the same motives that might have driven me to my laptop or desktop a few years ago. Today, I simply have to convenience of being able to carry the internet with me wherever I go (or at least wherever my 3G network will allow me to connect). Is there a difference in context? Absolutely. But, it’s more about the device than it is about my intentions, and any assumption that I am in a hurry when I am lounging on my couch is likely to be fundamentally inaccurate.
I just want to get the information I’m looking for.
Mobile First?
Of course, the logical extension of designing as though users are in a hurry is not necessarily a bad thing, and has been one of the fundamental principles of good usability for years. Even before the explosion of web-ready cellular devices, I seem to remember most UX pundits preaching that the fewer obstacles you put between your user and the content they are looking for, the more usable your site will be and, by extension, the more enjoyable the experience will be for the user.
As far as i can tell, that hasn’t changed.
It just seems that a number of factors have brought it to (back) to prevalence. The first is this assumption that users surfing on a handheld device are in much more of a hurry than users surfing on a desktop or laptop; we assume that they need information faster. In response, we start to cut out all the fluff (widgets) that have filled our sites for so many years, leaving us with optimized “mobile” sites that are leaner and more efficient than their desktop counterparts.
Of course, we’re thinking of the user first here. Right? It has nothing to do with that other factor called screen space. Because, as Luke Wroblewski has rightly pointed out:
There simply isn’t room in a 320 by 480 pixel screen for extraneous, unnecessary elements. You have to prioritize.
Suddenly, we don’t have room for all that extra content. We can’t cram an entire brochure’s worth of material (which probably too much even for a brochure) above the “fold”. Advertising banners or Google Adwords just take up too much valuable visual real-estate and either need to be relegated further down the page or removed entirely. As Luke points out, we suddenly need to prioritize, and if we have any common sense at all, that priority needs to be the content.
In ruthless, butcher-shop fashion, we cut away all the extra fat and produce simple sites where content is allowed to shine. In fact, we produce the type of sites that we should have been creating all along, regardless of the device they are being viewed on.
And, at least as I understand it, that is the reason (or at least one of the reasons) that Luke Wroblewski preaches his concept of mobile first with such fervor. It takes us back to the basics and helps eliminate much of what the calls the ”interface debris that litter today’s desktop accessed Web sites.”
Interestingly, however, if we dig to the core of this argument, we find that its not about division, but cohesion. The beauty of the so-called “mobile” design is that its fundamental constraints naturally lead to a better user experience on handheld devices (or at least handheld devices that offer a modern browsing experience). But the idea shouldn’t stop there. Instead, it should flow over into the entire site, placing the focus on content and usability in all contexts, not just for the smaller screens of our handheld devices.
The New Boston Globe
As a case in point, let’s look at the Boston Globe as an example. If you haven’t heard about its recent redesign, you clearly don’t spend much time on Twitter. Regardless, since it’s launch, news of this redesign has been plastered all over the design circles, mostly with a reasonably positive reception.
Setting the subscription-for-content model aside, the site overcomes a number of the issues that face many news-based sites these days (see this installment of The Brads for plentiful examples). It has a clean, elegant design that places the emphasis directly on the content. Lovely typography makes reading a real joy.
More significantly for our purposes, however, is the fact that these statements remain true on my iPhone, my iPad, my MacBook, and even on IE8 on my Vista-powered home PC. The site doesn’t try to distinguish between “mobile” and “desktop” users. Nor does it appear to make any glaring assumptions about behaviour in these areas. It is simply designed to respond to the space allocated for display, and to do so in such a way as to provide optimum readability and usability.
In my mind, this is the way of the future. It’s not about a “mobile“ web that stands in direct contrast to a “desktop“ web. Instead, its about a single, flexible and meticulously crafted web that provides rich user experiences across a wide range of different devices.Post A Comment

Daquan Wright says:
I too think emphasis should be put off mobile, and instead “adaptable.”
The web is a fluid and open platform, and accessibly by a myriad of devices. It only makes sense that a site be accessible across platforms, regardless of the technique. Certainly not just taking a website optimized for desktop, and letting it adjust to only mobile platforms. TVs are also becoming intertwined with the web.

Steven says:
I’m another for adding the term ‘Desktop’ to this too. Those ‘desktop version’ links on mobile sites … yuck. Sadly, I use both ‘mobile’ and ‘desktop’ terms because they are convention.
Using these terms isn’t ideal, but just like placing navigation at the start of html documents, some things clearly aren’t ideal but because the people who are to use them get comfortable with conventions, it can be counter-productive to fix afterwards.
As Climax Media suggests … a website is a website. However, people in the industry want to make money and ultimately most of us designers and developers are put in a position where we need to provide what the end-user expects. Hence why we have therse topics to vent our views on in the first place. So, is that so bad?
I’ve recently began to think that alot of what is hypethetically correct about an open, semantic and accessible internet, is also actually flawed in it’s implementation (and I know I am not the only one who knows it). Yet, like before this mobile boom, the world can still move on and we still have jobs regardless of what things are wrong with it. So maybe there is a more positive way to channel our passion? Perhaps we just need to adopt mobile and desktop convention (being that it is expected) and use it as best as we can.

Ecatherina Khetagurova says:
In no way belittling the importance of adaptive web design to properly display web pages on monitors with higher resolution is enough, I absolutely do not agree with the desire to use it instead of mobile design.
There is hardly a lot of people using mobile internet for a long surfing, reading many articles, study a lot of additional information provided by the sites. Even when you consider that people do not go to the Internet in the literal sense on the move, the vast majority of mobile Internet users looking for specific information on what is called here and now.
Most often, users of mobile internet urgent need to order a product or service, to read a specific article, to explore opinions about the work of a company, etc. I doubt that in this case the user will enjoy for a long time to get to the information you need.
Imagine that you need to buy some books to study. Would you ask the seller a bookstore in detail retell the content of all books on the subject or start to read the entire literature in a row just standing at the counter before you buy it? No, you’re curious by brief announcements of your books you will find reviews about them, can be run through the eyes introduction to the book.
The same behavior applies to the mobile internet users. Therefore, the mobile site should be a kind of announcement, a presentation of a large site. Mobile site should contain only the most basic information that is of paramount importance to the user.Mobile internet is valued for its speed and ease of finding relevant information.
A unified web page is deprived of a large amount of content. He suffers from a site owner who loses income from advertising. Suffers from the user PC, who can not get the usual amount of information without scrolling web page. He suffers from mobile Internet users, unable to quickly get access to basic information. Everyone suffers.
One more thing. Admirers of adaptive web design is clearly discounting the fact that most users of mobile Internet – it’s not the owners of iPad, and those people who are holding a mobile device with a screen resolution 328h480 px and even 240h320px

Sorry to be pedantic, but no. The word you’re looking for is MOTILE, not mobile. Mobile means it can be moved (or carried). The term motile, used mainly in biology, describes an entity that can move under its own power or volition.
Come to think of it s motile phone would be a rather cool thing to have, like the little chappie in the Carphone Warehouse adverts. Or an astromech.
Oct 28, 2011
Matt Ward says:
Interesting observation, Andrew. My understanding of motility is that it is primarily a biological mechanism, and since we are talking about a nob-biological entity here, does it still apply?

Problem is, with Israeli mobile-websites at least, instead of just creating one long page, maintaining design, and keeping it just like the regular website, they stretch each article over 4-5 pages and its not easy to read that way, thats a point of improvement, I hope it is not like that in English websites.

- "Humph! Very important people should really be picked up by a splendid red engine like me! Fancy choosing little Thomas!"

The New Station is a magazine story.
Plot
Thomas is very pleased; he's been given the job of collecting some very important people to open a new station on his branch line. James is annoyed as he thinks a shiny red engine like himself should get the job of collecting the important people.
Later, Thomas puffed to the harbour with Annie and Clarabel where the very important people climbed aboard. On his way to the new station, Thomas approached a bend in the line. Rather oddly, the signal was red. The driver climbed down and ran ahead to see what the trouble was. He came back and told he Fat Controller happy again and the opening party begins.
As for James, he had to spend a week at the Works and thought he would never boast again.

There's a chile for every taste: Use Food Network Magazine's cheat sheet to pick your perfect pepper.
Shishito
Blister these sweet Japanese chiles in a skillet with olive oil, then season with salt for a simple side dish. But watch out every now and then you'll get a hot one. Scoville Units: 0 to 2,000
Poblano
Use these large mild peppers for chiles rellenos, the popular Mexican stuffed-and-fried chile dish. Poblanos are tough-skinned, so roast and peel them before using. Scoville Units: 1,000 to 2,000
New Mexico
Roast these earthy-tasting chiles, then chop and add them to stews or enchiladas. They're similar to California and Anaheim chiles but a little hotter. Scoville Units: 2,500
Jalapeno
These peppers are super versatile: Try the pickled ones as a burger or taco topping, and use the fresh ones to spice up curries or cocktails. Jalapenos range from mild to medium, depending on where they were grown. Scoville Units: 2,500 to 10,000
Serrano
If you're ready to graduate from jalapenos, try serranos in your salsa or cornbread. They're crisp and spicy with a slightly herbal flavor. Scoville Units: 15,000 to 25,000
Cayenne
You've probably used powdered cayenne for a hint of heat, but the fresh peppers pack an equally spicy punch. Mince and add them to a stir-fry. Scoville Units: 30,000 to 50,000
Thai
These green or red Asian peppers are incendiary: Slice them and mix with soy sauce, vinegar and sugar for a fiery dipping sauce. Scoville Units: 60,000
Habanero
Don't let the fruity aroma fool you: Habaneros are the hottest peppers you can buy at most stores. A single one can make a whole pot of chili sizzle. Scoville Units: 100,000 to 350,000
Mulato
If you've ever had mole sauce, you've probably tasted these sweet and mild chiles. They team up with anchos and pasillas to form the "holy trinity" of peppers used for the classic Mexican sauce. Scoville Units: 1,000
Ancho
These are dried poblanos. Their raisin-like flavor tastes great in tortilla soup or salsa, and they're essential for a good mole. Scoville Units: 1,000 to 2,000
Cascabel
The name of this smoky-tasting pepper means "rattle" in Spanish — the seeds make a racket when you shake the pod. Soak and puree them, then add to chili or taco meat. Scoville Units: 1,500 to 2,500
New Mexico
Dried red New Mexico chiles are the key ingredient in the state's famous red enchilada sauce. They're often sold in wreaths or on strings in the Southwest. Scoville Units: 2,500
Guajillo
Soak and puree these sharp chiles to make a smoky sauce for chilaquiles, a Mexican tortilla casserole. Scoville Units: 2,500 to 5,000
Pasilla
These long, thin chiles add a pleasantly bitter bite to mole. The name means "little raisin" in Spanish. Scoville Units: 4,000
Chipotle
These dried, smoked jalapenos taste like barbecue. You'll often find chipotles canned in adobo sauce. Use them to add heat and smoky flavor to a marinade or mayonnaise. Scoville Units: 10,000
De Arbol
Small but potent, de arbols are blazingly hot. Toss them whole into stir-fries or grind them into chili powder. Scoville Units: 50,000 to 65,000Partner Benefits

Partners in Crime (clockwise from left) Urie with Brandon Routh, David Krumholtz, and Sophia Bush in the new CBS sitcom Partners.
“Have you seen the poster?” Urie’s face lights up as he grabs his iPhone to scroll in search of the just-posted one-sheet. It shows the series’ four leads squeezed side by side in the back of a New York City cab, with the overline “From the Emmy-Winning Creators of Will & Grace” and the tag “Four Friends. Three Couples.”
Not only is CBS banking on Partners’ association with the groundbreaking Will & Grace, the network’s ad campaign also invokes another iconic, long-running sitcom: Friends. For his part, Urie is thrilled to be on a refreshingly old-fashioned, character-driven sitcom at a time when most comedies are, as he says, “so referential” (see: network TV’s other new gay-themed comedy, The New Normal).
Plus, Urie’s character, based on Max Mutchnick, the gay half of the Will & Grace creative team, was written with him in mind. Or at least that’s what Mutchnick has said. “That’s really nice,” counters Urie as he matter-of-factly swipes a sweet potato fry across a mound of ketchup at a 24-hour diner near his apartment. “I don’t think it’s true, but it was really nice of him to say.”
It’s not actually so far-fetched. Urie had tested for roles in two previous comedies from Mutchnick and David Kohan: the short-lived Twins and the even shorter-lived Four Kings. “I didn’t watch it,” he says of Four Kings, which he had really hoped to land. “I was tooThe Sundering Flood, by William Morris, [1897], at sacred-texts.com
Chapter XXXVIII. Osberne Parts from Stephen the Eater
The next morning Osberne went his way riding on a good horse, and not without treasure in his scrip. He was girt to Boardcleaver and had the wonder-bow and shafts with him; but the byrny, Hardcastle's Loom, he left behind, and had but a white basnet on his head, for he deemed that his friend Sir Medard would purvey him of armour. All the household were without in the garth to see him off, but none went further with him save Stephen the Eater, who rode with him as far as the bent, and closely and lovingly they spake together on the way. But when they were come to the crown of the bent Osberne drew rein and said: "Now, my friend, shalt thou turn about and let me go my ways." And they turned about both and looked down on Wethermel, and Stephen cast his arm abroad and spake: "Best-beloved of all men, how long deemest thou it shall be ere thou seest this again?"
"I wot not," said Osberne; "I am in the hands of Weird, to wend as she will have me: but I will tell thee that I have hoped and prayed that it might be in no longer space than five years; then shall I be of twenty years and three, and she but a few weeks younger, and manhood and womanhood and due service of the kindred shall lie before us both if I find her alive; but if I find her dead, or have sure witness that so she is, that moment shall I turn my face and come back to you, to live and die with you as I may. There is the third thing left, to wit, that I may wander about the world and find her not till I am exceeding old; but even then shall I come back with her, or the memory of her. Now I will not say Remember me, for therein I trust thee, but I will bid thee live hale and merry, that when I see thee again thy face may be as little changed as may be."
Therewith they parted, and Osberne looked not back again.The Book Show #1320 - T.C. Boyle

After a close first half of play, the Massachusetts women’s lacrosse team took off in the second half and never looked back, winning the season opener against Vanderbilt on Sunday 13-6.
Leading 5-4 at halftime, the Minutewomen (1-0) opened the second half with four unanswered goals, outscoring the Commodores (1-1) 8-2 in the half to put the game away.
“I think the fact that we were able to pull away like that really shows just how motivated and tough our team is,” UMass coach Angela McMahon said.
McMahon added that a big key to the turnaround was ball control. She said the play of draw specialist Kelsey McGovern, as well as Melissa Carelli and Kelsey Sheridan, who finished with seven combined draw controls, was instrumental to the team’s victory.
“With those people coming up with that 50-50 opportunity, giving us possession, absolutely directly correlated it to us being able to put it away on the offensive end,” she said.
Another highlight on the day was the play of Katie Ferris. The senior attackman led the team with four goals and four assists, and broke the program’s all-time record for goals with a new mark of 171.
“She played fantastic,” McMahon said. “A couple of her shots weren’t falling for her in the first half and she did a fantastic job of making adjustments the second half where she was getting better quality shots off.
“I think she was also realizing what her defender was doing against her and when she had opportunities to go to the goal versus setting up her teammates, and again, that balance of being able to score and feed that makes her so dynamic and helps our team overall be really tough to beat because she can do both of those things.”
UMass took a quick 4-1 lead in the first 15 minutes of the first half, but Vanderbilt came back with three unanswered goals by Mallory Schonk to tie it up with two minutes left. A goal by Carelli just before time expired gave the Minutewomen a one-goal lead going into the break.
McMahon said overall the team’s play was a little sloppy in the first half.
“We had some nice plays here and there but we weren’t really ever able to gain good momentum to really push a good lead,” she said. “I think part of that is attributed to what a good team Vanderbilt is, but I think moving forward, definitely something we learned in this game was that we need to take better care of the ball.”
UMass will next travel to Storrs, Conn., for a game against Connecticut. The game is set for Saturday at 1 p.m.
After defeating the Huskies last year in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, McMahon is sure the game will make for a tough matchup.
“With Vanderbilt, we had a little bit of unfamiliarity because the teams had never played, but UConn, it’s the opposite,” McMahon said. “So, we’re going to have to really have to be crisp and sharp to beat such a good UConn team.”

Is there an English subtitled release in the US?
I was just released in Japan less than 3 months ago. Give it some time. It takes quite while for American movies to make it over to Japan because of the need to subtitle. Plus it might not make it into theaters here regardless.
As to the article…….this is not “leaving no stone unturned” it’s more akin to stealing a newborn from a crib. Japan just made this EXACT movie so for the Hollywood to create an American version seems beyond wrong. At least have the decency to let the dust settle before blatantly stealing something. Doesn’t someone in Japan have the rights to this to prevent it from happening in the first place?
they have the rights for Space Battleship Yamato, but not to Star Blazers. I wish they would have done Captain Harlock. However if they do plan to do a robotech or Gundam it should be by those same guys that did SB:Yamato
Ack, WHAT? All Star Blazers is is the Japanese version dubbed over and gutted of some material. I can’t believe that would qualify as separate rights.
Would be funny though if this was done and the Japanese version was STILL better.
the japanese one looks great i cant imagine something looking better unless they are going to buy the sets from the japanese
dude that movie is like a japanense all my children in space. terrible terrible film you can watch the jap torrent online
Yup Agreed, Just needs english voice over perhaps
Second thought if Hollywood Leaves it’s Political Garbage, Sex Scenes, and excessive language out of this and stick to the script. ie what I as a kid remember; and I have on DVD all 3 yes 3 specifically 1 & 2 are the American Favorite. Any way it is doubtful that Hollywierd can do anything like this anymore. Keep it clean. You can have lots of Action without the stuff listed above and watching people getting blown to bits.
And as originally stated the Japanese Version looks awsome and well we’ll see. Lucus made films much like Star Blazers with the aforementioned nasties left out. Star Wars ring a bell. So yes I guess hollywood can make a good film but they derailed some where.
Whaaaaaaatttt? Leave stuff where it is. Last Airbender, DragonBall, and Speed Racer proved that.
Awesome! I loved this show when I was a kid.
how about a gundam or robotech movie, omething that destroys the transformers franchise
BIG BUDGET GUYVER!! do you even realize how awsome a halfhorror action thriller scifi film based on the guyver would be? done right? amazing
I loved this show. I cannot wait for the subtitled Japanese movie too.
I hope they do the Space Marines story arc.
WTF!!!!! why hollywood always messed up with Japanese film. Are they don’t have any ideas left to create a film. It would be a big mistake if they make the film. Example the japanese film ruined by hollywood : dragonball evolution, Tekken, The King of Fighter and Street Fighter. They all Sux….
Is Brian synger directing? This writer did the usual suspects, Valkyrie, and jack the giant killer. How about a trigun movie Hollywood. Since Keanu is already destroying cowboy bebop.
I heard that was a rumor , they arent making Cowboy beebop, cause it would cost to much money to do it. If they where to do it it should be done by Whendon, he would be prefect for it.
cast
Jet Black: Bruce Willis
Spike Spiegel: Brad Pit
Faye Valentine:Eliza Dushku
Edward: Chloe Moretz
theyre rewriting the script to downsize the budget. and reeves as spike is already awsome. i cant see pitt performing jeet kun do or however you spell it. spikes martial arts are based off of bruce lee and judging from the matrix reeves can pull it off. id rather see a ghost in the shell movie thats focused on bato and the major being a supporting character.
I would totally love to see this. At least an American version wouldn’t have either the annoying subtitles or dubbing. I was a HUGE fan of the show when I was a kid and this would be a total blast from the past.
They should make a Voltron movie first
It has been nearly 2 years since I have heard any news. Any updates? The Japanese live-action movie was cool but a little disappointing. I am hoping the US version will right their mistakes.
Problem: Hollywood has never “righted” any “mistakes” (what would those be anyway), instead has it taken good productions and made them worse.
Every single Hollywood remake is like that.
Emmerich’s Godzilla all over again. Or does remember all the Hollywood remakes of European movies couple of years back, which were all inferior to the originals?
Hollywood, living off remakes. Laughable.
And it will suck. Huge CGI fest, of, compared to what the Japanese productions tend to field, inferior quality. That’s all it will be, cause that’s all Hollywood can make these days.Related BlogsRooftop at the Vendue Inn Charleston

— LeBron James (@KingJames) October 19, 2013
I wouldn’t expect LeBron to ever play in an NFL game.
First of all, a team won’t sign him for one game and he wouldn’t be in sync with his teammates. He would need a lot of time to practice and get on the same page with the rest of the team.

The City of Altus will have a roll-off located at the community center for trash collection.
The schedule will include returning the trash by noon.
Goals of this group include keeping Altus looking as good as possible and keeping trash out of the main waterways in the area. “It’s time for us to clean up Altus!”
All businesses along the major thoroughfares are asked to participate in the clean-up effort and are asked to clean up areas in front, back and sides if their building. “Pull those weeds!”

Kelis has always been a trendsetter, but we aren't expectng her feather and pony hair cape to take off with the masses. The "Milk Shake" singer performed for an audience of 50.000 on the third day of Lovebox 2013 in Victoria Park over the weekend.
Kelis, who's new to Instagram, posted several pics from the show which included her latest song, "Jerk Ribs" off her forthcoming album, due later this fall.
But one NY native was missing in action......
Lil' Kim was scheduled to perform at Lovebox, but she never made it to the stage. Festival officials apparently cancelled her performance due to tardiness, releasing a statement that said, 'Lil' Kim did not turn up to her set on time. The festival had no other option but to maintain the scheduled running order to ensure the other main stage acts were not disrupted.'
At least that's what some folks are claiming.........
Other rumors around the cancellation say Lil' Kim showed up on time but was not pleased with the stage that had been selected for her set (and that led to a nasty clash with organizers).
But after the botched set, Kim decided to invite her fans (above) to a meet and greet in her hotel lobby. And despite most of Great Britain being on royal baby watch, it turns out that Lil' Kim's milkshake brought the boys to the yard, and had fans lined up down the street!

Regarding. […]The arithmetic variant of the SET command, SET /A, can also calculate a modulus, perform logical bit shifts, and do boolean operations.
I first used the arithmetic operations in tip 0721 » General purpose date math routine.
I used the following commands to calculate whether the current year was a leap year, so I could make February have 29 days:
set /a DD1=%DD1% + 28 set /a WKYY1=%YY1% / 4 set /a WKYY1=%WKYY1% * 4 If %WKYY1% NEQ %YY1% goto DAYM set /a DD1=%DD1% + 1Had I known about the modulus operator, I could have changed this sequence of commands to:
set /a DD1=%DD1% + 28 set /a WKYY1=%YY1% ^% 4 If %WKYY1% GTR 0 goto DAYM set /a DD1=%DD1% + 1While this only saves 1 statement, it does save considerable processor time.
When using the SET /A command, you can enclose the string to the right of the = sign in double-quotes ("), causing the expression evaluator to consider any non-numeric strings in the expression as environment variable names, whose values are converted to numbers before using them. This eliminates the need to type all the % signs. Thus set /a WKYY1=%YY1% ^% 4 becomes set /a WKYY1="YY1 % 4"
Consider the following:
set /a AA=1 set /a BB=2 set /a CC=3 set /a quot=(%AA% + %BB%) / %CC% The last line can be typed as: set /a quot="(AA + BB) / CC"You can use the logical shift to shift bits left or right, thus multiplying or dividing by 2:
set /a aa=8 set /a bb="aa << 1"shifts the bits in %aa% left by 1, which multiplies by 2, whereas:
set /a aa=8 set /a bb="aa << 2"shifts the bits in %aa% left by 2, which multiplies by 4. Similarly:
set /a bb="aa >> 2"
shifts the bits in %aa% right by 2 bits, dividing by 4.
Boolean operations are performed by using:
& - bitwise and ^ - bitwise exclusive or | - bitwise orThus:
set /a byte=0x01 set /a xx="byte & 0xFF" leaves the 0 bit on set /a xx="byte & 0xFE" turns the 0 bit off set /a xx="byte ^ 0xFF" reverses the the 0/1 condition of the bits. set /a xx="byte | 0xFF" turns all bits onSund.

I just finished reading an article in Adage, entitled, “Our Biggest Brands can no longer be managed by nerds” by Tom Hinkes. His basic premise is that using data to inform marketing decisions somehow is responsible for the loss or the demise of CPG brands.
While I agree that “brand marketing is not a science, it requires analysis, discipline and detail. Even more, it requires intuition, flair and vision,” what I disagree with is the confusion between data and “numbers”. Using advances in market research, analytics and more recent social monitoring to listen to your customers, gain a greater understanding of what motivates them and responding to their needs/desires is not being a “bean counter”.
What made Starbucks a success was not that Howard Schultz ignored the research and went with his gut; it was that he was able to see the real needs/desires of his audience. They weren’t interested in coffee or soft drinks; they were interested in human interaction and a place where that could happen. And that type of insight is exactly what data and the successful understanding of data can bring about.
So I would counter that it’s some traditional brand managers who can’t see the forest for the trees and it takes a new more strategic business focused approach to be successful in today’s marketplace. So instead of being afraid of nerds, learn to listen and then apply the intuition, flair and vision that makes brand marketing as much art as science.Edward G. Robinson offers an excellent turn as a crime lord obsessed with the welfare of his son in this melodramatic crime story. The lad is born while the notorious Robinson serves 10 years. Unfortunately, the press hound the babies mother and constantly derider her until a kinder reporter takes pity and begins writing stories to support her. This angers his editor who fires him. One day Robinson's wife goes to visit him and he behaves like a brute. She is so shocked that she ends her marriage and hooks up with the reporter. Together, they move far away to start successful new lives. A decade later, Robinson gets out and begins searching for his boy. Unfortunately, he also gets talked into his gangster activities by an old cohort. The gang, however turns on him and forces him to reveal the location of a large cache of loot that he hid before entering the slammer. Tough old Robinson won't tell them, so they kidnap his son.Fortunately, Robinson and the lad escape. The gangster tries to get to know his boy, but the child wants nothing to do with him. Angered, Robinson swears vengeance upon his ex and her new spouse. ~ Sandra Brennan, Rovi

This one is fully vegetarian, with all the goodness of homemade vegetable stock. The original recipe called for a lot of fresh herbs, which I didn’t have because I ran out and there wasn’t time to go out and buy them. What I had instead were dried rosemary, thyme and bay leaves, and fresh mint leaves. The latter was a very nice addition to the soup and if I had to do it all over again, I’d make this soup with the same ingredients.
A few weeks ago, I asked for vegetarian cookbook recommendations on Twitter. One of the top two mentioned by my Twitter pals is Deborah Madison’s “Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone“. I didn’t realize it was like The Vegetarian Cooking Tome–the massive amount of recipes overwhelmed me the minute I held it. I haven’t delved that much into vegetarian cooking (there’s always a slight meat component in most of my vegetable dishes), so I didn’t know where to start. That week, we were having an incredibly cold and rainy week, as is typical for Vancouver winter. It was starting to get really old and the only thing that could really lighten the mood up was a good bowl of soup. When I looked through the cookbook, this one jumped at me. This would be the books “first test”.
Friends, do you do that, too, when you have a new cookbook? Do you test out a few recipes to see if the cookbook will be worth its place as a standby in the kitchen? For me, if one recipe succeeds, it stays near the kitchen and I continue to cook from it. If it fails, I’ll give it 2 more tries before I ditch it. What about you? How many recipes do you test before it gets a Yay or a Nay?
This recipe definitely earned a “Yay!” in my book.
I love when everything goes together and the whole experience of making a dish somehow connects you to the author, through the methods, the flavors, and the culmination in the forms of a really good meal and a silent Thank You to the mind that created something so wonderful. A regular dinner turned into something special. Yes, I romanticize about meals, and if this was a date, I’m picking the phone to ask for a second. ;-)
SPLIT PEA SOUP
Adapted from Deborah Madison’s the book, Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone
Ingredients
- 1 ½ cups slip green peas, sorted and rinsed
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 large onion, diced
- 2 medium carrots, diced
- 2 large garlic cloves, chopped
- ¼ cup chopped parsley
- 1 teaspoon dried rosemary
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 2 bay leaves
- 4 sprigs of fresh mint
- 2 quarts vegetable stock or water**
- mushroom soy sauce (optional)
- Greek yogurt (optional)
Preparation
- Soak peas in water and set aside.
- Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion and carrots and sauté for about 10 minutes. Add garlic, parsley, herbs, paprika, fresh ground black pepper and cook for another 3 minutes.
- Drain split peas. Add peas, 1 ½ teaspoon salt and stock (or water). Stir to keep peas from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Wait for it to boil before lowering the heat to simmer for about an hour. Partially cover until peas have broken down. If soup becomes to thick, add water according to your preference. Remove bay and mint leaves.
- Season with soy sauce or salt as desired.
Serve hot. Highly recommended topped with a dollop of Greek yogurt.
** You can also use chicken or beef stock, if you do not have preference for vegetarian.
You are after our hearts – we adore soup and we adore split peas. Not many people actually enjoy a bowl of the “green stuff” but we do! I have actually been thinking I should make it & now I am inspired to try your veggie version – I usually put bacon in it! Thanks for a great recipe!
Haha..I know…I was surprised how many people steer away from the green stuff. This is part of my #10in10 effort so I’m cooking more vegetarian recipes. You’re welcome! I have to admit, I was tempted to put bacon on the end product. Hah.
Looks wonderful! I’m about to do a 21 day vegan “cleanse” diet and this is something I can actually eat! Yay!
.-= Kristina@FormerChef´s last blog ..Four Favorite Markets in Rome =-.
Kristina, so you’re actually going to do it? :) I’ll be posting another vegan recipe, and another one that is the most amazing dessert (and it’s raw and vegan). Good luck! When are you starting?
I think I’m going to start on Monday. Have you done something similar?
I’m semi-doing it unintentionally because of the vegetarian and raw cookbooks that I’ve purchased. I think I’ve only eaten non-vegetarian twice the past week. One thing I can’t give up though is baked goods. Haha.
You’re the one who calls for a second date? Heh heh ;) I give cookbooks several tries, especially if I was hell-bent on liking it. Oops! But I still like being pleasantly surprised.
This soup would be perfect for a frigid day like today! Brr!
.-= Manggy´s last blog ..Rose’s Chocolate Feather Bed =-.
This is wonderful! Split pea soup is one of my favourite recipes and you have reminded me of how easy it is to make but oh how satisfying. YUM!

This is one of those soups that gets better as it sits. Perfect for leftovers!
.-= The Duo Dishes´s last blog ..Stirring Up Help for Haiti =-.
Oh love this! But then I might be biased because split peas is one of the ingredients in my favourite Caribbean soup which I actually blogged about recently. The spices are different but how could anyone not love this. Love the dreamy quality to this picture.
What a beautiful bowl of split pea soup! One of my favorites! Love that it’s a veg-friendly version.

Montana Grain Growers Vice President Matt Flikkema says he's never seen such extensive damage to the county's wheat and barley crops. He expects "very little crops" will be harvested, with work scheduled to begin next week.
Flikkema said the damage from Thursday afternoon's storms could approach $50 million.
The storm started in southwestern Montana. Wind gusts up to 104 mph were recorded in Polaris, northwest of Dillon. The National Weather Service reported major damage to homes and some trees.
Strong winds and possibly a tornado caused severe damage in Twin Bridges, uprooting trees and blowing the roof off at least one building.
Golf-ball sized hail fell across much of Belgrade and the northern part of Bozeman.
Crop damage reported from strong thunderstorms
This was one of the larger chunks from the hail storm today (off of Valley Center Road). It hit us about 5:20 pm and lasted for about 10 minutes. A golf ball is on the left for comparison. Lisa Michael, Bozeman

Questions and comments to: webmaster@press.princeton.eduPrinceton University PressThere's a great new food blog that deserves a read called So Good. Written by a corporate communications professional by day/comic by night (insert joke here - there are so many ways we could run with that) named Jon Eick, he's one of the freshest, funniest and most entertaining voices to enter the food blogosphere.
And now there's a delicious review of Bacon Salt. His epiphany moment? A Bacon Salted Bloody Mary, one of our absolute favorite uses of Peppered Bacon Salt, which makes the world's best Bloody Mary (which, incidentally, is best enjoyed as a 7am pick-me-up before a college football game). A quick, well-written excerpt:
Over the next few days, as I began to try Bacon Salt on different foods, my initial hesitation turned to excitement. I mixed a healthy amount of the hickory into some burger patties I made and the flavor of the burgers was astounding. I put an ample amount of the original on some cheese fries and loved it. Bacon Salt on my corn on the cob proved to be fairly good, as did butter and Bacon Salt on my mashed potatoes.
But then, came the moment that made me a Bacon Salt fanatic. After mentioning to Dave that I wasn’t a fan of the peppered, he suggested that one use for it is to add it to Bloody Mary’s. It just so happens I am a huge fan of bloody mary’s and make them all the time, morning or night. Four nights ago I made my regular bloody mary and added in some Peppered Bacon Salt.
Ladies and gentlemen, what I tasted that night was a whole new world of flavor excitement. I love, love, love bloody mary’s. But now, I had a way to make them even better. I experimented with the amount of bacon salt I used, trying bloody mary’s with both overpowering and weak bacon flavor. Once I found the right balance, I was in heaven…a tasty bloody mary gets that much tastier with a subtle hint of bacon flavor.IRAN: In video, anger boils over at Friday sermon
Newly released video from Tehran shows crowds of angry opposition supporters reacting to a much-anticipated Friday sermon given by Ayatollah Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who called for the release of political prisoners but stopped short of a wholesale condemnation of the government's crackdown.
Rafsanjani is one of Iran's leading power brokers and a supporter of opposition leader Mir-Hossein Mousavi, but is widely considered more of a calculating politician than a risk-taker. But even as he urged police and security forces to "work within the framework of the law," unconfirmed reports appeared on the Internet of clashes between pro-government and opposition supporters.
Reactions posted on micro-blogging service Twitter reflected mostly disappointment that Rafsanjani had not taken a harder stance against government violence or offered a comprehensive power-sharing solution to the crisis.
"Very disappointed, nothing new, basically green light for the status quo," tweeted parsa4.

Said a spokesperson, “We were not aware of this deicison…it was a mistake.”
The Bros at Total Frat Move, who were first to this story, had some pretty solid analysis on this blasphemy of all blasphemies. And a reaction as quality this one desrves its due praise:
What situation could possibly lead someone to think this was a good idea? I don’t care how much one resident bitches about The Star Spangled Banner, this is America, that is our Goddamn flag. If someone wants to fly it then they damn well should be able to do so. WHO GETS UPSET ABOUT SEEING AN AMERICAN FLAG!?
While the state has scrambled to reverse their decree, the town populace has been in a complete uproar. 82-year old resident Barbara Marshall was particularly irked, and decided to defy her commie town by letting her stars and stripes wave free.
“If somebody wants to come and take the flag down, I’ll take pictures,” she said to The Sun Chronicle, presumably before threatening to “mow down those commie bastards with my husband’s old Tommy Gun from Iwo if they try to take it.” Grandmothers, believe it or not, are actually huge proponents of the second amendment.
While the Housing and Community Development department is tripping over itself to rectify the situation, the ban is still technically in place. If I were a resident of Wrenthem (before killing myself from boredom), I would raise up a hundred flags on my front yard. If that’s a problem, they can kiss my ass and come and take it.

I love to make my own pizza crusts. I love to play with different recipes. This pizza crust is particularly exciting to me because I have a 2 1/2 year old that loves pizza but isn’t a huge fan of munching on cauliflower. Problem solved! In addition, there is no flour in this recipe. So for those of you who don’t play well with gluten and grains, this recipe is a winner, winner pizza dinner!
Cauliflower Pizza Crust
- 4 Cups Raw Cauliflower
- 1 Egg, lightly beaten
- 1/4 cup Goat Cheese
- 2 Tbsp Mozzarella Cheese
- 1 tsp Dried Oregano
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Place cauliflower in a food processor and pulse until a rice like texture is achieved. Bring a large pot with a couple inches of water to a boil and add the cauliflower. Cover and steam for 5 minutes. Drain the cauliflower into a sieve then transfer to a thin dish towel. Then squeeze the excess moisture out. Let it sit a minute if it’s too hot to handle. Once you’ve squeezed out as much liquid as possible transfer the cauliflower to a large bowl and stir in the egg, cheeses and oregano. Press the dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 20-30 minutes. Once the crust has been pre-baked add any toppings you like. Then pop back in the oven for an additional 5-10 minutes.
Pulse the raw cauliflower in the food processor until it looks like this.
Steam in the boiling water and transfer to a sieve. Do you have one of these? You need one, I promise you’ll use it all the time!
Plop the interesting creation onto a kitchen towel….
Now squeeze, squeeze, squeeze all the water out.
Combine the remaining ingredients and form into a pizza dough shape on a parchment lined pan. I went with a square-ish shape. It just felt right.
Bake until just starting to brown.
Add your favorite toppings and bake another 5-10 minutes. I went for tomato sauce, vegetarian sausage and mozzarella cheese.
Just look at that crust! Miss Ava devoured this pizza and that makes this Momma so happy!
Whitney
This makes me so happy. I’m going to sneak this into our Pizza night!
my gosh, there are so many receipes that i have to try! i love goat cheese and i like cauliflour. my daughter has no problem eating cauliflour, but my husband doesn’t eat alot of veggies. maybe i can sneak this one here. thanks.

READ COMMENTLetter to the Editor: County works with residents to avoid possible foreclosures.
That is simply not the way the county operates. Yes, if you don't pay your taxes for a certain time period, you can forfeit your house or other property. However, Charlotte Sandvik, Cass County Treasurer, and I work with individuals that are in danger of losing their residence to avoid foreclosures if at all possible.
The county does take a small number of properties each year, but it is a lot less than most people would think given the 50,000 + properties in Cass County - taking an occupied residence is extremely rare. We work especially hard when a property is a private residence, if we think they may qualify for a homestead or veterans credit, we work with them to file the necessary forms. If they have mortgages, we try to have the owners talk to their lenders in order to pay the taxes and escrow funds for future years. Sometimes it may be that the property is overvalued -we then ask the assessor from the city or township to take another look at the property.
In 2010, the year the eviction was to have taken place in West Fargo, the county "took" 44 properties. Fourteen of those properties were redeemed prior to the date the county sells the properties, and three of those were redeemed with financing assistance from the county. Two of the Fargo properties the county auctioned were occupied residences and in both cases, there were extenuating circumstances that made forfeiture the only option for the owners. In both cases, the property taxes were not their biggest problems.
In 2011, the county "took" 73 properties and again, twelve were redeemed by the sale date; one with financing assistance from the county. The remaining properties were vacant lots, or lots with buildings that either needed to be demolished or rebuilt. None of them were occupied residences.
Yes, the county does need to follow the law and foreclose on a property when the taxes go unpaid. However, the treasurer and I work diligently to make sure owners are fully informed of deadlines, work out payment plans, do automatic payments if the property owner wishes, and accept payments of any size. In the case of residences, we try to make sure the owner is applying for all available credits and try to make sure that the property is not over assessed.

all as it seems this style has a powerful attractiveness related to
it. The faded look of this amazing make-up style creates an eye
popping effect, an effect which attracts attention towards the eyes
making them appear more dramatic. The most popular color used to
create smokey eyes is black but other colors as well look just as
fabulous. Two or multiple color tones can be used to create this
fading makeup style. Purple, greens, browns and golds are great
eyeshadow colors to create smokey eyes.
Primer is a must when applying a smokey eye makeup as it will help set the eyeshadow in place. Applying this type of make-up needs to be done gradually and following certain steps. The darker color needs to be applied on about half of the eyelid and gradually work the lighter color in to receive a smooth, uniform transition. It is the transition which creates this smokey effect. There are a variety of eye shapes and it is essential to adapt the make-up to your eye shape, so your eyes will look gorgeous.
Dramatic eye makeup
Dramatic eye makeup is a popular makeup style as it creates a powerful eye catching effect. This makeup style is not for everyone as it is a powerful makeup which uses dark colored eyeshadow to define the eyes. This makeup style differentiates itself from the smokey eye makeup through the method of application as well as the result. Dramatic eye makeup doesn't have a fading effect and the transition to bare skin is done quickly, dramatically. This make-up style has become quite popular among certain celebrities as it helps emphasize the eyes.
This type of makeup is usually created using matte colored eyeshadow because matter colors have a more powerful look. The color is applied on the entire eyelid up to the crease. Eyeliner is often used to contour the eyes before the eyeshadow's application.
Use colors like black, dark gray, dark purple, dark red, depending on the color of your eyes and your complexion. Dramatic eye makeup usually helps emphasize eye color so it works great with any type of iris coloration.
Natural eye makeup
This makeup style is increasing its popularity as it is suitable for any type of occasion. Natural beauty has always been appreciated and the new trends are trying to emphasize natural beauty. Since we have reached a time where pastels dominate the fashion collections, natural eye make-up only comes to contribute to the new fashion trends look. Warm tone eyeshadow, matte or shimmery, applied softly on the eyelid, a soft contouring of the eyes using a brown colored eye pencil and a touch of mascara helps create this lovely makeup style suitable for women of all ages.
Lavender, soft pink, yellow, pearl are only few of the shades you can use to create a natural looking make-up.
Minimal eye makeup
This type of make-up uses virtually no visible make-up, as some women just don't have the skill, the time or the patience to create more sophisticated makeup styles. Minimal doesn't mean completely bare, one can use neutral tones to create a flawless appearance. A beautiful woman is considered to be a woman who takes care of her appearance, always allowing a little bit of time for make-up, hairstyling and fashion.
Nude eye color and a touch of mascara is all that is necessary to create this minimalist natural looking make-up style.
Vintage eye makeup
There are a variety of vintage eye make-up styles ranging from 1920's make-up until the late 70's but there is one makeup style that seems to remain as popular as it used to be decades ago. A simple make-up style using eyeliner to define the eyes is still popular among teenagers as well as older women.
There are a variety of ways to apply eyeliner according to your eye shape, so determining what style suits your eye shape is a priority. The eyeliner used can be liquid eyeliner, gel or pencil, but the most popular eyeliner type still remains the liquid eyeliner. Applying the eyeliner can require a little bit of practice as a smooth uniform line is required for a perfect look.
You can use a nude matte eyeshadow on your eyelids if you consider it to be necessary. Apply falsies and coat your lashes with a thick coat of black colored mascara.

A total of 78 experts tested 700 pizzas from restaurants around the U.S. and ranked each one in an attempt to discover the perfect slice for American taste buds.
The panel consisted of a geographically diverse bunch of American chefs, restaurant critics, bloggers, writers and "pizza authorities," according to the food-focused website. Also contributing to the panel was The Velvet Underground parody tribute band, The Pizza Underground, lead by actor Macaulay Culkin, strangely enough.
The results, however, may enrage some. Pizza Margherita is certainly the preferred style choice of pizza critics throughout the top 101 list, while Chicago deep-dish fans will be disappointed to learn that only a few made the list. Though, any argument over the best pizza is sure to leave at least some pizza aficionados unsatisfied.
Though the New England area dominates the top 101 list, the location of some of the top pizzerias may surprise you. Pizzeria Bianco out of Phoenix, for instance, is renown nationwide with its owner Chris Bianco being named by Zagat as one of the six chefs who changed pizza. Check out the top ten below.
The Top 10 Pizzas in America
10. Tony's Pizza Napoletana, San Francisco, CA (Margherita)
9. Paulie Gee's, Brooklyn, N.Y., NY (Regina)
8. Totonno's, Brooklyn, N.Y., NY (Margherita)
7. Flour + Water, San Francisco, CA (Margherita)
6. Pizzeria Mozza, Los Angeles, CA (Squash blossoms, Tomato, Burrata Mozzarella, Tomato Sauce)
5. Sally's Apizza, New Haven, CT (Tomato Pie: Tomato Sauce, no cheese)
4. Roberta's, Brooklyn N.Y., NY (Margherita)
3. Pizzeria Bianco, Phoenix, AZ (Marinara)
2. Di Fara, Brooklyn, N.Y., NY (Di Fara Classic Pie)
1. Frank Pepe's, New Haven, CT (White Clam Pie)
For the full 101 list from The Daily Meal, click here.
This is the 2nd time Frank Pepe's topped The Daily Meal's list of best pizzas, winning the #1 slot last year as well.
One of the oldest pizzerias in the country, Pepe's, was founded in 1925 by Italian immigrant Frank Pepe. After working in factories and serving in World War I, Pepe soon began selling "tomato pies" in Wooster Square while working at a bakery. After he saved enough money, he invested in a wagon to sell his pizzas and eventually bought out his employer's business, which became the location of first Frank Pepe's Pizzeria Napoletana.
Pepe's originated the famous New Haven thin crust pizza, reminiscent of a Neapolitan-style pizza. The famous white clam pizza is also believed to have originated with Pepe's after watching his business partner's nephew sell clams outside the store.
What do you think of The Daily Meal's results? Did they get it right? Let us know in the comments below.

Since
People are very divided on this place. I love the apps and desert, and usually make my meal with 2 of each. The cheese and fruit plate is very inviting, soup can be good too. Service is sparky and not at all subservient, which I like. A good variety of wines by the glass. Nice artsy-homey deco. Now wait for the other side!
My in-laws adore Helen's Garden, so I have been there quite a few times. I would say that the food is consistently good, not outstanding. It's a safe choice and the atmosphere is nice. It's very well managed. I agree that the service is "sparky and not at all subservient."
They do have a really great happy hour...go to happy hour at Helen's and then dinner at Mama's (although I would rather eat at Helen's than at Mama's...IMO the service at Mama's is awful and the food is just okay)."?
- re: kelarry
My mistake in going to Nacho Mama's versus the Halfshell--well, it was really a stupid mistake. Hubby and I were able to get a parking space directly in front of the restaurant. There were a lot of people standing on the sidewalk. We weaved our way through the crowd and saw the bar and the hostess stand. The hostess was practically out the door and on the street and asked if we wanted a table. My hubby was discussing issues about his disastrous day at work. I was concentrating on his dissertation and we just followed the hostess to a table. I remember commenting on the painted walls and then looking at the menu wondering why there weren't any oysters. But, I just continued to listen to my hubby and ignored my instincts.
We laugh about the error now. My hubby says that I am a great listener and is delighted that I gave him my full attention instead of turning to my chowhound side and focusing on FOOD!
I am disappointed, though, that I didn't get to eat the oysters on horseback at Mama's, or the fried oysters, etc. It seems to be one of the few restaurants that offer oysters on horseback. The only other place I know of that carries the dish is the Manor Tavern in Monkton. FoiGras

Am not at all disappointed in Canton and the restaurant scene. My hubby is less enthusiastic, mainly because of the parking situation.

Last week, the above Reuters photo by Krishnendu Halder appeared online with the following caption: “Members of laughter clubs attend a session during ‘World Laughter Day’ celebrations in Hyderabad, India.” The celebration in India included a huge sculpture of the mythical figure Ravana based on Nina’s design from the film.
Consider for a second the amazing nature of this photo’s contents. Nina Paley made Sita Sings the Blues in her apartment–all by her lone self, on a shoestring budget, using a desktop computer. One short year after its debut, with absolutely no promotional budget, no theatrical distribution and little mainstream media coverage, the film has traveled around the globe and fans are creating sculptures based on her work.
Nina has made it possible for everybody to see her film by placing her film into Creative Commons and allowing it to be shared without copyright restrictions. Conventional thinking leads us to believe that this type of distribution is impossible and that global visibility is only possible through millions of dollars worth of marketing and advertising. Paley, however, has entrusted the distribution to her audience and (surprise, surprise) people are watching her film and building a community around it. The success of her experiment proves that independent artists with limited means can indeed compete on a world-wide playing field, not by trying to mimic strategies of entertainment conglomerates, but by taking advantage of ideas like Creative Commons licensing and employing comprehensive online distribution strategies.Life Coach London ¦ Recovery Coach ¦ NLP London ¦ Therapy London ¦ Sort My Life Solutions (Smyls) ¦ Addiction ¦ Anxiety ¦ Stress ¦ Employee Workshops

Teenager In Trouble Yet Refuses Help
Question Posted Saturday April 22 2006, 6:06 am
It's hard for advice if the question needs to be brief as there's no background on which to base the answer.
That said, my 15yo daughter (not living here) is showing many signs of a teenager in trouble; she recognises life's tough for her at the moment yet when I've suggested therapy or councelling she flat out refuses. Those close to her have tried to councel her but I feel she needs someone she's not related to, before she'll open up and face the turmoil in her life (some she's created and some out of her control).
I am seriously concerned for her welfare and have tried seeking advice from the "welfare system" which was unable to help.
I'm a 42yo single mum with another daughter 14yo living with me.
Has anyone any advice that is practical?

Additional info, added Saturday April 22 2006, 8:46 am:
1. in 2004 I went into hospital, both girls went to stay with their dad. When I came out she didn't want to come home. Her dad says yes to "look good" whereas I set boundaries..eg: no school = no play. (she truants a lot since leaving home).
2. Her father has a nephew who is a convicted child molester (over 10+ years ago) whom I have to constantly battle to keep away from my daughters. My 15yo likes this nephew and they both speak of "love" though their meanings are completely different. When he recently found out she had a boyfriend he was using msn/sms/phone to play the suicidal victim if she didn't break it off with her b/f. Welfare have known about it all for a long time but do nothing but cover their butts. This is a long term battle with my daughter now hating me coz I won't accept the nephew contact she has. The courts and welfare say no unsupervised access but the nephew flaunts that concept. I've also heard rumours from her peers that she did in fact sleep with the nephew but she denies this.
3. At 14 she got pregnant and was ordered by her dad to have an abortion (which she still mourns visibly) and an implant in her arm for contraception.
4. Daughter's sister 14yo has Asperger's Syndrome, which 15yo is only just starting to accept. They've found it hard to get along in the past. (I've mentioned this as it's a contributing factor to why she doesn't want to come home).
5. Her father felt bad after the pregnancy so thought taking her down south would "fix" it. There she is socially isolated, her father lacks the strength to follow through let alone set limits....worse though, his g/friend has had enough and has now started being very nasty to my daughter.
6. She's drinking alcohol at least weekly - she is having sex with people she barely knows (3rd one) - her language is appauling - her mood swings are pretty dramatic - she's having panic attacks - she's making really poor choices - she's moved into a negative group of peers - she's in trouble at school both with bullies (some of which she brings on herself) and with teachers (swearing at them).
She seems to have no regard for anyone but herself, while at the same time seems to have an overwhelming sense of never being able to do anything right. She's spoken of suicide and her art doodling is indicitave of that holistic negativity.
She used to be on ADD medication which curbed her impulsive and irratic thought processes. Her grades have dropped as a result as has her self esteem. I'm not saying a tablet solves all things, but it did help her concentration and thinking patterns. She was embarrassed to be on medication so her father let her stop taking them.
Finally, I love both my teenage girls but have to admit to being intimidated by the chance of having them living together with me again but more fearful if she doesn't come home, for her sake.
Please forgive my blurting all this stuff, I hope it's not too hard to follow.

WOW! that is alot of stuff to handle, when i was a teenager and that wasnt far away i was the same exact way. Its the teen year thing some people fall into it and some dont. What you need to do is try to get her back and away from her father because obviously her father is a bad dad sorry to say but its beyound obvious that he is he cares nothing about her well being. If you get her back go to court to try it talk to a therapist yourself they can help you to get her back. Once you do she will change her ways around. But im telling you its just a teen thing shell grow out of it once she realizes how dumb it is. In the mean time you just keep an eye on the things shes doing and keep trying to inforce the parent roll just keep letting her know that you do care about her. There really isnt much you can do from a whole different side of the us but you can fight for her. Hope iv helped a little let me know how it turns out good luck!

Oh Wow! I know all too well what it feels like to be a parent of a troubled teen. Without trying to diagnose it sounds like your daughter has symptoms of a mental health disorder (more than add).
If she flat out refuses to go to therapy, you alone will not be able to physically get her there. But that still leaves a few options.
1. You could go to a therapist alone, without your daughter at least for your own peace of mind.
2. You could consult with a program that will do an intervention on your daughter.
3. At the next outburst or evidence of her unreasonable behavior call the police and tell them you want to have her commited for psychiatric evaluation. They will physically take her there. You could even have everything ready in advance, the admission papers, the facility where she will go and so on...
Most of all don't blame yourself. If you have tried everything you may be at the point where you have to let go!

You do have quite a big problem. But i firstly have to say that I think you are pretty fantastic to go through so much, especially without support.
Have you heard of 'tough-love'? It's basically a concept where you tell your daughter that you love her and so you're going to be very tough on her. Your daughter seems to need help, and at the moment, you have done all you can, and you don't have much external help. that has to change.
Have you thought of sending her to 'boot camp'?One good website is troubled-teens.org, or many other website if you look under teenage problems.
This is your choice, maybe you want to go there and have a look, see if you're comfortable with sendiing your daughter there. Don't use it as a threat for your daughter, like you'll send her there if she doesn't quit smoking. This is a chance to change her life and you're giving it to her. Tell her father about it, and ask for his support or to back off, you don't want your daughter running back to him and ruining her life by making it easier now.
If you don't like the idea, then you are going to really have to build a network. Go to her school, tell her principal and teacher her problems. tell them to call you if anything goes wrong. Get someone to pick her up immediaately from home, and stay with her till you get back. Other than food, shelter and clothes, the rest are all priviledges that you take away until she earns them back. If her grades increase or something, than give her them back one by one.
She needs help with the smoking and drinking and she could be suffering from manic depression. She either goes for the meetings, or you get the court to make her. She can't do it by herself.But don't forget to tell you love her, and you think that she can do something with herself, that's why you're pushing.
For your other daughter, you might want to build her own support group, there are organisations that help with her social abilites. If you want, I can check up on them and send you an attachment or direct you.
And finaly, most important, you are right now what's holding your family together. But at this rate, you're going to burn out, and there'll be no one to help. Give yourself time out. Hire a babysitter or just ask someone you know to watch the kids and you relax. there are many home spa techniques and other relaxing techniques. I can send you some ideas, like using cucumber to relax your eyes.
I really hope this is helpful to you.
Good luck.

Strep throat?.€1 million fund for new businesses
Consultancy firm PWC Malta has launched a €1 million start up fund aimed at helping budding entrepreneurs.
The company will be dedicating €1 million of pro bono services over a year towards new businesses.
These services will include advice on setting up business plans as well as advice on IT, taxes and employee sharing possibilities.
Kevin Valenzia, from PWC Malta, said that the company employed some 500 people and it would now be making their experience accessible to innovative and creative entrepreneurs who may need initial support to make their dream come true. This, he said, will lead to having a more innovative economy.
He added that the start up fund was being launched in collaboration with Times of Malta that will be promoting the initiative through its media as well as the University of Malta that serves as an incubator to ideas and creativity.
Allied Group managing director Adrian Hillman said that many would find the link between the news organisation and entrepreneurship to be “odd”. However, he said, this lay perfectly within the company’s mission to promote innovation for the benefit of society.
University Rector Juanito Camilleri spoke about the recently launched Entrepreneurship and Business Incubation centre that aims to put knowledge-intensive entrepreneurship at the top of the University of Malta’s outreach agenda.
He called on Government to support such initiatives through funding and tax incentives among other things.
Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, who was present for the event, said Government was committed towards supporting budding businesses and was exploring various options.
As various European countries battled with youth unemployment, not enough attention was given to the option of self-employment as a solution to the problem, he said.

From startups to meet-ups, the newly dubbed District Hall will provide a needed gathering spot for entrepreneurs in Boston’s Innovation District.
The $5.5 million, 12,000-square-foot facility will open in the next few weeks with meeting and event space, “pods” where fledgling businesses can test their concepts with the public, a lounge and cafe area, and restaurant.
“There’s always a need for more connectivity,” said John Harthorne, founder and CEO of the MassChallenge startup competition and accelerator across from the Northern Avenue center. “When we first started (in 2010), people told us it wouldn’t work because Boston wasn’t collaborative. But it’s three times more collaborative (now). That type of engagement happens in gathering spots.”
Mayor Thomas M. Menino toured District Hall yesterday and unveiled its name. “This is what it’s all about — thinking outside the box, new ideas, new companies, wow!” he said.
Built by developers of the 23-acre Seaport Square project, District Hall will be overseen by the Venture Cafe Foundation, a sister nonprofit of the Cambridge Innovation Center, which wants to expand the definition of innovation and entrepreneurship to nontraditional areas, including food.
In addition to MassChallenge, it’s in close proximity to incubators and accelerators including Greentown Labs, Space With a Soul and Bocoup Loft.
“We run a similar space at Bocoup, and there’s so much demand for it,” said Darius Kazemi, programmer for the Web app and open-source consulting company, which also houses startups. “We’ve seen more and more technology meet-up groups formed. And the existing groups are getting bigger and bigger.”
Activities already scheduled for District Hall include Mobile Monday Boston; LearnLaunchX meet-ups for educational technology startups; and Boston Startup Institute, an entrepreneurship training program for high school students.
In addition to revenue from its restaurant, District Hall is pursuing sponsorships. Paid events also will help pay for what will be a majority of free events hosted by the center.Pirates (6-13) at Astros (11-10)
1:05 PM EST–Osceola County Stadium, Kissimmee
Here is the MLB.com Gameday
Audio on Pirates.com
Zach Duke, your Opening Day starter, will pitch for the Bucs against the Astros today. He’ll make one more start between today and April 5th. Jeff Karstens and Jack Taschner will follow him.
Roy Oswalt will make the start for Houston.
Today’s game won’t be televised, but a record number of regular season games will be thanks to an agreement announced by the Pirates and FSN yesterday. A remarkable 156 games will be broadcast this year, and every single one of them will be available in HD. That’s a significant increase from last season, and it means that only six games will be without TV. Great news!
Brian - Fri, Mar 26, 2010
PreviewsI posted last week about bringing my lunch to school. It got me to thinking about when I would purchase my lunches in the cafeteria.
Once I entered Junior High/Middle School I no longer had to pack my lunch. I actually got to buy my lunch in the cafeteria. I know a lot of people complain about school cafeteria food but when you are 11 and you actually get to eat spaghetti and meat sauce from a can (think Chef Boyardee) on a regular basis because that is what the school served, it IS GOOD. A lunch platter at that time cost 80cents.
Since we were a large family and met certain criteria we were issued a card for discount lunches. I called it Well-fare lunches, although it was not. The card that was issued was the size of a baseball card and had 10 spaces on it. Monday through Friday. The card was valid for two weeks. Every two weeks I had to go to the school office to get a new card.
I would go through the line, present the card and pay half for the lunch, which was 40cents. The only problem with this card was that it was yellow. Big Bird Yellow. There was a slight embarrassment every time I would present the card. Not only could the other students see I was presenting a discount card, and of course would heckle me, but the lady at the register with the hair net, always rang up the wrong amount. She was so used to hitting the 80cent button that she would get all flustered, moan something under her breath, and have to void the transaction, re-ring it into the register and punch the hole in the card. So the embarrassment level went up a bit because I was also holding up the line.
In the beginning of the school year, because of this process and the uneasy feeling I rarely used the card. I would buy whatever items I could for the 40 cents that I was given to me every morning. I don’t know if someone ratted me out, but eventually I got into trouble for not using my card.
My dad, being the genius that he is, decided on a different approach. He was going to let me decide. He was giving me control. He said something like “You can decide whether you eat lunch or not. I will give you 5 dollars every two weeks. Whatever you don’t spend you can keep. I expect you to buy lunch with it, but you decide what you want to do with it.”
5 bucks! Wow I could buy the full price lunch 3 times a week. Then I thought it through. If I used the discount card at 40 cents I would have 50cents left over every week. Comic books were 40 cents at the time, so every two weeks I could buy 2 comic books. Man, my dad rocked. He was paying me one comic book a week to eat lunch. There was no embarrassment using the card anymore because I had something to show for it at the end of the week.
Then I thought it through even further. If I would just buy milk and a Jell-O every day it would only cost 20 cents. I would have 3 bucks left over at the end of the two weeks. That was 7 comic books every two weeks. I was still buying "lunch" with the money so my parent's couldn't be mad.
So that is what I did. I would pour the milk over the Jell-O and I would slurp it up with a straw (seriously drinking Jell-O with a straw was fun, try it). Everyda, for a few months, I had Jell-O and milk for lunch.
Then my parent's started to check the card to make sure it was punched. Either someone ratted me out again, or the boxes of comic books gave it away.
It was good racket while it lasted.

i remember having a discount lunch card when i was growing up and i was embarressed everytime i presented it. i had completely forgotten about it til i read this post-sheesh.
each of my kids lunch costs me $3 per day-insane.
(that's roughly $800 bucks a year on lunches)
Great story!
At the schools my kids go to they now have accounts at the school and they just punch their student id into the keypad at the end of the lunch line. It's good because kids can't be using lunch $$ for other things, other kids can't rip em off, and the kids who do get meal assistance - nobody know.
I had a card and hated it too! They have the keypad Lori talks about at my son's school. My Aunt used to eat a fudgesicle and a orangesicle for lunch every day. Then she wondered why she got acne.
You get extra credit points for ingenuity, William.
Lunch account tied to the ID card is awesome! Up here the school district charges $1.70 for full-price lunch. It would cost me more to make a lunch and send it, so I don't.
Can't say I've ever tried Jello and milk! Doesn't sound very appetizing, but I'm sure it was quite the tasty treat when you got to use your spare change for comic books!
You have some very strange eating habits.
talk about cheap a reagulaer lunch at my school is 3$
Funny, I thought my friend was nuts when she said she pours milk over her jello.....thats now, this day and age.....but hey, I guess I can't knock it until I try it....I'll let you know......lol
Milk over jello? And through a straw?! AWESOME.
Ah, the discount lunch tickets... I can SO relate to this post! Except ours were black- and white- striped. Like a zebra. I hate zebras to this day. Yep. Good times.
I love the way you wrote this. It really sent me back, you know? Well done.
You did it again! Who else on Earth drinks Jell-o and milk through a straw??? I was sure I was the one and only! Amazing! Did you also drink milk through a Twizzler after biting the ends off, making "strawberry milk"??? Did you dip French fries into chocolate shakes too??? Did you try the Laverne DiFazio special, Pepsi and milk and almost puke? Unbelievable, Jell-o and milk! Hahaha! Glad to have someone out there as freaky as me. :)

Jello & Milk? Yikes! Does Maxfield eat this too? My kids caught my dad pouring milk and raisins over a bowl of rice with a little spoonful of sugar and now they want me to make rice all the time so they can have grandpa's version of rice pudding. UGH! I guess maybe if I wasn't allergic to milk.... Stacie
I ate chocolate chip cookies with chocolate milk for about a whole year or more in high school because I hated the lunch they served. And somehow that sustained me for the whole day and throughout track practice after school..that cost about a dollar I think.
Am I the only one that is wondering why you were buying comic books in junior high and high school? That seems a bit old, but then again, I've never been one to read them myself.
I remember those damn cards. How embarrassing.
LOL..that is funny...do you still have the comic books?
well several things on this one .. but first, its' been a long time since I have been on Poop and Boogies because quit honestly, I was booted off or should I say asked not to post because I gave away too much secret Family Info... But I'm back!!!
First observation: I think only females read your Blogs...which is fine, just noticed that everyone who comments usually is always a Female. So does that make you more or less of a Female yourself?
2nd observation: You are giving away too much material... You need to focus on getting each one of these Blogs produces into a half hour sitcom!!!!! The material is all here... its like the WonderYears all over again.... except with a Larger Family, and well a different time period, and well ok, bad comparison but you knew what I meant.....
Later.
Had to link you again. You really have a way of jogging my memories. :)
Lois Lane
ROFL! Great Story, thanks for shaing it.
I Love the story!! You were lucky to have a cafeteria at any age.
I beleive they now call jello and milk through a straw "bubble tea"...
LOL!
I remeber the Comic Books well. I had to clean them up every other week. My brother paid me, to clean our room because it was so messy. I don't even know why my parents carpeted our bedroom, the Comic Books took care of covering our floor.
"So that is what I did. I would pour the milk over the Jell-O and I would slurp it up with a straw (seriously drinking Jell-O with a straw was fun, try it)."
Ok so I thought I was the only one on the face of the earth who did this....LOL kudos to you..my husband looked at me as if I were absolutely insane when I told him about eating jello with milk over it..and I put an extra sprinkle of sugar..
I did a search for "milk & jello" and your blog came up. We've always teased my dad because grandma used to serve him jello with milk on top. Somehow, my husband hadn't heard the story until a few days ago and called up my father in absolute horror. I wanted to see if my dad was absolutely crazy or if it was a generation-thing. By the way, he also puts maple syrup on vanilla ice cream. Thanks for the laugh, and my dad will thank you for the verification!
I punched "jello with milk" into google and this is where it took me.
Great story! I just finished eating Jello and milk.‘IT’S A MESS': True The Vote executive director Catherine Engelbrecht says “radical special interests” can game the electoral system.
By Kenric Ward | Watchdog.org
RICHMOND, Va. —,” Engelbrecht asserted.
“The few conversations that are had about how to shore up these weaknesses are immediately seized on by certain politicians and special-interest groups as fuel to further divide American voters based on trumped-up race and class-based narratives,” she said.
Engelbrecht said the “vicious cycle” can be fixed “if citizens wake up, stand up and refuse to settle for a broken system.”
Jay DeLancy, executive director of the Voter Integrity Project of North Carolina, says the solution is as simple as one-two-three.
“First, tie registrations more closely to (each state’s) Department of Motor Vehicles. All voter ID cards would originate there,” he explained.
“As is today, when we get an ID card from DMV, we get registered to vote — but turning in your former state’s ID card should revoke your right to vote in the state that issued it.
“Second, make it a felony to possess a voter ID card — or any other DMV-issued ID card — from more than one state.
“Third, we would only be allowed to vote from the address on that ID card. If a voter shows up with the wrong address, the vote is provisional until the card is corrected,” DeLancy concluded.
He added: “We don’t need a federal ID card to do this. In fact, it wouldn’t require any more feds to be hired.”
States, however, will have to tighten up. And that could be a challenge — both politically and fiscally.
In Virginia, Wheeler noted that the State Board of Elections and Department of Elections “have had their funding reduced greatly by the (Terry) McAuliffe administration.” McAuliffe.

No worries, I'm not actually dying; but, I just read this funny / sad article over on the New York Times titled, "In Web World of 24/7 Stress, Writers Blog Till They Drop." It talks about the tremendous pressure that professional bloggers feel to pump out blog posts even milliseconds ahead of the competition in order to get the bigger traffic share and therefore the bigger ad revenue share. Now, I believe this article focuses on those who blog for money (in a paid-per-post kind of lifestyle), but after reading it, I think most anyone who blogs on a regular basis can sympathize at least somewhat with the mania that takes over. Apparently, in the last few months, three famous bloggers have had heart attacks resulting in two fatalities (only one of them, Om Malik, actually survived).
That's totally bananas! I like to think that I maintain my sanity fairly well; sure, I my life lacks balance, but that's due to a whole host of reasons (not just blogging). For me, I think the biggest trick to maintaining sanity is to only allow myself to blog at certain times. I find my really creative juices are flowing from like 7am to 9am, before work, so, that's when I blog and do a sizable chunk of my research and development. And, for those of you who stop here often, you might remember that I don't even have the internet at home - this way, when not in the office, I can only think about blogging. I know most people these days cannot even imagine being off the grid at home, but, I'll tell you, when I get home and slip into something comfortable without the temptation to surf the web looking for por- er um, ColdFusion articles, it's pretty gosh darned relaxing.
Maybe the blogging world should take a que from the beer advertising world and start suggesting that people, "blog responsibly".

A kanban board shows the set of tasks still waiting to be completed as a status board with colors showing the status. The board is designed to help team members get a clearer picture of which items are overdue or causing delays when using Scrum or kanban agile methods.
The board has been added to Team Foundation Service in recognition of the growing interest in the kanban methodology, according to a blog post by Brian Harry, Microsoft technical fellow for TFS. He says:
"Now you can manage your project with Scrum, with kanban, or you can combine them to get the best of both by using kanban visualize the flow of your Scrum backlog items. Scrum and kanban are both work management strategies that involve breaking down a problem and then visually transitioning work through a series of states."
You can watch a video of the board in action:
The addition to Team Foundation Server is less pretty but possibly more useful. It is a set of command-line tools called Git-tf to make it straightforward to use a local Git repository.
The tools will mean you can check out a project from the server into the local Git repository. You’ll then be able to use git commands to edit, commit, revert, branch and merge the repository. The changes can then be synced back to the TFS server using Git-tf. Microsoft has also launched a Git-tf open source project on its Codeplex project site.
The thinking behind the addition of the tools was explained by Brian Harry in another blog post where he outlines a situation where most of a development team are working in Visual Studio or Eclipse, but at the same time there are developers."
The plan is that support for Git-tf will also be added to Team Foundation Service.
There is a video to watch:

Meal Plan: Let’s Add More Greens
Trying to keep your children's diet healthy and tasty is a great feat in today's world. Fast food restaurants serve as quick fixes and, yes, they do provide apples instead of fries these days, but that doesn't replace a healthy home-cooked meal. However, many kids do not like eating their fruits and vegetables and instead want their Top Ramen Noodles, which pull a zero on the healthy and nutritious scale.
One thing I realized from watching those families whose children enjoy their veggies, they have their children eating veggies from a young age and also combine some of their favorites with veggies, like using Ramen Noodles in a Stir-Fry with broccoli and peas.

Tips for reducing the risk of harmful infections.
While biologic medications have revolutionized the treatment of many kinds of arthritis, like all drugs, in addition to their benefits, they come with new risks. Biologic drugs work by suppressing the immune system, an action that can open the door for infections.
We asked Arthritis Today Medical Advisory Board member Robert Shaw, MD, an instructor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University and a practicing rheumatologist, what precautions people with arthritis should take before starting a biologic medication. Here is his checklist:
1) Have a skin or blood test for tuberculosis, or TB.
Experts estimate that 90 percent of people who are infected with tuberculosis, which can cause a deadly infection, don’t know it because the bacteria can lie dormant in the body for years. Taking medications that suppress the immune increases the risk that the infection will become active.
2) If you need any live virus vaccines, get them one to three months before starting biologics.
Flu vaccine injections are dead viruses and can be given anytime. But any live virus vaccine needs to be given one to three months before starting immunosuppressant drugs. Discuss how to handle live virus vaccines with your doctor, including:
• Flu Mist vaccine, which comes in nasal form
• Shingles vaccine
• Measles, mumps and rubella vaccines
• Typhoid, varicella, small pox and yellow fever vaccines for people who need to travel
3) Finish antibiotics before starting a biologic.
Anyone with any infection or fever who is on antibiotics should not start a biologic until the infection and fever have passed because your immune system is impaired.
4) Wait if you are going in for surgery.
Dr. Shaw says patients going in for surgery should hold off on biologics like etanercept (Enbrel) and adalimumab (Humira) for two weeks before surgery and they should hold off on infliximab (Remicade) and abatacept (Orencia) for four weeks before surgery. Additionally, patients should not start or restart the biologics until after their sutures or staples are removed and there is no sign of infection because biologics will make it harder to heal.
5) Get scanned before you take rituximab (Rituxan).
Dr. Shaw says patients should have a Hepatitis B scan before going on Rituxan because the drug impairs immune system cells called B cells and that predisposes people to hepatitis. If you are harboring the Hepatitis B virus, it will make you worse.Food Blog Roundup: 02.20.07

In short, I found ANTLR fiendishly difficult to use, so for a simple task like this, especially one where parsing is *not* going to be a bottleneck, the simplest possible solution (parsing with hand-written Ruby) is going to be the best one.

Fragrances are used more often by people in Spain (94%) compared to France (88%), Brazil (84%) and GB (76%). Chinese people use fragrances the least (just 12%).
Other findings from the Kantar study include:
• In Spain, Great Britain, Brazil and Russia it’s the younger audience that wear perfume or aftershave whereas in Egypt, Turkey and China young and wealthy adults predominate.
• Europe is a fairly stable market with growth driven by new product innovations. Consumers in France are more likely to be interested in the latest products and a bit of expense whereas in Spain luxury brands appeal.
In Brazil and Russia, intensive development of specialized distribution has helped the fragrance category flourish. For example, in Brazil more older male consumers are using fragrances and those consumers spending more than $40 a year went up from 7% to 13% between 2009 and 2012. In Russia, between 2010 and 2013, more consumers began to use perfumes across all ages and social classes. Beauty outlets were visted in 2013 by over one quarter of the Russian adult population.
According to Kantar, consumers in the Middle East buy what they can afford. The introduction of cheaper and unbranded offers has left luxury brands in a vulnerable position. And while the tradition of wearing a fragrance doesn’t really exist in some Asian markets, the demand for perfume is being slowly developed by global brands. In China perfume use is generally reserved for the higher social classes, particularly young women (15-34 year olds) who like to keep up with the latest fashions (55% v’s 48% of the average population). They are also more likely to travel by plane or own a tablet.

Rand Paul courts the black vote
If the GOP was seen as a party of genuine free enterprise (I know, don’t laugh), which made the case to all people that free markets and free prices generate prosperity and that government intervention and cronyism lead to stagnation and despair, the party could make serious progress with non-white voters.
Political entrepreneurs vs the real entrepreneurs
We are regulating our economy to death. One of the main reasons why there is an increasing disparity in wealth in this country is that the crony class is wrapping the middle class and the merchant class – the entrepreneurial class – in red tape. Pay a tax here. Pay a fee there. Do you have a license to do that? It is harder and harder to build a business – something which is plenty hard to do without the crushing weight of the state.

Abstract
TAPIA GRANADOS, José A.. A reduction in automobile traffic: an urgent health promotion policy. Rev Panam Salud Publica [online]. 1998, vol.3, n.3, pp. 137-151. ISSN 1020-4989..
During the last few decades, traffic injuries have become one of the leading causes of death and disability in the world. In urban areas, traffic congestion, noise, and emissions from motor vehicles produce subjective disturbances and detectable pathological effects. More than one billion people are exposed to harmful levels of environmental pollution. Because its combustion engine generates carbon dioxide (CO2), the automobile is one of the chief sources of the gases that are causing the greenhouse effect. The latter has already caused a rise in the average ambient temperature, and over the next decades it will predictably cause significant climatic changes whose consequences, though uncertain, are likely to be harmful and possibly catastrophic. Aside from the greenhouse effect, the relentless growth of parking zones, traffic, and the roadway infrastructure in urban and rural areas is currently one of the leading causes of environmental degradation. Urban development, which is nearly always "planned" around traffic instead of people, leads to a significant deterioration in the quality of life, while it also destroys the social fabric. Unlike the private automobile, public transportation, bicycles, and walking help reduce pollution, congestion, and traffic volume, as well as the morbidity and mortality resulting from injuries and ailments related to pollution. Non-automobile transportation also encourages physical activity¾with its positive effect on general health¾and helps reduce the greenhouse effect. The drop in traffic volume and the increased use of alternate means of transportation are thus an integrated health promotion policy which should become an inherent part of the movement for the promotion of healthy cities and of transportation policies and economic policy in general.Definitions

He was a nondescript fellow, in his shabby suit, but with an eye bright and unwinking as a bird's questing over me and missing nothing, and while he wasn't above middle height I guessed that anyone who ran into him would come away bruised.
But the unwinking stereo-eyes of the autopilot fed its data to the 'brain'; the submolar mechanism selected and rejected; the Ship grounded gently on a rolling high prairie near a clump of vegetation.
But the rat-trap mouth was still the same, and that unwinking half-blue half-brown eye boring into me.
In terms of thematic scope, narrative complexity and unwinking bleakness, both its ambition and its achievement were extraordinary.

Mr Baptist, never taking his eyes from his dreaded chum of old, softly sat down on the floor with his back against the door and one of his ankles in each hand: resuming the attitude (except that it was now expressive of unwinking watchfulness) in which he had sat before the same man in the deeper shade of another prison, one hot morning at Marseilles.
At dinner she maintained her watch, with the same unwinking eyes..

Chevron Corp. has reached agreements to acquire two adjoining parcels of land totaling 61 acres in Moon Township.
The California-based oil and gas giant confirmed the properties were acquired "as a potential site for a new regional headquarters office campus."
A spokesman for the company confirmed that the properties include a Kmart store on 22.5 acres in Moon Township that suburban Chicago-based Sears Holding Corp. (Nasdaq: SHLD) announced last week will close in June. He added the store location and a neighboring 40-plus acre parcel comprised the total site Chevron is working to buy.
The Pittsburgh Business Times reported in February that Chevron was under contract to buy the 43-acre tract from Roy F. Johns Jr. Associates.
According to the company, Chevron (NYSE: CVX) plans to complete the transactions in the next few months and make a final decision on the future use of this land later this year:
"Chevron is pleased to have been offered the opportunity to acquire this land, which provides us with a potential location as we continue to evaluate our options for a regional headquarters facility," said Bruce Niemeyer, vice president of Chevron’s Appalachian/Michigan Business Unit, in a prepared statement. "We are committed to this community, to contributing to a vibrant regional economy, and to producing energy supplies that will fuel this region and our nation for generations."
Sources have told the Pittsburgh Business Times since early 2012 that Chevron planned to build a new office campus of at least 150,000 square feet in size, if not much larger.
The company ranks as one of the largest natural gas producers in this region and one of the largest oil and gas companies in the world. Chevron reports that it employs around 650 people in Pennsylvania, with nearly 400 located in two separate office buildings in Moon Township.:

You are out in Alaska. You go into a remote area during the spring. You set up a base camp for a couple of months. When the time comes and you are ready to go, and you're actually trying to leave, you discover that the river you crossed a couple of months earlier, while coming in, has now swollen because of the warmer weather and increased snowmelt. The current is way too strong, and the crossing is much too dangerous.
You can go back to the base camp, but you've lost some weight and food is low. You can forage and hunt, but it isn't easy and there might not be enough calories. If you can make it for another couple of months, the river will be lower and passable again.
So one option is to wait it out.
The actual person (who was in this situation) decided that he was trapped. There may have been some other alternatives to those he had in mind, though.
So the challenge is this: if you were in that situation, and decided to leave rather than wait, how many ways can you think of that might get you out of the situation?
(One other aspect: you aren't carrying any electronic devices that would allow you to make calls.)
How many possibilities, how many ways out can you come up with?Everything you need to understand or teach Our Father by Marilyn French.
Despite the grim premise and the repeated assertion that their father's acts ruined each woman's life, the novel's theme is positive. Stephen's many marriages and his deliberate acts to isolate them meant the sisters grew up apart. In the case of Elizabeth and Mary, they knew one another but each was full of envy of the other. Yet when the women meet as adults, their individual, cautious revelations and honest reactions to each other gradually overcome their suspicion. The four have vastly different incomes, lifestyles, and sexual or marital status, the signals by which the outside world most often judges and classifies women. But their bond of blood and shared experiences ultimately leads to mutual love.
Stephen's mechanisms of control: secrecy, rage, isolation, power plays backed with money, are defeated once their objects start talking to one another honestly. His death, once his daughters bluntly confront him as a...
(read more from the Short Guide)Scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported today that the average temperature across the contiguous United States in April was 55 degrees F -- or 3.6 degrees F above average.
Further, 2012 is now the warmest year on record to date and the last 12 months are also the warmest on record since record keeping began in 1895, according to a NOAA news release.
In all, more than 300 locations in the United States had a daily warm temperature which was the warmest on record for April, according to data from the NOAA National Climatic Data Center (see map above).
The map shows that not only were many monthly records broken, but many of them were broken by a large margin – well over 1 degree Fahrenheit. Plotted in the image are locations of the broken records for the highest monthly maximum temperature during April, along with shades of red indicating by how much the record was broken.
Of course, it felt abysmally worse after a record-warm March, making it seem as if it were Spring in Reverse, temperature-wise anyway. It was only the fourth time on record -- and the first time in nearly 70 years that April in Cleveland was cooler than March on average.
That same phenomenon occurred across Ohio and seven other states: Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.
The weird spring followed what has come to be called "The Winter That Wasn't" around here -- the warmest three-month winter on record in Cleveland. The average high temperature this past winter was 44.5 degrees -- that's nearly 8 degrees higher than average, according a Plain Dealer analysis of 141 years of temperature data kept by the National Weather Service.
The 12-month period of May 2011-April 2012 has a nationally averaged temperature 2.8 degrees F above the 1901-2000 long-term average, while the January-April 2012 months were 45.4 degrees F, 5.4 degrees F above the long-term average. That made the winter of 2011-12 the fourth warmest on record, according to NOAA.
Climatologists and environmental groups have been quick to remind that both the U.S. EPA and the International Panel on Climate Changeboth have said weather extremes were likely to result from a warming global climate -- even with regional variations.

President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt is the latest to produce a set of ideas, which he is sharing with President George W Bush at the presidential retreat, Camp David, this weekend.
The special welcome to Camp David is a calculated diplomatic move, designed to show Mr Mubarak the sort of favoured treatment that Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia received when he met President Bush at his ranch in Texas a few weeks ago.
There is an element here, also, of calculated rivalry between the Arab leaders. By presenting his own plan, President Mubarak is keeping up with the Saudis, whose recent initiative was warmly received by the Americans.
So this is the state of diplomatic play.
President Mubarak is proposing a timetable, leading to the declaration of a Palestinian state next year.
But he accepts that many of the toughest issues would have to be left for decision later: the boundaries of a Palestinian state, the status of Jerusalem, and the return of Palestinian refugees.
"I think to declare a state just theoretically like this and then to sit and negotiate what would be the borders, what about Jerusalem - I think it may work," Mr Mubarak told the New York Times.
The Saudi peace initiative is almost equally vague. Under Crown Prince Abdullah's plan, the Arab world would offer "normalisation" of relations with Israel, in exchange for a return to the 1967 borders.
The Israeli Foreign Minister, Shimon Peres, has his own ideas as well. He wants the early declaration of a Palestinian state on the land currently controlled by the Palestinian authority, with negotiations to follow on the final borders and other issues.
Plans are flawed
All the ideas have merits, but all seem fundamentally flawed as well.
The Palestinians are most unlikely to accept Mr Peres' idea for fear that their state would never expand beyond its initial borders. In any case Mr Peres is considered a marginal figure within the Israeli cabinet.
The Saudi proposal for normalisation of relations is a step forward, but still leaves almost everything up for negotiation.
The Egyptian plan looks the most bizarre. It is difficult to see how a state could be declared, when no one agrees where it is or who are the citizens.
Then there is the position of the two most powerful players in this game, Israel and the United States.
Once again the Bush administration is wracked with division.
The pragmatists at the state department are working on a peace conference to be held some time this summer. They do not want to dismiss out of hand the idea of a timetable for peace.
But on the other side are the hard-line supporters of Israel, Vice President Cheney and Defence Secretary Rumsfeld, who are deeply sceptical of dealing with any Palestinian body led by Yasser Arafat.
President Bush himself has said that after his meetings this weekend with President Mubarak and the Israeli leader Ariel Sharon he will lay out his own ideas.
"I will talk to our country about how I think we should move forward," Mr Bush told reporters.
A senior administration official gave some more details. He said it would be misleading to look for a "Bush plan".
"What we are considering," he explained, "and I would stress that no decisions have been taken at this point, but what we are considering is laying out some ideas, perspective, principles, parameters about how we might move forward to realize the president's two-state vision."
But all of this delicate diplomatic two-step is heavily dependent on events on the ground. More suicide bombings could blow away all of these negotiations.
They would question, once again, Yasser Arafat's ability or commitment to ending violence from the Palestinian side.
Many in Israel believe Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is waiting for just such an opportunity to expel Yasser Arafat from the Palestinian territories. And that would put an end to this current flurry of diplomatic activity.Thanks for stopping by! You’re probably here because you are interested in interior design or getting organized- me, too! First, let me say two things about design:
- Interior design does not equal expensive, frivolous luxury. If you have an interior why not arrange it to suit your needs, style and purposes? You do not need to spend thousands of dollars to have your home look good and function efficiently.
- The design of your home should reflect YOU; not current trends, not what your designer likes- it should reflect your likes and your family’s needs. You should feel comfortable and content in every room.
I believe that you do not need to live locally for me to help you design your home. I do offer full service design for locals, but I also offer what I call “e-design”. Check out my services page to see how it works and let me know if you have questions!
I would love to have the opportunity to help you feel calm and collected in your living space.
At this time I offer two types of organizational services to people in my local community. I can do straight-up organization and move management. Straight-up organization is simply helping you determine what to keep and where to keep it. I do not “make you” throw anything away. But I will be honest with you- no one can fit 100 cubic feet of belongings into 20 cubic feet of space. I work with you to help you figure out what should be kept and what should go.
Move management is organization in combination with a move—usually downsizing. Before you move, I help you figure out what to take and what to keep. If you have the dimensions for your new place, I will draw up floor plans so you will know where exactly each piece of furniture will fit in the new place and what needs to be given away, sold or donated. This will save you the expense of moving items that you won’t use in your new place and help your movers know just where to put everything!
Thanks for visiting my website! I’m glad you’re here! How can I help you?Posts Tagged ‘Jerome C. Rousseau’

The Parable of the Talents: Embracing the power of imperfect actions
This past Sunday found many of us discussing the parable of the talents. This parable is especially powerful to me because of what it teaches about God’s plan for us. God’s plan—at this stage—is not about a particular set of outcomes being credited to us. Instead, God wants us to join with Him in sculpting our will and internal resources toward ends He knows will lead us to realize our full potential. In other words, the Gospel is about our “becoming” through imperfect actions under God’s guidance. In the parable, the master praises the servants who acted to increase... Read more »March 15, 2014

It was so lovely: hardly any people, no screaming kids, no long lines: just peace and quiet. I did not have a grocery list in mind and just picked random produce, flowers, and new shampoo. Then I decided to get a package of ground pork and figure out what to do with it.
That's when I remembered one of my most popular posts: Spicy Turkey Meatballs. It has been pinned more than 3K times!! {Those are big numbers for me.}
I decided to do something similar with the ground pork and that's how Asian Pork Meatballs with Teriyaki Glaze came about. {Thanks Cindy for the idea of adding teriyaki.}
Asian Pork Meatballs with Teriyaki Glaze
Makes 12 meatballs
Ingredients
1 pound ground pork
1 egg
2 garlic cloves, microplane'd
1" fresh ginger, peeled and microplane'd
splash of soy sauce
splash of Worcestershire
splash of water
2 tablespoons chopped cilantro
pinch of red pepper flakes
peanut oil
Teriyaki sauce
sesame seeds
Directions
1. Combine the first 9 ingredients and form them into meatballs. I recommend using a cookie scoop to keep the balls uniform.
3. Once the balls are brown, drizzled the teriyaki sauce over them and continue to cook until the balls are cooked through (test one to make sure!).
4. Sprinkle the balls with sesame seeds.
These were incredibly flavorful and gorgeous. Don't you agree?
To serve, I made a quick Three Pepper Salad: yellow, red and green peppers mixed with red onions, cilantro, sesame seed oil, a bit of salt and sesame seeds.
This was a filling and pretty lunch!
What would you have done with ground pork?

New York, NY, November 27, 2012: As the holiday seasons approach, Japan is ready to greet a new year with more new hotel and transportation facilities, serving visitors to more cultural beauty and excitement to visitors from all over the world in 2013.
While the city witnesses a lot of redevelopment projects,InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) is adding a new property in Osaka in August 2013. Located in Osaka's latest redevelopment zone in north yard of the city's train hub Umeda station, the Osaka InterContinental Hotel accommodates 215 guest rooms occupying 17 floors of Grand Front Osaka building. Grand Front Osaka consists of 3 commercial towers, and the Inter Continental Osaka will become the most accessible hotel to Osaka's urban experience with shopping, dining, business, and major train service to nearby cities such as Kyoto, Kobe and Nara.
The US gains more gateways to Japan along the West Coast in 2013.
- Delta Air Lines have announced a new non-stop service from Seattle, but this time, to Haneda, Tokyo's inner-city airport. The inaugural flight is scheduled in March 2013.
- All Nippon Airways (ANA) adds a non-stop service from the West Coast. On January 11, 2013, the new service connects San Jose and Narita with Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
- United Airlines starts non-stop service between Denver and Narita on March 31, 2013.
A new airport is opening in Okinawa, Japan's tropical island region. Ishigaki Island, one of Okinawa's remote islands, is getting Shin-Ishigaki Airport as a new gateway to this unique yet tranquil southwest beach paradise of Japan on March 7, 2013. Ishigaki is famous for world's best scuba diving spots, unique island culture and lifestyle, and breathtaking nature.
Japan's train culture takes one step further in 2013. Starting in October 2013, the Bullet Train system (a.k.a. Shinkansen) in Kyushu (southwestern island) adds unique first-class train cars on the train track. The car is designed with retrospective style and full of regional craftworks and traditional designs. Called the Seven Stars Cruise Train that serves in 7 prefectures of Kyushu, the train takes passengers to Kyushu's richness such as hot springs, natural beauty, culinary culture and local hospitality..Following our factcheck on the cost of clinical negligence claims against the NHS, Full Fact were contacted about the number of instances of clinical negligence versus those which give rise to a court case. In particular, in the House of Lords Lord Beecham claimed that:
“The noble Lord, Lord Wigley, referred to the rather alarming statistic that 10 per cent of National Health Service patients in any year suffer from clinical negligence.”
Full Fact could not locate Lord Wigley’s exact reference to this statistic. However, Lord Wigley does make the claim that “there are about one million adverse accidents in the NHS every year”, arguing that there was a much smaller number of instances resulting in a clinical negligence claim and subsequently there was little evidence of a compensation culture, so we assume this is what Lord Beecham refers to.
The claim that 10 per cent of patients suffer from clinical negligence can be traced back to evidence given to the Health Select Committee by Professor Richard Thomson in 2008.
Professor Thomson states that “around 10% of admissions to hospital suffer some form of harm but more associated with medical management than with the underlying disease processes. That figure is seen internationally in other developed healthcare systems”.
Professor Thomson cites a study in 2001 by Professor Charles Vincent into the number of patients experiencing ‘adverse events’, reviewing medical notes for 1014 patients. 110 patients experienced an adverse event, giving a rate of 10.8 per cent.
An adverse event is defined as “unintended injuries caused by medical management rather than the disease process” – a much broader definition than that used by the courts for clinical negligence.
Furthermore, the NHS Litigation Authority outlines a two-part test for clinical negligence, whereby negligence has occurred if:
- The doctor (or medical professional) must have acted in a way that fell short of acceptable professional standards
- Their actions must be shown on the balance of probabilities to be directly linked to the harm suffered
In particular, the first requirement that the actions of the party responsible must have fallen below acceptable professional standards is not taken into account when defining ‘adverse events’. It is also possible it will not be present in some of the cases found in the NHS’s favour, although cases without this element are unlikely to be brought before the courts.
The Whole Government Accounts give figures for the amount paid out for clinical negligence claims, and therefore are not subject to the same distinction.
Nevertheless, members of the House of Lords appear to be using the terms interchangeably, potentially undermining their arguments about ‘no win, no fee’ arrangements. This is apt to cause a certain amount of confusion about what the figures actually mean.Browse for words starting with simulacrum

It might even be said that I have a bit of an intellectual crush on her. So imagine my delight when I found myself in Twitter conversation with her. Imagine my epic joy when she sent me a copy of her book Manhattan Dreaming after I entered her Valentine’s Day tweet-off with a very silly reference to venereal disease (GET IT?!!!! ZOMG I AM SO WITTY).
I thought about writing a review of this heartful and hilarious page-turner. However, I’ve never been the book club type (put another way, much of my life is taken up with the laugh-a-minute, never-ending book club that is scholarship). So, I couldn’t resist the opportunity (raised by @fairerfields, who shared the VD loot) to write some ‘book club notes’ for Manhattan Dreaming. Behold!
– What is the role of friendship between women in Lauren’s journey ‘from Manuka to Manhattan’?
– How do family and community matter in Lauren’s story?
– What helps Lauren to find love, respect and romance in her life?
– What does that love, respect and romance look like?
– How is Lauren’s story a Koori story? an Australian story? an international story?
– What is the role of communication technology and social media in the relationships in the book?
– Reading the book, when were you surprised? Why were you surprised?
– Heiss’ Mr Right and Dreaming books have been labelled ‘chick lit’, ‘Koori lit’ and ‘Koori chick-lit‘, with Heiss herself earning the nickname Koori Bradshaw à la Sex and the City. How fitting are these labels?*
– Check out** the work of some of the visual artists and musicians that Lauren promotes in her job as a senior curator.***
*Heiss’ characters have much better sex than the SATC ladies IMHO.
**I know, not a question. But you won’t regret it.
***My personal favourites include Destiny Deacon and The Last Kinection.
I was lucky to get a copy too with a tweet I can’t even remember anymore… rest assured, yours is far more witty. :)
Great questions you’ve got and wouldn’t it be nice to actually explore all of them. What I will sort-of answer is the ‘chick-lit’ one and comm’n tech.
I don’t read chick-lit and have been accused of being a literary snob. I think “Manhattan Dreaming” does fall into this category but with moments of deep insight particularly relative to art and family. Personally, I would have preferred more of the latter and less of the ‘chick-lit-ness’. I would have preferred more dialogue about art between Lauren and her colleagues. But I’m sure Anita chose this genre and stuck to it with skill. I’m quite curious to read her non-chick-lit books now.
The book would make fascinating discussions on social media and if not for the “adult” content, would love to do so with high school kids. Maybe HS kids read chick lit as they watch SATC show/movie. Hmmm….
Anyway, thanks for this platform to share some thoughts on the book.
3 cheers for Anita as well for her generosity and wit.
Hey thanks for your thoughts Malyn! I love the idea of high school readers engaging with the book alongside SATC.
And/or maybe Anita could add some “YA fiction” to her writing arsenal!
Great questions to start a discussion!
(I was a tweet winner too.) I think writing Anita off as Chick Lit actually does her a disservice. Or rather I think the labelling of women writers like Anita as Chick Lit authors, undermines the value of their literary contributions.
This was so much more than a modern day love story for the modern girl. She touched on issues of Identity, cultural appropriation, colonisation, politics, and whole host of other indigenous issues. (Though she didn’t delve into them too deeply. To do so would have damaged the story, but the fact that she did mention them helps to open those topics up for examination. )
Where SATC tends to revolve more closely around relationships and navigating relationships with work and other desires, Manhattan Dreaming is about that and all those other things I mentioned. SATC is much less inclusive of all women. So you could say MD is a little more multicultural.
It’s also nice to read a book about Indigenous women who break the stereotypical moulds. In MD we have no less than 3 strong Indigenous women characters. Anita’s book is more than just entertaining. There’s a whole dialogue happening beneath the surface.
I too, can’t wait to read her other books. And yes, I agree, I think she would be able to do YA particularly well.
Awesome.
“there’s a whole dialogue happening beneath the surface” – now that’s entertainment! ;-)

FILM REVIEW; The Ex-Con Is Determined to Go Straight, but . . .
As ''The Yards'' grimly wends its way toward a sudden surprise ending that's corny enough to cap a 1940's Warner Brothers crime story, it is impossible not to admire the film's epic ambitions, thwarted though they may be by the final spasm of nobility. But until that moment, ''The Yards,'' directed by James Gray (''Little Odessa''), impresses as one of the few films in recent years to dare to tread in the sacred shadow of Francis Ford Coppola's ''Godfather'' movies. For that kind of nerve, it deserves points.
With its candlelit chiaroscuro, its hushed family pow-wows, and a dark, churning score by Howard Shore that consciously echoes Nino Rota's and Carmine Coppola's original music for ''The Godfather,'' ''The Yards'' aspires to the same towering evocation of a shadow world within the one we know.
James Caan, the original Sonny Corleone, is conveniently on hand to infuse ''The Yards'' with his smiling-cobra charm as Frank Olchin, the corrupt captain of a hugely profitable business repairing New York subway cars. Frank, who has grown rich and arrogant from a bribery and kickback scheme that involves the Queens borough president (Steve Lawrence), lives in a mansion whose interiors are bathed in the same eternal dusk that dimly glows inside the Mafia castles of ''The Godfather.''
Mr. Coppola's classic films aren't the only obvious forerunners of ''The Yards.'' Often the movie recalls Sidney Lumet's gritty New York dramas of the 1970's and 80's. Some of its punchiest scenes show politicians, labor organizers, businessmen and policemen thrashing out issues and haggling for pieces of the pie. As these men in their cheap suits and bad dye jobs jockey for advantage, ''The Yards'' portrays New York City politics as a sweaty back-room world of shady deals and mutual back-scratching. If that world feels authentic, it also seems slightly out of date in these yuppified times.
Finally, there are those sentimental old-time prison movies that ''The Yards'' updates with its Coppola and Lumet-influenced touches. According to the formula, a good-hearted ex-convict back on the streets and determined to go straight finds himself led astray along a path from which there is no turning back. The only cliche missing is a concerned streetwise priest.
The dirty-faced angel suckered back into the criminal life in ''The Yards'' is Leo Handler (Mark Wahlberg), a street kid who served his time after taking the fall for a group of friends involved in an auto theft ring. Earnestly played by Mr. Wahlberg, who speaks his role in a near-whisper, he is a chip off James Cagney's block. As Leo endures one personal disaster after another, you know he will end up either a martyr or a hero, and you root for him to be saved by a miracle.
In old-time Hollywood style, ''The Yards'' also gives Leo a long-suffering, physically fragile mother of the sort that the Cagney character would call ''Ma,'' as in ''Aw, Ma!'' Val (Ellen Burstyn) who has been living for her son's return, is the kind of doting but perpetually weepy mother whose heart condition dramatically improves or worsens depending on the fortunes of her fugitive boy.
Val also happens to be the sister of Frank's wife, Kitty (Faye Dunaway). No sooner has Leo returned from prison than he has a job interview with Frank, who promises him low-level work as a repairman once he completes the requisite training. Leo, who is less than enthusiastic about such prospects, wonders how his best friend, Willie Gutierrez (Joaquin Phoenix), who also works for Frank, has money to burn.
He soon finds out. When Willie takes him along on his rounds collecting payoffs for Frank, he invites Leo to be a partner. Leo can't resist the easy money. One night, Willie invites Frank to accompany him to the Queens subway yards, where trouble breaks out between competing contractors. In panic, Willie commits a murder, while Leo nearly kills a policemen who tries to prevent him from fleeing.
As the incident balloons into a scandal that threatens Frank's business, Leo goes into hiding and finds himself gradually cut off and eventually named the chief suspect in the killing. Adding emotional complications is Willie's engagement to Frank's beautiful stepdaughter (and Leo's cousin), Erica Soltz (Charlize Theron), who was Leo's teenage sweetheart.
''The Yards'' is held together with so many narrative nuts and bolts it sometimes feels clogged with machinery, and as the story unfolds, the screenplay frantically tries to sketch in crucial details with little bursts of exposition. That rush to fill in the blanks takes its toll. And when ''The Yards'' builds to a moment of Greek tragedy near the end, it feels more forced than cathartic.
But for all its incongruities, ''The Yards'' is a serious film that strives for a moral complexity and a textural density rarely found in contemporary dramas. Its greatest asset is Mr. Phoenix's incendiary Willie. Hot-wired with ambition, every nerve twitching with impatience, his eyes ablaze, he is the personification of upward mobility run amok, an impassioned young man so desperately on the make he could explode at any second.
''The Yards'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has scenes of violence and profanity.

What makes you think that fat knobby rubber tires screaming down a "fragile desert trail" (in your words) does not do as much or more damage to trails than horses hooves? I seem to recall pictures of the historic Oregon Trail showing wheel ruts in the trail not ruts from horses hooves! Maybe "its not as good as it used to be" because of mountain bike traffic and lack of trail maintainence by the undermanned and underfunded Forest Service! And further more what makes you so elite as deny people the right to enjoy natures beauty at a much slower pace by partnering with one of nature's "noble creatures." This seems more natural than bicycles.
We all enjoy natures beauty in different ways. We should be smart enough to learn to work together to ensure that the beauty and solitude that wild areas provide all of us remains for future generations to enjoy.Written by Anthony Browne, described as the paper's chief political correspondent, and Lewis Smith who gets the lowly title, "environment reporter", the strap informs us that, "Scientists demand ban on North Sea cod fishing" and that, "Years of tougher quotas have failed to revive stocks".
The story is garbage.
Its thrust is that people described by the paper as "scientists" are saying that a complete ban on cod fishing is the only way to prevent the species from dying out in the North Sea.
These are from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), a highly partisan group of official scientists who represent the orthodoxy of fishing science. They are telling us that the "much-trumpeted European rescue plan for cod" (devised by them – although we are not told this) is failing.
We always knew the plan would fail – it never had a hope in hell of success and the only commercial fisheries which have successful managed their stocks are those which have ignored ICES advice.. but then we have Mr Anthony Browne, chief political correspondent, telling us that "the bycatches are difficult to avoid because cod are bigger than the other fish and no method has been devised to catch the other fish without scooping up cod in the process."
It is difficult to deal with this. Said as neutrally as possible, we can only say that this is not true. In fact, it is a total, absolute lie. And so is the following from The Times:
However, Mireille Thom, the European Commission spokeswoman for fisheries,."
But such measures are beyond the wit of the EU, which then spouts lies to the likes of The Times, from which it gains aid and comfort as their gullible hacks print the garbage they are told.
Then, to add insult to injury, the paper finishes up its report by citing a spokeswoman for the Marine Stewardship Council, "which encourages sustainable fisheries", saying that the ICES warning should be heeded: "It's the best scientific advice people can get."
As we wrote though, pity the poor readers. How are they supposed to know this is the garbage it is? Perhaps Mr Montgomerie might do a piece on it tonight?

Hurney would have a job if the right players where in Carolina.....they aren't. That means new GM will most likely do a lot more than just draft a new class to add to the Hurney bunch.
Reason why have struggled so often isn't having the wrong superstars....but IMO the rest of the roster is weak. We have had bad depth and weak 2nd tier players.
I don't think that the issue is that he couldn't find talent or even get the right guys. The problem is that he failed to meld his idea of wanting to keep guys like Stewart and Williams with the offense continuing to run a run-heavy scheme. Chud and Hurney were on opposites ends of the spectrum as far as what they were doing. Since it was Hurney's thing to manage he was let go.
Based on the injuries we have had to key plays and how the backups played the past few weeks, the depth looks pretty good..

So will records keep tumbling as people get fitter and technology takes off? Or is there a limit to human performance?. But athletic performance does not depend solely on physiological processes, and improvements in other factors have helped us to far exceed the limits previously placed on human performance.
Causes of athletic improvement
Other factors contributing to athletic performance include psychology, nutrition, training methods and technology. Over the past few decades, leaps and bounds in each of these areas have advanced athletic performance.
Technology is constantly evolving. In swimming, there have been major advances in the design of Olympic swimming pools, reducing turbulence and improving performance. Olympic pools are now deeper, have ten lanes instead of eight, and anti-wave lane ropes.
But it was the advent of “super suits” (pictured above) in 2008 that caused the greatest improvements in performance. The super suits used polyurethane material to reduce drag and improve buoyancy: 255 world records were broken during the two years they were deemed legal.
The suits enabled swimmers to sit in a higher and more streamlined position in the water, and took away the advantage held by swimmers such as Michael Phelps, who naturally sat higher in the water. The suits were finally banned in 2009; but world records set by athletes using super suits have been allowed to remain.
As a result, world records since the super-suit era have been, and will continue to be, few and far between.
Doping and performance-enhancing drugs have been obvious contributors to improvements in athletic performance. As our knowledge of the human body and the processes limiting athletic performance increases, so does the ability to illegally alter these processes to enhance performance.
Gene therapy is now being used to treat diseases associated with muscle wasting and weakness, but it may also be exploited to enhance athletic performance.
Constant improvement
Whether a ceiling to athletic performance will ever be reached depends on many variables, discussed below:
1) The first of these is the type of event. In sprint events - where physiological factors are the main determinant of performance - it’s possible we’ll one day reach a ceiling of human performance.
But this is based on what we currently understand about the limits of physiological and biomechanical performance. There’s a lot about the human body that we still don’t understand, and improvements in our knowledge may reveal new limits to athletic performance.
Performance in endurance events doesn’t just rely on physiology and biomechanics. Because other variables are continuously evolving, it’s likely to take longer for a ceiling to be reached on endurance performance. We may never get there.
2) The answer also involves technology and the limits that are placed on technological advancements. In sports that rely heavily on technology – such as swimming and cycling - a ceiling might not be reached if limits are not placed on the magnitude of performance enhancement that new technology can bring.
3) A third variable involves doping and other illegal performance-enhancing practices. The success of the fight against doping depends on scientists' ability to come up with tests to detect doping.
This can be problematic when the doping involves manipulating proteins that are normally present in the human body. As long as the authorities remain one step behind those developing the latest doping technologies, it will be difficult for a ceiling on human performance to ever be reached.
4) Finally there are athletes, such as Usain Bolt, who have a physique and running technique we have never seen before, and all of the ceilings that we put on normal physical ability are simply thrown out the window.
There is no doubt improvements in athletic performance have slowed down; but with athletes such as Bolt, and advancements in technology and our understanding of the human body, a ceiling to human performance still seems a long way off.Brad Pitt to make cameo appearance in `22 Jump Street` sequel

SCC31
Standards Coordinating Committee 31
- One of the driving forces behind the organization of Utilimetrics in 1986 was the need for standardized interfaces between Automatic Meter Reading (AMR) devices. Founding members recognized the importance of creating guidelines that promote the manufacture of interoperable equipment and reduce the risk of equipment obsolescence. In 1990, industry leaders began work to establish interface standards when the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) approved a charter for Standards Coordinating Committee 31 (SCC31). The committee now has several subcommittees and working groups that focus on areas such as security, communications interfaces and information transfer. Utilimetrics provides financial and administrative support for SCC31, and participants pay for travel expenses to in-person meetings. An international group of technical experts who represent utilities, vendors, consultancies, research organizations and educational institutions participate in the standards-development process. IEEE approves and owns all finished standards.

SCL
Substation Configuration Language
- The Substation Configuration Language (SCL), IEC61850, defines the interrelationship of the substation equipment to each other and to the substation itself. Although the substation object models define each of the devices in the substation, these device models do not define how the models are interrelated. The SCL uses a standard file format for exchanging information between proprietary configuration tools for substation devices. This standard is based on Extensible Markup Language (XML), and draws on the data modeling concepts found in the other parts of IEC 61850, and the capability of the IEC 61850 protocols to “self-describe” the data to be reported by a particular device.

SHA
Secure Hash Algorithm
- The Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-1) developed by NIST, is required for use with the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) as specified in the Digital Signature Standard (DSS) and whenever a secure hash algorithm is required for federal applica- tions. For a message of length < 2^64 bits, the SHA-1 produces a 160-bit condensed representation of the message called a message digest. The message digest is used during generation of a signature for the message. The SHA-1 is also used to compute a message digest for the received version of the message during the process of verifying the signature. Any change to the message in transit will, with very high probability, result in a different message digest, and the signature will fail to verify.
The SHA-1 is designed to have the following properties: it is computationally infeasible to find a message which corresponds to a given message digest, or to find two different messages which produce the same message digest.

SIPS
System Integrity Protection Schemes
- SIPS is a concept of using system information from local as well as relevant remote sites and sending this information to a processing location to counteract propagation of the major disturbances in the power system. With the increased availability of advanced computer, communication and measurement technologies, more “intelligent” equipment can be used at the local level to improve the overall response. Traditional contingency dependant / event based systems could be enhanced to include power system response based algorithms with proper local supervisions for security.

Solid Oxide Fuel Cell
- Solid oxide fuel cells differ in many respects from other fuel cell technologies. First, they are composed of all-solid-state materials--the anode, cathode and electrolyte are all made from ceramic substances. Second, because of the all-ceramic make-up, the cells can operate at temperatures as high as 1,800 degrees F (1,000 degrees C), significantly hotter than any other major category of fuel cell. This produces exhaust gases at temperatures ideal for use in combined heat and power applications and combined-cycle electric power plants. Third, the cells can be configured either as rolled tubes (tubular) or as flat plates (planar) and manufactured using many of the techniques now employed today by the electronics industry.

Its then-taboo subject matter, including a blatant frankness about homosexuality and drug usage, led to a obscenity trail against the book's publisher. The film will chronicle Ginsberg's trial and controversy. Jeff Daniels, Mary-Louise Parker, Paul Rudd and Oscar nominees Alan Alda and David Strathairn round out the cast (thus far). Each play a character associated with the trial. The role is a major coup for Spider-Man star Franco, who has been anointed "the next big thing" for a while but is capitalizing on that potential in a big way this year with a raved comedic performance as the stoner with a heart of gold in Pineapple Express. He will next be seen in the Nicholas Sparks adaptation Nights in Rodanthe, and will appear as Sean Penn's partner in the biopic of gay politician Harvey Milk in Gus Van Sant's Milk. Van Sant, incidentally, will serve as a executive producer on Howl. Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman will direct their first feature after making a number of documentaries (including one on none other than the aforementioned Milk).Ginsberg was briefly portrayed by a bearded David Cross in last year's Bob Dylan-inspired biopic hybrid I'm Not There.

Blog: I'm back!
Hello, everyone! It was almost three months ago that I left work, had a baby and stayed at home to take care of him, and while I miss him so much, it feels good to be back doing what I love and working for an industry that I truly admire.
So, what did I miss while I was gone?
Well, I missed two big carwash shows. And, it looks like both went really well. The Northeast Regional Carwash Convention had its largest showroom floor ever and attracted more than 1,300 attendee. The San Diego show seemed to also have good numbers. What does this all mean? Well, I wonder if people are optimistic about 2013. I remember saying I was optimistic about 2012 and it looks like it was a "good year" for folks. Not to generalize, but often, good numbers at the tradeshows, indicate the carwash industry and market are doing well, too.
So, here at PC&D, we are gearing up to put out 12 more top-notch magazine issues for 2013. The team here has put in months and months of research to determine what it is you would like to see and read about next year. If fact, I have seen the early stages of the January 2013 issue and its remarkable. If there is anything you would like for us to cover in upcoming issues, please write to me at dgorgos@carwash.com.
In the meantime, I hope you're all enjoying this festive and generous time of year.
It's good to be back!

You spelled your last name wrongBurnsville Public Library wins the Marshall Cavendish Excellence In Library Programming Award
For Immediate Release
Wed, 04/06/2011
CHICAGO — The American Library Association (ALA) is pleased to announce that the Burnsville Public Library, in Burnsville Miss., is the recipient of the 2011 Marshall Cavendish Excellence In Library Programming Award.
This award, donated by the Marshall Cavendish Corporation, honors a school or public library that demonstrates excellence in library programming by providing programs that have community impact and responds to community needs. Advocacy, partnerships and creative of use of resources, regardless of the size of the library, are taken into consideration.
The Burnsville Public Library receives this honor for two outstanding programs – their Library Model Aircraft Program entitled ALOFT: A Learning Opportunity – Flight Technology, and their instructional program for youth to raise awareness of common ruses used by child abductors entitled SAFE: Stop Abductions Forever.
According to Jury Chair Tim Grimes of the Ann Arbor (Mich.) District Library, it was especially noted that the Burnsville Public Library has a staff of only one librarian with some part-time help. The librarian, Robert Forbes, is responsible for both ALOFT and SAFE programs at the library.
The ALOFT program, which targets 4th- through 8th-grade students, helps to correlate math and science concepts learned in school with practical applications in model building. Sessions are taught by librarian Robert Forbes, who is also a Mike Monroney Aeronautical Institute FAA Certified Instructor. Students read the model plans, then select and install the appropriate material. The models are completed with a silkspan or monocote covering and are installed with rubber, electric and fuel powered motors.
Throughout the project, plan reading, theory of flight, aerodynamics, weather, building and flying techniques are taught. The program operates daily after school, and models are flown on Saturdays at the Burnsville Sports Complex or at Iuka Airport. The project has numerous local partners including banks, the TriState Educational Foundation, WalMart, local physicians, the Town of Burnsville and the Friends of the Library.
The SAFE program depicts several scenarios of the most common ruses used by child abductors. These simulations are play acted and filmed using home video equipment and are complimented by two actual live abduction videos.
The program, aimed at preteens and teens, was begun due to the number of increases in child abductions nationwide and due to five recent local incidents involving students of the Burnsville Elementary School and the surrounding area. Sessions are taught by Robert Forbes, who is also a trained 911 operator. Recipients of the project include the 21st Century Community Learning Center, Iuka and Booneville Mississippi Boys and Girls Clubs, a 4H Club, several churches and a local Girl Scout troop.
The Marshall Cavendish Excellence In Library Programming Award includes $2,000 and a 24k gold-framed citation, donated by the Marshall Cavendish Corporation. Other members of the 2011 jury were Karen Apland, Santa Clara County Library in Gilroy, Calif.; Dr. Barbara A. Burd, Coastal Carolina University in Myrtle Beach S.C.; Denise Kwan, Chicago Public Library; and Dawn Zeig, Renaissance Oak Elementary School in Mahwah N.J.
The 2011 Marshall Cavendish Excellence In Library Programming Award will be presented at the ALA Award Ceremony and Reception Tuesday, June 28, during the 2011 ALA Annual Conference, which runs from June 23-28 at the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center in New Orleans.
The deadline for submissions of applications for the 2012 Marshall Cavendish Excellence In Library Programming Award is December 1, 2011. Guidelines and application forms are available on the ALA website.

Common Ground for Connected Lives Sermon Series
As we conclude our series “Common Ground for Connected Lives”, the reality is … this is only the beginning of a beautiful new chapter of cultivating the common ground we have with one another, sharing common ground with our city, and finding common ground with people who are far from God.
Through this series God has brought about profound unity around much more than building a facility, but around being the church we were created to be! In light of that, if you’ve missed any of the five messages, please take some time to visit our website by clicking here and be encouraged by the stories of how Jesus engaged a wide variety of people with the transformational message of the gospel.
We’re praying that God would use us in this next season to influence our world like never before! May He grant us favor as we follow hard after Him and devote ourselves to cultivating common ground.

Auckland City Council is considering building a multimillion dollar Māori Tourism centre on the waterfront to attract tourism.
The basic problem is authenticity – Maori didn’t live in high tech waterfront buildings with electric lighting; they lived in well-established pa sites.
A Maori/Polynesian cultural centre is a fantastic idea but only 10 minutes’ drive from the International airport is an ancient Pa site on Mangere Mountain.
“Would it not be more logical to rebuild the Pa site on Mangere Mountain and show off Māori culture in its true form so tourists can walk around the site and experience this rich diverse culture?”
Most European tourists don’t come to New Zealand/Aotearoa to experience Europe recreated in the South Pacific with casinos and yachts – they come here in part at least to experience Polynesia and discover what the world was like prior to the age of European seafaring.
This tourist trap on Mangere Mountain could potentially change the economy of Mangere Bridge.
Mangere is the first place people from all over the world people first arrive in New Zealand so why not have free buses transporting them to the ancient Pa site of Mangere Mountain and afterwards encourage them to enjoy our cafes in Mangere Bridge. This would pour millions of dollars into the local economy and could employ many youth in and around the new development in roles such as providing Kapa Haka performances and acting as tourist guides and even staging mock battles of a Pa site invasion.
The CBD doesn’t have the Māori population to support such a centre but there is an entire Māori community in and around Mangere to support such a venture.
The role of the local board is to provide employment and create a tourism industry without Tangata Whenua participation at decision level there is a lack of enthusiasm for Maori tourism and history.
Such a venture could also encapsulate the Polynesian cultures from Tonga, Samoa, Niue and the Cook Islands with the main draw card being the medieval Pa site.
If elected this is one of the many new ideas myself and Mana will be bringing to the table at Auckland City Council.

TUDOR STAR has ultra-consistent recent form, two seconds and two firsts from her last four starts, the last victory being the Aloe Handicap over 1300m at Arlington. She just failed to overhaul SCENTED ASH over seven furlongs at Arlington last time. The pair finished over five lengths ahead of the third placed runner and the top rating is now 4kgs better off with her conqueror. She has gone close over the mile and should be a tough nut to crack.
THE MAGIC KINGDOM is seldom beaten far but has become a costly horse to follow. She had excuses for her last run and stays a mile but may still have her work cut-out for her to reverse the form.
COUNT TO TEN is visiting from the Cape and hasn't raced since flopping with blinkers in a Grade 1 at Kenilworth in early December. She showed potential winning two of her four previous starts and hails from an in-form yard. Her local trainer usually brings his runners back well and she will be a force.

LUNAR MOON is another of Justin Snaith's visiting Cape runners. The daughter of Var landed the gamble with a good victory over subsequent winning stable companion, Only Emily on debut and then stayed on nicely for fifth behind the same rival on Met day. She hasn't raced for six weeks since but takes a big drop in class and should relish today's extra furlong.
Having said that, she will have a race on her hands and the Greeff runner, WINTER FANTASY is a big threat. This daughter of Western Winter is the stable elect and she was outrun late by YOSHIE on debut over 800m in December. She returned from a ten week break with a vengeance as she thrashed her rivals by 5.50 lengths over the minimum trip, two weeks ago. There isn't much doubt that she will strip much fitter this time around and the extra 200m should pose little problem for her.

Victoria Zegler/Photo Editor Attorney Daniel O’Neil looks toward the family of William Lord Merrill as Merrill via TV during his arraignment Tuesday morning. Merrill, a former CMU education professor, is charged with three felonies related to child pornography.
Disgraced Central Michigan University professor William Lord Merrill, 58, was sentenced to 70 months in prison Tuesday at U.S. District Court in Bay City for possession of child pornography, according to court documents.
Merrill, who taught, among other courses, classes on Internet censorship at CMU, was arrested for possession of more than 100,000 images of child porn on Dec. 19.
He was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Thomas Ludington.
He entered a guilty plea in March, admitting to receiving child pornography. In exchange for the guilty plea, federal prosecutors dropped a second charge of the same crime and another count of child pornography possession.
Merrill could have faced as much as 20 years in prison. Instead, he will serve just above the minimum sentence of 60 months.
He resigned from CMU in November after being suspended by the university.
According to court documents, Merrill knowingly received child pornography on or about July 26, 2003, and he said he knew the material constituted child pornography as defined by Title 18 in the United States Code 2256.
The FBI seized Merrill’s hard drive from his CMU office, in addition to the hard drive that contained child pornography.
Additionally, the U.S. attorney agreed Merrill assisted the authorities in his prosecution by notifying authorities in a timely manner that he intended to plead guilty. then sent to Bay City.

I think maybe he is finding the same thing. He is now on a motorcycle trip and I am delighted for him.
4. How have you practiced self-care in the last couple of days? Hum. Well, I've started taking some supplements to help with night sweats. While they don't seem to be doing much (so far), I am now having and remembering lots and lots of vivid dreams. Taking some time to sit with those, after waking up, feels like self-care.
Also, I am now a devotee of the Egoscue Method for stopping chronic pain.

Jerry Sandusky’s Son Arrested for DUI (Mugshot)
by Greg Smith | Posted on Wednesday, October 9th, 2013
Early Tuesday morning, Jerry Sandusky’s son Jon was arrested for DUI. The Cleveland Browns Director of Player Personnel was initially pulled over for an illegal turn per TMZ:
36-year-old Jon was initially pulled over in Fargo, ND early Tuesday morning after cops say he made an illegal turn. During the stop, cops suspected he was hammered tried to administer a breathalyzer test … but Jon refused.
Instead, cops ordered Jon to field sobriety tests — and he clearly didn’t perform well enough, ’cause he was immediately arrested for driving under the influence.

It is not a temporary solution, otherwise you

versions. And why should a manufacturor release
any specs if he can just use the API indefenitly?
Jeroen
Why didn't you asked this on the linux-kernel mailinglist????
If you had read some archives of linux-kernel you
would know why this doesn't work:
1 A 'stable' api means that you will be stuck with
old mistakes for a long time, there is a reason
why kernel interfaces change, namely to make them
better.
2 You are making it easier for the manufacturors
to make binary only drivers, and thus they will
never need to give their specs away. This might
work well if you have a popular system. But don't
expect them to release a driver for x86, ppc, arm,
mips, superh or whatever linux runs on this week.
3 You already don't have to work on the kernel for
writing a device driver, when making a modular
driver you only have to know a few kernel
functions that you have to call.
I have written several drivers and know almost
nothing (but learning) about the inner works of
the kernel.
4 Building layer upon layer upon layer will make
your driver slower and slower and slower.
5 Most important: Linus doesn't like it :)

Some engineers don’t agree with state
As state officials rushed to reassure drivers unnerved by yet another problem in the Big Dig tunnels and Representative Stephen F. Lynch called for a federal investigation, engineers said yesterday they found it hard to believe that thawing soil alone could have caused a sinkhole to open beneath the Interstate 90 Connector.
Joseph Sopko has frozen ground for the construction of the Silver Line tunnel under Russia Wharf in Boston, a giant gold mine in Ontario, and sewage tunnels in Milwaukee. He said the earth around those projects has never settled by 8 feet, as it has around the I-90 tunnel.
“Those numbers are just way out of line,’’ said Sopko, an engineer who was not personally involved in the I-90 project but who works for Moretrench, the company that did the freezing there. “I did my doctoral dissertation on ground-freezing, and I just can’t see, mathematically, how you can get that kind of compression.’’
David K. Mueller, an engineer and vice president at Moretrench who worked directly on the I-90 project, said 8 feet of settlement was more than he had seen in the 30 frozen-ground projects he has worked on.
“On most of the ground-freezing projects we’ve done, we’ve never seen any settlement,’’ he said.
Workers used chemicals to freeze the ground 11 years ago, allowing them to build the tunnel without the soil caving in. They completed the freezing process in 2002 and said they expected some settlement to occur as the ground thawed. But state officials said the ground has receded twice as much as they anticipated.
Though they say they are not sure what caused the problem, they disclosed Wednesday that the thawing soil has left a sinkhole below the roadway that has filled with water because the area is below the water table.
Engineers have not been able to see the sinkhole because of the tunnel’s remote location, 60 feet below ground, but have estimated that it could be 4 feet deep and up to 190 feet long. They say it poses no threat to drivers because tests show the tunnel could span the gap like a bridge over a river.
They plan to fill the space with concrete once the area is completely thawed, sometime in late 2013 or early 2014.
The state has spent $15 million to date to monitor the situation and has budgeted $10 million more for repairs. The money comes from a $485 million fund set up by the Big Dig’s contractors to avoid liability for the fatal tunnel collapse in 2006, leaks, and other problems on the project.
“We’re confident the tunnels are safe, and they can withstand any of these stresses for as long as necessary and well beyond their service life,’’ said Frank DePaola, the state highway administrator. “We’re not going to let the void stay there for that long just for durability and longevity. But it could. Very similar to a bridge spanning a river, it stays there for 50 to 75 years.’’
Mel Levy, a retired tunnel engineer for the New York City Transit Authority, speculated that the tunnel may not be resting evenly on its base. That, he said, could cause the tunnel to bend and stress.
“The problems are more serious than they’re talking about,’’ he argued.
Lynch said he has asked the Federal Highway Administration to join the state in conducting a thorough inspection.
“Due to the high volume of commuter traffic using this roadway and the public safety issues involved, due diligence requires that we obtain a structural assessment to reassure the public that the situation is safe,’’ the congressman from South Boston said in a statement. “The safety of the public must be our top priority.’’
Engineers have been freezing the earth for excavation projects for more than a century, but the I-90 Connector was one of the largest such projects ever. Officials chose to use ground freezing so they could build the tunnel under the train tracks into South Station without disrupting rail service.
“Ground-freezing is, without a doubt, the most expensive approach,’’ Sopko said. “But it’s for projects that can’t be done any other way.’’
Andrew J. Whittle, a soil engineer at MIT and member of the state Department of Transportation board, said the state needs to find out why the ground has settled that much, so it can hold the proper contractor responsible.
“I can’t see how thawing would produce this movement alone,’’ he said. “There must be something else at play, and it probably is worth investigating.’’
Whittle offered one theory. He noted that workers have had to place 8 feet of rock under the train tracks into South Station to keep the tracks level as the ground there has settled. He said those rocks could be pressing the soil down.
“The fact that there are eight feet of stone on the surface is the piece that people have missed,’’ he said. “Eight feet of stone is a lot of stone and, for sure, that could drive this. “
DePaola, however, dismissed the idea that those stones weigh enough to depress the ground.
Thomas C. Sheahan, a civil engineer at Northeastern, said the soil itself could be a factor because it is mostly Boston Blue Clay.
“From a soil point of view, it loses some of its strength’’ when it is dug up during construction, he said. “This phenomenon of the sensitivity of the clay could be leading to additional settlement than would normally be predicted.’’

Ernie Els reacts on the 18th green after finishing with an eight-under-par during the final round of the Masters golf tournament at the Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Ga., Sunday, April 11, 2004. Phil Mickelson won the Masters with a nine-under-par.
AP Photo AUGUSTA, Ga. -- Munching on an apple, working on his putting for a playoff that would never come, Ernie Els watched helplessly as the Masters moment he's dreamed of disappeared.
While Phil Mickelson celebrated victory with his family, Els gave his putter a dejected flip and walked away, an aching void in his heart that only a win at Augusta National will fill.
"It's very tough for me to explain how I feel right now," a somber Els said Sunday night, after missed birdie putts on the 17th and 18th holes left him one stroke behind Mickelson. "I just said to my wife and my dad, 'I gave it my absolute best, especially today.' I'm very disappointed now, but I'll get over this. I feel like I'll win a major this year.
"I would have loved to have won this one."
The 34-year-old is one of the best players of his generation, already a three-time major winner.
But the Masters had felt all week that this was finally his year, and it seemed as if he might be right after making two eagles in a closing 5-under-par 67, his best round of the week. But just like in 2000, when he finished second to Vijay Singh after squandering birdie chances on his final three holes, it wasn't meant to be.
The pain would be the same, regardless. But adding to the agony was the 20 minutes he had to wait between his finish and Mickelson's approach to the 18th green. Els couldn't bear to watch, knowing there was absolutely nothing he could do.
"You've done what you've done. I played as good as I could. You're just ..." He paused, trying to find the right words. "You're there in another guy's hands."
And after falling spectacularly short so many times, Mickelson finally broke through. He drained an 18-footer for birdie to win his first major, setting off a raucous celebration on the green as Els quietly slipped away.
"I'll have another shot," he said. "I'm sure of it."
But he will wonder about these missed opportunities. Beginning the day three strokes behind Mickelson and Chris DiMarco, Els' game was sputtering until an eagle on the par-5 No. 8 gave him the lead.
His second shot hit a ridge on the left side of the green and trickled down to settle 5 feet from the hole. He had to scramble to save par when his second shot on No. 9 went six rows into the gallery behind the green, but he made it look easy with a chip shot a few feet below the pin.
He moved to 7-under -- two strokes ahead of Mickelson -- with another eagle on the par-5 13th, knocking the ball to 12 feet from 206 yards out. He followed with a gutty save on 14 after driving into the trees.
Then came what might have been the defining two holes in the tournament, had he won. On a slope behind the 15th green, Els chipped within 1 foot, tapping in for a birdie that put him at 8-under.
At 16, he left himself 45 feet on a huge-breaking, right-to-left downhiller. He ran the first putt 10 feet past but made the comebacker to save par.
"I was trying to push," he said. "I was hitting the ball very solid. I was feeling so good out there, I felt I could have birdied every hole the way I was playing."
But he didn't. He two-putted from 17 feet on the par-4 17th, then missed a 25-footer by eight inches on 18. As the ball skittered past the hole, a grim look crossed his face.
"I'm going to look myself in the mirror tonight and say, 'Well done,'" Els said. "It's one of those things. That's golf. I've had some good wins and I've had some tough losses, and this is one of the tough losses."

The historical ties or ‘twin towns’ are another part of Deptford’s rich history and we were proud to be able to show them the great progress we’re making on site.
Step into our arches…Wednesday, March 4th, 2015
Today we opened our site in Deptford and invited businesses and local start-ups to get an early look at the new commercial quarter. The scaffolding is already down on several of the restored arches and the shape of the new Market Yard is really starting to show. But we couldn’t just invite people for a look round without a colourful Cathedral welcome. We turned the site safety kit shelter into a pink coloured living room and we talked all things commercial over hot coffee served up by the Dungarees coffee team. A busy and enjoyable morning in SE8.

Spirit of Sittingbourne
In early 2011, as part of the Spirit of Sittingbourne consortium, we were selected by Swale Borough Council as their development partner to regenerate Sittingbourne town centre in a £46m mixed-use scheme which is designed to breathe new life into the town and its local economy. We’re going to build a new station square to transform arrival in the town, a new cultural quarter, civic quarter with a new library, brand new public realm throughout the town centre and residential schemes, all of which will generate £326m of economic improvement over the next ten years and create around 790 jobs.
The Deptford Project
In summer 2008 we installed a 1960s commuter train carriage into a site next to Deptford High Street train station in south east London. We put it there to kickstart a £47m mixed-use PPP regeneration scheme in partnership with the London Borough of Lewisham. Currently under construction, the scheme includes a new residential building, restoration of an historic Victorian carriage ramp and a newly landscaped market yard.

Case in point: I ♥ Huckabees.
I had a free movie pass to view the movie last weekend. In short and without verbal pomp, it sucked. It was stale, tired and gimmicky. Although the casting was great (Dustin Hoffman, Lily Tomlin, Jude Law, Naomi Watts, Mark Wahlberg), the script was trite, unfunny and boring beyond belief. Sorry David Russell, but you’re trying too hard to be quirky and offbeat.
There were a few genuinely funny moments, mostly coming from Wahlberg. The former Marky Mark, was the best thing about this movie. He was cast as a paranoid post-9/11 fireman obsessed with the wasteful use of petroleum. But his moments were not enough to hold this soulless shell of a movie together.
Furthermore, I cared nothing for the characters, especially the main one, Albert a cloying poetry environmentalist played by Jason Schwartzman. He was so annoying I wanted to kick him, or at least give’ him a heaping helping of successive pimp slaps. In the one scene that was interesting–when Albert’s mother is confronted for her insensitivity to the death of his cat when he was young, there was a moment when I thought, “oh this might get interesting.” You see the mother blew him off to hang out with a female friend in the kitchen when he needs attention upon learning about his deceased feline. I thought they might have been lovers or something and were gettin’ on and little Albert had interrupted her love in the afternoon session. Then the whole family would’ve found out years later that his mother had been having a lesbo affair. But no, that didn’t happen. I sighed and slumped deeper into my seat wanting to throw popcorn at all the hipsters laughing so hard at the Seinfeld-type humor I hate.
Thank goodness I saw the movie for free. I would’ve been mighty pissed if I had shelled out coins for it.Powered by SidelinesSouthampton midfielder Adam Lallana is just one of a number of Southampton players being linked with a move elsewhere
Southampton’s good start to their Premier League campaign has raised the profile of some of the Saints star players.
The club from the south coast have three players in the England squad for the friendlies at Wembley against Chile and Germany.
Talisman and striker Rickie Lambert almost now seems like an old hand at international level compared to newcomers Adam Lallana and Jay Rodriguez, but the former-Rochdale striker has only made three appearances for Roy Hodgson’s team
Deserved
Lallana and Rodriguez are deserving of their call-ups to Roy Hodgson’s England squad. Both players impressed in spells last season, but in recent months seem to have found a consistently high level of performance.
In fact, Rodriguez is probably the Saints most in-form player in recent weeks. The former-Burnley star has done well to keep his place in the Saints team, after the arrival of fellow attacker Dani Osvaldo looked set to hand him stiff competition for his place.
Rodriguez has been switched from a central striking berth to a role on the wing in recent months and he has thrived. The striker of Spanish descent could now make his England debut with Manchester United forward Danny Welbeck pulling out of the squad through injury.
Lallana has been one of Southampton’s best performers for the past couple of seasons. Lallana was previously called-up to the England squad for the World Cup qualifier against Ukraine, but the midfielder did not get onto the pitch.
Circling
The good performances of some of Southampton’s players this so far seem to have the Premier League vultures circling over the Saints best players. Lallana, Rodriguez and even full-back Luke Shaw have all been linked with moves away from St Marys in the last week.
According to the Daily Mirror, Arsenal and Liverpool are looking to make a move for Jay Rodriguez in January, while the Metro claims that full-back Luke Shaw is on Tottenham’s transfer wish list. The Metro are also linking Lallana with move to Liverpool.
Building
The speculation about the players proves that they are playing well. However, Saints boss Mauricio Pochettino is building for the future. I am sure that the Argentinian would not be happy if a number of his key players were sold.
Comfortable
Southampton are not a club that are poor or need to sell players. The Saints are financially comfortable and unless stupid offers come in for their best players I doubt that the club would even entertain them.
Positive
There is also the question of whether the players would actually want to leave St Marys. Something really positive has been taking place at Southampton over the last few years and many players will be encouraged by the way the club have gone about their business in recent years.
The clubs owner and board are ambitious and want Southampton to go to the very top. The appointment of Pochettino as manager has proved an absolute masterstroke. The Argentinian has the club playing some superb football, and more importantly the Saints are winning games.
All signs point to a positive future for the club from the south coast. That may well be enough to keep the likes of Shaw, Lallana and Rodriguez happy.
Academy
The Southampton academy has a fantastic success rate over the last decade. Lallana, Shaw and midfielder James Ward-Prowse are all graduates from the academy. All three are regulars in the team.
The biggest product of the Saints academy is Real Madrid’s Gareth Bale though. The Welshman became the world’s most expensive player when he moved from Tottenham to Los Blancos this summer in a deal worth £85million.
The Southampton board has big plans for the academy and they are hoping that in the near future the majority of the Saints first team players can be brought through their own youth system. That means that the club could eventually be almost self-sustaining, which would be a major advantage in these harsh financial times.
Happy
With Southampton going well in the Premier League, the in-demand players seem happy with the Saints. They have no need to look at moving clubs. The grass is not always greener on the other side and I really hope that the Saints keep hold of all their best players.
Can Southampton keep hold of their key players?Current search

X-rays will help orthodontists see how your teeth currently align and point out any areas that could be corrected through orthodontic treatment. (Photo by Katie Jacewicz)
Orthodontists are dental professionals who build fabulous smiles for children, adolescents and even adults by bringing teeth into proper alignment through the use of braces and alignment techniques. Many people believe straightened teeth look better and give people more confidence in their appearance.
Why and when should you see a specialist?
How do you know if you need orthodontic care? Even teeth that seem straight may have an improper bite. Here are several factors to consider:
- Difficulty when chewing or biting food
- Crowded teeth or teeth that protrude
- Upper and lower teeth that don't align properly
Most parents feel that the time to see an orthodontic specialist is between the ages of 9 and 14, but the American Association of Orthodontists recommends that your child get an orthodontic checkup no later than age 7. Evaluating teeth at an early age prevents serious problems later on and makes treatment less complicated.
What can you expect on your first visit?
At your first visit, the specialist will check how well the teeth align through a visual exam. Sometimes a mold (impression) is made. X-rays are used to view the jaw and bone structure. At this time, a decision on whether a dental appliance is needed will be discussed. Wearing braces puts continuous pressure on teeth, which in turn keeps them in a straighter position. The professional will determine the type of braces and time frame according to what needs to be corrected.
For the most effective care, it is important to keep all orthodontist appointments. Don't forget routine cleanings and checkups with your regular dentist.
How can you partner with your orthodontist for a healthy smile?
Wearing a dental appliance is a serious investment of time and money. The end goal of a better smile is not just up to your orthodontist. Kids and parents, as well as adults with braces, must take an active role in their care to achieve the desired results. If a patient has poor oral hygiene, plaque can build up around and under the brackets, bands and wires. Because of this plaque, white scars may appear permanently on your newly straightened teeth.
Is there any restriction with food?
Avoid any hard, sticky and chewy foods, which can damage the dental appliance and lengthen treatment time. It's best that cookies are broken into pieces rather than bitten into. Rinse your mouth with water after eating any sweets, and brush your teeth daily--at least twice with a soft toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste. Use a fluoride rinse at night at well.
What precautions should you follow after removing a dental appliance?
An orthodontist will fit you with a retainer when your dental appliance is removed. This helps to make sure your teeth do not shift out of place. Make sure to wear a protective mouth guard when participating in sports. Too many teeth are knocked out through injuries, accidents or rough play.

On a blog, it’s perhaps a boon. People read your posts, feel good about what they have just experienced. The like your post, share it and leave a “wow” comment. Elsewhere in life, it may not always work very well.
Feedback, for example.
In this over-sensitive world we are often reminded about providing constructive criticism. Especially at work.
[I stopped after the sentence above for a long while, thinking about how this post would automatically be construed as insensitive if I wrote exactly what I had in mind. I thought of ways of how I would sensitise the post so that it wouldn’t sound insensitive. I spent time searching for what the accepted definitions of constructive criticism are.]
Which brought me back to the problem: because constructive criticism, to me, in the simplest form, is to help someone understand what’s wrong and how it could be made better. Our tone and choice of words influence the reception of our feedback (or criticism); fair. Unfortunately, as I see it, constructive criticism has come to mean an endless shower of a niche sugar-coated vocabulary that’s peddled as appropriate. A straightforward no (which means just that) is often seen as harsh and negative as we allow ourselves to become denizens of this over-sensitised sub-section.
The advantage of a straightforward response is clarity. And while the person giving feedback has certain responsibility, the person receiving it has equal responsibility. Words, tone and body language will play their part – feedback is more important to the one who receives it.
Would you like it upfront (and possibly crude and rude) or do you want to buried under a dump of dishonest sweet talk?
rude and crude…that’s what i go for with a big smile on my face,Mostly in a sarcastic way. I would like to have it the same way. All the sweat coating is tastes bull shit to me.
Did 1year in an IT job just like that. :)
:) Praveen, the ‘rude and crude’ was for effect, what I was essentially leaning on is straightforward feedback about the work.
Now that I am not working, telling the same as ‘rude & crude’ gives me the ‘In your face’ feeling….;). I was always the smiling & friendly one.My team loved sarcasm. LOL
Interesting post, and I have a slightly different perspective on this.
From my perspective, I don’t see it as a binary, and therefore mutually exclusive choice – this is specifically with regard to your last sentence, which concludes your post.
Constructive criticism does not involve the art of sugar-coating a bitter message, IMO. That would certainly be disingenuous, if not downright dishonest, and would be no different from “politically correct venting”. And above all, it would constitute a disservice to the person being thus criticized (as opposed to being critiqued).
For one, constructive criticism should aspire to be objective, not subjective. True, it may still be subjective in the sense that it is one’s own personal opinion, but when I say “objective” I mean that it should stay focused on the “object” that is being appraised/ critiqued, rather than the “subjects” involved i.e. rather than express one’s feelings about the object, or about the person responsible for creating that object. The ability to separate these things is a fundamental skill involved in being a constructive critic.
Further, is important to adopt the goals and frame of reference of the person responsible for the object under appraisal, leaving aside one’s own goals and frame of reference, or even the goals and frame of reference one may think that person ought to adopt. (It is not about “us”, it is about “them”.) Unless, of course, the person explicitly asks – “what would you do in my place?” and in that case one may start by commenting on whether or not one might even set such goals for oneself. That said, the critique should focus on where the object under appraisal falls short of the goals of that person, and balance it with where it already meets or exceeds those goals.
Then there’s the art of delivering unpleasant feedback. As I progressed through my career and learned to lead large teams, I taught myself how to deliver “tough” messages (mostly by trial and error, and by watching other more experienced leaders) – as a manager is required to do while discussing a team member’s performance assessment. The idea here is to focus on areas for improvement rather than to disparage poor performance, much as one may find the latter very tempting to do. A profound understanding of the fact that nobody is perfect helps in staying focused on this goal. It’s about sharing one’s outlook for the future based on an objective, fair and balanced review of the past. Specificity, data points and examples help in making a solid case for recommendations for improvement. (“Here’s where you can improve and here’s how better to handle it in future”.) Pragmatism and empathy are key.
Thanks for reading a rather long comment!
P.S. The ability to use words well (what you started out with in your post) is a boon when it comes to “the art of delivering unpleasant feedback”, if the objective is to be honest while causing the minimum pain. Which is a good objective to have :)
Completely agree there. Sometimes, however, I have seen adjectives take the life out of the essence! (what I referred to as ‘training’ in my previous reply) :)
As I said on Facebook, I don’t disagree with what you said – in fact – you have a presented a very practical and usable approach to providing feedback.
This post was primarily written in the perspective of delivering unpleasant feedback;especially of telling someone that the work wasn’t done well. (After having provided necessary guidelines to get the work done).
In my experience, it takes two for a feedback to be constructive. Mostly, people receiving feedback are defensive and feel the need to present their side of the story (which is not a bad thing, in fact it lends perspective to the process of feedback). In a defensive state, the choice of words matters less, because usually the the objectivity that you mention is not present on both sides.
I have seen most managers being ‘trained’ in the art of providing feedback; I have not come across any such initiative to train folks in the art of receiving feedback.
Also, I have often seen (and been disappointed) that managers are asked to ‘soften the blow’ – and they resort to sugar-coating which buries the essence of the message. My rant was primarily agains that @ sugar-coating – which, as you have put beautifully – “would certainly be disingenuous, if not downright dishonest, and would be no different from “politically correct venting.””
Thank you for your comment and the conversation it has ensued.
I had a long convoluted thought process within myself as I read this post, and thankfully, Hemant has brought it out so well that I wish I wrote the comment. I agree that providing constructive criticism or honest positively-intended feedback is an art, and is learnt over time. I like it blunt when receiving a feedback, but while providing it I will have to consider the context (the recipient, the setting, the subject/topic, the objective, the surrounding value system, and so on) and decide whether to be blunt or indirect or even sarcastic.
Hemant has indeed added zest to this conversation! It’s interesting how you put it – that you like to receive feedback in a blunt manner – but will consider the context when providing feedback. As I mentioned in my reply to Hemant, the problem as I see it, is that very few will ever consider the context of the person providing the feedback. :)
I can’t handle crude or rude. I prefer it sugar coated even if I am aware that there is a sugar coating. It’s just who I am.
:D “I’ll de-coat it myself, you say?”
A bit late, but here’s a really cool article (with illustrations) which sums up a bunch of stuff on the subject. Far more effective in getting the point across than my verbose and lengthy comment above :)
Cute! :D (and very clear)Because liver cancer and diseases such as cirrhosis rarely have symptoms until they are in advanced stages, it’s extremely important to get your liver tested regularly. Most of these tests are painless and only take a few minutes.
Frequently, your doctor will do a combination of liver tests especially if you are having symptoms or are considered at risk for liver disease or cancer.
You should have your liver tested if you:
• Are Male, aged 50-60 and of Hispanic, Island Pacific, Asian or Native American
• Have a history of alcohol abuse
• Have jaundice, or yellowing of the skin or eyes
• Have a distended and/or tender abdomen
• Have an auto-immune disorder
• Have Hepatitis
• Bruise or bleed easily
In the following paragraphs, you will learn about the different kinds of liver tests and what to expect when you undergo them.
Liver Ultrasound
A liver ultrasound is extremely simple. You won’t have to take any medications prior to this liver test because an ultrasound is completely non-invasive. The doctor or tech will simply use a hand-held device that emits sound waves to produce pictures of your liver and kidney.
A liver ultrasound is used to check for a fatty liver, liver cysts or masses and the reason that the doctor does an ultrasound on the kidney is for comparison. If the liver is much brighter on the image than the kidney, it’s fatty. Since a liver ultrasound uses sound waves, there’s no exposure to any kind of radiation.
MRI Scans and CAT Scans
Your doctor may want to do a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan or a computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan in order to search for masses or to get a better image of a fatty liver. The MRI gives a better picture and does not expose you to any radiation. This test won’t be done in your doctor’s office because the equipment is extremely expensive.
MRE Scan
A magnetic resonance elastography (MRE or liver elastogram) is brand new technology invented by imaging researchers at the Mayo Clinic that is used to scan the liver for very early signs of liver disease. Toxins, fat and infections can cause inflammation and damage to the liver which causes scar tissue.
If left untreated, this tissue will grow, harden into fibrosis and cause cirrhosis, which isn’t reversible. The test is also used to spare some patients from a liver biopsy. Because it’s difficult to diagnose liver disease early, this machine represents a technological and diagnostic breakthrough.
Liver Function Blood Tests
A blood test can only detect damage to the liver, not actual function. The tests aren’t really reliable because they don’t always detect a problem even if there is one and sometimes liver enzymes will be elevated for reasons other than liver problems. Because of this, the tests are usually just a jumping-off point and are usually used in conjunction with other methods.
The blood test checks two things:
• Total Bilirubin – this part of the test measures the level of bile pigment in the blood. If your bilirubin is elevated, you may have jaundice.
• Liver Enzymes – there are several different enzyme levels that are tested. Normally, the enzymes are located only in the liver cells and only leak out if there’s damage to the liver.
The following enzymes are tested:
• AST – These used to be called SGOT and elevated levels are not necessarily indicative of liver disease. They may also be elevated if there’s a muscle or heart issue.
• ALP – is elevated in many different kinds of liver disease but can also be indicative of another problem.
• GGT – this enzyme will frequently be elevated if you abuse alcohol or consume other chemicals that are toxic to your liver.
• ALT – formerly known as SGPT this enzyme is more specifically indicative of liver problems if elevated.
• Blood Protein – These proteins are made in the liver and the liver test measures their levels as another indication of liver function.
As you can see, these liver tests are only good for indicating that there MIGHT be a problem and are in no way a positive indication of low liver function due to disease. There are several other things that your doctor may test including glucose levels, triglyceride levels and cholesterol levels.
Liver Biopsy
Finally, your doctor may decide to do a liver biopsy. This test is invasive and involves removing a small piece of your liver so that it may be tested for fatty deposits, fibrosis, cancer, or other diseases. This should be a last resort.
With the exception of the biopsy, liver tests are non-invasive, painless and may save your life by catching liver disease in it’s early stages. If you’re at risk, make sure that you get tested because in the case of liver disease or liver cancer, sooner is always better and might be the difference between life and death.Difference between revisions of "John A.

Aquired Brain Injury | ADHD | Autism Spectrum Condition | Blind and Vision Impairment | Deaf and Hearing Impairment | Health Conditions | Intellectual Disability | Learning Disability | Mental Illness | Physical Impairment |
The primary responsibility of any post-secondary education provider is to deliver the best possible academic experience for all students. Students may reach their goals and realise their potential in different ways – and this is true particularly for students who have a disability. Staff may encounter students who are mildly or severely hearing or sight impaired, who have long or short term medical disabilities, mobility disabilities, psychiatric or psychological disabilities, or a learning disability. In the context of inclusive teaching practices which enhance the learning of all students, it is useful to have a basic understanding of the implications that a specific disability or health condition may have in order to better meet the needs of students.
Even though two people may have a similar condition or disability, they are unlikely to have the same needs or experience of disability or require identical strategies and adjustments to support their learning. Rather than make assumptions about the impact of a student's condition on their learning, ask them what assistance or accommodations they need.
A health condition is variously disabling depending on the extent to which the education provider makes provisions for their inclusion. For example, a person who uses a wheelchair will have no difficulties negotiating a well-designed accessible building but will be disabled in a poorly designed one. But even within the same provider, students with the same disability or condition may have very different needs. This can be as a result of the following factors:
- The type or extent of the impairment; for example, ‘vision impairment’ refers to a broad range of conditions with very different implications for the student
- The student’s previous educational experience; some students may have already developed effective study skills, while others may have only recently developed an understanding of their disability
- The nature of the study; a student studying physical sciences may have very different assistance requirements than one who is studying law
- The teaching format; a student's needs will vary according to whether they are undertaking practicum work, e-learning or lab work, for example
- The level of study; postgraduate study will require different skills than an undergraduate course
This section offers insight into the experience of living and studying with a disability or health condition, defines the terms you may encounter and suggests specific strategies for accommodating needs. Disabilities and health conditions can result from injury, illness or genetic disorders - but remember, your focus is the implication of the disability or health condition for learning, not the specific disability itself. Your job is to make reasonable adjustments to teaching and assessment practices in order to minimise the impact of the student's disability.color panel machine making machine

Published in The Express Times from Nov. 17 to Nov. 18, 2012Declining to disclose the exact number of subscribers affected by the outage, Steve Swasey, Netflix VP/corporate communications, says it wasn't the majority of the company's 7.5 million members. "When you love someone, you forgive them for their mistakes," he says. "People love Netflix, so they're very forgiving when we have a bad day."
On average Netflix ships 1.8 million DVDs daily from 52 distribution centers across the country--Monday being the slowest, and Tuesdays and Wednesdays the busiest. The outage knocked out the Netflix Web site for about 11 hours.
The company apologized to subscribers for the "extreme anomaly" and took steps to financially compensate those who expected DVDs for the mistake. One member who received the email message says of it: "Nice. And no, I didn't notice that they hadn't shipped on Monday."
Daniel Ernst, Hudson Square Research Soleil analyst, called the refund generous, suggesting the move demonstrates the company's ability to step up to the plate.
"This type of [glitch] usually happens when traffic on sites spikes or accelerates quickly," Ernst says. "It has happened with Apple, Microsoft, and Research in Motion."
In February, Netflix boosted its revenue and earnings targets for the first quarter in 2008, amid stronger-than-expected subscriber growth. The online DVD-by-mail company expects earnings of 15 cents to 20 cents per share, up from a prior estimate of 13 cents to 21 cents. The bump lifts the revenue forecast between $324 million and $328 million--up from $323 million and $328 million in earlier estimates.
Ernst says Netflix will have added 700,000 new subscribers--totaling 8.2 million--in the first calendar-year quarter, ending March 31. This compares with 481,000 new subscribers, totaling 6.8 million, for the year-ago quarter.
Ernst estimates that Netflix will report $325 million in Q1, up from $305 million in the year-ago quarter. He attributes the uptick in growth to a pull back in marketing by Total Access from Blockbuster and ongoing deterioration at Movie Gallery.
Netflix spent $391.3 million on advertising in 2007, up from $369.2 million in 2006, according to Nielsen Monitor-Plus. The research firm estimates Netflix will have spent $52.9 million in January, excluding outdoor ads.Susan Robb has been part of the local art conversation for years. "The Seattle artist's interactive installations get people to walk miles (The Long Walk), squat in high-end buildings (Sleeper Cell Training Camp), and lock their bikes to a Parking Squid," says arts editor Laura Dannen. Now she's making conversation the art with the Skype Skulpt Studio at Cornish. Robb will take instruction from artists via Skype on how to build a sculpture with materials she has on hand—or found objects people bring in—and then return the favor. Each session is broadcast live in the Cornish gallery and results in two artworks (one constructed by Robb and one that the video-chat collaborator will mail to Cornish).
For our latest Fiendish Conversation we pseudo-ambushed the forward-thinking artist for a chat about making conversations visible, critics, and former bands.
What led to the Skype element of Skype Skulpt Studio?
My work has lately been socially engaged work. I’m interested in working with other people to create a piece; it typically has been about that interaction or the time that we spend together. It seems like creating sculptures with other people would do two things: It would continue that inquiry into socially engaged work, but it would also... sort of make visible the structure of conversation. I have this idea that when you speak to your friends, or you speak to anybody, you’re creating this invisible structure that’s made out of words, and gestures, and the feeling of the conversation. My hope is that in this piece—through this piece—that some of that idea comes across.
We’ll place the call and I’ll show the artist the material I have—basically my vocabulary—and they’ll do the same. And then improvisationally, of course—the way a conversation works—I’ll direct them in the making of something, and vice versa.
One of the exhibit’s parameters is that people can bring in materials and found objects for you to use when sculpting. What are you hoping to get out of that?
That extends the conversation to more than just me and the artist I’m having the call with. Basically those objects become interjections into the conversation. I present a number of materials to the artist, and they do the same, and then I direct them in the making of a sculpture using the things they’ve shown me and vice versa. So the things that people bring in are the things that the other artist ends up using in their piece, so to speak.
Which up-and-coming local artists should people take note of?
I’m not sure how up-and-coming or emerging they are, but Mike Simi, Susanna Bluhm, Julie Alpert… There’s probably more. I mean, there really are so many great artists in Seattle, it’s hard to name them all.
How has Seattle shaped your artistic voice?
That’s such a complex question 'cause I do think geography ends up being everything for me. Because geography is so important, I started creating work that was site specific—that dealt with this place, like in terms of The Long Walk. ... ONN/OFF, the light festival, obviously was created because of the depressing, rainy, totally gloomy winters. I needed to make something that would take me out of that, and I had a feeling that a lot of other people were feeling the same thing that I was feeling.
If you weren’t an artist what line of work might you have considered?
Musician. I used to be in a band and I got a lot of satisfaction out of that, too. I played bass and sang in a band called Incredible Force of Junior.
What's your opinion of critics?
I like art critics. I wish there were more art critics in Seattle. I think that the Seattle art scene would be made stronger by more critical conversation, more give-and-take, more ways to connect the work that’s being made her to larger themes. So I’m all for critique.

But it’s a natural response to the delightful retelling of “Pinocchio” at Seattle Children’s Theatre, a show co-produced with The Children’s Theatre Company of Minneapolis, where it played earlier.
Carlo Collodi’s classic fairy tale of a spunky wooden puppet who longs to be “a real boy” is well-served by a framing device smartly applied by adapter-director Greg Banks.
Entering the theater, the audience finds the stage has become a construction zone. The crew of Italian workmen realize that people have arrived to see the adventures of Pinocchio. So they obligingly act out the story, using ladders and scaffolding, paint brushes and buckets, paint rags and drop cloths as props for make children attending know “Pinocchio” only from the popular animated Disney film version, the storyline here (more faithful to Collodi’s novel) will offer some fresh twists.
As in most versions, the poor puppeteer Geppetto builds a puppet which surprises him by coming to life as a good-hearted but naive, sometimes naughty little lad.
More than anything, Pinocchio longs to be a “real boy.” Hence his eagerness to attend school. But he keeps getting distracted, and into jams. En route to the schoolhouse he can’t resist making a detour to watch a street puppet show.
Later he accepts an invitation from a man offering a lift to a dreamy playland, where a week is made up of “six Saturdays and one Sunday,” and life is (allegedly) nonstop fun and games.
But Pinocchio winds up being (briefly) turned into a donkey (with paintbrushes for ears). He and Geppetto get swallowed by a whale. And nasty Fox and Cat pretend to befriend him, but wind up robbing him.
These escapades are mainly humorous, with the five-member cast earning many laughs with slapstick-style shtick.
There are some sober moments, too, when Pinocchio fears his surrogate papa has drowned, and when he is bullied when he finally gets to school.
But the mood is mainly upbeat and, except for some saggy stretches in the first act, it tickled and interested SCT’s young (ages about 5 to 8) patrons at a recent matinee.
They were wooed in by the creative ways the set and props helped conjure the tale, like when a pulley was used to hoist an impromptu fairy into the air. (Who needs animated special effects when you can do that?)
And they were very responsive to the audience-participation bits, when Pinocchio urges everyone to get vocal and help him decide what to do and where to go. (Not that he always follows their advice.)
The traveling cast, which includes the ebullient musician Victor Zupanc, playing guitar and accordion and much more, are inviting and adept. And in the lead, actor Elise Langer gives Pinocchio a raffish impishness that makes him all the more lovable.

Starting on Feb.13, visitors to the Museum of the Coastal Bend can explore regional history through guns. A new temporary exhibit, outs and masked bandits in the Wild West, guns have been with us for a long time,” said Eric Ray, curator at the Museum of the Coastal Bend. They.” Marks show that some of the guns were originally issued to the British army, a theme that is common in the exhibit. “Guns were used and used and used, changed from style to style as technology improved. They were not disposable,” said Ray.
 – how many people have heard ‘you’ll shoot your eye out’?”
The exhibit opens with a preview reception for members and invited guests on Tuesday, Feb. 12 from 5 – 7 p.m. At 6 p.m., Kurt House, noted firearms collector and Colt Collectors Association publications chairman, will give a lecture as part of the exhibit’s opening. Non-members who are interested in learning more about the museum are encouraged to attend.
"Winning the West" is organized and curated by Ray, who joined the museum’s professional staff in August 2012.
“With his experience and education, Eric has brought another level of expertise in exhibits research and design, as well as collections management to the Museum of the Coastal Bend,” says Sue Prudhomme, director of Cultural Affairs. “Eric is leading the redesign and expansion project of our permanent La Salle Odyssey Exhibit, scheduled to open in fall 2013. "Winning the West" gives our audience a first taste of the aesthetic that Eric brings to the table.”
"Winning the West" is open to the public from Feb.13 through Aug. 30. The Museum of the Coastal Bend is on the corner of Ben Jordan and Red River, on the Victoria College campus. Admission is $3.50 for adults, $2.50 for visitors 55+, $2 for students through 8th grade, and free for members and VC/UHV students.Solving the revprop change blocked by pre-revprop-change hook (exit code 255) with no output error
By Cyrille Mahieux on Thursday, September 23 2010, 20:50 - Subversion - Permalink
What is the pre-revprop-change hook ?
The pre-revprop-change script is launched before any property is modified on the Subversion repository.
Because Subversion's revision properties are not versioned, making modifications will overwrite the previous value of that property and since data can be lost, Subversion supplies this hook to log changes or enable only some properties to be changed, ...
revprop change blocked by pre-revprop-change hook (exit code 255) with no output is a common error when playing with revision properties that can be solved in two simple steps.
Check the pre-revprop-change hook existence
By default, there only a template hook named pre-revprop-change.tmpl in the repository hooks folder.
You need a pre-revprop-change file, so you can rename it to only enable svn:log and svn:author (Commit log message & author) :
mv hooks/pre-revprop-change.tmpl hooks/pre-revprop-change
Or make your own hook to enable all properties to be changed :
vi hooks/pre-revprop-change
then insert
#!/bin/sh exit 0;
The exit 0; instruction is equivalent to a success for svn, so this one will allow EVERY revision properties on repository to be changed (Useful for svnsync).
Give the execution right to pre-revprop-change hook
It's a common mistake to forget enabling execution right to the hook
chmod +x hooks/pre-revprop-change
This is the second step, you are now able to change revision properties on your repository.
(exit code 1)
In case you obtain revprop change blocked by pre-revprop-change hook (exit code 1), this mean that pre-revprop-change hook is enabled, executable, but it does not allow you to modify the revision property you're trying to change.
Check the message it return (unless with no output is specified), check the hook code, if you can't or are not allowed to do theses things, check repository hosting documentation or contact your repository administrator.While the NCUA’s Office of Minority and Women Inclusion was created to ensure diversity in management, employment and business activities, the two-year old division has much more room to have an impact.

TribLIVE Sports Videos
Yoga is part of one team's workouts as squads at Quaker Valley and Sewickley Academy prepare for winter sports seasons that will begin over the next couple weeks.
Members of the cooperative swim team formed with boys and girls from the two schools will participate in exercises designed to promote control of the mind and body. In yoga, breath control, meditation and bodily postures are practiced for better health and relaxation.
“It's good for the mind and increases flexibility, which is good for swimmers,” coach Sue Morgan said. “We will include it as part of dry-land exercises.”
Nothing as exotic is planned in other sports, including boys and girls basketball, where fundamentals are stressed.
“We will be working on offense and skill development, with an even greater attention to defense,” Quaker Valley girls coach Jim Dudas said.
Sewickley Academy boys coach Win Palmer has taken a similar approach to his team's workouts.
“Preseason practices (are) when we put in our defensive system,” he said. “About 70 percent of our practice time will be focused on the fundamentals of individual and team defense.”
Quaker Valley boys coach Mike Mastroianni considers preseason practices the most important of all.
“Your foundation of your team is developed and the expectations of your program are established,” he said. “We have a lot of work in front of us.”
Since the beginning of the school year, Sewickley Academy girls coach Allen Vaccarelli has kept the gym open for players interested in sharpening their skills. But there have been few participants because many girls play fall sports.
“We have been doing offseason open gym sessions twice a week,” Vaccarelli said. “This allows a small number of girls the opportunity to get extra work and attention on their skills.”
The Sewickley Academy hockey team is awaiting the arrival of four players from the boys soccer team, which has been participating in the PIAA playoffs.
“Things are going well considering we don't have all our kids,” coach Ryan Patrick said.
Before beginning its season in October, the Quaker Valley hockey team had camp and preseason practices in August.
“Preseason is very important,” coach Kevin Quinn said. “We played in (a) tournament and (scheduled) scrimmages to see where we are and what we need to improve.”
Senior Clayton Bouchard said preseason workouts have made him better.
“It's a good way to get the intensity back and work on your stickhandling,” said Bouchard, 18. “You become rusty.”
The Quaker Valley bowling club will have a handful of practices before beginning its season this month.
“People don't think of bowlers practicing, but they do,” coach Greg Vecchi said. “Practice prepares you for the speed of the game.
“There are 10 bowlers on two lanes. Kids have to get used to that.”
Junior Michelle Starke enjoys practices.
“We encourage and help each other,” she said. “We'll give advice to go on this side, or go left or right.
“We have a really good time. We become friends.”
Senior Troy Gleason said he and some teammates also practice as members of junior leagues.
“Some of the bowlers we bowl against belong to (junior leagues), too,” said Gleason, 17. “It gives us chances to scope out the opposition.”
Sewickley Academy bowling coach Antonio Palangio agreed that practice is as important to bowlers as it is to athletes in other sports.
“If you miss a spare, you know that's something you have to work on,” he said. “It's like when you miss free throws in a basketball game--you keep practicing until you get itSome things I’ve been reading but don’t have much to say about.

- Plot treats the variable x as local, effectively using Block.
- Plot has attribute HoldAll and evaluates f only after assigning specific numerical values to x.
- In some cases, it may be more efficient to use Evaluate to evaluate f symbolically before specific numerical values are assigned to x.
- No curve is drawn in any regions where f evaluates to None.
- Plot has the same options as Graphics, with the following additions and changes:
-
- Interactive labeling can be specified for curves using Tooltip, StatusArea, or Annotation.
- Plot[Tooltip[{f1,f2,…}],{x,xmin,xmax}] specifies that the
should be displayed as tooltip labels for the corresponding curves.
- Tooltip[f,label] specifies an explicit tooltip label for a curve.
- Typical settings for PlotLegends include:
-
- Plot initially evaluates f Plot to miss features in your function. To check your results, you should try increasing the settings for PlotPoints and MaxRecursion.
- On[Plot::accbend] makes Plot print a message if it is unable to reach a certain smoothness of curve.
- With Mesh->All, Plot will explicitly draw a point at every position on each curve where each function was sampled.
- The arguments supplied to functions in MeshFunctions and RegionFunction are x, y. Functions in ColorFunction are by default supplied with scaled versions of these arguments.
- The functions are evaluated all along each curve.
- With ClippingStyle->Automatic, a line is drawn at the top or bottom of the plotting area wherever a curve goes outside the range of the plot.
- With the default settings Exclusions->Automatic and ExclusionsStyle->None, Plot breaks curves at discontinuities it detects. Exclusions->None joins across discontinuities.
- Plot normally returns Graphics[{Line[…],…}].
- With a Filling specification given, Plot returns Graphics[{GraphicsComplex[…],…}].

12 Tips to Climb the Corporate Ladder FAST
By Lauren Bayne Anderson
June 03, 2011
Got.
And if you’re just starting out, as far off as it seems, it doesn’t have to take years to get to a promotion. There are ways to move up from your current position— FAST.
Here’s how:
- Work Harder: Come early, stay late. Get lots done while you’re there.
- Take on Added Responsibility: If the boss needs someone to handle a project, volunteer.
- Exceed Expectations: Find out what the expectations for any given task are and exceed them. If the project is due by the end of the week, get it done mid- week. If you are tasked with coming up with two new ideas, come up with five.
- Attention to Detail: Make sure to get it right. Everyone makes mistakes, but let your work be work that can be relied upon for being complete, accurate and professional.
- Look the Part: Dress for the job you want, not the job you have. Looking the part shows professionalism, and helps your boss see you as a natural fit for the position.
- Be a Leader:: Have a positive attitude, don’t wait for work to fall in your lap, take initiative.
- Come Up with New Ideas: Even if they aren’t adopted, you’ll secure your position as a person who thinks outside of the box and is constantly thinking for ways to improve.
- Make Your Boss Look Good: Always try to make your boss look good, especially in front of his/her superiors. This means doing everything you can to excel in your position and displaying a positive attitude while doing so. Doing your job well makes his/her job easier, and it makes your boss look like they have things together on their team—a team that performs well.
- Be a Good Co-Worker: Help out coworkers when you can. Show you can be part of a team. After all, how can you lead a team, if no one on it likes you?
What NOT to do:
- Don’t throw your coworkers under the bus. You may think making them look bad will help you out, but in the end, you’ll become the enemy of your coworkers, and your boss will come to see you as a trouble maker who can’t work within a team.
- Don’t Plot for certain positions. Especially positions that are already filled. If you work hard and stand out, opportunities will always present themselves—and they may be opportunities you hadn’t considered.
- Don’t share too much. Dating someone new? Went bar hopping over the weekend? Got a new tattoo? Don’t share at work. You’ll be viewed as unprofessional. When’s the last time you talked with your boss about the dating scene? In most cases, you haven’t. Take a cue from them.

I have been doing all of these things for over 4 years and my supervisor has taken all the credit and has thrown me under the bus. I guess I need a new career.

Does every move upward inevitably demand that I supervise other people? If so, I will happily stay where I am. Nothing could be more difficult and stressful than managing people.

I did eveything on the to-do list at my last job and I still got laid off because of "seniority" and that my position was the most "expendible". I was already doing the work of three people and consistently going above and beyond my job duties. I was coming up on my one year review and thought for sure that I was due a promotion. I guess in this economy it doesn't matter if you do everything right, because you can still get screwed.

graduate from the State Police Academy's intensive 21-week training
program and to undergo instruction as part of an entirely new training
concept known as Action Adult-Based Learning Methodology - a training
format that utilizes advanced facilitation methods, training scenarios,
role-playing exercises and student presentations to accomplish training
objectives.
"Congratulations
to each member of the," Colonel Dunbar said. "It is truly
an honor to congratulate each trooper and to wish the newest members
of the New Jersey State Police success and God-speed as they report
to their duty assignments." "Today's troopers will face
a much more complex world and will have less margin for error. They
must think and act independently and possess the self-confidence
and focus to perform their job constitutionally and with compassion,"
he added.
According to Captain
David S. Leonardis, Commandant of the State Police Training Academy,
the Training Bureau has undergone significant changes during the
past 18 months. Changes include a new recruit evaluation system
designed to compliment the adult-based learning methodology, wireless
internet laptop research supported by a newly appointed academy
librarian, significantly smaller class size for pre-service training,
use of firearms simulation training scenarios and the implementation
of an instructor/recruit mentor program. Additionally, each individual
lesson plan used during the course of pre-service training was completely
reviewed in-house and through various governmental and private educational
testing facilities to insure conformity with independent training
requirements. Also, the trooper recruits have been fully trained
in the use of police computer systems and each will utilize a portable
laptop computer from which police-related information can be quickly
and accurately obtained and police reports can be entered directly
into the revamped State Police data collection systems.
The 127th and 128th classes
were also challenged in the specific areas of constitutional search
and seizure with the implementation of revised State Police guidelines
and exhaustive classroom and practical training scenarios involving
the legal use of search and seizure procedures. The recruits participated
in extensive training and role-playing exercises which focused on
responding to and handling domestic violence situations, human dignity
and human relations exercises, cultural diversity and awareness
and sensitivity training and the State Police initiative of community
policing and community relations. In the area involving cultural
diversity and minority instruction, the trooper recruits received
extensive and detailed instruction from experts outside of the State
Police, including representatives from ethnic, cultural, community
and professional organizations. Such interactive training included
extensive lecture, practical exercises and role playing in cultural
diversity and awareness especially as they relate to the role of
police in our society.
Yet another training
initiative that has been successfully integrated into the State
Police curriculum is an intensive training course which details
Spanish for Law Enforcement Officers.' This course exposes
State Police recruits, and on-duty troopers, to extensive language
instruction geared to enable them to better communicate with Spanish
speaking individuals about police-related matters and to better
assist injured persons, disabled motorists, and in communicating
with Spanish speaking victims and witnesses.
Recognizing the important role
that the field-training officer plays in the development of a new
state trooper, the Social Science Unit made major revisions to the
Trooper/Coach training program. The revised training required to
become a Trooper/Coach was upgraded to a five-day course, which
includes a comprehensive evaluation of the Trooper/Coach's ability
to effectively train new troopers. The most significant change involving
the Trooper/Coach program is assigning two trooper coaches to each
probationary trooper.
In commenting on the overall
selection process for State Police recruit training classes, Col.
Dunbar reported that each applicant applying to the State Police
is required to have a minimum of 60 college credits plus two years
of work experience or, alternatively, a bachelor degree. During
the most recent recruit selection process, several "firsts"
were achieved, including the use of a blind screen to evaluate applications
for minimum qualifications; the implementation of a new State Police
examination; changes to the physical qualification test to mirror
the same examination required of all State Police enlisted personnel
and affording candidates several opportunities to take the test
during a four-week period; revamping the interview process to include
two members from the State Police as well as a Human Resource Specialist
from outside the State Police; an in-depth review of individuals
recommended for disqualification during the background investigation
by a State Police Bureau Chief, a Section Supervisor, personally
by the Superintendent and finally by the Office of State Police
Affairs in the Attorney General's Office.
Dunbar said that as probationary
troopers, the:

Oh no, I shouldn't say running as that would make it easier for motorists.
I should say they are creeping along at a snail's pace on Main Street. It seems it's getting more and more prevalent on Main Street in our fair city.
When someone is using the crosswalk, I am all for safety and for them taking their time crossing the road.
But I get frustrated when I see people jaywalking in the middle of the road taking their own sweet time to get where they are going. In the meantime, I have to slow down in my car from the slow speed I was already traveling downtown.
Some of these jaywalkers have an attitude too. Some look at me with attitude as if to say "how dare you drive on a road." Then there are some who cross the street and never even look if any cars are coming.
I realize due to where people park and where they need to cross downtown, reaching a crosswalk is not the most ideal situation in all cases. That means some level of jaywalking is inevitable. I've been known to do it, but I can tell you I don't take my time when I do.
I know there are some people even crankier than me out there as one guy revved his engine while I crossed the road one time.
It's the kind of walking that slows everyone else down that I don't like. It takes long enough with stop signs on every corner to get through Main Street with my car without having to slow down for someone who apparently feels Main Street is a pedestrian walkway.
And a slow one at that.
I think last week's heat exacerbated the situation as walkers were moving even slower than usual across the street.
I guess we all have to coexist in this town and I can learn to be more tolerable. But if you are capable of reaching an extra gear when you cross the road (like faster than Frankenstein), it might be beneficial to usInsights: Interviews on The Future of Social Media as Curated by Anil Dash and Gina Trapani

- No current results.The Celtics still need one more win to capture their 18th NBA title, but some in Los Angeles — outside of the Lakers, it seems — are ready to hand the Larry O’Brien trophy to the C’s anyways.
A day after the Lakers lost Game 5 of the NBA Finals in Boston, the reaction in L.A. was quite bleak, to say the least.
The headline of the first article on the LATimes.com sports page read: “Lakers Make Losing Look Effortless.” That was followed by the other headlines like “When push comes to shove, the Lakers fail to answer” and “Kobe Bryant has no use for teamwork.” Yikes.
While those familiar with Boston sports are no strangers to negativity from the media or from fans, the latest reaction out of Tinseltown has some edge to it that would appeal to even the saltiest of New England sports fans.
The Celtics came out Sunday night and outhustled and outplayed the Lakers, and those on the Left Coast took notice.
“When the ball was loose, the Celtics got it, unless they fumbled it away or two of them dived on it and knocked it over to a Laker,” L.A. Times writer Mark Heisler wrote in his column Monday.
Bill Plaschke wasn’t much kinder in his column. “This is no longer a series, it is a stereotype, the resilient Celtics boxing around the retreating Lakers,” he wrote.
In regards to the Lakers having home-court advantage in Game 6 and a potential Game 7, Plaschke didn’t mince words: “If home is where the heart is, the Lakers need to conduct an all-out search once they arrive.”
Even the lone bright spot for the Lakers, Kobe Bryant’s 38-point outburst wasn’t enough to give the Los Angeles scribes any sort of comfort or satisfaction. The Times’ T.J. Simers not-so-affectionately referred to Bryant as “Our Ball Hog” in his column Monday. He didn’t stop there, either.
Simers sarcastically lamented: “Over the years, it doesn’t always mean the Lakers are going to win when Our Ball Hog loses sight of everyone else, but you’ve got to admit it’s the best in basketball entertainment.”
Simers also mockingly added: “Later, I heard he [Bryant] wanted to fly the plane home, too.”
Although the Lakers are saying all the right things publicly about getting back into the series, it’s no secret that those who are following them closely don’t have much hope for the men in purple and gold.
Plaschke may have put it best: “At this point, the better team is not the better team. The biggest is not the strongest. Style is getting whacked by substance. Talent is getting whacked by tough.”
The words of criticism for the Lakers are even more interesting when considering that had the Lakers won Sunday night, they’d be in the driver’s seat with the series heading back to Staples Center and two chances to win the title. What a difference one game makes.
The Lakers came into the season, playoffs and the NBA Finals favored to win it all. However, if they don’t get their act together and match the effort level of the more resilient Celtics team, the L.A. media will have to replace negative headlines and negative columns with an obituary for the Lakers’ 2009.Buying Seafood in K/W
Where?
I lived in Guelph some years ago and found it and K-W a wasteland for fresh seafood.Problem is demand is slight and few vendors seem willing make the drive to TO several times/week. Sobey's once was OK. There was also a Newf named Brian who ran good seafood shops in Guelph, then Kitchener. No idea if he's still around.There is a Newf community in Cambridge, so that might be worth exploring.That area's booming now and might support a good fish store or two.Sorry I can't help out with more
I used to live in KW and the seafood offerings are brutal, indeed. Caudle's catch was sadly some of the best (!!!). I used to get my fish from one of the large East Asian groceries in Kitchener, I believe on King. I used to get them simply cleaned and they were pretty good. Someone once told me they used Sobey's fish for sushi...I tried not to look alarmed.
After living in downtown Toronto, and before that, NYC., I find myself in a suberb with a craving for fresh fish and seafood.
While Diana's is a 20 minute drive away, I frequently buy from the fish counter at Sobey's Dominion, Loblaws, or Costco.
They all have standards of freshness, and sometimes the products are as good as Diana's. Costco seems to be consistently better, but the others can be OK when they have a special to promote, and a good supply of it. Last spring Sobey's had very good halibut steaks and fillets from B.C. for $8-$11/lb. Recenty all the chains, except Costco, have had great deals on King Crab.
I would suggest reading the flyers on Friday and going to a store early on Saturday; then check the item for freshness, and try to develop a rapport with a counterperson who actually enjoys fresh seafood.
If I had a counter server who would not touch some seafood items, I'd talk to the manager, and get him to do it!
We lived in Guelph until this summer and let me just say it was paradise compared to Kingston or Peterborough where we now live (where your choices are limited to atlantic salmon, rainbow trout and don't forget sole or snapper). My preference for seafood was the Heartland Zehrs on Kortright. There is a lady (grey to white hair in her fifties?) that is really great. She can tell you exactly when things came in and if there is anything better in the back. Even the teenaged part-timers seemed to be generally informed.Details of the forthcoming Festival of Museums in Scotland, running from Friday 16th to Sunday 18th May 2014:

I have been an aggravated TruGreen Chemlawn customer for several years now. They do many things right.
It is how they handle additional services that drives me absolutely nuts.
Periodically, I get a call from them. "Hello, Mr. Ungar. How are you tonight?" You know right there someone is trying to sell you something. The caller then goes on to say something about how I need a special application for something, or my lawn needs to be aearated or something like that. The caller tells me the cost, and I tell them yes or no.
Either way, you think you'd be done at this point. But not if you say yes. If you say yes, a second person has to call to confirm EVERYTHING you just talked about with the previous caller. That is how they work. Why? It's not like we are talking about a $1,000 service - it usually isn't more than $100.
I got one of those calls earlier this week. I told the caller I'd do whatever it was AS LONG AS I DIDN'T HAVE TO GET A SECOND PHONE CALL THAT NIGHT. He said no problem. He kept his word. I got the second phone call Wednesday night. I very politely told the lady on the phone that I don't care how their systems work, they don't work for me and I was cancelling the special service. She apologized profusely and said she was just doing her job.
This got me thinking: do we put our clients through needless hoops and hurdles? I hope not.
I am going to call my TruGreen Chemlawn office. If they insist on working like this, I'm going to tell them I will find another service that works differently.My name is Miroslav Olickov with art name Mirolli.

The Department of Telecommunications is planning to issue fresh guidelines that would allow telecom operators to continue using the spectrum after the expiry of their licence period, which is 20 years from the day of issue of a licence.
The DoT has decided to take this step to do away with any kind of ambiguity on the issue as there were no clear guidelines now for the renewal of licences.
It would also help the government generate revenues once these telecom companies approach them for renewal of their licences.
“The licence for unified access services is issued on non-exclusive basis for a 20 years, extendable by 10 years at one time within the territorial jurisdiction of a licensed service area (telecom circle),” the DoT said on its website. However, it did not mention the criteria based on which the licences could be renewed.
Government sources said the Centre was planning a new licence renewal policy as licences of some old operators such as Airtel and Vodafone, which are now providing 2G services and soon offer 3G services, would expire between 2014 and 2021.
Notably, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India had recently proposed that the operators should be asked to pay a renewal fee if they want to continue to offer services at the end of the licence period.
Bharti Airtel and Vodafone had taken some of their licences in 1994-95 which means that they would have to pay a hefty amount in the next four years.Tracy Foster, left, Danielle Brown, both of Hanover, pose by running shoes at Solemates.

Whether.
Custom fit
At Flying Feet, it takes about a half hour to be fitted. Customers discuss their exercise routine, then Flying Feet’s staff examines anatomical and biomechanical information by measuring and using thermal boards. Once a type of shoe is chosen, the customer walks or runs some 30 feet while the employee studies their running style. This is done outside or on an indoor treadmill.
“It’s important to wear the shoe you need,” said Pennewill. “For example, if you have a high arch and tend to push out, you need a shoe that helps keep that alignment.”
If you’re serious about running, stay away from big-box sporting goods stores that sell stripped-down athletic shoes. It’s worth the cost to have experienced staff fit and measure you for the right shoe.
“Some stores water down the technology of running shoes,” said Pennewill. “You get what you pay for.”
Finding the right shoe
So how do you know if being fitted for running shoes is right for you?
“If you’re serious about running, you’ll want to make that transition from wearing an OK shoe to an actual specialty running shoe,” he says. “If you’re still deciding if this is the thing for you, you can get away with a basic shoe.”
Another tip — take a look at how often, and what distance, you’re running.
“Mileage matters,” said Pennewill. “If you’re running one or two miles a few times a week, you don’t need anything special. Your body will let you know when it’s time to take your shoe to the next level.”
Did you know?
Replace running shoes every six months or 500 miles, whichever comes first. You’ll know it’s time when the mid-sole (the cushioning) begins to break down.
Where to get fitted
If you’re ready to invest in a specialty running shoe, here are some area stores:
Flying Feet Sport Shoes, 1511 Mt. Rose Ave., Springettsbury Township; 717-845-283;.
SoleMates, 110 W. Eisenhower Drive, Hanover; 717-634-2870;.

Sorry, McCain, but I used to vote Republican and this year I'll be voting for Barack Obama. I am ready for change!!!
Just looking at the turnout numbers, McCain is in big trouble.
CNN story line....
Dems can vote for whomever they are stuck with.
Reps can't get voters to stick to whomever.
If it isn't Clinton, McCain '08
This is ridiculous. CNN, at least try to disguise your bias.
CNN always has and always will HEART Obama.
Schneider's a dork. McCain won't run against Huckabee in the general...he'll run against liberals...conservatives and mods don't vote for liberals.
Who really cares whether Conservatives rally behind McCain or not. Their brand of rhetoric and ignorance/belief in the face of truth and facts has doomed them. The earth really is round, global warming does exist, and the earth is really billions of years old. Deal with it.
If I was McCain, I wouldn't worry too much. All those who are republican and voted for Obama today will be back in Nov.
When will the votes in the Texas caucus be counted? We all completed paperwork voting for our candidate but left there very confused. No one really knew what was going on.
So, Obama wanted Hilary Clinton to stop campaigning if she lost Texas and Ohio.
Mr. Obama you should stop campaigning if you lose those states!
Funny, your headline on your main page said this article was about bad news for CLINTON, but the article is actually about bad news for MCCAIN. Didn't Anderson Cooper spend a half hour talking about just these kind of mistakes last night?
The only way the GOP will become unified is if they all join the Democratic party this year. Congratulations Senator McCain, but you may as well keep barbecueing, because the Republicans will not have a prayer, despite the religion, in the General Election. Hopefully, you will have the opportunity to have sensible, mature, substanstive debates on the issues with Senator Clinton.
A McCain vs. Clinton race for the Presidency will lead to a respectful and enjoyable campaign season where ultimately the United Staes will join together on a bipartisan basis to solve our nations problems. To me a Clinton/McCain ticket would be perfect for getting our country to join with bipartisan congressional support to solve the major issues of our precious nation. Talk about a dream ticket.
McCain would need Hillary win Ohio in the general election; one the most important states in the nation. Thanks OHIO. You are the Best.
Have you even been to Texas? Between Hilary, Obama and McCain, believe me he's their guy...
Do you think conservatives will vote for McCain, Obama or Clinton. They will rally to the Republican candidate. McCain speaks his mind and acts on his beliefs, even if they stray from the party line. He is not so far from the conservative ideals that the conservatives will vote Democrat.
Obama hasn't won, yet so Obama supporters go find a Hillary article to annoy people on.
HILLARY WINS OHIO!!!!!!!!!
Sp you think all these Texas Conservatives are going to vote with the MOST liberal person in the US Senate?
the numbers won't matter. one things republicans do much better than the democrats is fall in line. and trust me, they will
He may not have to...
I was independent until registering Democratic this year. If Clinton is the nominee, there is a better than average chance I'll vote for him. I support Obama because I think the most important thing is to change *how* government is run. If Clinton's slander wins the day, McCain is the next best to achieve this goal.
Really nothing is bad news for McCain, seeing as no one really values the conservatives as they are today. Funny how one of the more popular conservative radio show hosts when giving a speach to support McCain, used more dirty politics then McCain himself was using, and then after being shown that his comments were bad by McCain himself, he then, out of nothing but spite and the purest of ignorance, switches his vote and support to hillary clinton.
Conservatives, is this who you want representing you?
If not Obama '08 then Hilary '08 (I'm a true democrat)
I don't think he's got any more work to do . He can go home and bbq some more pig parts with his obnoxious rich friends till Nov. He wasn't elected .
I think John McCain will be just fine, he seemed pretty fired up earlier. It's going to be a good year!
It's ironic that the man the Rove Republicans set out to slander and defame in order to win the nomination eight years ago is their nominee. I am a Democrat, but I prefer him to Senator Clinton and her decision to do the same to Senator Obama. I guess it shows that a woman can be just as mean in politics as a man.
Tell McCain not to worry because some of Hillary's supporters would rather vote for McCain than Obama. We are not THAT liberal and stupid!
Look at the popular votes for Clinton and Obama; count 'em and then look at the nuber of votes cast for McCain. Spells doom for the Repubic Party, no?Note: CUBRID will be integrated into SOFA Statistics 1.2.3 on Windows.

Despite the name, Hernandez looks like an old-fashioned neighborhood butcher shop, a mom-and-pop operation bordering an industrial neighborhood in Hialeah. Nothing very notable about the place. Except that the best roast pork on the planet can be had there. You have to call or visit ahead of time and tell them what kind of pig you want: A 40-pounder? 60-pounder? Bigger? A 100-pounder? No problem. Then tell them when you would like the pig to be ready: Next Saturday? Sunday? Fine. On that day, all you have to do is keep your eyes from popping out at the gorgeous, bronzed porker they'll slide out of their bread oven for you, drenched in mojo, face down, spread eagle on a large metal tray. Crackly, crunchy skin on the outside. Moist, piping-hot meat on the inside. Take it home. Feed a hundred people. Tell them you cooked it yourself. Squeal with delight.September 3, 2013 11:06:34 AM

Also joining the party on the red carpet for its world premiere will be Mark Palansky's directorial debut, Penelope. Starring Reese Witherspoon and Christina Ricci, pic is said to be a modern-day fable which revolved around a woman (Ricci) who is looking to escape from a family curse.
Of the 352 films, 261 will be features and most are looking forward to either a world, international or North American premiere.

United StatesBrink seems to be all the rage today, and that makes sense cause it just got released on.. I think today?
As far as I know you guys in America got it today, but then I saw a comment on raptr... some guy said he'd been playing it all weekend? Anyways, it only comes out on the 13th for those of us in the U.K. I pre-ordered it about a week ago, against my better judgement.
FF XIII was the first game I ever pre-ordered, but Im an FF Fanboy so of course I did that. You see, like a lot of people, I tend to get games way after their release and by that point I always know if the game is for me or not.
But then I get the feeling that I missed out on discovering the game's quality for myself. Also, there's so many games I don't take chances on that turn out to be awesome, and then I never get around to buying them and then the sequel comes out and everyone's all like "oh my god so good!" and Im like "shit I should have gotten into this earlier and now Im way behind!".
In this case however, I knew that I shouldn't bother getting Brink cause it would just be a fail. But then I saw those tutorial/ads and thought it was clever, and my idea of the game changed. Sooooo, I pre-ordered it, excited about the fact that I'd get to form a completely untainted opinion about it. The way it should be.
I was telling my friend this same thing just before I got back to my flat to see the sparkling 'D' 1up gave it. I had no idea it was being released in America a few days earlier than here so I have to say dammit 1up! I got no heads up on that. Obviously 1up isn't to blame, Ill just have to be wary of these things the next time I want a fresh and unexpected gaming experience. Things like different release dates and the fact that gaming sites tend to review games. It probably didn't help that I chose to read the whole review too.
I now know not to get my hopes up, so I also have to say thanks 1up. I heard that a lot of people who pre-ordered Brink had jumped ship. But not me. Im still determined to play it and maybe even enjoy it. I was also planning on giving my initial thoughts about it on here when I did finally play it but no ones gonna need to read that anymore. Soo, I just want to say a couple things before we rap up this post.
One thing I really like about this game is that Bethesda gave a shout out to their other (probably better) games in the form of the pre-order packages that, depending on where you ordered from, gives you exclusive customised skins, armour etc. There are four of these: the DOOM pack, the Fallout pack, the Spec ops pack and the Psycho pack. That last one as far as I know is the only one not connected to an already existing game.
The other thing I like is that one of the characters looks like Altair or Ezio found themselves in 'Attack the Block' (Pic below). Cloths that conceal the identity of the character but are reasonable attire for free running in make him a cool lookin' character while at the same time having a reason to look cool. Too bad the game doesn't make better use of the S.M.A.R.T system and free running....
- This guy deserves to be in a good game, maybe Brink 2 will do him justice -Hockey Canada doesn't want to fall behind the rest of the sport in the analytics department.
That much was clear with Wednesday's hiring of Misha Donskov as manager of hockey operations, analytics and video. Donskov will be primarily tasked with video responsibilities, but Hockey Canada president and CEO Tom Renney believes the former Ottawa 67's associate coach has more to offer.
"I think there's an opportunity to tap into his knowledge with respect to analytics and what might (be) best to measure, whether it's on-ice performance, whether it's how we put our camps together, whether it's the numbers of people we put in our camps," Renney said in a phone interview Thursday. "He has an analytical mind, and having said that he certainly pays attention to the analytics of the game. I think there's lots of ways and means with which to incorporate his skill to that end."
Analytics go beyond traditional statistics such as goals, assists and plus/minus to measure things like puck possession, quality of competition and where players are on the ice.
Donskov replaces Andrew Brewer, who left his job as Hockey Canada's video coach to join Mike Babcock's staff with the Detroit Red Wings. Babcock heaped tons of credit on Brewer during the Olympic gold-medal run in Sochi for ensuring Team Canada was well-prepared along the way.
Brewer got some analytics started before he left, and that's where Donskov picks up.
Renney, who worked as an assistant under Babcock last season and was head coach of the Vancouver Canucks, New York Rangers and Edmonton Oilers before that, said he has an appreciation for analytics from those jobs. In replacing Bob Nicholson in July, the 59-year-old didn't see analytics as a weak point for Hockey Canada but considers the hiring of Donskov a way to strengthen it.
"We knew that because of the skills that he brought to the table that that was an avenue we could even explore that much deeper," Renney said. "I don't know that analytics is always solution-based, but it certainly has a great deal of information to it and really in-depth information. I think with that in mind I wanted to make sure that we could at least pursue that to a point with the skill that was required. Misha delivers on that, we think."
Donskov had recently been promoted to assistant GM of the Ontario Hockey League's 67's after spending two seasons as an associate coach. Before that he was an assistant coach/assistant GM with the London Knights.
"The more diversified you are, the more valuable you are in a number of different ways," said Renney, who cited conversations with 67's owner Jeff Hunt and OHL commissioner David Branch as reasons he chose Donskov.
"Certainly he has a job description and it would suggest video, but it does go beyond that. I think we're going to see his skills over time — not unlike myself, I hope — where we're able to apply ourselves in those other areas."
Even though Donskov has hockey operations in his job title, he won't have to help replace Brad Pascall, who left to be an assistant GM under Brad Treliving with the Calgary Flames. Instead, those duties belong to vice-president of hockey operations and national teams Scott Salmond.
After a career of coaching in the NHL, being the president and CEO of Hockey Canada and piecing these things together is another challenge for Renney, who said he was enjoying the learning portion of his new job.
Renney and his lieutenants don't have any time to waste with the world junior championship in Montreal and Toronto fast approaching. Canada hasn't won a medal since 2012 and hasn't won gold since 2009.
In preparation for the tournament, Renney is involved behind the scenes but understands the expectations that will follow.
"At the end of the day, win and it's everybody else's program, lose and it's mine," he said.

Last year saw a shift from a reliance on oil and coal to an exploration of untapped natural gas resources and renewable energy. Few will bet against this topsy-turvy, transitional energy state persisting through 2013 and beyond. For the coming year, fossil fuels will continue to dominate the energy market, but renewables will continue their slow and steady gains, experts say.
"Alternative" no more
Clean energy will continue its creep into the mainstream. Wind-powered generation grew by 27 percent in 2011 and is projected to grow 15 percent in 2013, according to the US Energy Information Administration. Solar energy will continue robust growth, according to the EIA, with a projected 28 percent jump in consumption in 2013.
At this rate, alternative energy may even lose its distinguishing adjective.
"The word 'alternative', with its connotations of hand-wringing greenery and a need for taxpayer subsidy, has to go," writes Geoffrey Carr in The Economist. "And in 2013 it will. 'Renewable' power will start to be seen as normal."
But despite strong growth, renewables still generate only about 13 percent of the nation's electricity. While a dramatic drop in photovoltaic prices will likely continue to buoy the solar industry, wind power faces a less certain future. Time is running out to extend the federal production tax credit, which the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) says has supported a 90 percent drop in wind's cost since 1980 and enough energy to power over 12 million American homes.
"It's down to the wire on wind, and Congress has a choice," Rob Gramlich, AWEA's senior vice president for public policy, said in a statement. "If they do nothing, the wind industry will fall over its own fiscal cliff and America will lose most of its wind installations next year."
Still all about fossil fuels
Fossil fuels will continue to dominate American energy in 2013 and beyond as the International Energy Administration projects the US will lead the world in oil production by 2020.
Natural gas was the darling of 2012, with new drilling techniques tapping vast, previously impenetrable sources of energy. The US Department of Energy is now exploring the potential of exporting natural gas to capitalize on the country's newfound glut.
The fate of oil and coal rest largely in the hands of reelected President Obama, as he continues to weigh how much traditional fuels factor into his "all-of-the-above" approach to energy policy.
Coal, currently the largest generator of US electricity, faces the specter of tighter regulations from the Obama administration. Earlier this month, the US Environmental Protection Agency tightened soot standards. Some say its the first of many regulations to come, now that the election has passed and superstorm Sandy has cast new attention on climate change.
A decision on the Keystone XL pipeline is likely to emerge in early 2013. The nearly 2,000-mile-long proposed pipeline, which would connect Canada’s oil sands to American refineries, faces strong opposition from environmental groups that say the project will emit unprecedented levels of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. Supporters emphasize the pipeline's employment bump and a decreased dependence on turbulent Middle East oil supplies.
"It's a $7 billion infrastructure crossing five states that will mean 20,000 new jobs, including work in the building and construction trades, which are suffering from 12% unemployment," Cindy Schild, API's downstream operations manager for refining and oil sands, told reporters prior to a public hearing on Keystone earlier this month. "Longer term, it will provide a major ongoing stimulus to the US economy since 90% of the dollars we spend in Canada are returned to the US."
Either way, Keystone may very well serve as Mr. Obama's energy and environment crucible. It "will do much to define his environmental legacy," writes Andrew Restuccia in POLITICO.April 25, 2014
Final Stats
FORT WORTH, Texas – The No. 47 TCU men’s tennis team bowed out of the 2014 Big 12 Tennis Championships on Friday afternoon with a 4-2 loss to No. 3 Oklahoma at the Bayard H. Friedman Tennis Center.
The Horned Frogs (12-12) were barely edged by the Sooners (22-2) after pulling off the doubles point and No. 57 Nick Chappell recording the biggest upset of his career with a win over No. 5 Guillermo Alcorta at No. 1 singles. In the end, Oklahoma proved to be too much and will be moving into the semifinals of the championships.
“At the end of the day I am really proud of our team and what they have endured all year,” coach David Roditi said. “We have had every opportunity on the court and we let it slip, but these guys never gave up and we almost pulled off a big upset today. I am really proud of our team for that.”
Arnau Dachs and Trey Daniel were the first duo to put TCU on the board at No. 3 doubles with an 8-4 victory over Peerakit Siributwong and Nick Papac. Oklahoma would even the score with a tiebreaking win on court two, with the final doubles point decision coming down to the two best pairs on court one.
No. 10 Chappell and Will Stein did not let No. 29 Dane Webb and Andrew Harris even close on the first court, as the duo recorded their 24th win of the season and seventh over a ranked opponent with an 8-5 victory.
Into singles action, Oklahoma took the lead with victories on courts four and six, but the biggest win of the day for TCU came on court one, as Chappell upended Alcorta and earned his highest ranked opponent victory. Chappell took control from the start and limited Alcorta to only two points in the first set on his way to a 6-2 win. The second set was a close battle, as the two broke each other before holding serve to send the match into a tiebreaker. Chappell was once again in control and took out Alcorta 7-3 to win the straight-set fight on court one.
Chappell’s win would be the final victory for TCU on its home courts this season, as Austin Siegel took down Daniel on court five for an Oklahoma 3-1 lead. The final point for the Sooners would come on court two as, No. 6 Axel Alvarez Llamas came back to defeat Dachs. The Vic, Spain native split the first two sets with his opponent, before the match decision coming down to a tiebreaker in the third set. Llamas showed why he was highly ranked as he blanked Dachs 7-0 to clinch the match for the Sooners.
“For us to almost beat them at their best position, I think it shows how good this team is,” Roditi said. “It is a shame due to lack of capitalization of opportunities and being a little unlucky in the tiebreaker that we may not make the NCAAs. Today we showed we should be in the NCAAs, but because of not taking care of our opportunities earlier in the year, we may or may not be in the tournament. We can almost beat the No. 3 team in the nation and it’s a shame if this team doesn’t get in, but that is the way it is and we didn’t take care of our opportunities.”
TCU will now await word of a possible at-large bid to the NCAA Championships First and Second Rounds, which will be held May 9-11 at selected campus sites.

Digicel.The phone call was terrifying -- a child protection services worker accused Anndorie Sachs of giving birth to a child that had tested positive for methamphetamine.
"Panic, absolute panic," Sachs said.
And then, confusion. Sachs hadn't given birth in more than two years. After investigating the phone call, the Salt Lake City mother of four realized she had been the victim of medical identity theft. Someone gave birth using Sachs' name and her medical insurance to pay for it.
Authorities say that as Americans continue to struggle to pay their bills, more sophisticated thieves are turning to medical identity theft, making medical insurance fraud a top priority for government and private healthcare officials.Authorities say that as Americans continue to struggle to pay their bills, more sophisticated thieves are turning to medical identity theft, making medical insurance fraud a top priority for government and private healthcare officials.
"We have definitely seen an increase in medical identity theft over the last year," said Jennifer Trussell, director of investigations for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
More than 300,000 Americans were victims of such identity theft in 2009, according to the Federal Trade Commission.
In Sachs case, an alleged drug abuser who was pregnant in 2006 was found to have stolen Sach's driver's license and obtained her medical records before giving birth under Sachs' name.
But convincing medical investigators that she hadn't given birth wasn't easy.
"I said I had not recently had a baby, that my youngest were 2 years old," Sachs said. "I said, 'Come meet me and you'll know that I didn't just have a baby."
Investigators still made her life a living hell, she said, questioning her employers and interrogating her children.
Joe Ryan had a similar experience. He received a more than $40,000 bill for surgery he never had.
"The hospital actually thought that I was going make this $44,000 payment, and I was proving to them I have no scars from a surgery," he said. "And they said, 'No, we're going to go ahead and pursue this.' And I was in disbelief. I said, 'Are you kidding me?'"
Authorities said medical identity thieves are becoming better organized and bolder.
"We have heard reports of receptionists specifically being sent in by some of these identity theft rings to do nothing more than steal identities," Trussell said.
Ryan said the hospital that accused him of trying to dodge the surgery bill absorbed the loss in the end. But his credit was ruined.
The woman who stole Sachs' identity was eventually charged, but Sachs has since installed locks and a new alarm system at her home and worries the same thing could happen again.
"I mean the hospital didn't want to help me. The police didn't want to help me. You're really on your own with this," she said.
According to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, medical identity theft happens when someone, without your knowledge or consent, uses your identity to receive medical treatment.
If this happens to you, it can have serious repercussions.
For example, if your medical identity is stolen, your medical records may be altered and may show incorrect information. This may prevent your obtaining proper medical care and insurance benefits, according to the FTC.

Burress is trying to earn a roster spot on the strength of his ability to be a threat in the red zone, an area that Burress believes he can still dominate as a 36-year-old who played just four games last season.
Obviously any extended absence would make it difficult for him to get that job and, perhaps, continue his career, so the diagnosis will be a big one for Burress.
why do i have a feeling that it’s broken?
He shot himself again?
Must be quite an arm injury if you cant walk off the field.
Was the gun registered?
To make matters worse that was his gun hand.
This sucks. I was hoping the convict would make the team and waste a roster spot. Get well plax!
sounds like a collarbone. 6-8 week injury.
javanflac, if that timeline is true, he will be cut no question. His contract isn’t guaranteed. cya bye
Wow I didn’t even know he was on a roster
Never want to see injuries, especially in preseason.
jtbsteeler: How you gonna feel when Colbert signs a FA wr?
Tell me why he needs an arm to walk off the field!!
Osteoporosis is no joke.
Was Plaxico’s gunshot wound to the leg so severe that he walks on his hands now?
He’s shot.

Plaxico has served one of the harshest penalties handed down by the CJ System. He’s paid his debt to society and his critics and detractors need to get off his case and take a good long hard look in the mirror. If he can’t help the Steelers win–then focus your comments there–otherwise your comments have nothing to do with football and that’s what this forum is for.
Im guessing dislocated shoulder.
Hey Rottenbreath,
The Steelers are signing players because of injuries. Ozzie will be signing a WR or three because of he will realize he has NOTHING after Smith, who is a glorified #2 WR.
And if you saw the quarter and a half of Bucs vs. Ravens that I just saw Ozzie isn’t even waiting until after the game to call FA’s. HAHA He’s seen enough. And so have I.
Joe has transformed from Jumpball to “Dumpdown”. What a pathetic display by the Ravens offense. And Suggs was getting blowed off the ball and gasping for air. Dumervil was mouse silent.
Plax – what goes around comes around. See ya.
@father4 – you’re correct, he paid his debt to society – more than enough in my opinion. However, for us Giants fans, I think he’s fair game for ridicule for the rest of his career after carelessly throwing away a very promising season for the team.
“Burress believes he can still dominate…”
“Still”? When did he ever dominate? He scraped out a few 1,000 yard seasons, but he was never dominant.
What a shock, Plexiglass is hurt
Thereyougo2, you act like he killed or covered up the killing of people. And all the haters, I never claimed that he was the sharpest tool in the shed, but he had an expired permit from I think FL and got himself in his own leg because he had it in his pants like a gangster instead of a holster(2 examples of his intelligence). True he wasn’t going to be even third on the depth chart, but his size would’ve helped in the red zone.
The FA WR core is fairly thin but the steelers can skip right over Owens, Moss, and Ocho Cinco. Lloyd would be a decent pickup, but he will be overpriced and I think he has injury issues…who’s left? They just better land one before the ravens.
jb you really need to stop thinking that you see things the same way as a pro football gm. and this was a preseason game. it doesnt count. come week one the champs will have their roster in place. i know you are worried. its ok
If that roster has the same WR’s that you have now on it without any additions, I will be ecstatic.
I know you have a roster full of bum WR’s on it, I don’t need to be a GM to see that. Your fans, local radio and media all agree with me.
is that so? thats what everyone is saying? ok. i would be more concerned about the offense your boys are trotting out. its not pretty. no proven rb or te and no top wrs. i will take ravens offense with rice flacco and torrey any day.I get the alignment fairly easy, switch to production mode (either mode 2 or 3, no difference) light goes green but when I boot the xbox, no sign of Matrix inside

I’m not sure who to even rip on here. The little ping pong guy? That match was a bloodbath. It had nothing to do with the ref. Final was 11-6 and judging by the last two volleys it wasn’t even that close. So you take your aggression out on the judge? C’mon dude, that’s just sad. And what about the judge? Bro you’re like 11 feet tall. You dominate that kid. I know it can be intimidating when a ping pong bully starts running your kitchen, but dude you’re humungous. If you’re going to jump up and be aggressive towards the kid then do something about it. Get violent. Don’t just throw a paddle, stick your tail between your legs and walk away. As far as I’m concerned this was an exchange with no winners.
Property of Barstool Sports 2015Ellsworth Kelly’s sculpture, subject of a show at Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts, makes the complex simple and the simple complex
The fan-shaped birchwood "radius" work Curve XXI, 1978-80, appears to hover midair.©ELLSWORTH KELLY/COURTESY MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS, BOSTON/SAN FRANCISCO MUSEUM OF MODERN ART, DORIS AND DONALD FISHER COLLECTION AND HELEN AND CHARLES SCHWAB COLLECTION
Ellsworth Kelly’s home and studio in Spencertown, New York, are not dissimilar to the elegant, minimalist Chelsea galleries of his longtime dealer, Matthew Marks. The upstate complex, where the artist has lived and worked since the early 1970s, features a studio addition designed by architect Richard Gluckman, with an indoor and outdoor exhibition space. At the time of our meeting, two of his reliefs hung outdoors. One was a black bronze from 2004. The other, of recent vintage, was a wide triangle topped by a graceful curve—an iconic Kelly shape—with a glossy white surface that reflected the trees and fields in the distance. It’s a reminder, Kelly pointed out, that his abstractions are grounded in nature and the world he lives in, however mediated.The 87-year-old artist recalled how he went to Paris on the G.I. Bill, from 1948 to 1954, immersing himself in Matisse, Picasso, and the European modernists. He “missed all the 10th Street activity—missed the Abstract Expressionists,” he said. When he returned to New York, Pop art and Minimalism were on the ascent, and he soon earned a place in the radical coterie of postwar American artists for his monochromatic planes of pure color. He was the “last American artist,” the late curator Kirk Varnedoe asserted, “who needed to go to Paris.” Kelly is extremely busy at the moment, with a catalogue raisonné in the works and multiple museum shows scheduled for this year and into next—at the MFA in Boston, the Haus der Kunst and the Pinakothek der Moderne in Munich, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The MFA show (September 18 through March 4), titled “Ellsworth Kelly: Wood Sculpture,” includes 19 of the 30 unpainted wood sculptures that the artist made between 1958 and ’96. These are being shown as a group for the first time and constitute a complete cycle, since, Kelly explained, “I won’t be making any more.” Well known for his paintings, drawings, and prints, Kelly has received little critical attention for his sculptures—an unfortunate oversight that includes this important body of work.The four earliest wood sculptures in the show, from 1958, are designated “reliefs” and have organic motifs reminiscent of Brancusi, whom Kelly met in Paris. The first of the four is a pair of modest-size wooden rectangles, darkened by age, with the curved shape cut out from one panel affixed to the other, positive against negative; the panels are rotated so they are not mirror images but are more subtly juxtaposed. Kelly has always been acutely sensitive to installation: to the wall as the ground/support; to the relationships of forms to their environment and to one another; and to how those relationships activate and shape space. In many ways, the artist—resolutely following his own vision in pursuit of color, line, and form and armed with intuition and formal sophistication—has redefined what contemporary sculpture can be, spinning the simple into something complex and vice versa, as Brancusi did before him.Kelly began his next group of these sculptures in 1978, and over the course of the following decade made the majority of the wood pieces, with their recurring motifs, variants of the circle, rectangle, and triangle. In one teak construct, from 1978, Kelly aligned a rectangular panel diagonally along the edge of a triangle to suggest a fold. The blonde birchwood Curve XXI (1978–80) is an expansive, fan-shaped “radius” work, installed so that it seems to hover gracefully in midair, both solid and not. Almost all of the pieces have “curve” or “relief” in their title. They range from wall-mounted to freestanding works, with the horizontal reliefs (Curve in Relief IV and Curve in Relief V, 1981 and 1984, and Curve XL, 1984) extending up to 14 feet, the freestanding verticals up to 15 feet. These slender “totems,” as Kelly calls them, are flat with curved silhouettes, several flared at the top. They are typically created from a single piece of wood (as in Curve XXXVII and Curve XXXVIII, both 1984). Suggestive of figuration, they recall the Cycladic fertility goddesses, Brancusi’s Endless Column, and even Greek pillars, their slight swelling an optical refinement that animates and humanizes them. The arcs in Kelly’s works are carefully calculated, and sometimes barely perceptible, evoking the trajectory of the horizon as well as a section of a greatly extended circle. Kelly said he prefers the curve’s greater dynamism, dismissing the circle itself as “too familiar, too complete.” Lightly caressing the unsealed wood of the sculptures, Kelly spoke about their “softness” and the need to “focus on both surface and shape.” Wood is intimate and yielding—the opposite of the adamant bronze, steel, and aluminum that make up the greater part of his sculptural output. The wood, unlike industrially produced metal, is “natural” and has its own material integrity, changing in color over time, a process he appreciates. Kelly selects his materials carefully—white and red oak, maple, sycamore, elm, mahogany, and less common varieties, such as padauk, wenge, zebra, and sapele—and is highly discriminating about color, sheen, and grain. Tracing one “expressionist” pattern full of tiny filigrees and swirls, he then found another, comparing its intricacies to that of a Chinese landscape painting. “I love to draw but I could never draw or paint that well, with that much detail. I would never have the time, unlike nature which took a hundred years to do this.” Referring to the vertical totems surrounding us, he concluded, “That shape is fast but the grain is slow.”Lilly Wei is a New York–based art critic and independent curator.Looking at this hot face and amazing breasts, you can hardly guess you’re drooling over a tranny.

Adding.
Posting a pic of herself and her friend holding up their blinged out iPhone cases, Miley accompanied the pic with a message reading: "@devonleecarlson thank you soooo much for @leesaamarie & my phone case! So nice meeting you & your mama today! :)"
The outing comes as questions are arising in regards to the total lack of publicity being put forth by Lionsgate for Miley's new movie "LOL" - which is now set for a seven city limited theatrical release on May 4th.
Giving the film barely any chance at box office success, as "The Avengers" is hitting cinemas the same day, a columnist for the Los Angeles Times opined on the reason behind the movie being "buried" is that "it lacks the obvious marketing hook of high-profile films like Hunger Games and the upcoming adaptation of the bestselling pregnancy book What to Expect When You're Expecting."
Meanwhile, the director of "LOL," Lisa Azuelos, says that Lionsgate was too preoccupied with producing and promoting "The Hunger Games," as she's quoted saying, "They couldn't take care of my movie, and I waited in line."

BT is out for blood, seeking damages as well as an injunction over patents ranging from "Service Provision System for Communications Networks" to "Storage and Retrieval of Location Based Information in a Distributed Network of Data Storage Services." Among the services named as prime examples of infringement are Google Maps, Places, Offers, Music, Location-based advertising, Google+, and of course Android.
It's worth noting that BT's lawsuit has materialized at a very interesting time. Specifically, it has come about just as Google tries to close its acquisition of Motorola Mobility Inc. It's unclear whether there is a connection here, but the timing is coincidental, if nothing else.
It isn't clear just yet which direction this suit may go, but if Google is made to pay more Android-related royalties on top of existing obligations, FOSS Patents speculates that the search giant may have to pass the expense to manufacturers, which could have a significant impact on Android's progress.
For a complete explanation of BT's claims regarding each of the six patents in question, check out FOSS Patents' post on the subject here.The quote above is not new - the whole quote can be found here - but it's been swirling around in my mind lately.
See, I bought a new computer last week. Compared to my current laptop, this new desktop is huge. I've been setting it up and sorting out, but I don't have Photoshop on it yet. Since I use Photoshop everyday, I'm still using my old laptop.
I'm kind of anxious/scared/afraid to switch everything over to the new computer. On some level (and I know this is somewhat irrational, just bear with me) it feels like a big computer = big things. Like I need to start working on big projects with big announcements and big results and big this and big that and that's just too much big. So, I'm 'playing small'. Still working from my old, small, comfortable laptop. And that's just no good for anybody.
So this weekend? No more playing small. I've been wanting/needing a new computer for ages. My trusty old laptop is on it's last legs and can't do the things I need/want it to do. Change is good. Change is important. Change means I can work on 'big projects', but only if I choose to. My playing small serves no one, especially the one who I want to glorify with my work.
xo,
B
I'm interested to see how all of the projects turn out via your new computer!
I have a desktop here and I don't think I could live without it :) now I might approach it in a completely new way and think BIG things myself! I also wanted to pop by and thank you for your comment the other day. It really sat deep with me and it means the world that you were willing to put those words out there just so that I knew I wasn't feeling alone. That speaks volumes. You are a gem!
xoxoHybrid taxis are expected to be spotted on the streets of Seoul as the Seoul Metropolitan Government introduces ten eco-friendly taxis.
The taxis will be tested for about a year until more become available at the end of 2010. The plan is driven by the goal to fight global warming by cutting carbon emissions.
Hybrid cars use electric motors to cut the reliance on fuel by half compared to taxis that run on liquefied petroleum gas. This means that one hybrid taxi is able to reduce carbon emissions by around six tons per year. Hybrid engines shut down automatically when the taxi comes to a stop, which is great for saving energy as drivers often spend hours waiting for passengers.
The downside is that hybrid taxis are considerably more expensive, by over US$4,300 per vehicle. The cost is a major issue for many operators considering such vehicles. Seoul City officials said they will be pushing for government funding to assist in purchasing green taxis.Deadly Premonition: The Director’s Cut Set to Release April 30

For the Red Sox, it's still sort of early
Posted by Peter Abraham, Globe Staff May 12, 2011 10:30 AM
The Red Sox are off today following two disheartening losses in Toronto. The players should take up a collection and cater dinner for the Bruins to thank them for distracting people while they pile up losses.
With any luck, the B's will go to the Cup and keep the columnists away from Fenway for a few more weeks. Go get 'em, Timmy Thomas.
But as annoyingly inconsistent as the Sox have been through 37 games, it's important to note that a mere 23 percent of the season has been played and they are only 4.5 games out.
So there is that.

Suster recently wrote a post describing his favorite entrepreneur story in a while. It's the tale of Sriracha hot sauce creator David Tran, who fled Vietnam in the 1970s when the North's communists took power.
Tran actually named his company, Huy Fong Foods, after the ship that took him from Vietnam to the U.S. He named the hot sauce after Si Racha, a small village in Thailand.
When Tran moved to Los Angeles to start his business, he hand-made batches of hot sauce in a bucket and drove it to customers in his van.
"But his goal wasn’t to make a billion dollars," Suster writes. "He wasn’t driven by quick riches. He was driven by wanting to provide a great product. How much could the new generation of entrepreneurs learn from that? I know it’s what I look for when I want to back companies."
Today, Huy Fong Foods does $60 million in annual sales. And what's especially notable is that he didn't get any outside funding and never sold out.
Here's what touched Suster, in his words:
-.”
- Uncompromising product quality (he processes his chillies the same day they are harvested)
- He had a guiding principle for the company.

It runs well, but it does not start well. Windows Restarts are fine, but cold starts average 4-5 minutes to POST, with the record-holder so far being more than 48 minutes. I have had a number of 20 minute-plus POST times.
Radeon HD4670 video card
other USB peripherals are usually removed during testing
The motherboard has just been received back from RMA. The RMA made no difference.
The PSU is rated by the Corsair Calculator as being the right power level. NCIX, the vendor, agrees that it is the correct power for this system.
A G.Skill RAM tech advised me that, were the RAM not working properly with the system, then Windows would not be stable. He said a RAM problem would not manifest ONLY in pre-POST.
I have compiled some 102 pages as a .PDF showing all my startups since early July. Since building the computer in November, I have had POST times as low as 20 seconds only about a dozen times. But once POST has been reached, the system procedes up into Windows (not quickly) and works for hours, or, if not shut down, for days, without problems. I don't have bluescreens, and the computer seems to handle fairly large loads quite well. (I don't use it for gaming, however.)
Constraints: I don't have other components I can swap in and out, and I don't have the money to gamble on buying components that might or might not fix the problem.
Of course the usual advice is to strip the system down. So:
. . .I still received pre-POST times between 0:30 (30 seconds) and 1:30. There had been some faster POST times when the system was fully loaded.
(One mysterious clue, or perhaps irrelevant, was provided by a CD-RW which I have removed altogether. This CD-RW would emit "groan" sounds every 5 to 7 seconds during the long wait for the POST, and it certainly SOUNDED as though it were trying to start, and maybe recycling, every 5-7 seconds. It was easy to imagine the drives were not being given the power to start up, and therefore to consider a faulty PSU. However, removing the CD-RW made no difference, and there is also the point that the totally STRIPPED system (detailed above) was still very slow to reach POST.)
My next step is likely to be to RMA the PSU. However, I have my doubts. What do you think?
I would be very very happy to solve this problem, which as persisted 11 months.
Thank you.
Good job on the work you've done so far to debug this issue.
What is being shown on your display while you are waiting for POST to complete? If nothing is being displayed, what POST codes are being displayed?
If you don't have a POST card, you can find a PCI POST card for a few dollars online or at a computer electronics store.

The fast memory test, does a "quickie" memory test... Whereas the full memory test checks the entirety of the memory with a more rigorious memory test.... The quick test is typically enabled by default, and the full test can take several minutes if you have alot of memory...

At the moment, corn is the primary source of ethanol. It can be made from sugar or saw grass. The residue of corn-based ethanol is indeed used as livestock feed. But the use of corn for ethanol adversely affects the price of my nachos. And Bama's cornbread. (Have no idea where you can get real buttermilk, Bama. I can only wonder why you would want to. But then, you probably don't put sweet pickles on your peanut-butter sammich.)
"What I really wish is for the government to finance a "Manhattan Project" to find a substance that will free ourselves once and for all of dependence on oil as a fuel. We will never be completely free of oil, however, because it has countless industrial uses apart from fuel that will continue to require that we buy some oil but nothing like we do today."
Shoot! I'm in quick reply and can't do the quote justice. Danger! Will Robinson! The government can't fund its own toilet paper properly. When the demand requires it, it will be there. We'll be using hydrogen or electrically powered vehicles (recharged from nuclear plants), but our plastic bottles and Saran Wrap will be a bit harder to do without.
There are corporations out there working on alternatives. But, until WE want to buy fuel-efficient vehicles and adjust our lifestyles, there will be no money in it.

Faith - Poem by Annajoy Thompson
My faith has been tested
My love has been stretched
I've learned so much
But am blind to the rest
My mind has been trained
My heart has been weighed
I've lost so much
But my hope has remained
These questions left unanswered
The confusion pursues
But I have no fear
For my life is in you
Your faith is unfailing
Your love shall remain
Your mind is all-knowing
Your heart is the same

Thanks! HEHE!Fluidic – Sculpture in Motion is a new installation for Hyundai’s Advanced Design Center installed for Milan Design Week and created by Berlin based design studio WHITEvoid. The visitor enters a darkened space, the eyes slowly adapt and a dim wall of light in the middle of the room becomes increasingly visible. Wide curved cascading podiums lead up to the core installation As the spectator approaches the virtual walls part and a cloud of iridescent light particles activated by ultrasharp laserbeams becomes visible. All suspended in mid air hovering above a water mirror surface.
The installation wakes up, a singular point appears, the smallest element, the birth of light. More particles are following, accumulating, evaporating – creation of life. When the user gets closer to the installation curious light elements start to flicker and arrange. The visitor can actively engage with the swarm by moving in front of the installation. The swarm of lights will follow. The communication and the visitors is initiated.
The central core of the FLUIDIC installation the point cloud is composed of 12.000 small translucent spheres. These attached to almost invisible strings. The positions of the spheres in space are arranged seemingly random within the cloud. The algorithm takes into account the position by scanning the arrangement and projecting using 8 high power laser projectors positioned around the installation..
Production time took 4 months whereas time from proposal to final installation a total of 7 months including the 15 people core team with 32 helping hands for 3 weeks producing the 4100 strings with 12.000 spheres. Production and installation accuracy in overall setup +- 1 millimeter with 8 lasers with included processing units specifically produced for this installation, communication through LAN connection.
A total of 6 Kinect cameras are used for visitor tracking and the software used is VVVV and realtime sound in max for live. The hardware includes one PC for processing 6 kinects tracking data and generating 8 laser graphics output, one macMini for Sound output synced with main PC over LAN and 6 channel sound system plus 2 subwoofers, sound produced and realtime generated in dynamic surround. The whole system is suspended from ceiling and the overall weight of hanging structure is 2,2 tons. Water basin underneath is filled with 6000 liters of water and the total exhibition size over 1000m2. WHITEvoid designed the whole exhibition including podiums, lighting etc…
Christopher Bauder, founder of the design studio WHITEvoid, considers the project as a perfect symbiosis of futuristic technology, aesthetic art and involving the observers. “It’s not only the physical 3D display, but also the organic aspect the visitors create just due to their mere presence, that makes the FLUIDIC project a very unique art experience”, Bauder says.
An interactive realtime 3D simulation of the FLUIDIC installation created with Three.js can be found here: (Login: whitevoid / Password: nu2012)
FLUIDIC is on display at the Temporary Museum for New Design in Milan until April 14th 2013.

WHITEvoid’s main focus is to transfer bits and bytes into real space and the other way around. With this, Bauder and his team virtuously combine art, design and technology in their projects. The studio develops interactive installations but also products for museums, exhibitions, festivals and concerts. Many projects have been awarded with internationally renowned prizes, among others the reddot design award, iF communication Design Award or the International Media Architecture Award.Hot, My Dadima Wears a Sari. It’s just that there’s not a whole lot of variety in the titles I’ve seen. The two I’ve just mentioned, by Pooja Makhijani and Kashmira Sheth respectively, are great little books, but I think there’s a fair amount of tales you can tell aside from getting all sari-based. Food has always offered the best possible way of introducing children to other cultures. Whether you’re delving into Linda Sue Park’s Bee-bim Bop! or trying the sushi favored by Rosemary Wells’ Yoko, food is something all ages understand. With that in mind, F. Zia, an elementary school teacher who grew up in Hyderabad, India, brings us a story that combines contemporary Indian-American life, good old-fashioned storytelling, and delicious food all in one place. Add in the rather striking illustrations by newcomer Ken Min and you’ve a tasty concoction worthy of your notice..
Mixing contemporary life and fable in a tale can’t be easy. You don’t want to tip the book too much in the direction of contemporary life, or the fable aspects will get lost in the shuffle. At the same time, you also have to avoid telling too much of the fun exaggerated stories, or else your book will be promising future magic on which it can never deliver. Ms. Zia balances both by placing the story in context right from the start. The very first thing you see is Aneel thinking about his grandparents’ stories while the smoke of the incense beside him turns into rolling green fields and sunny skies. When Dada-ji does start telling his tale, it’s punctuated with some contemporary asides, rooting you in the present. So you have the story of grandparents from India now living with their American children and grandchildren on the one hand, and the conjured dreams of their stories on the other. It makes for a nice balance, a book that’s more interesting than if Zia had gone entirely one way or another.
Sometimes I’ll be entranced by the look of a book and its story, but the writing will turn me off completely. Ms. Zia, however, seems like an old hand at this game. Her words repeat beautifully at the beginning and the ending of the tale. She works in common Hindi words and phrases into the story so naturally that you can’t imagine the text existing without them. Best of all, she’s evocative. Even Dada-ji’s story begins with the right flavor. “In a village far, far away where the warm breeze made the green wheat fields dance and the brown coconuts rustle lived a lad who astonished the villagers morning, noon, and night.” I also appreciated that Zia avoided potential sap. It would have been all too easy to turn this tale into one where Dada-ji tells overblown tales of strength from his youth in the first half, only to grow ill in the second and have to be revived by his grandson’s roti recipe. It sounds odd to say, but part of why this book works is because there isn’t this peril at stake. Aneel’s motivations aren’t any greater than simply wanting to make some tasty food for his grandfather. Nothing wrong with that.
What are we to make of the animator turned children’s picture book illustrator? It’s a phenomenon that has grown increasingly over the last few years. On the one hand, not every animator has what it takes to tell a visual story, even if their images pop off the page and leave you wanting more. Ken Min, to my mind, has an advantage over his brethren then. As an animation storyboard artist, Min’s entire career has been based on visual storytelling. As such, storyboard artists sometimes make for the best transitional picture book artists. I say “sometimes” because there are some storyboarders who have a difficult time making their books look like anything more than a rote series of images stuck to a page. Min’s book works because he has no problem working Zia’s text in with his own images. The story bounces back and forth, and I particularly appreciated Min’s willingness to break apart his pictures into cutaway rectangles or extreme close-ups when the mood strikes. The illustrations are done in acrylic and colored pencil, though there’s a strange mixed-media feel to them. Sometimes you wonder if he didn’t cute a figure out and then just re-glue it to the page. Whatever it is he’s done, it keeps the images from turning flat at any point. Excellent!
But really, the whole reason I picked up the book in the first place probably had a lot to do with how Min does people. I like it when a book makes an effort to be more than a series of talking heads. Consider a sequence where Aneel runs to his different family members in the hope of getting one of them to make a batch of roti. First off, I was very grateful that he asks both men (his dad) and women to do this. Well played there. In each case Aneel is rebuffed, no better than by his older sis. The text reads, “Finally Aneel tried his big sister, Kiran, but she didn’t want sticky globs of dough getting under her starry nails.” The picture backs this up, but what I loved was how Kiran is pictured admiring the nail job on her left hand, while her right effectively covers up Aneel’s mouth, big sister-like. No misinterpretation there. On a rereading I also noticed that when Dada-ji tells his exaggerated tales of his youth, the kid in those pictures definitely has his nose. It’s a little detail, but one that shows that the artist was truly paying attention to what he was doing.
I did have one problem with a book, and it’s due to its success. Here you have a tale that talks up the deliciousness of a good plate of roti. When Dada-ji licks the salty specks from his fingertips the reader pretty much wants to get a taste of what’s going on as well. So I eagerly flipped to the end of the book for the obligatory food-based-picture-book-recipe only to find, to my horror, no recipe! No warm steamy roti! No hot chewy roti! No roti at all! There’s a very useful Glossary of terms available for English speakers who want to correctly pronounce some of the more difficult Hindi words and phrases, but it could easily have shared some space with a little delicious roti action. After all, the fact that Aneel makes perfect roti my merely throwing a couple ingredients into a bowl may give kids the wrong impression on how easy it is to replicate a beloved dish. Maybe a recipe would have alleviated that problem a bit..

Thanks for the shout-out.
This book looks great – thanks for the review/heads-up! Another great food-related book for kids is Dim Sum for Everyone by Grace Lin. Just used it in story times this past week and it was a big hit!
Many thanks, Fusenumber8 for your review.
ms. bird
thank you so much for your review. it’s caused quite a stir here on the left coast among family and friends. best way i can express it is that when i gave the review to my mother to read, she smiled. (and that’s something cause she’s a rather stoic person.
thanks again.

Hello Farhana,
great book and illustrations. Reminded me of my own grandfather. Good representation of nostalgic and happy moments with him.
Brought a smile and laughter to my face.
Keep it up. All the best moving forward.

I agree that food is an excellent way to introduce children to a new culture. Perhaps the second printing of the book will include a recipe for hot roti.
I’m so excited to see this book. My husband was born and raised in India, so we have lots of Indian blood in the family (including in our two kids). I’m always on the look out for well written picture books with a nice touch of “Indian” in them. I think I’m going to go pre-order this one right away! Thanks…
Hi, again. I was just looking at Lee and Low’s page for the book, and there is a link to a roti recipe there!Printable version

Very good book, as long as you have not upgraded to CS2
By bjt
from Undisclosed
I found his book (and CD) very good. His lesson planning was excellent. However, as I am using CS2 versus a later edition of CS software, was not able to use the shortcuts, etc., that he provided for the book.Am also disappointed that his Photoshop CS2 will not be released until August.

Very good book for a Photoshop novice like me
By Anonymous
The book is very well-written and easy to read. I can see the immediate impact on my pictures after reading each lesson. The author takes you straight to the important functionality (and skip the useless or less powerful features which glut the Photoshop interface). I've rarely felt so empowered just by reading a book. Kudos Deke !One wish is that the book would give more than one example for each technique (may be as a separate exercice at the end of each chapter, to avoid disrupting the flow). Also I haven't found the videos to be that useful to watch. They seem to be more like a advertisement to entice you to buy additional video lessons.But these are small minuses considering how much I've learned in a few hours of reading the book and doing the exercices.Highly recommended !Thierry
's much more than just a book! Deke McClelland is known worldwide as a Photoshop Master. The things he does with Photoshop are simply magical and he does them with such style and grace! He makes things that I previously considered extremely difficult as simple as saying "1 2 3". He is truly a MASTER!This is actually a "one-on-one visual classroom" with two hours of video instruction on the accompanying CD. The minimum requirements for this classroom are:1. Adope Photoshop CS Software.2. 256MB of RAM.3. 650MB of free hard disk space (350MB for Photoshop and 350MB for the One-on-Oneproject preference settings, color settings and keyboard shortcuts – (optional but recommended).One-on-One includes the following 12 Lessons:1. File management and navigation. File Browser. Contact Sheet II and PDF Presentation.2. Brightness and contrast. Levels, curves, histogram and shadow/highlight commands. 3. Color balance, variations, hue/saturation and camera raw.4. Selection tools. Select menu. Paths Palette.5. Crop and transform. Image size. Canvas size.6. Painting and retouching. Paint brush and healing brush. Color replacement tools. History palettes.7. Masking functions. Color range and extract commands. Channels palette.8. Focus adjustments.

We will make peace with Photoshop through understanding, the understanding borne by knowledge, the knowledge wrought by experience. Take heart, kindred spirit; mastery will be yours".It was a great pleasure to review this book and I feel honored to have spent this time with the MASTER!ADOBE PHOTOSHOP CS one-on-oneDeke McClelland, AuthorPublished by: deke Press/O'Reilly1005 Gravenstein Highway NorthSebastopol, CA 95472(800) 998-9938: $ 39.95 US

From Conservapedia
A catacomb is an underground cemetery consisting of a gallery with recesses for tombs. [1] Catacombs are present in many cities around the world.
Roman Catacombs
The catacombs in Rome were underground tunnels and burial galleries for Christian martyrs in ancient Rome. Christians would recognize the contributions of these martyrs by attending ceremonies in the catacombs on the anniversaries of the deaths of the martyrs.
French Catacombs
The Catacombs in Paris, France are a series of tunnels converted into a mass grave during the 18th century in order to alleviate the problem of overcrowding in the cemeteries in the city. The monks responsible for cleaning and arranging the remains organized them into piles and patterns ranging from Xs to crosses. There are estimated to be the remains of 5 to 6 million people in the Parisian catacombs.[2] The tunnels are a popular tourist spot today, however there are sometimes issues with tourists stealing a bone or two as a souvenir.

Anthony Weiner is not without an opinion, so it seems fitting that the disgraced ex-politician will be sharing them. Online, of course.
The former congressman, whose sexting derailed not only his tenure in Washington but doomed his campaign for New York City mayor, has signed on to be a political columnist for Business Insider, the business and technology news website.
,” says the announcement on the website.
As we all know by now, Weiner resigned from Congress in 2011 after he admitted to sending salacious messages and pictures to women via Twitter and Facebook.
Weiner tried for a political comeback last year and briefly led polls for the Democratic nomination for New York City mayor — until he admitted he continued to send lewd messages after resigning from Congress. He finished fifth, well behind Democratic nominee (and now New York City Mayor) Bill de Blasio.
Says Weiner in the Business Insider announcement: “I look forward to a spirited conversation with the BI community.” Naturally, Weiner shared the news via Twitter.
The “Weiner!” column will run on the last Friday of every month, starting March 28. He also regularly shares his opinions via a column for the New York Daily News.Where can I find some Korean fried chicken up in here? :-)
there was a previous discussion on this topic -- i don't think the KFC you are hankering for is available here but there is another type:...
there's also a few places that do something call "Bul Dak" which is literally "Fire Chicken", I think there are places on bloor, east of christie that advertise this on their signage...
good luck and please share your finds!
- re: berbere
There is a Korean fried chicken place (I think it's called Ajuker chicken) on Bloor Street. It's on the north side of Bloor and I think it's about 4 doors east of Tacos El Asador (if I recall correctly). Unfortunately, the place itself is nothing to write home about -- flourescent lights and not all that attractive, but the chicken is delish. Very light crispy batter and quite inexpensive. Recommended.
- re: mickeyj
There is also an Ajuker chicken place in a plaza on Yonge St north of Steeles...I think on Glen Cameron. The place is TIIINY... I've only been there once, but there are maybe 4 tables, so I guess, just like the downtown location, it's nothing to see. The chicken is made fresh to order though. He fried it up when we ordered and we had to wait about 10 minutes to get it. You can get it plain or with some special sauce. The sauce is actually pretty good.
I'm not sure what mickeyj means by quite inexpensive, but i agree that it is delicious :) Sorry I can't remember the exact prices, but i remember it came up to 10 bucks for about 10 small wings.
- re: sumashi
Also right across the same parking lot from Ajuker in Thornhill is another little restaurant called House of Hot Taste that serves up a lot of KFC. Clientele there at lunch was mostly younger kids.
As their name suggests, they do a lot of the spicy sauce, but also have some non-spicy as well. I tried the sweet sauce fried chicken (1/2 bird)... the waiter said it was his favorite, but it was nothing special. Maybe Ajuker (the take out one) is better?
Is it good because it's double-deep fried?
- re: Royaljelly
I think that's the secret to their fried chicken... double-deep fried! My guess is that they do it at really high heat and do it twice with a cooling period in between so that it doesn't burn....?
I had the half/half... with sauce and without. The skin stayed crunchy, even under the sweet spicy sauce, It also didn't taste incredibly oily if I remember right...
- re: sumashi
I just read a review of Korean Fried Chicken on the blog below, he mentioned the NY times article too.....
Thanks for the info, I came here first looking for where a KFC restaurant would be in Toronto. The internet is great.....I'm hungry.Saturday, August 20, 2011
Summer Concert Catch-Up
Titus Andronicus and Okkervil River at the Wiltern, 6/23/11
Both of these bands came in riding the respective records that had made me a fan, but I was curious how they would translate live and if they would be a compatible pair. Titus Andronicus came out blazing, opening with the epic "A More Perfect Union," which they somehow played faster than the studio version. Lead singer/guitarist Patrick Stickles raged and rocked in all his bearded glory, but the sound people apparently didn't know he was playing the solos for at least a song or two, and some of the greatness was lost in the mix. Still, the band was tight and explosive, and when they closed with "Four Score and Seven," their best, most anthemic song, I sweated and smiled and almost lost the glasses off my face, a problem I was happy to see I wasn't too old to experience.
blow up the Fonda last summer as Roky Erickson's backing band? I don't know if it was another sound issue or just fewer musicians than they had in studio, but right off the bat I was denied the ferocity I was hoping to hear. "White Shadow Waltz," a standout and suitably epic choice for opener, somehow lost its grandiosity. A couple songs later they played the best new song, "Rider," but the acoustic guitar strumming that gives it so much of its depth couldn't rise above Will Sheff's voice, which was entirely too loud in relation to the music. The lack of a second drummer hurt as well, but I had thought they would have found a way around it. (To be fair, that song's Ramones reference, 'down on Rock-, Rockaway Beach' had an extra 'rock' thrown in to match the cadence of the original song, a nice touch.)
Despite my affinity for the band being a byproduct of the new album, the songs that worked the best for me were the older ones, and I couldn't have named a single one of them if you'd paid me. Ultimately that was ok, despite my slight disappointment with the execution of my favorites, but I kept thinking about Titus Andronicus throughout. Whether that's a criticism of Okkervil River or just a serious compliment for their openers, I'm not sure. Probably both.

Encore: Unless It's Kicks
Soundgarden at the Great Western Forum, 7/22/11
Fast forward to 2011, I've just recently turned thirty, and now I'm the one shelling out silly amounts of money to see a band that I came of age musically with, and hold in much higher regard than most current groups. Soundgarden's Superunknown is the first CD I ever went out and purchased for myself (probably at The Wherehouse, but possibly Blockbuster Music), and one of the few I never sold back in a fit of adolescent impatience and poverty. I've never sat down to actually rank my entire musical library--do I smell a future blog post?--but I imagine it would rank in my all-time Top 20, easily. Sadly, the one time I saw Soundgarden before they broke up was at Lollapalooza 1996, along with Metallica and the Ramones, and I barely remember it. Too much pot smoke floating around Irvine Meadows that day for my fifteen year old self to hang.
Now they were back, and though I was a bit younger than the fogies talkin' shit at that Who show, I finally understood where they were coming from. (And wasn't any less wrong. It happens.) Even more than Daltrey, Chris Cornell's voice still sounded amazing, and the band sounded like they'd never been away. If anything, Cornell flexed his pipes a little too much, going high in spots on songs like "Spoonman" that sound better with his low end. And this was no greatest hits spotlight; right off the bat they started playing songs from the very beginning of their career. Normally I'd be all about the deep cuts, but when it started to look like every album but the last two was going to get that treatment, I got a little disgruntled. After they did "Black Rain," a song that they surely love a lot more than anyone in the audience did, I turned to my girlfriend and said "You know, it'd be nice if they pulled a little from Superunknown!" Almost like they heard me, six of the final seven selections from the main set were from that album, including a killer rendition of the title track with Pearl Jam's Mike McCready on dual lead, and hidden gem "Head Down."
The encore was more choices for the hardcore fan, closing with Badmotorfinger epic "Slaves & Bulldozers," but I think my favorite moment was when they did the hit single from that record, "Outshined." As thousands of people sang out, in unison, "Show me the power, child, I'd like to say that I'm down on my knees today," it gave me the butterflies, making me feel like I was thirteen again in all the best ways.
Set List: Searching with My Good Eye Open / Spoonman / Gun / Jesus Christ Pose / Room a Thousand Years Wide / Blow Up the Outside World / Loud Love / Big Dumb Sex / Ugly Truth / Fell on Black Days / Flower / Outshined / Black Rain / Rusty Cage / The Day I Tried to Live / My Wave / Burden in My Hand / Black Hole Sun / Head Down / Superunknown (with Mike McCready) / 4th of July
Encore: Beyond the Wheel / Hunted Down / Mailman / Slaves & Bulldozers
Fucked Up at the El Rey, 7/26/11
I was not-so-secretly hoping they would play the whole fuckin' album, and when they opened with the musical intro "Let Her Rest" I felt something coiling inside me, ready to explode at the opening riffs of "Queen of Hearts." The rest of the crowd appeared to be feeling the same thing, as the whole place started moving and Abraham jumped right into the sea of people in front of the stage after only a few fuckin' words. This took me out of it for a moment because while I love that level of energy and intensity, I'm a real stickler for hearing the songs as close to how I know them as possible, so when lines were being dropped because he was bouncing around the pit I got annoyed. Then I decided to stop being such an uptight fuck and rolled with it.
After it became clear that they weren't playing the entire album, the motherfuckers came back to it with one of my favorites, "Turn the Season." With killer backup vocals and lead guitar that sounds like a fuckin' boomerang, it's the catchiest track and got the house worked up even more. As it turned out, they only played six songs from David, but it didn't matter at all. It was just an hour and a half of crazy, pissed off punk rock done right. You're fuckin' A.
Set List: Let Her Rest---->Queen of Hearts / David Comes to Life / Turn the Season / Black Albino Bones / Running on Nothing / Crooked Head / I Hate Summer / The Other Shoe / Twice Born / A Little Death / Magic Word / Police / Son the Father

As someone who was about the same age when I saw Zeppelin at The Forum in 1977 as you were when you first saw Soundgarden, I am probably guilty of the sin you describe. But to my credit, I do have a certain level of animosity to old rockers my age who scream out "Free Bird" at concerts because I do continue to listen to new music.
From that set list, Head Down makes me the most excited, probably because it's got Kim Thayil's Indian influence all over it in the guitar work, and it was the absence of Kim Thayil over the years that made me sad Soundgarden had dissolved. And as an old Led Zep fan, you can imagine how much I appreciate Cornell's vocal gifts.
Have you ever seen Lindsey Buckingham live and solo? Strongly recommend if you are a fan of masterful guitar work, though his audiences usually have a handful of KLOS-type idiots.
Hooray for new visitors from other corners of the internet! Though admittedly not that far.
Yes on "Head Down!" I almost commented on the difference between that whole album and the previous ones, where the Eastern sound had crept in, but then I decided I had gone on long enough. My older brother and best friend were both excited to hear they played it too, so I guess it's a secret favorite. I was hoping for "Fresh Tendrils," but I ain't complaining.
Never seen Buckingham. I've done a decent job of seeing the older rockers--in addition to The Who, I've seen The Stones, John Fogerty, Al Green, Levon Helm, McCartney, Roger Waters--but he's one the ones I'd still like to catch.
He's got a new album coming out this fall, tour likely to follow. He usually plays multiple locations in SoCal. I cannot stress enough how talented and underrated this guy is. Blows my mind every time, I went a live show of his for first live show 18 years ago and it about blew my mind (and I also had better seats than Stevie, just sayin').
I've seen McCartney, circa Wings Over America (my first concert, in fact, I was 13). I'm dying to see David Gilmour. Regret missing Nirvana. Mike Campbell has a side project that plays locally several times a year called the Dirty Knobs. Very much a music lover's type of gig, it's basically song setup and guitar solos. He's got an impressive collection of axes and you never know who is going to be there. Steve Ferrone and Ron Blair used to be in the band, but TP forced them to quit. Jason Sinay from Five Easy Pieces is in the Knobs, too.
Okay, too many "blew my mind" references, sorry, I'm usually more elegant.Register now for free, or sign in with any of these services:

After the resentment begins, it starts to build quickly and before long, you'll be spending your lunch breaks complaining about how much you dislike this particular person.
It causes an unhealthy amount of stress in the workplace.
To deal with this situation, Peter Bregman at Lifehacker brings up an interesting point: Perhaps the reason why you don't like this other people is because "in the dark shadowy parts of your psyche, you can detect shards of that disagreeable trait in yourself" and this reminds you of what "you can't stand about yourself."
How do you deal with this?
Bregman says the best long-term solution would be to try to get to know them better. This way you are also getting to know parts of yourself better, and you can make changes to your own character flaws.
He writes:
?"
"And being compassionate with yourself is the key to being compassionate with others. Before you know it, you'll actually begin to like people you never liked before. Maybe you'll even feel like helping them run those meeting more productively."The Zionist Organization of America opened a Jerusalem office. The office, whose opening will be officially announced at a news conference in Jerusalem later this month, is headed by Jeffrey Daube, a former special needs educator with extensive experience in Israel issues in Washington.
Daube has been associated with several pro-Israel groups, including the American Israel Public Affairs Committee; NORPAC, a pro-Israel political action committee; and Palestinian Media Watch. ,” ZOA President Morton Klein said in a statement. “We will also be fighting to take Jerusalem and the so-called Palestinian refugee issues off the table.”Brad Stevens had never been ejected at any level of basketball before Saturday, and he wasn’t proud of breaking his streak.
With 35 seconds left in the game, Stevens and Gerald Wallace were issued four technical fouls in short succession and tossed from the Boston Celtics’ 105-98 loss to the Sacramento Kings. Getting the Jerry Sloan Special wasn’t Stevens’ idea of a good time, though he was apologetic afterward in declining to discuss the first time in his coaching career he’s been send to the lock room early.
“I don’t know what Gerald said,” Stevens told reporters. “I’ll just avoid talking about it. That’s probably the best thing.”
Whatever he said — though it doesn’t sound like much — Stevens’ ejection fittingly summed up just how exasperated the Celtics (19-38) were with the officiating against the Kings (19-36). Longtime Celtics nemesis Marc Davis being part of the crew working the game didn’t help, either, to lessen the feeling of injustice.
When DeMarcus Cousins picked up his fifth personal foul on a charge with just under eight minutes left in the game, the Celtics felt they were in control. Kelly Olynyk hit a 3-pointer on the next possession to cut Boston’s deficit to one point, and when Cousins nearly flipped out while shoving away Kris Humphries a couple of minutes later, the Celtics thought for sure the Kings center, who already had a technical foul in the game, was done for the night.
But Davis, Eli Roe and David Guthrie swallowed their whistles, as they did most of the night. Cousins battled throughout the game with Humphries, Brandon Bass and Joel Anthony, and every Celtics defender managed to stay out of foul trouble. Still, the Celtics were not pleased that it took until the final 31 seconds for Cousins to finally receive his sixth foul.
You might not be happy about it, but congratulations on your first NBA heave-ho, Brad. Here’s to many more — because that would mean you get to stick around the league for a while.
Stevens certainly wasn’t thrilled with the officiating, but the fact that the referees let both teams play might actually have worked in the Celtics’ favor. Boston’s interior defenders were extremely physical with Cousins, none more so than Humphries. Yet Humphries finished with only three personal fouls and racked up 19 points, eight rebounds and two blocks in 36 minutes.
Cousins played dumb with print reporters afterward, claiming he didn’t know who Humphries was. In an earlier postgame interview, however, Cousins made clear that he recognized Humphries.
“He’s a scrappy guy,” Cousins said. “That’s the type of role he has to have to stay in this league, so I guess he’s got to do his job.”
It was meant as a backhanded compliment, but it was a compliment nonetheless. Cousins could learn a few things from Humphries, in fact. Much of the Celtics’ second-half comeback from 16 points down was made possible by Cousins complaining to the referees and taking multiple plays off. He’s also not much of a defender, not because he lacks the skills but because he lacks the desire.
Cousins is right about Humphries needing to be scrappy to stay in the NBA. But Cousins could also stand to benefit from being a little more scrappy himself, and not just in the ways that earn technical foul.CRAFTY SAVVY // 28th November 2011
You think crochet was only good for old grannies and pregnant women? How wrong you are! In the last few years, there’s a big trend going on with crochet, a return of hype for the art of the needle and for all things crafty in general.
In fact, crochet is so hype right now that a new science was born: crochetdermy.
Please meet Shauna Richardson, the artist who invented and coined the term and discipline. The UK based creative has a background in conceptual art. The body of work she calls Crochetdermy is her investigation into the theory that “Anything can be art“.
She sculpts life-size animal – taxidermy-like mammals – using crochet. Richardson’s work has received much critical acclaim, worldwide media coverage and has been sold to collectors across the globe.
In 2009, the artist was the recipient of the Artists taking the lead award of the London 2012 Cultural Olympiad with the Lionheart Project. She is exhibiting a life-size brown bear at the V&A Museum in London during the show entitled The Power of Making. On view until January the second 2012.

Every day, it's a million phone calls to get myself and the Girl situated into Danish life. We found an apartment, bought a car. The Girl found a good language course for foreign doctors.
At times, I am excited. Mostly, I think about the kids. As I am typing, I keep glancing over at their pictures on the wall. I talk to Daughter every night on the phone and picture where she is in her room, whether she is sitting or standing. I wonder what it would be like to lift her up and touch her. Leaving them like this is a potent mixture of longing and guilt that often brings tears to my eyes.
I have a recurring fantasy about surprising them after school one day. It's torture, because it won't happen; but I think about the looks on their faces and the night that would ensue. We used to have nights together that I took for granted; trips to the YMCA, books in bed.
It will take some time for me to come to terms with living away from them. Daughter, of course, comes over to live here this summer. I can't wait for that moment when she moves here. Son is still too young to talk to on the phone and I am not sure he understands that we moved away. Towards the end, he would break my heart sometimes with his naive ways. A month or so before the move, we were running together, doing something I can't remember. He stopped and looked up at me and said "I'm a fast runner like you, Papa, because you are my Papa". Near the end, I would pull him close to tell him that it wasn't his fault that I was moving and that I would think about his every day. I told him it was the stupid doctor world, which made us do it. He didn't understand at all.
The Girl seems to be adjusting just fine. It's an adventure for her, of course. She is picking up Danish impressively quickly to the point where she can carry a slow conversation and watch Danish TV. It's a bit of an issue between us, that I would prefer to be in the US with the kids, while she would prefer to be here. I try to be as excited as I can for her sake and, at times, I am truly happy about being here. At the same time, it's brewing under the surface. I feel like if we hit some major setback here I would want to bail immediately, whereas she would want to stay here.
As you can see, it's hard. I think things will be fine in a couple of months.
Running-wise, we are both running lots of slow miles. We have an 8.2K race on Saturday, which looks to be fairly uncompetitive. Someone fast could always show up but I doubt it. There are "Christmas Prizes" so it will be interesting to see what the family brings home. Will post a report.

Tough to read. At one point I had to make a decision to leave my friends and my older son behind, and for my son to leave his dad behind - so that my boyfriend wouldn't have to leave his son. Of course, there is much more involved, but somehow I thought this sacrifice is less than the one he would have to make. Knowing him, and learning more and more about him, tells me it will be a right decision. But only you guys can make yours.
Congrats on the win.

Expand Messages
- Hello - I am new to this group but I have to say that I am extremely
pleased with what what has been done in enhancing the functionality
of the Slug. And I would say to the powers that be, Well Done!
I have been using my NSLU2 for about 2 months, and wanted to enhance
its capabilities and increase its functionality, which lead me to
here. This is my first attempt at this, but I felt pretty
confident, as I have pretty extensive experience on UNIX platforms.
Anyway, here is a brief description of my issue....
Recently, I took my current slug, running the factory installed
V23R73 firmware, and replaced it with the Unslung 6.8 beta firmware.
Following the directions precisely, and I successfully upgraded the
firmware. I hadn't actually Unslung it yet, but it did seem to be
functioning fine for the time being running from the device Firmware.
Here is where things seemed to go awry...
I attempted to Unsling the device through telnet with the drive
attached to Port1 (I will move to Port2 in the future). At first I
was not successful using a WD MyBook and I had seen some thing in
the wiki about issues with those drives. I then attached a Maxtor
OneTouch, and the Unsling command (/sbin/unsling disk1) ran
correctly, and I then restarted the slug, and it hasn't been
available on the network since. So as of now, there is no way to
access the slug. I can't even ping the address.
So in looking over what was done to the device and the drive
partition. I can tell you the following:
1) All lights on the slug appear to be normal, as I have no flashing
lights of any king on the slug, except standard network and I/O
lighting.
2) It is not a network issue, as all other network devices are fine
(even changed the cable based upon a previous post).
3) I ran an IP Scan of my network, thinking that the IP may have
gotten changed to something else that I was unaware.
I then took the drive off the slug, and connected it to one of my
boxes, and looked over the newly created partition, and associative
file system. And for some reason, it does not look right. For
instance, the was no /etc or /etc/samba dirs which seem to be
referenced elsewhere. Most of the config files (group, password,
etc)were placed in root. There was no sysconfig as I would expect
in Linux system, although I did find a config file that had all the
appropriate setting from my original slug configuration in it. Is
this the slugs representation of sysconfig?
Anyway, I hope someone out there can assist me, and help point me in
the right direction. This is really bugging the crap out of me, and
I would like to figure it out.
Thank you all in advance.

This part of the two article series concentrates on theming a watermark textbox control discussed in a previous part. We are going to create a look-less custom watermark textbox control to be more specific.
I use StyleCop in my projects to make the code readable in a uniform way. So, if you should get an error when compiling the project, you can either download and install StyleCop, or edit/remove the corresponding entries in each .csproj file:
<Import Project="$(ProgramFiles)\MSBuild\StyleCop\v4.7\StyleCop.Targets" />
ChangeThemeCommand_Executed
TextBoxWithWatermark
Themes/Generic.xaml
Generic.xaml
<SolidColorBrush x:
<SolidColorBrush x:
<Style TargetType="{x:Type local:TextBoxWithWatermark}">
<Setter Property="SnapsToDevicePixels" Value="True"/>
<Setter Property="Template">
<Setter.Value>
<ControlTemplate TargetType="{x:Type local:TextBoxWithWatermark}">
<ControlTemplate.Resources>
<BooleanToVisibilityConverter x:
<local:WatermarkHelper x:
</ControlTemplate.Resources>
<Grid>
<Grid.RowDefinitions>
The Style tag at the root tells WPF that we are going to define a style for each and everyTextBoxWithWatermark control that does not come with an alternative style. An alternative style can either be defined in:
Style
DarkExpresssion/SimpleStyles/SimpleControls.xaml
The most basic style application includes a Setter property tag in which the Property attribute selects the properties' name, and the Value attribute the actual value that we want to define for this particular style.The Template setter is a little more elaborate. It can be used to define a ControlTemplate for our custom control. The control template contains pretty much the same code as the original user control from the first part of this article. Compare the contents in the TextBoxWithWatermark.xaml file from part 1 with the SimpleControls/Themes/Generic.xaml file in part 2 and you will notice that I moved the UserControl.Resources section into the ControlTemplate.Resources and kept the layout in the Grid further below.
Setter
Property
Value
Template
TextBoxWithWatermark.xaml
SimpleControls/Themes/Generic.xaml
UserControl.Resources
ControlTemplate.Resources
Defining a default look and feel for a control in Themes/Generic.xaml file is only half the price because we also have to tell WPF to look there if a style is not defined. We do this by stating the ThemeInfo attribute in the SimpleControls/Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs file:
ThemeInfo
SimpleControls/Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs
)
)]
A custom look-less control does not define its own GUI. Instead the GUI is either defined in the Generic.xaml file of the source assembly or in the applications theming. Therefore, I have removed the TextBoxWithWatermark.xaml portion from the TextBoxWithWatermark.xaml.cs user control of part 1 and created effectively a new code behind file in TextBoxWithWatermark.cs.Comparing TextBoxWithWatermark.xaml.cs from part 1 with TextBoxWithWatermark.cs from part 2 reveals that I only added a static constructor and removed the standard constructor (since this.InitializeComponent(); is no longer used in a custom control.
TextBoxWithWatermark.xaml.cs
TextBoxWithWatermark.cs
.xaml.cs
TextBoxWithWatermark.cs
this.InitializeComponent();
static TextBoxWithWatermark()
{
DefaultStyleKeyProperty.OverrideMetadata(typeof(<b>TextBoxWithWatermark</b>),
new FrameworkPropertyMetadata(typeof(<b>TextBoxWithWatermark</b>)));
}
The DefaultStyleKeyProperty property tells WPF to find the default stylefor the TextBoxWithWatermark control class in the Themes/Generic.xaml file.This is done with a static constructor because it applies to each and every TextBoxWithWatermark control object that does not get its style through an alternative route as discussed above.It is worthwhile to point out that you can use the OnApplyTemplate method to initialize a look-less control whenever a new theme is applied to it. This was not necessary here so I did note implement that method.
DefaultStyleKeyProperty
OnApplyTemplate
This part of creating a custom look-less control is not strictly necessary for every custom control but I included it here because it might raises a few eye browse otherwise.The 'special' thing about the watermarked textbox is that it uses a converter (Using ValueConverter and MultiValueConverter in WPF) to decide whether the watermark should be shown or not.Comparing WatermarkHelper.cs converter from part 1 with that of part 2 reveals that I changed the visibility of the class from internal to public. This change was necessarybecause the ControlTemplates in the ExpressionDark and WhistlerBlue themes would otherwise not have worked and I did not see a reason to strictly hide this in the custom control implementation. Making the converter public and part of the ControlTemplate adds flexibility to this implementation because it enables everyone to implement there own converter and showing the watermark based on there own logic without having to change the original implementation in the DLL project.

The weekend of May 11th-13th, New River Academy left the woods of West Virginia behind, and headed into the metropolis of Washington DC for a little culture, and of course, a little kayaking.
Earlier this year, I introduced the students in my World Literature class to the Holocaust when we read Marcus Zusak’s book The Book Thief. The Book Thief tells the story of a young German girl named Liesel Memminger and her foster family, and their decision to hide a Jew in their Munich basement during World War Two. It is a story in part about the power of words, and the power of friendship.
While reading the book, I was surprised to see how little the students knew about the Holocaust in general, and some of the history behind it.Hence, a field trip was born; the idea being to bring the students to the Holocaust Museum, and then let them wander around DC to absorb some culture, see some sights, etc. But what field trip at a kayaking highschool would be complete without a little kayaking to accompany the glories of our nations capital?
Fortunately for us, the Potomac river (yes, the one that Washington crossed) runs right through the heart of Washington DC, and just a bit further South of the city is the Whitewater kayaking paradise of Potomac Gorge, and the legendary Great Falls. We were lucky enough to have NRA alumni Jordan Poffenburger put us up at his home just outside of the city, and with the help of DC local Geoff Calhoun, show us down the Falls. Ned Poffenburger showed the rest of our group down the lower part of the Potomac gorge, home to several great play spots, and some beautiful scenery.
Great Falls is a maze of channels and slots on a river wider than the highways and beltways circling DC. Located in a national park, it is a coveted run for mid-Atlantic paddlers, primarily because it is imperative to know the lines and where to go on the river, to avoid getting hurt or arrested by the park service. On our way to the river, Jordan regaled us with stories of kayakers accidentally signalling rescue helicopters to save them, thanks to well meaning bystanders and tourists at the park.
In the evening light, with birds circling above the river, the Potomac felt pre-historic. It was hard to imagine that the city of DC was a mere 20 minute drive away. It seemed more likely that we would see dinosaurs around the next bend in the river, rather than seeing their skeletons in the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History.
Saturday was an epic day of urban adventures. The day started off at the US Memorial Holocaust Museum, where students went into the permanent exhibit as well as a temporary exhibit on Propoganda- a perfect example of the power of the media in government- our most recent chapter in Government. Then students were allowed to explore the joys of DC on their own, before meeting up to see “Dynamic Earth” at the Einstein Planetarium, a film produced by my dad about the carbon cycle- currently being studied by Kira Tenney’s Environmental Science class. Post movie, we had a sunset photoshoot in front of the Washington Monument before heading home.
Despite behind tired from our city fun, we decided to return and paddle a Great Falls and the lower gorge again on Sunday before heading home to Fayetteville and finals week.Find Restaurants in Nebraska

About Make-up Class Assignments
Due to school closures for snow days, holidays, and other SNR schedules, all Monday evening classes have six (6) classes that need to be made up by the end of March. Since there are many challenges of having students come in on Fridays and two Sundays, the SNR Administration as given the instructors the opportunity to arrange make-up assignments. To quote Associate Dean for Curriculum and Instructrion, Dr. Louis deSalle, "As the assignments are submitted students will be marked present on these dates. If by these dates students have not completed the assignments, they will be marked absent." I will add to this by saying that assignments not handed in will affect your final grade. Below is the schedule all make-up assignments are to be submitted:

WASHINGTON, Jan. 16, 2008 U.S. defense officials made it clear today that while they appreciate the hard work NATO troop-contributing nations are doing in Afghanistan, more counterinsurgency training would help further the allies' success.
In response to reports that Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates was displeased with NATO allies, Pentagon Press Secretary Geoff Morrell said that the secretary praises the allies’ work. But, he added, the secretary is concerned about their need for counterinsurgency training.
“At no time did he ever criticize any single country for their performance in, or commitment to the mission in Afghanistan,” Morrell said.
Gates has praised the countries involved in the fight in Afghanistan’s Regional Command South, he said, and has many times singled out Canadian, British and Dutch forces “for their professionalism, commitment and bravery in their work in RC-South.”
Gates has noted, however, that NATO as an alliance does not train for counterinsurgency,” Morrell said. “The alliance has never had to do it before.”
NATO came into being in 1949 as a defensive alliance aimed at the Soviet Union. NATO forces were structured to stop the Soviet Union’s Red Army from coming through the Fulda Gap in West Germany and striking through Western Europe.
Gates “is concerned, and he expressed that to the allies, that we may be sending operational mentoring and liaison teams to Afghanistan which are not properly trained,” Morrell said.
These teams go to train the Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police. Gates is concerned that the teams are not well-schooled in counterinsurgency tactics and strategies, Morrell said.
“That’s why there has been a push to send OMLTs to Hohenfels (in Germany) to get counterinsurgency training before going to Afghanistan,” he said, using the military shorthand term for operational mentoring and liaison teams.
The U.S. 7th Army Training Center runs a training area at the base that trains Europe-based American units that are deploying to Iraq and Afghanistan.
Gates has seen the progress that forces and civilian organizations can make in following a counterinsurgency regimen, Morrell said. The secretary has visited Khowst in Regional Command East and has seen how American forces have had success with counterinsurgency.
“We’ve been doing this for six or seven years, so we are figuring it out,” Morrell said. “It’s taken us a long time to get there. We’re only now enjoying that kind of cohesive counterinsurgency success in RC East.”
The bottom line with Gates is that he is concerned with NATO and how it is structured to deal with counterinsurgencies, Morrell said, adding that the secretary is not worried about any particular country.
“Everybody is putting themselves on the line to go after the Taliban and al Qaeda,” Morrell said. “They are doing an astoundingly brave job.”Bakugan Dimensions Locations Category page 4,842pages on this wiki Edit History Talk0 Bakugan Interspace Bayview Stadium Observatory Bakugan Interspace Stadium Barber Shop Gear Shop Gundalian Ship School Lobby Subcategories This category has only the following subcategory.

Its okay to say, "I don't know." But it looks like that isn't what you're doing. It looks like you're saying that Jesus (as depicted in biblical mythology) can exist or not exist depending upon the individual. That simply isn't the case nor is it rational.
It would be akin to stating that the existence of Peter Pan is subjective. The existence of this person doesn't change or fluxuate depending upon the individual. Either Pan existed or he didn't. To assert that he did implies certain qualities about Peter Pan that are either in reality or they aren't. If they aren't, and exist only in story and legend, then the Peter Pan of the story exists only in Disney Lore and not in reality.
If, however, we can demonstrate that a person once lived and stopped aging in a place called Never, Never Land; could fly with pixie dust; and defeated a pirate -then we have qualities that fit the story of Peter Pan and its reasonable to apply them to the story, making the central character a reality.
Likewise, with Jesus, there are qualities about this alleged messiah that make up the character. Its easy enough to show that the
name
Jesus in its original Hebrew was in use during the first century BCE. Its easy enough to show that religious superstitions and political agendas existed among the Hebrew people of the region at the same time. It is, then, easy to conclude that a person named Jesus created a cult following based on these superstitions.
However, what cannot be shown, is that the person above -who may have
inspired
the myth that followed, actually performed the deeds mentioned in biblical mythology. Indeed, enough of these deeds, actions and accounts are contradictory, improbable and irrational so as to demonstrate that such a person almost certainly did not exist.
Therefore, the existence or non-existence of Jesus, the alleged christ, is not a subjective position.!ONCE IN A WICHITA HOTEL
The following is poem number 10 of 2009’s NaPoWriMo – 30 poems in 30 days during the month of April. The original prompt was, “laughing buddha”. Like poem number 9 (CHICAGO), it’s quite a deviation. In the original draft, which took a while to come to light, the little girl was carrying a stone buddha. It made more sense to give her a doll.
ONCE IN A WICHITA HOTEL
I saw a little girl walking along railroad tracks
carrying a baby doll while a three-legged dog
hopped nearby. I wanted to yank the window up,
say something, Good morning, ask how the dog
lost its leg, anything, but figured she’d think
I was crazy. What kind of person yells
to little girls from a hotel window but a madman
running from life? Surely someone has told her
to beware of men like me. And to think
the only reason I was awake was because
a train ran past the hotel on those same tracks
every other hour all night – just when
my rhythms were almost in sync
a new locomotive blew past like a ghost,
until I gave up on sleep all together, made a pot
of coffee from a bag left in the wicker bowl
on the empty dresser and decided to wait
for the next train to go by, so I could yank up
the window and yell at it – but what kind of madman
yells into a wheat-colored sunrise
at a train that can’t hear you and wouldn’t care
if it did? I decided at least I should call out to the girl
to watch for the train which was sure to pass
any moment – that’s when I discovered
the window was painted shut, probably to keep
men like me from doing anything but thinking
about what we’d say if we could.

Published July 8, 2014.The bombing happened in Kandahar province where four Nato soldiers were also killed on Thursday in separate attacks by suspected Taleban fighters.
Earlier this week, UK and Canadian-led Nato forces took control of military operations in southern Afghanistan from US-led coalition troops.
The area has become a stronghold of the Taleban.
Hundreds of people have been killed there in fighting in recent months.
Thursday saw one of the bloodiest days in Kandahar since the end of the war, the BBC's Alastair Leithead in Afghanistan said.
A suicide car bomber detonated his explosives in a crowded market in Panjwayi town, local officials said.
Civilians were deliberately targeted in the attack, which claimed the lives of children, the Afghan interior ministry said.
The blast left a 1.5m-wide (5ft) crater and scorched several shops. Bloodied caps and shoes lay in the road, the Associated Press (AP) news agency reports.
A convoy of Nato troops was moving through the area when the attack took place, but was unaffected, an alliance spokesman said.
"They were close enough to hear the blast," the spokesman, Maj Scott Lundy, told the AP.
Rising Nato death toll at military patrols.
And local officials said 10 Taleban fighters were killed by Afghan and Nato forces in the neighbouring Helmand province, during a raid on a Taleban hideout.
Seven Nato soldiers - three of them British - have now been killed since the alliance assumed control of operations in the south on Monday in the first land deployment outside Europe for Nato forces.
The 8,000 soldiers are under the umbrella of Nato's International Security Assistance Force (Isaf) in six provinces in the south: Day Kundi, Helmand, Kandahar, Nimroz, Uruzgan and Zabul.

Both Norvig and Kemp separately alluded to difficulty in the Google-NASA partnership, which was by Google Chief Eric Schmidt and has yet to produce a so-called Space Act contract that would outline forward-looking joint projects. (Kemp said the Space Act was close to being finalized, but didn't say what projects it might cover.)
Norvig and Kemp said the problems in the relationship surrounded differences in culture--Google's young staff is on the fast track when it comes to product cycles versus NASA's largely older staff that takes a cautious, methodical approach to research and development. (Astronauts going up in the space shuttle surely appreciate the latter.)
"There's a trade-off between moving quickly and being careful," said Norvig, who spent the early part of his career at NASA. "We (at Google) have the needle set in the other direction."
Other problems, Norvig said, deal with intellectual property and legal concerns around joint projects. But ultimately the dot-com culture could teach NASA about adapting better when there's failure, he said.
Insight into how Google and NASA work together could shed light on the government agency's broader strategy to team up with private industry to advance space exploration. NASA has several initiatives in the works, including government awards and a venture capital fund, to foster private industry's development of networking technology, robotics and nanotech for space travel and tourism.
Still, Google's Norvig ended his talk on a high note. He said an exciting thing about the partnership is gaining access to NASA's enormous data sets, including scientific and historical data and aerial imagery. "We're getting that out," he said. Also, Google and NASA enjoy an intellectual exchange that can be helpful to the search giant in, for example, learning about NASA's approach to supercomputing.
"It can be fruitful to talk about architectures and learn from each other," he said.:10 Yes America, the shout-out was for Tracy “J” not for Tracy “T”…That being Tracy Jennings, the No. 1 Connie Hawkins league Fan of all time. And yes…Those jeans sitting in the front caused many a missed shot (sometimes you just have to blame the editor).
:09 While you’re watching the NCAA tournament, don’t forget the greatest shot ever heard around the world came from your own 5th Avenue legend, Dwight “The Ice Man” Clay. His shot with actually 58 seconds left on the clock not at the buzzer as people think, ended UCLA’s 88 game win streak and college basketball dominance.
:08 Speaking of shout-outs, a big one to one of Pittsburgh’s true community icons…“Batman” aka “Bat,” owner and operator of Bat’s Barber Shop on Penn Ave. in the heart of East Liberty. He’s stood the test of time, put up with my boy Terry and his misguided loyalty for the Knicks and played some pretty good basketball back in the day up at Schenley High School on Sunday mornings…Oh yeah, back-in-the-day!! We all miss it.

Shut-up! You’re lying and you know it… Please! Ya don’t even know what VCU stands for!?!?
:06 Speaking of Butler. It’s a little bit easier to take Pitt losing to them now, huh?
:05 Ok, ok, the calls keep coming in for the ones missed on the all-time basketball list (Just wait until football season). Tell you what we’ll do. You think you got a better “Top 10” list of the area’s greatest of all time? Then send it to me. Mail me your “Top 10” greatest City League basketball players of all time and I’ll put your list and your name in the paper if it’s the best one I get. And I’ll send you two free tickets to a Pittsburgh Power football game. Now put your pen where your mouth is, and it’s okay for you Peabody grads (Mike Goosby) if you can’t spell all the names. I’ll make it look pretty for ya. Mail your list to: Champions Enterprises 416, Springdale Dr., Suite 33, Pgh., PA 15235.
:04 Here are the names of some of the area’s great, great players that somehow didn’t make some of the past lists. Go figure! Gene Turner, Darrell Gissendanner, Cory Gadson, Clev Edwards, Stu Lyons, Joe Stallworth, Rob Dixon, Gene Harrell, Mike Wilson, Frank Foster, Ron Hightower, Ronnie MeGrae, Rob Moore, Darrell Porter, Shane Bibbons, Alex Johnson, Jeff Baldwin, Larry Anderson, Billy Searles, Gary Carter, Jeff Burton, Joe Barlow, Kenny Walls, Thomas “June Bug” Howard, Kevin Price Jr., Mel Keys, Malik Hightower, Rick Gannon, Stan Mahan and Jimmy Nichols…and that’s just to name a few. Now you can better appreciate my basketball knowledge and superior genius as I give you those “Top 10” lists. C’mon man…this ain’t easy!!!
:03 “The List”…continued…If you’ve been following along you now have your point guards, 2 guards and small forwards. Here’s the power forwards lists, the Big Boys with multiple skills but for real for real the showstoppers!! 1. Sam “Bam” Clancy 2. “Big John” Marshall 3. Benji Pryor 4. Mel Bennett 5. Mark Hassell 6.

2. Don’t like Miami Heat, just don’t, don’t really know why, just don’t!!! (c’mon Celtics, get this done…then “It’s Laker time.”)

Wilkens WeatherBy Samantha L. QuigleyAmerican Forces Press Service
SCOTT AIR FORCE BASE, Ill., Feb. 20, 2009 The nation’s top military officer expressed concern here yesterday about servicemembers and their families “toughing it out” with frequent deployments and little time together between those deployments.
Navy Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, talked about the stresses of war and a variety of other topics in a town-hall meeting with servicemembers and civilians.
In answer to a question from the audience, Mullen acknowledged that even when troops theoretically have 12 months of “dwell time” between deployments, that’s not really the case when they have to spend part of that time away from their families training for their next deployment.
“The way the families are handling this thing is they’re just toughing it out until they get the relief. There’s a concern about how long they can tough it out,” he said. “We’re going to have to continue to focus on that.”
Suicide rates are increasing in all of the services -- dramatically in the Army -- Mullen said.
“The correlation [between] the stress of these wars and the suicide rate is something that I accept, and then I want somebody to disprove that,” he said in pledging continued efforts to fix the problem. “I’m not going to wait for somebody to disprove that to me.”
Turning to care for the casualties of war, the chairman said the nation owes them and their families a great debt.
“For these [servicemembers] who’ve either paid the ultimate price or been wounded and done what we asked them to do as a country,” he said, “we should figure out what their needs are, … and we should figure out how to take care of them for the rest of their lives.”
Mullen drew on the Israeli model of veteran care as an example of the intent the United States should have when it comes to veteran care.
He noted a past conversation with the Israeli army chief of staff, during which he asked how that country provides continuous care for its wounded. The Israeli chief reached into his wallet and produced a list of a dozen names.
Upon assuming command of a unit, he explained, Israeli commanders must sign for an accountability log that lists the families of the unit’s fallen servicemembers and the unit’s wounded and their families. The commanders take care of and keep in touch with these people, and are inspected on their fulfillment of this obligation as part of their command requirements.
“As the [Israeli] minister of defense says, ‘We write the check off the top at the beginning of the budget cycle to make sure they’re taken care of,’” Mullen said. “I’m not arguing we should do that, but I am saying we ought to have that effect.”
Later, Mullen spoke with reporters about NATO’s efforts in Afghanistan, stressing the need for more help from the alliance’s members, especially in the nonmilitary part of the equation.
“For the entirety of my tour as the chairman, … I’ve worked hard with my partners in NATO to push them to generate more capabilities, not just military capabilities,” he said. “We have financial capabilities, we’ve got development capabilities. I talked about the need for governance. We have … expertise that we need there to assist in training the Afghan people with the respect to proper governments.
“There are a number of ways NATO members can help and we need them to step forward,” he continued. “They have stepped forward to some degree. We need them to step forward more significantly.”
Mullen also discussed yesterday’s vote by Kyrgyzstan’s parliament to close Manas Air Base, an important logistical hub for the war in Afghanistan. While the country’s parliament voted 79-1 not to renew the U.S. lease on the base, there has been no official notification from the Kyrgyz government, Mullen said. But if the base is closed, he added, the United States has options.
“There’s a six-month process once notification is given, should that happen,” Mullen said. “We’ve done a lot of work to create options and look at other ways of doing this, and I’m comfortable that those options will support us very well if we get to that point.”

Furthermore, the Smithsonian Institute painstakingly deconstructed and recreated her kitchen for permanent display [10] [11], Trinifood [12] and Caribbean Pot [13]. We have all made nods and mention of her in one way or another, as has Trini beauty blogger Afrobella [14]. Where institutional praise is non-existent I can only hope that what she inspired in each of us will be enough to keep her name and face around just a little bit longer.

02920 343333Kota Kinabalu: The "shooting spree" that affected 46 business premises over a wide area here and in Penampang, last weekend, has jolted the confidence of the people.
Former Chief Minister Datuk Yong Teck Lee said the people are wondering if there is, indeed, a bigger threat to Sabah's security and the people's safety than what was claimed by the authorities.
Yong said the unconvincing police explanation that the shooting spree was the work "budak nakal" (naughty children) using air guns that shoot "guli" (marbles) only made the people more sceptical about the identity and motive of the shooters. "The sooner the police come up with coherent and clear information, such as the probable motives of the shooters, the easier it would be for the public to comprehend what is happening and for people to spot possible trouble makers and report to the police," said Yong in a statement, Wednesday.
The Sabah Progressive Party (SAPP) President also pointed out that CCTV images of the attacks showed the alleged shooters as young adults, not teenagers.
"It is safe to conclude that the groups of shooters know their way driving around the city and had planned and executed the shootings in an organised fashion in a couple of hours and then disappeared.
"Is there a lapse in information gathering by CID, Special Branch, Rela, Civil Defence, JKKKs, JKDBs and other components of the local security network?" he asked.
He lamented that at the moment, the police are either not forthcoming with information or have no clue as to what is happening right under their noses in the State capital where the police top brass reside.
"It even took the police three days to clarify that the widely-circulated photos of two persons handcuffed sitting on the floor in a police facility as not that of the shooters in the city.
"As though it is not worrying enough that the police have had no fore knowledge of the shooting spree, the police seem at a loss even with the benefit of hindsight and after reviewing evidence gathered," Yong said.
He added it was equally worrisome when the Deputy IGP blamed Sabah's long coastline for the possible smuggling of air guns used in the shooting, indicating that the weapons were brought in from the Philippines.
"This amounts to a glaring admission that Sabah's borders are still not sufficiently secured by Esscom.
If air guns can be smuggled and used in Kota Kinabalu by organised gangs, then it follows that real guns and bullets can be similarly smuggled into Sabah," he said.Do you wish there were a way for you to save several pivot table filters so you can apply them to the same or another pivot chart whenever needed? With Excel 2010’s new slicers feature, you can.
Say you’ve published the following pivot chart to your company dashboard.
Now, say the sales staff for the adult book categories (mystery, romance, and sci-fi) would like to see a similar chart. In Excel 2007, you would have had to create separate category filters for the new chart. And if they want to filter each chart for only 2010, you would need to manually update the year selection in each filter. You probably would end up with 3 additional charts for your dashboard, one showing sales for the adult categories for 2009 and 2010, another showing those same categories for 2010, and a third showing children and young adult category book sales for 2010.
In Excel 2010, there is no need to create new charts. You can connect the chart to slicers that let your users filter the data interactively.
Creating slicers
To create slicers for a chart, using the Annual Sales by Category chart as an example, follow these steps:
Excel 2010 displays a slicer for every selected field, as shown:
(Note that we edited the field titles to read Book Category and Sales Year for the data table’s Category and Year fields, respectively.)
Each slicer contains a button for each value in the selected field. The highlighted buttons reflect the current filters for the chart. In this example, the Book Category field slicer has Children and Young Adult highlighted, while both 2009 and 2010 are highlighted for the Sales Year.
Along with the ability to edit field titles, Excel 2010 provides a number of options for formatting the slicers. Here the formatting options were used to change the slicers’ color, size and alignment to each other. After formatting the slicers, you can copy them and the chart to your dashboard so users can create their own filters.
Using slicers to filter charts
Users can change filters or return to the original filters simply by selecting the appropriate slicer buttons. For example, to see 2010 sales for the other categories, click on the Mystery button in the Book Category slicer and while pressing the Control key, click the Romance and Sci-Fi buttons. Then, click the 2010 button in the Sales Year slicer. These field selections are shown below:
The chart will immediately update, as shown here:
Sharing slicers
Would you like users to be able to apply the same filter to more than one chart without having to manually recreate separate filters for each chart? For example, say you have a second chart on your dashboard such as the one shown here:
You can use the same slicers created for the Annual Sales by Category chart to show 2010 distribution sales for the adult book categories. You do not need to go back and create a separate chart with the new filter; you simply share the slicers you created for the Annual Sales by Category chart with the Sales by Channel chart. Follow these steps:
The Sales by Channel chart will immediately adjust to the filter selections in the shared slicers, as shown here:
You can connect your slicers to any number of Pivot Tables or Pivot Charts. Any changes made to a shared slicer are shown on everything connected to the slicer. For example, if you select 2009 in the Sales Year slicer, both charts will update to show only 2009 sales results.
Slicers help streamline your dashboards so that users can perform their own analysis. This video provides a step-by-step demonstration on how to use slicers to create an interactive dashboard for your organization.Re: Trying to do updates

Recent CommentsKate Gosselin‘s life seems to be completely devoid of friends, right? The last time we can remember her having friends was on Jon and Kate Plus 8, where she was besties with her neighbor, Beth Carson. Beth and her husband, Bob Carson, would help out Kate and Jon Gosselin with their kids every time they got a chance, and Kate and Beth ended up becoming quite close. Beth even made several guest appearances on the reality show, but their friendship quickly fizzled out.
Years later, Beth is now opening up about what caused the end of their relationship. Apparently, Beth actually helped Kate write her first book, Multiple Blessings, but Kate spent the whole time trying to diminish Beth’s role in the novel. She tried to take credit and cut Beth off from what she was owed, and what self-respecting person is going to stand for that?
Beth tells Radar, . I didn’t know that Jon was even on the book until it was published and Kate tried diligently to get my name removed from everything.”
Can you imagine? Beth wrote the book, and yet she finds out that her name is barely associated with it once it releases? In my opinion, she was far too trusting of Kate, but it looks like she learned her lesson. And what’s worse, Beth admits that if it wasn’t for her lawyer, Kate would have managed to take her name off everything and not owed her a single penny. Yikes.
In the end, Beth did get the 50% cut that she was promised, although her role in the novel was vastly reduced in the aftermath. But at that point, she’d just about had enough, and was done with Kate and her thieving antics.
Well, add professional thief to the long line of things that Kate Gosselin is capable of. Not only did she try to take the credit for the book, she did it so blatantly that she ended up alienating her only friend.

Summary:
The car is a real attention/respect getter
Faults:
I've had to put a frame underneath the car. That's was only about 1,800 bucks, but it was something I could live with. Most issues with the vehicle were cosmetic. I had it repainted, shined the interior up by installing a new headlight switches, carpet, and putting a new stereo in the car.
General Comments:
Most people get these vehicles and sink thousands into them, don't do that. Slowly put money into the vehicle otherwise you won't be happy once it's completely done. A lot of owners let them sit, so if you find one with low miles, then get ready to pay for seals and gaskets that have gone bad. It's normally small stuff, but one thing after another goes bad.
Would you buy another car from this manufacturer? Yes

I actually did the book without my bone folder so it's not totally necessary.

Är väldigt sugen på att sätta igång att vika jag med! Blir det snyggast med en tjock bok tro? Är på jakt efter fler instruktioner för hur man kan vika liknande saker, alltså inte vika tranor, hundar eller blommor utan mer abstrakta saker.
Jag ser inget kontroversiellt alls med att använda en bok till detta, det finns ju en hel del böcker som gör sig bättre som ornament än som läsning...

Det finns säkert några tutorials bland Pinterestbilderna men du som är så himlarns pysslig knåpar nog raskt ihop nån fantastikt vikt kreation på känsla:) Vad gäller tjockleken så var min bok perfekt till denna liggade skapelse men om man vill kunna vika boken 360 grader för att göra t ex såna här så behöver man nog en lite tjockare. Min var som en tunn pocket på ca 1 cm men med de där lite gammaldags tjockare arken.

I was going to ask the same question as Quoda, but then I looked at Jennifer's link with instructions and figured it was some kind of decoration. Perhaps you could show a photo of how it looks like on your shelf or where ever you put it?
As for books, if you did this to some rare first edition, I would be cross with you, but these days, there are plenty of printed materials, like magazines or paper backs printed in millions, that end up in recycling anyway, that I don't see any reason why they cannot be repurposed for something else. For starters, I would repurpose all Harlequin novels into SOMETHING USEFUL, BEFORE they even end up in bookstores or in anyone's hands :-).
Posted by: Zosia | March 07, 2013 at 12:10 PM
Next post: how you hang it on the wall! There are very neat examples out there, although I confess I'm not sure how they deal with the different kinds of binding (because it all falls on the binding, doesn't it?).
I'm a librarian and the first time I saw an "intervened book" at a public library (of all places!) I gasped in horror. But truth be told, I'm also quite fed up with the adoration (almost fetish) of the object book regardless of its contents, and this is a good new life for books that are not being read (or there are so many copies that who cares about just another one!)
I'm not being very clear in my thoughts, but I want to make it clear that I love reading, I love books, I love libraries, and I love folded books too.
:-)

They are so cool and different! I love those that hang. Definitely would be a conversation piece.
Posted by: Sandy P. (USA) | March 07, 2013 at 01:02 PM
My belief that people should be allowed to do what they want with their own stuff outweighs my feelings that books are sacred. Not all books are that great anyway. In college, I got stuck reading plenty of books that should have been folded instead of read by human eyes. ;)
I adore paper crafts of all kinds so I'd love to see another photo of this folded book on display. :)

Very cool! I love text for reading and incorporated into art! There are many altered book crafts out there, and this is another one for me to try!
Posted by: Lisa | March 07, 2013 at 04:44 PM
I am a librarian and I think - I KNOW - it is perfectly ok to use an old book or even a brand new one for crafts.
One of the hardest lessons to learn as a librarian is the importance of weeding. There are some books (example: computer manuals from 1995, old science textbooks, really atrocious pulp novels) that just need to go to recycling. And this is repurposing.
Therefore -- TA-DA! *taps you with Librarian Wand* -- I deem this totally allowable!

Never, never, never! I had an ENGLISH LIT teacher who encouraged us to look at books differently and not regard them as precious. She taught classes on interacting with books and altering them way before it was a thing people did. I LOVE YOUR project. I saw one where someone made a sort of filing system out of a book. Too cool!

Posted by: Paula | March 07, 2013 at 10:30 PM
Cool idea! I'm not a big fan of re-reading books, so this could be something cool to do with some of my old paperbacks I have lying around!
Oh, and I'm an English teacher...and I fully endorse destroying books. I think treating them like they're precious jewels takes away a lot of the fun. I like to write in my books, earmark pages, and use old book pages as wrapping paper. They are just paper, after all - the words live on long after they're torn up, worn out, or thrown away. :-)

Indeed, not all ornaments need to be useful but this craft is still useful. One, it keeps you from being bored as it gives you something to do. Two, my kids would also love this because they love paper crafts. And three, I think they would make a good ornament to decorate your shelf with instead of being plain books on a shelf.

What fun! I've seen some amazing window displays at Anthropologie that use this technique. Sorry can't find pictures. . .

I think these folded books are a work of art. I have Lisa Occhipinti's book on my wish list. I hadn't thought about searching on Pinterest for photo's and maybe tutorials. Thank for the links. I also added AMM to my reading list.
Have a nice weekend!

I, too, am a librarian and was going to mention the same thing! In fact, for Christmas, I took law books that I had weeded for recycling and did a paper folding project to turn them into Christmas trees. It was fun and students and faculty loved them. :)

Begin Again too contrived for its story | Movie Review
Through July 7 at Lincoln Square Cinemas. Rated R. 104 minutes.
By Brian Miller
Seattle Weekly
What songwriter hasn’t thought of moving to New York in the hopes of being discovered? What aspiring musician hasn’t at least considered auditioning for The Voice, or fantasized about what it would be like to date Adam Levine and be friends with CeeLo?
As with his 2007 hit Once, writer/director John Carney again presents such an optimistic story, with all its dreamers, losers, opportunists – and original score – this time framed in Manhattan instead of Dublin. Yet unlike Once, with its frumpy clothes, dingy digs, and less-than-perfect looks, Begin Again’s bohemia is too contrived, its songbook too forced, its cast too well-known and practiced.
Keira Knightley is Greta, faithful girlfriend to up-and-coming rocker Dave Kohl (Adam Levine) and an aspiring songwriter herself. (Knightley performs her own songs, which bear some resemblance to Aimee Mann’s.) After Kohl scores a record deal, the pair moves to Manhattan, where he’s quickly seduced by the industry’s trappings. When Greta turns to fellow busker Steve (James Corden), he whisks her out to an open-mike night in the Village, where she’s discovered by down-on-his luck record exec Dan (Mark Ruffalo).
After some late-night beer-fueled banter, Dan and Greta team up to make a record. Rebuffed by Dan’s partner Saul (Mos Def), the pair resolves to go the DIY route – with financial assistance from Dan’s former client TroubleGum (CeeLo Green). Meanwhile we learn of Dan’s difficult separation from his family and Greta’s struggles with Kohl.
Obviously we expect these two to connect, just as in Once. That film worked for me (and many others) because I could buy the central couple played by Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová (both of them real musicians). Begin Again feels more like something purchased in a SoHo boutique. Greta’s supposed thrift-store chic simply reads as Knightley being expensively styled as Annie Hall.
The film becomes too much the glossy, magazine-cover fantasy: Where in the known world would you find CeeLo, Levine, and Mos Def – who comes around in the end – all banking on one unproven songwriter’s raw talent? While Carney is again peddling the notion that a musician with a dream can get discovered, the reality of “making it” in the music biz has everything to do with hard work – not simple luck, as is the case here.

Amazon Cloud Player, Google Music, Slacker Radio, Rdio, and a host of other similar services are set to face serious competition in the United States as Spotify preps for landing. After years of hopes and high expectations, Spotify’s website is now taking email addresses for invitations. Promising “any track, any time, anywhere” and for “free” we’re not totally sure what lies ahead for US fans although we figure it won’t be all that different from other parts of the world. If so, look for $10 per month for Premium access and unlimited streaming across your Android (and other, less cool) devices. As far as the “free” stuff goes, we would expect limited playback hours, advertisements, and lower audio quality.

Gather ideas for making your yard a brilliant display of color and texture using low-maintenance plants and design ideas.

A landscape.
-- Conifers at the back edge of the yard offer year-round color and visual interest.
A congenial grouping of perennials and annuals dresses up a narrow flowerbed.
-- Easy-care doesn't mean boring. In fact, if you reserve your garden efforts for a few extra touches, you can make a distinct impact, such as adding canna or other heat-resistant, summer-flowering bulbs.
-- Annuals are a great way to provide pops of color during the summer without having to worry about prepping the plants for winter. Begonia and lantana.
Take a chill in this peaceful, Asian-inspired garden.
-- Hardscape elements reinforce the style -- and keep down the maintenance -- of a garden. A restrained wooden fence with a minimalist detail at the top emphasizes the Asian influences in this garden.
-- In place of hard-to-please plants, garden ornaments fill in gaps in a landscape, as this graceful statue does.
--.
Vibrant colors belie the ease of care behind the plants in this garden.
-- Ornamental grasses such as Japanese forest grass are steadfast when it comes to low-care gardens. They offer amazing foliage, need little handholding, and withstand harsh weather.
-- A flagstone path -- which requires no care except a good sweep -- flows from one end to the other of the narrow side yard.
-- To create a truly low-maintenance garden, limit plants to those that need little TLC and can take the conditions of the space's microclimate, such as these coral bells.
-- After the first year or two, large deciduous trees, such as this maple, offer structure without demanding garden addition.
A front yard!

Shrubs and trees combine for a striking, expansive bed.

Very few events totally dominate twitter. Eurovision is one of those (well, In Europe at least – the rest of the world must look on in bemusement). Eurovision can contribute beauty to the world – ABBA – and can also spawneth a monster – Celine Dion.
Here is my celebration of my small corner of twitterdom as events unfolded last night.
This was all so big it even surpassed Beckham’s last home football game even complete with his tears.

@Alex_Pearce: eurovision has given me a chance to finish off the update to the #office365 for education starter manual-will be released over the next week
once a year one we are reminded that we can do without the EU. We could have a monthly eurovision song contest to get europe together and stop them fighting each other.
after all the EU is just an extension of the german french idea that having a common iron and steel policy would avoid a further proliferation of blue eyed blonde haired children in paris.

A Response to Auntie
Aunt.
You need to remember something, ALL BUSINESSES EXIST TO MAKE MONEY. If they start losing money, they revamp, initiate layoffs, MOVE...Apparently, demand for their product is down 40%. They pay more than $620,000 in property taxes, which will assuredly go up due to Doyle's slash-and-burn policies..
The deal they offered the union included:
* Buy-out packages of $5,000 to $25,000, based on years of service
* Medical coverage and contributions will be the same as salary plans.
* Pension plan frozen, not eliminated, at current $48 per year of service multiplier.
* Retirement plan becomes defined contribution plan (401K) with Company matching 50 cents for every dollar contributed up to 6 percent on top of benefits already earned.
* Employees retiring in 2009 may elect current retiree medical plan at current contribution rates.
* Employees retiring after Dec. 31, 2009 will be offered an optional retiree medical plan with contributions equal to salary retiree medical plan.
I suspect the union bosses are more concerned about themselves than their members, as most times, THEY don't suffer the hardships the workers do. To quote Brian Dunbar:
"I recall a report I read a few years ago following a similar decision in Tennessee: company said they could not operate, union de facto voted to close the plant rather than concede wages and benefits..
For my part, I'd take a wage cut rather than lose my job. Same for my son, who only makes $14/hr, but keeps getting laid off. He's trying to get a steady job for $12/hr. My dad (worked for Harley) always said he feared the union would strike-or-demand themselves out of jobs. Now we see it happening.?

The Lowest of the Low
Why aren’t advertisers disassociating from this babbling, delusional, bloated bag of flesh?
Extortion & Mercury Marine”.
Malicious Mercury Marine
A Journal Sentinel article quotes the Mercury Marine president, “Quite simply, Mercury is capable of producing many more engines than the market will require in the foreseeable future. Our facilities were designed and built during much different market conditions and are now underutilized.”
This seems to be a problem of management and planning. But, of course, for which, the everyday workers will have to sacrifice.%.”
I’m sure these executives will be taking a pay-cut and agreeing to a wage freeze to show solidarity with their workers – the ones who actually produce the goods that allow the executives to get such ridiculous compensation. The average unionized Mercury Marine worker earns $20 per hour; roughly $41,600 per year. McCoy’s earnings alone are equivalent to the yearly wages of nearly 225 workers.
Pundits, talking-heads, parrots, and a generally business-friendly press all seem to be on board with the idea that a reduced-wage job is better than no job at all. It’s always the responsibility of the lowest on the ladder to feel the pain. Why is there no longer accountability among the executives that are supposed to be running these companies? Why, when profits decrease, or when their stock value decreases are executives still rewarded with increased compensation? While simultaneously laying off workers and rewriting union contracts forcing workers to make concessions.
Alongside this, these same pundits always push for state giveaways to the corporations. Subsidizing workers’ wages or healthcare outright is bad policy. Rather than just directly giving tax breaks, incentives, or subsidies to workers, the circuitous route of trickle-down is preferred. They rationalize that giving away millions to corporations to create/retain jobs is sound policy.

Inflation Exaggeration
A couple of things about this:
Debt as a percentage of GDP is not even close to the post WWII level. Obviously we can sustain higher levels of debt to revitalize the economy without worrying about inflation. Let’s not forget that, historically, the period from the mid 1940s to the early 1970s, which began with huge levels of debt (up to 120 percent of GDP after WWII), also saw the U.S.’s largest growth rate.
Second, most of those saying we need more stimuli also realize the need to rein it in after we have more clear signs that the economy is improving – employment increasing, house prices stabilizing, etc. Those pretending this is some sinister plan of never-ending government spending are only spinning such nonsense so that they can reassert their own false messiah – tax cuts. And, we know who has primarily benefited from the tax cuts of the last 30 years. Plus, inflation tends to hurt lenders more than borrowers. Who are they really protecting in the battle against inflation? [It would be nice if the Fed, in their supposed dual mandate, focused as much on full employment as they do on price stabilization.]
Some are saying house prices have hit bottom and therefore we can disregard any and all stimulative efforts. But this is a simple misreading of seasonal housing data that misrepresents reality. [Although it should be noted the Milwaukee market has shown amazing resiliency in comparison to other areas of the country.]
Be careful of the latest Paul Reveres crusading against inflation. It is more likely the usual distractionary politics masking typically upwardly redistributive policies.

Site Selection Shenanigans
Typically, a business threatens to move its facilities unless a state or locality will provide a subsidy - a bribe. [Think Mercury Marine, which wants a 7-year pay freeze and a 30 percent pay reduction for new hires or says it will move to Oklahoma. This is more a threat to gain concessions from the union, but concessions nonetheless.] They don't do this because they seriously feel the cost of moving to another site is worth it or that another site is more optimal for their business. They demand a subsidy because they can. Threats of leaving caused politicians to provide subsidy packages to these blackmailing businesses. This is (supposedly) economic development.
140 new jobs, it claims, will be created. With a $3.25 million subsidy from the state and $3 million property tax credit from Menomenee Falls, that's roughly $45,000 per job created. This is actually not a bad number (compared to the hundreds of thousands some subsidies have cost per job). And, in the larger scheme of things, a $6.25 million subsidy is chump change. But just because this deal does not have the mind-boggling numbers of some others, that still does not make it right.
Why did normal business operations and expansions become partial monetary responsibilities for taxpayers? It's great that we have successful businesses that have grown over the years and are national leaders in their industries. But, if another site is more optimal, they should move, this would lead to more actual growth for the national economy. Why would we pay millions to retain a comparatively weaker facility? Eventually a competitor in a more optimal location will outperform and put the weaker company out of business. If a company feels they need to grow and increase production, it should not be the state's responsibility to fund this. One would think that this would be a sound management decision based on sound business principles.
Unless we're deciding on a quasi-industrial policy whereby taxpayers support local business retention and expansion. But if that's the case, there needs to be a public discussion between politicians, business leaders, and taxpayers. It has to be connected with comparative advantage, sectoral areas where we feel we can compete and grow, and within a comprehensive planning strategy for the state and the region.
These backroom deals, giving away millions to successful companies, need to be brought out into the light of day.

Contemptible Congressman.
The Right-Wing Health Care Harangue
The veiled logic begins with the statement, "many more people will have their health coverage funded, subsidized or legally specified by the federal government. This means their health is no longer their concern but ours. When anything is paid for publicly, it is decided politically. Health care will be no different."
Shouldn't the health of our fellow citizens already be a concern? Shouldn't the government play a major role in the health of the nation? Just as it does with housing, transportation, finance, and well, everything! Why should health care be untouchable? We have a private-run system now. It costs twice as much as any other country and we have 50 million without coverage. So, obviously the private sector does not know how to run health care.
And, public action being decided politically - that's called democracy. Obama won. His side (the majority of America ) wants health care reform. Those already served under a government-run public option - Medicare - are very happy with their health care.
Patrick has a rant in the article on abortion. All I'll remind Pat here is this - abortion is a legal medical procedure. Stop trotting out the wedge issue(s) that divide everyone and speak to the issues where we can reach compromise.
He claims the President is dodging certain specifics, mockingly saying, "This man ran on change." Just as McIlheran is speculating about the health care proposals he obviously has not viewed, yet he still feels qualified/obliged to fantasize about what they mean and what the results will be.
Being the good right-wing soldier he is, Pat had to mention "rationing.".
Does any thinking individual feel that using science to determine what procedures are the most cost-effective for health outcomes is a bad thing? Government curbing overly expensive yet no more effective procedures is good management. Are Republicans saying we should spend just for the sake of spending? Aren't they the ones always preaching about not throwing money at things?
There also seems to be a bit of the, "We're Americans, we're the best, there can be no restrictions on anything we do." It's a very infantile urge to be tapping into. But the right loves latching onto the lowest-common-denominator and playing on peoples' emotions.
Pat then brings up the Congressional Budget Office review (which some have found problematic) that finds the proposals will not slow health care cost increases. As long as we don't control pharmaceutical costs and re-imagine our health care system more holistically with more preventative care, active lifestyles and in accordance with healthier, locally grown foods, I agree, costs will continue to rise.
This is also a standard-of-living issue. Health care is a right in a civilized society. The American standard-of-living has been falling. Yet, I haven't heard the Republicans outraged by this. Income inequality has been skyrocketing over the last 30 years. Where are the Republican voices on this issue? Suddenly they're concerned with our rights, our health, how we live, our choices? Yet they've been silent as jobs have been outsourced, more and more went without insurance, more and more were thrown into crippling debt over medical bills, wages have stagnated, and citizens have found it harder and harder to make ends meet. But now we should trust them? They've got our best interests at heart.
To allow the system to continue to be run by private entities, whose interest is profit and not health, can only lead to worse and worse outcomes. As Albert Einstein said, "Doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results is insanity."

Same Old Song
Death Panel Deception
There is nothing in the health care proposals about a death panel or putting anyone to death. This is just a flat-out lie being parroted by conservatives.
So why are we listening to and giving airtime to right-wingers who continually just lie to the American people? George Stephanapoulos questioned Newt Gingrich on his dishonesty and pointed out there was nothing about a death panel or "communal standards" in any health care proposal. George should have thrown Newt out of the studio and barred him from ever coming back.
If you can't form a logical argument, grounded in reality, and based on facts, shut the f#*@ up! You're adding nothing to the discussion and you're diminishing our democracy. And the media should stop allowing these cranks on as if there were two sides to every issue.
Stephen Colbert offers his thoughts.
Cronies of Rich Guys (CRG)
Chris Kliesmet is the executive administrator of CRG Network. He found the Public Policy Forum report (the data discussed in the article) showed "another sign of how onerous property taxes in Wisconsin have become." He feels, "local officials should be holding the line on spending and cutting taxes."
Does any of this sound familiar? Is this unbiased analysis? Or just conjecture? Is this opinion even necessary for the article? Does this simply interject conservative talking points for no apparent reason?
I guess the irony of a "watchdog" group complaining about taxes even though [because of the status of his group, "CRG Network Foundation, Inc. was formed as a 501(c)(3), non-profit, tax-exempt corporation"] their organization doesn't pay any taxes went over their heads.
Here are some excerpts taken directly from their website regarding their mission:
- It's mission is to help citizens elect fiscally conservative candidates, assert property rights, and remove corrupt and/or fiscally irresponsible politicians from office
- To lobby and advocate for fiscally conservative and property rights legislation on a local and statewide basis
- Motivate fiscal conservatives to vote in increasingly larger numbers
- Organize fiscal conservatives into the most influential political force in Wisconsin
- Encourage fiscal conservatives to contribute the human and financial resources needed to grow and be successful
- ...unions and other special interest groups
- ...tax-spending special interests and regulatory bureaucrats
CRG was one of the initial agitators calling for the recall of Tom Ament. Scott Walker has only worsened the County budget. How about recalling him? Come on, CRG, where's your consistency? Walker has only dug a deeper budget hole. According to your logic, he must go. I'll gladly sign that recall petition.
CRG is nothing more than one of "starve the beast" organizations of the right. It's not about what's best for citizens. It's about their ideology being in control of government to steer largesse to their cronies rather than to workers and infrastructure. Seems more like a "watchdog" group for the rich.
In a recent post, I had shown government wasn't all that bad. And, as Paul Krugman wrote in a recent column, if it wasn't for government intervention in the economic catastrophe we're in, we'd be in a Depression. (And if conservative ideology hadn't invaded government policy and torn down the regulatory structures enacted after the Great Depression, we wouldn't be facing such an excruciating financial collapse, either.)
But, alas, the liberal and government bashing will continue. Why? Because it's easy, and because the right-wing conservatives have nothing concrete, substantive, or worthwhile to offer. Although, they'll form a PAC, call themselves "watchdogs", and get quoted in the local paper as credible public policy analysts.

Economic Reform
The Government, The Government...
He repeatedly begins his disparaging remarks with, "The government...". In Gingrich's worldview the government can't do anything right.
Yet, government seems to perform well regarding the military, Medicare, Social Security, our legal system, police and fire protection, the postal service, highways, water systems, electrical grids, among a host of other activities.
Jeff Faux's chapter What Kind of America Do We Want? came to mind while thinking about all this government bashing. In which he highlights the many accomplishments of government, the many failures of the private sector, and the obstructionist tactics of the Republican party.
America seems to be under the illusion that the private sector is an altruistic, benevolent entity steering everyone and everything towards perfection. Although, empirical data seem to indicate just the opposite. [See The Raw Deal, Tax Cut Snake Oil, The Squandering of America, The U.S. Since 1980, and Unequal Democracy]
Yet, all the institutions, infrastructure, and backbone that allow our modern existence are directly because of government involvement.

Getting rid of these unnecessary subsidies would be one of the quickest and easiest ways to clean up tax law, and get revenue into the public coffers. Allowances are understandable when services are being provided for the sick, poor, or elderly - those who can not afford it or are physically unable to provide for themselves. But the massive conglomerates and operations some religious organizations run and/or are involved with, which get tax exemptions, are market distortions favoring one group (churches) against others involved in provision of the same service.

Their childlike behavior and complete lack of knowledge has only lowered the level of debate. And their behavior at town hall events is appalling and disturbing. For the media to be giving these charlatans a stage is equally atrocious.

There are a couple of absolute must-read editorials in the the Nashua Telegraph and Concord Monitor this morning. Both papers are joining the chorus demanding that Mitt Romney release his tax returns.
The Telegraph says the Romney tax returns are a non-partisan issue, that this is information the public simply deserves to have in order to evaluate Romney as a presidential candidate:
It’s not a matter of whether the president’s political operatives have a right to scour the financial documents; it’s that the American people have a right to know the financial background of those who aspire to hold the highest office in the land.
The Concord Monitor not only suggests that Romney is hiding something, they actually put forward a theory as to what that something might be:
Could it be that despite a fortune estimated at some $250 million and an annual income of more than $20 million, Romney paid little or no taxes in some years? Some tax experts think that's a possibility. So do we.
This whole question underscores the central choice voters have to make in this election. Which economic vision is best for the country?
President Obama believes that everyone, even the wealthiest Americans, must pay their fair share to create an economy that's built to last. Romney, on the other hand, is so heavily invested in the bad ideas that damaged our economy that New Hampshire papers are openly wondering whether he's paid in any share at all.
In other words, when it comes the economy, Romney's not the solution–he's the problem.
If you agree that Romney should release his tax returns, add your name to the list of Granite Staters who think Romney needs to come clean and show them to us.
New Hampshire deserves to know what Romney's hiding.6th February, (24th January O.S.):

Every. …While I did say I did not plan on doing a lot of challenges this year, I did WANT to participate in as many of the ABS challenges as possible. (Wow! That sentence will definitely trip a grammar teacher! So many "did"s! Let's try reconstructing)
While I was not planning to join a lot of challenges this year, I did WANT to participate in as many of the ABS ones as possible. (Much better!)
Actually, a stretch goal is to be a featured designer there!
I was looking forward to seeing the inspiration artwork for January, and was thrilled to see this:

Do click on the photo to read more about the art.
Oh no no, I don't really know the artist, am not in love with peacocks or anything like that. It was all for a very selfish reason. You see, I had this really pretty focal pendant that I got from my partner in the 6th Bead Soup Blog Party, Miss Kathy Combs.
Next...what do I DO with it? Its an asymmetric pendant, and enameled, so I knew I could not punch in more holes if I wanted to make a bracelet (which I did not, I am scared of making them, remember?). So it had to be a necklace. On to how do I string it. I have some gorgeous Marsha Neal silk cord in co-ordinating colors that I considered, but I was feeling like playing with wire.
I have this gorgeous brown colored wire in my stash, which went very well with the focal. I used the wirework to depict the flow and the shape of the ferns. I used faceted czech glass beads in slowly graduating colors, from the brown of the earth to the yellow-gold of the persimmons.
Finally, the delicate brown chain is for the thin bare branches of the persimmon tree.
So now that we have the description and the design process out of the way, here is the necklace itself :-)
I did learn a lot while doing the wirework...mostly that I should measure the wire pieces exactly if I have to make a replica!
I was worried that the symmetrical stringing would not look good with the asymmetric focal, but it looks quite nice :) I do like it a lot!
The necklace is listed in my etsy store :)
Now that I am done with the January challenge, I am getting impatient and want to see the February artwork right away!
What a beautiful piece! I'm glad you figured out a design because that focal is gorgeous! You made it look so easy.
I made an unofficial goal to do as many ABS and Vintaj challenges as I could, and yet I keep forgetting to do even the first one!!! I need some sort of reminder......
Thank you, Alice!
What I do to remember the ABS challenge is keep the blog post announcing the challenge as "unread" in my google reader. That serves as a constant reminder until I do something about it :)
Where are the Vintaj challenges posted? I don't use it much, but would like to check it out!
What a pretty piece! I love how organic the feel is!!
Thank you! I emailed you with a couple questions :P
Great job,! The necklace looks beautiful .
Thank you, Kathy!
Absolutely beautiful, Kashmira! I love the colors you chose, complementing the pendant. And the wirework is great! Wire is a great addition to any design! ;-)

Sure is :) Hope you liked the necklace too ;)
It's really beautiful. I love the wire work you added at the front of the necklace. It's so elegant-looking! Fab-u-lous!!
Thank you! I was not sure about this design at all, but it looks really nice when worn :-) I hope it finds a new home soon. I hate that its just sitting in its little baggie waiting to be picked.
Kashmira, this is delightful! I wish I could buy everything you make! This is just such a winner! --Sharyl
Very fun and love the colors.Documenting The Sound Of Berlin
The sound of Berlin's S-Bahn is unmistakable; many Berliners hear it every day.
So Londoner, Peter Cusack, who is currently taking part in the Berlin Artists in Residence Program DAAD, decided to record it. Cusack, who is a sound artist and musician, has been exploring his favorite sounds of major cities, such as Chicago, Beijing, Prague, and London, since 1998.
He says, Berlin is, for sure, quieter than London.
"I found that at first rather boring, but as I got used to it, I discovered how to listen to Berlin, and then I found it a pretty interesting place. There are different sounds because it is quieter."
Cusack has recorded kites flying at the former Tempelhof Airport, as well as peoples' conversation, footsteps, and children playing.
"Obviously London has these, but they tend to be covered up more with traffic noise or aircraft noise in London. In Berlin, your hear them much more clearly," Cusack says.
The 64 year-old asks as many people as possible about their favorite sounds. For Cusack, the important task in recording is finding out why a sound is special to someone. He says, in describing sounds, there is a big difference between perceptions in the East and the West.
"In Beijing, one person's favorite sound was the sound of children playing, which is nothing unusual, but the reason she gave- she thought that Beijing, as a city, had gone back to childhood again. So, she is quite afraid for Beijing with this huge change, and she said it needed looking after like you need to look after children. I can't imagine any British people coming up with anything like that."
In Berlin, most of the time Cusack is on his bike, trying to find and listen to interesting sounds. On one of his tours, he discovered an intimate spot at the Spree close to Schlossplatz in Mitte where the waves make lapping noises against the side of the river.
Nature is one of Cusack's main interests. Since 2001, he's been working on an ongoing project, "Sounds From Dangerous Places," which brought him to Chernobyl.
He wanted to investigate how the sound scape has changed years after the nuclear disaster.
"If you would learn anything slightly different about these big problems by listening as compared with looking, or reading the text, or looking at scientific data. For example, in Chernobyl, in the exclusion zone, the people may be gone, or mostly gone, but the wild life is doing incredibly well, so I made recordings there of dawn choruses, evening choruses, ponds of frogs, which are incredibly full of life."
When asked if he ever erases sounds, he says he sometimes immediately deletes recordings.
"But if I keep it more than one day, then I keep it for 30 years."
Peter Cusack's project, "Berlin's Favorite Sounds," will be playing at Schlossplatz until the 26th of May.
9(MDAzMzQ2MjAyMDEyMzk4MTU1MDg3ZmM3MQ010))"The Nutcracker" has been enchanting audiences and filling the coffers of ballet companies for more than a century, and there's every reason to believe the tradition will endure.
This week alone in Cleveland, two professional productions will vie for attention: the Royal Winnipeg Ballet's Canadian-spiced version (five performances at PlayhouseSquare starting Thursday) and Moscow Ballet's "Great Russian Nutcracker" (Friday at the Cleveland Masonic and Performing Arts Center).
The Winnipeg production, which the company performed two years ago at the Allen Theatre, plants most of its feet near the original 1892 St. Petersburg version by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov, though filtered through recent choreography by Galina Yordanova and Nina Menon, updated slightly and set in a country hooked on a certain sport.
"We have a hockey game at the very top of the show," said Andre Lewis, the Winnipeg company's artistic director. "In Florida, that wouldn't happen. In Minneapolis and Cleveland, it certainly would. I hear you get a fair amount of snow."
More Canadian references? Some of the children in the Act 1 battle scene are dressed as Mounties.

Mostly, the Winnipeg "Nutcracker" retains the familiar scenario and Tchaikovsky's indelible score, performed in Cleveland by an orchestra of local musicians.
"It's been an incredible gift of Petipa and Tchaikovsky and Ivanov," Lewis said. "It's been a very good thing for us to have that. The opera world doesn't have that. The symphonic world doesn't have that. Only ballet has that Christmas tradition. It's wonderful, because you have a chance to celebrate Christmas with your family."
"Nutcracker" is considered wonderful for other reasons. It keeps dancers employed and helps the bottom lines of ballet companies. The Royal Winnipeg, Canada's oldest ballet company, gives 20 performances of "Nutcracker" each year at home and on tour.
Because the city where it resides has a population of only 600,000, the Royal Winnipeg relies on touring to provide the funds it needs to survive. The company takes to the road 20 of the 42 weeks the 26 dancers are employed. The tours take them throughout North America, Europe and elsewhere. Last year, the company appeared in Israel.
Many of the works the Royal Winnipeg performs at home and abroad are story ballets, though not restricted to such traditional brand names as "Nutcracker," "Giselle," "The Sleeping Beauty" and "Swan Lake." Along with occasional repertory programs, the company dances such full-length pieces as Mark Godden's "Svengali," Jorden Morris' "Moulin Rouge -- The Ballet" and Shawn Hounsell's "Wonderland."
"You need those kinds of popular works," Lewis said. "You can't just hope people will come because it's beautiful. That's not enough, sadly.
"I would not be opposed to doing more compilations, where it's not about story but about the power of what dance can be. But unfortunately, that doesn't quite cut it."
The company's next story ballet will be Twyla Tharp's "The Princess and the Goblin," based on the children's story by Scottish writer George Macdonald and set to music by Schubert. The coming-of-age work, a co-production with Atlanta Ballet, will receive its premiere in Atlanta in February and in Winnipeg in the fall.
Although Lewis has been guiding the Royal Winnipeg Ballet since 1995, his relationship with the company goes back to 1975, when he entered its school. He joined the company in 1979, when he first alternated in the roles of Romeo and Mercutio in a Rudi van Dantzig production of "Romeo and Juliet."
Unlike some dancers, Lewis devoted his entire performing career to the Royal Winnipeg.
"It depends on your circumstances and your personality and what you like to do," he said of the paths performers take. "I know some dancers who, after every three years, have to get to another company.
"Sometimes you have to say to dancers -- and it's not pleasant -- 'You have to move on. You've had a great career, but your physical ability is declining and you're at risk of hurting yourself.' "
The challenges of running a ballet company don't prevent Lewis from stating that he's "living his dream." He heads an organization with an $8 million budget, a quarter of which comes from government sources.
Still, economic pressures in recent years have compelled the Royal Winnipeg to take fewer risks and tighten its belt -- without reducing the number of dancers.
"I would hate to have to do that," Lewis said.Bluegrass Musical Celebration: To Celebrate the Life of Gene Bretecher

Nominated for the Okanagan Music Awards three times and winners of the OMA 2006 Bluegrass Band of the Year, and the BC Bluegrass Association 2005 Band of the year, they have played to sellout crowds at almost every concert. In 2009 they where voted amongst the top three bands in the Central Okanagan by Okanagan Life Magazine.
Together since 2004, the boys boast nearly 200 years of musical experience amongst them. Converging here in Kelowna, the band members hail from all over Canada. Dominic Cormier on banjo comes from New Brunswick and Ron Hillcoff on bass from Winnipeg, Manitoba. Vic Ukrainetz on fiddle started out in Saskatchewan, Bob Bissillion and Darrell Corbel hail from Alberta while Jack Kinakin is a Kelowna, BC boy, born and bred.
One of their goals has been to increase the exposure of bluegrass music to new people. Building on the recent rise in bluegrass music popularity in the past decade brought on in part by the movie “Oh Brother Where Art Thou”, they have drawn new audiences to the bluegrass scene through sold out performances at Bunches Bistro, the Creekside Theater in Lake Country, The Mary Irwin Theater in Kelowna, the Centre Stage Theatre in Summerland and the Kelowna Community Theatre.
Here are some of the comments made by the concert attendees. Click here.
Through the sale of their CD’s, fund raising performances, and individual donations, the band has raised over $50,000 to support a variety of community projects. These include over $32,000 to support Cancer Care and $14,000 for a new daycare center to open soon at Trinity Baptist Church in Kelowna.Mystic Politics mission is to instigate debate on politics, religion, and science towards a more informed society.

You don’t have to be reading a book to come in, sit down, and chat with us.
The main answer for me about why I try new authors is that someone at Bookflurries or another group of friends mentioned them to me. I checked them out, tried some of the books and either became enthusiastic or dropped them. Most often, I read a bunch of what the author had written trying to read them in order. I have been enriched by trying new authors though I still enjoy old favorites.
When I could go to book stores, I would look at the shelves of books recommended by the workers and in the library, I would look at the new arrival shelves and the books that were displayed standing up to catch my attention. I would also check the sale table at the book store or the books for sale at the library.
I used to get a catalog about general fiction books and I still get a catalog about science fiction and fantasy stories where I have found new authors to try.
As others have said, it is good to pick up a book and read a little of it, first. Barnes & Noble on-line has a feature where you can read a bit of the book by clicking on it. Sadly, I have forgotten to do that a few times and I was sorry.
Sometimes, I read reviews. Sometimes a cover grabs me. Sometimes a book is mentioned in another book. Sometimes as I look for one book at B&N several other books of the same time or subject are mentioned and I get hooked.
As I said last week, I sometimes read a book that I learned about from a good movie. For example, I watched Behind the Lines about Dr. Rivers and Siegfried Sassoon and decided I wanted to read the book Regeneration by Pat Barker as a result. The other night I re-watched the film and I understood it better the second time from having read the book. It is a very powerful film.
Many people here have used lists from Goodreads.
While I am waiting for a favorite author to write a new book, I get bored and that is when I need a new author. It is especially nice if the books of a trilogy have already been published so I can read them all at once without waiting. It is nice when I love a new author to find there are other books in the series of mysteries.
Sometimes, I don’t like the first book that I try, but I go on and I find the second one is better. Then, I am glad I tried more.
I have been enjoying new settings in different countries, too.
How about you? If you see a book in the library that looks good, will you give it a try?
Are you willing to try a different genre than you are used to reading if people have been praising the author?

It is OK to argue with my choices for the categories because I know that some people really liked the books that I didn’t or they can’t stand the books I like. I am just trying to get a discussion going.
I am grateful for the recs that led me to the new authors that were winners for me. Thank you!
Are there some new authors for me to devour?
It is OK to talk about any book. The author may be new to me even if it is an older classic.

London - Newcastle United striker Demba Ba struck in the last minute to salvage a 2-2 draw with Everton in a pulsating Premier League match at Goodison Park on Monday.
Everton looked to have sealed all three points when Victor Anichebe turned neatly to crack a low shot past Tim Howard with two minutes left, but Ba's clever finish earned a point for Newcastle.
Everton dominated the first half and led thanks to a fine goal by England left back Leighton Baines before Newcastle equalised just after the interval through halftime substitute Ba.
Everton climbed to seventh in the standings on seven points from four games with Newcastle two points back in 11th.
Everton went ahead in the 15th minute when Baines combined brilliantly with Steven Pienaar before drilling a firm left-foot cross shot past goalkeeper Steve Harper.
Baines cleared a rare Newcastle effort on goal off his own line and the home side ended the first half in complete control.
Newcastle manager Alan Pardew responded by sending on Ba and the move paid immediate dividends when the striker ran on to a beautifully weighted pass from Yohan Cabaye and struck a firm angled left-shoot shot past Tim Howard.
Pienaar was again the creative spark as Everton almost took the lead again but Marouane Fellaini was adjudged narrowly offside after clipping in the South African midfielder's clever pass.
Everton were also denied a second goal after 78 minutes when Anichebe's close-range header was tipped on to the underside of the crossbar by Harper and appeared to bounce down over the line before being cleared.
Anichebe then controlled Pienaar's pass and lashed a fierce shot into the corner of the net before Ba prodded Shola Ameobi's flick-on past Howard to earn the visitors a draw.
Chelsea lead the Premier League standings after four matches with 10 points following their 0-0 draw at Queen's Park Rangers on Saturday.
Manchester United climbed to second with a 4-0 rout of Wigan Athletic and Arsenal are third after thrashing Southampton 6-1.
Champions Manchester City are fourth following a 1-1 draw at Stoke’15’ Peer Reviewed Studies Confirm Arctic Was Warmer During Medieval Period

Charlotte Ronson, Donna Karan, and Elie Tahari Spring 2012, photos: IMAXtree
The look hasn’t been seen prominently since the 90s, but with the return of that decade’s crop tops, palazzo pants, and maxi skirts, it makes sense that the statement necklace would make a comeback as well. At Charlotte Ronson, the low neckline on a crop-top was balanced by a buckled belt-like choker. The choker’s orange and tan colors were a striking contrast to the cobalt blue. Donna Karan incorporated both the tribal trend and choker trend with a collar that featured layers of cascading spikes. Elie Tahari channeled the elegance of Grecian goddesses with a thin gold choker and draped whites.

Tyra Banks isn’t afraid to try a trend. She went bold on Good Morning America this week, accessorizing a basic charcoal grey jersey dress with an athletic-inspired neon green choker. We know Banks is excited about the trend, because she already tried to bring back the look last year at the Kid’s Choice Awards with a gold choker. The key to Banks’ Good Morning America look? The rest of her outfit was neutral, but her yellow manicure balanced the brightness of the choker. Anna Wintour also anticipated the choker trend (natch) with the signature antique multi-strand Georgian gem collar she wears whenever she gets a chance. (Some forum users have wondered whether she’s required by contract to wear it every day.) The multi-strand necklace hangs a bit lower than a singe-strand choker, so it's a less daring way to try the trend. Wintour paired her choker with a floral velvet gown at the Moet & Chandon gala event. At the U.S. Open Men’s Finals, hot mama-to-be Beyonce dressed up a t-shirt with a sparkling choker.

Chokers make a statement on the red carpet, too. At the Emmy’s, Vampire Diaries' Nina Dobrev perfectly accessorized her stunning red gown with a simple and elegant Neil Lane diamond choker that drew attention to her décolletage. She demonstrates that ears should be left bare with a choker, allowing it to shine. At boyfriend Kevin Hart’s premiere of Laugh at My Pain, Eniko Parrish wore a twisted silver choker with her ruched grey dress. Elizabeth McGovern looked lovely at the Entertainment Weekly and Women in Film pre-Emmy party. The Downton Abbey actress’ barely-there diamond choker added a subtle spark.Please note: This entire posting is simple conjecture and I have no real inside baseball information at all. I simply am wondering aloud about what is really going on. I have no proof at all; but, I do have plenty of suspicions.
—
I ask this question because of the following events that have taken place:
First of all, Aaron Walker lost his lawsuit against Brett Kimberlin. The good news is, that is he appealing the ruling and hopefully he will win it. Which makes me wonder, was the judge ordered to dismiss the lawsuit, because of an ongoing FBI sting, as Kimberlin being an informant?
Second of all this story here, involving a man and woman from Texas; which has more twists and turns than a Georgia back road. You really have to follow that story, least you get more confused than a pollack Jew in a Hindu temple. (Apologies in advance to my Jewish readers; but it really, really is that confusing! I am about as sharp of a tack as they come in these parts — and it even confuses me!— Some might disagree with that sharp tack bit, but I do not pay them dummies no attention. 😀 ) What really made me wonder about this, is this little comment here, by a commenter named “jwallin” over at Robert Stacy McCain’s blog, who by the way reappeared this morning after going AWOL yesterday and giving everyone a heart attack! Anyhow, here’s the comment:
I’m beginning to wonder if Neal AND Brett are both FBI informants acting as agent provocateurs.
And that doesn’t get them off the hook or anything but it does give an insight to why they believe they can make false accusations, go ballistic over the least little thing, make all kinds of false accusations and lie in court and expect to get away with it. (because they have so far.)
The FBI is not above using people and placing operators (not actual agents per se) in positions to supply the means and even the motive for others to commit unlawful acts. (see the poor sap that tried to blow up the NY Federal Reserve Bank in Oct.)
They also use guys like that as spreaders of disinformation and gatherers of information. They particularly like to use those who have criminal, prison/shady pasts as they can be pressured into cooperation and have the bonafides to appear to be what they may be pretending to be. (that’s if anyone bothers to check)
They also use them to spread dissension amongst collaborators and other informal and clandestine communities.
Sound like Rauhauser? Sound like Kimberlin?
Not saying they’re active, just saying they may have been used and may be used again. And it does fit some of the odd things and perceptions they both have of how little they concern themselves with being arrested or investigated.
Things that make you go Hmmmmm.
I was over here lying in the bed, waiting for the soup that Mom was making for supper, when I read this. This is when it hit me; “what if they are doing that?” It would not shock me one iota. The Conservative blogosphere, the Tea Party, the Republicans on the hill — all have been a huge thorn in the side of the President. Who is to say that the President did not order an big time, super secret investigation and take down of the right wing blogosphere?
Again, I do not have any inside baseball information on this at all. I simply am, as the southern folk would call it, “A wonderin'” about this all. I mean, the Government has done dishonest stuff like this before. Remember Ruby Ridge? Remember the Waco Stand Off? Remember Elohim City? Remember Oklahoma City? The United States Government has not always been forthright in their dealings and with the actions of the FBI. Like this man here, who is one of the people, that I listed in the title of this blog posting; who is an informant, I believe — like he says: I am an independent journalist, and I am seeking answers. I happen to believe that theory about these three men. However, I would like dig for the real truth as to what is really going on here. I simply do not buy the story that is being floated about these three people. Something more is going on and I want to get to the bottom of it.
If anyone that reads this, who happens to work for the FBI, and happens to know the truth. Please, do not hesitate to email me and tell me the truth. I will protect your identity and I will publish what you tell me to publish.
There are facts in this story, that the public needs to know about and that the corporate owned and controlled media will not cover, unless they are forced to. We bloggers in the uncontrolled, independent media world are the ones who have been digging these stories up and fleshing them out. We need to get back to doing that and stop with the bickering among ourselves. This is what our political enemies want, they want us to bicker among one another; so that we become less effective. We have to overcome that; and get to the bottom of what is really going on.
We have a Republic to save, we have liberty to protect, and we have a out of control Government that needs to be restrained. We must do our part.

Tange & Zula Press Release
Zula
Tange
Born: 1973
Birthplace: Africa
Birth status: wild born
Orphaned in a cull
Life before the Sanctuary: Chehaw Wild Animal Park in Albany, Georgia since 1978
Reason for coming to the Sanctuary: Chehaw’s Zoo Director felt that the facilities were no longer adequate for the elephants
Moved to The Elephant Sanctuary ~ February 19, 2004
Height: 8' 3"
Favorite Food: Watermelon
Tange
was orphaned in South Africa as an infant when her family
was culled. She was sent to a zoo in Georgia where she lived for
nearly thirty years with one other elephant. Tange is submissive
to both Zula and Flora.
She
is recognized by her large eyes and good natured interactions
with other elephants. She has short thick ivory, a long tail and
the longest body of all three African elephants.
It is unclear if Tange and Zula are related but what is known is that they were both orphaned as result of a culling (mass killing) of all the adults and sub-adults in their family [herd]. Once orphaned they were captured and brought to the United States along with a third, unidentified orphaned calf, by animal broker Jurgen Schulz.
Tange and Zula arrived at the Chehaw Wild Animal Park in Albany Georgia June 1, 1978; they had been purchased for $25,000. The Exchange Club of Albany donated $12,500 and challenged the public to match their donation by raising the remainder of the funds through community based fundraising.
In a two-fold effort to rally the community and later to repay the efforts of local businesses that helped reach the fundraising goal, Tange and Zula were taken to many promotional events. McDonalds was a popular spot to catch a glimpse of the baby elephants. It is said that people ate a lot of Big Macs that year in support of the fund drive.
Over the next five years Tange and Zula continued to make appearances at community events. The owner of a local moving company transported the elephants in his furniture van. On several occasions Tange and Zula were the main attraction at private parties hosted by friends of Jim Fowler, founder of the park.
Upon their arrival, Tange and Zula were housed with the zoo’s sole elephant Dottie, aka Champagne, a female Asian elephant that that the park had acquired one month earlier. Dottie was born wild in India in 1964. She was purchased by the Chateau Theatrical Animals for the New York World's Fair in 1965. In 1969 she was sent to the Beardsley Zoological Gardens in Bridgeport, Connecticut. In 1977, after killing someone at the Beardsley zoo, she was purchased by Jurgen Schulz and sold to the Chehaw Wild Animal Park in May of 1978. Tange, Zula and Dottie shared living quarters at Chehaw Wild Animal Park until Dottie was sold in 1985 to circus elephant trainer and presenter “Buckles” Woodcock. Five years later Dottie died at the relatively young age of 26.
Tange and Zula have spent their entire lives entertaining thousands of zoo patrons that visit the park annually. In the beginning they were even taken off grounds to do promotional events and private parties but that activity was discontinued when Tange became a “runner”.
When brute force is used with African elephants many respond by running, such was the case with Tange. African elephants have a reputation for being flighty and less intelligent than their Asian cousins. Although many are quick to flee from a situation which frightens or frustrates them, there is no scientific documentation which would suggest that one species is smarter than the other.
Their behavior however varies significantly. The heavy handed dominance that was prevalent in elephant management in the 1970’s lead to the creation of many “runners”. African elephants tend to be less tolerant of brute force than their Asian cousins. As results, trainers who had spent a lifetime developing their training craft with Asian elephants found African elephants to be “stupid”. Probably what is closer to the truth is that trainers with expertise training Asian elephants were set in their ways. The African elephant posed a new set of challenges which required a different approach.
In 1988, a new entry level keeper was hired to help care for the elephants. She had no experience managing exotic animals, which was common place in zoos across the country at that time. History would prove that what Kathi Murray lacked in experience she made up for in compassion and the determination to improve the welfare of her new charges. Staffing was inconsistent, leaving Kathi and her equally novice co-workers to figure things out for themselves.
In 1991, Kathi met Carol Buckley at an American Zoological Association management school. Carol quickly became Kathi’s mentor. For the next thirteen years Carol worked closely with Kathi, consulting on Chehaw’s elephant program. Kathi continued to expand her knowledge of elephants and their care. After years of hard work and self-education, Kathi and her fellow elephant keepers had developed a three-keeper team with training protocol for keepers as well as elephants. The protocols were based on team work and positive training methods. One of the many benefits resulting from Kathi and her college’s dedication was that Tange was no longer a “runner”.
In July of 1994, the 500-year flood swept through the City of Albany. Chehaw Wild Animal Park was literally under water. By the time Kathi reached Tange and Zula who were chained in their barn, they were belly deep in flood waters. Their vocalizations and body language clearly demonstrated that they were as happy to see Kathi as she was to see them. Throughout the ordeal the elephants placed their trust in Kathi completely. She credited their faith in her to the relationship they had forged; a relationship where Kathi placed their needs first and foremost.
Over the following years Chehaw experienced a turn over in zoo management and keeper staff. Luckily for the elephants Kathi remained a constant figure in their lives. The most recent change in leadership took place in 2002 and came in the form of a progressive thinker determined to better the zoo, the animal’s lives and ensure the zoo’s financial stability.
Zoo Director Glenn Dobrogosz made the bold recommendation to retire Tange and Zula. Dobrogosz felt that the elephants deserved to live out their remaining years in the best captive environment possible. He researched many facilities and found The Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee to be the most suitable environment for the elephants. Once The Elephant Sanctuary agreed to accept Tange and Zula, Dobrogosz set out on the daunting task of getting the Specie Survival Plan of the AZA to approve his decision. Dobrogosz followed protocol and after six months of diligently researching other facilities that were recommended by the SSP, Chehaw was given official clearance to send Tange and Zula to The Elephant Sanctuary.
In 2003 The Elephant Sanctuary expanded from a 200-acre habitat to an enormous 2,700-acre natural habitat preserve that can sustain up to 100 elephants of both species. The Sanctuary completed construction of the new African elephant house December 2003.
Tange and Zula were the first African elephants to live in the new state-of-the-art African house. They were soon joined by Flora, another African elephant and ex-circus performer who had been boarding at the Miami Metro Zoo.We had a great time participating at Global Family Day 2007 at Summer Stage in Central Park in New York City last month.

Hi- if I can get a DSC H9 for the same price as an H10, which would you recommend? I'm wondering if there's any advancements in the H10 that make it better than the older (but higher end) H9.
That's the short question. Here's more info about why I'm looking at these two:
This would be my first digital camera (it's ok, you can laugh). I presently have a Pentax IQ Zoom 90 and I've waited till now because I've never been satisfied with prints I've seen from digital P&S, I didn't want to give up the durability, and the shutter trigger speed on any didgital i've ever tried has bugged me. The print quality is now probably good enough, and apparently the Sony's have about the best shutter speed. As far as durability, it seems that unless I go with an Olympus SW all digital cameras are going to be about the same- I guess I have to learn to be careful.
I plan on mostly outdoor shots- wildlife, sports, etc. which is why I'm thinking about a mega zoom. I'm assuming the H9 would be the way to go, but I'm doing my due diligience- please set me straight if I'm off base here.
Thanks!Ask A Scientist

How long do horses live? Today it is not uncommon for horses to live beyond the age of 30 with good care. The average age is 28 years. Ponies tend to live longer with many ponies still living well into their 30's.
There exists an extraordinary collection of myths and facts about horses, their honored place in human history, and the mystique that has surrounded them in cultures around the globe. According to many scholars, horses have always held a mystical sway over the human imagination; it has inspired the same reverence or cross-cultural fascination.
North America was the original home of the horse species. They evolved here, and thrived here for over 50.
The genus Equus, which includes modern horses, zebras, and asses, is the only surviving genus in a once diverse family of horses that included 27 genera.
Issues associated with the existence of wild horses in the Western U.S. today represents another clash between those who see Nature as a collection of resources to be used to serve humankind and those who hold the view that Nature by itself has value apart from what we may wish to do with it. Today's wild horse management issues are extremely complex - if you are looking for simplistic answers, you will not find them here. The best thing you can do is to continually educate yourself and make your own decisions. Talk to people, talk to ranchers, wild horse advocates, recreationists, hunters & fishermen, campers, bikers, field biologists and wild horse advocates. Go visit the range yourself if you can. See for yourself what it's like. Imagine for yourself a "thriving ecological balance”, one with wild horse and one without.Apples of Gold’s Military Discount: 10 Percent Off Year Round!

Popular ticket site StubHub.com has tickets listed for a measly $6 apiece for the Bears-Browns contest in Cleveland this Sunday.

That would come in exchange for Israeli concessions that would allow faltering peace talks with the Palestinians to continue beyond an end-of-April deadline.
The person cautioned that such a step by the United States -- which would be a dramatic turnaround from previous refusals -- was far from a done deal and that discussions with Israel on the matter are ongoing. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the negotiations on the record.
In return, Israel would have to undertake significant concessions to the Palestinians.
U.S. defense and intelligence officials have consistently argued against releasing Pollard, who is serving a life sentence.
Pollard was a civilian intelligence analyst for the U.S. Navy when he gave thousands of classified documents to his Israeli handlers. He was arrested in 1985 and later sentenced to life in prison.
Pollard could be released from prison on November 21, 2015 -- 30 years after his arrest -- because he was convicted and sentenced before the abolishment of parole in the federal prison system. He has been serving his sentence at a facility in Butner, N.C.

Call in at 1-347-677-1837.
The passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) in 1996 changed the way the federal government finances cash welfare to low-income families. Instead of a matching grant, states receive a set amount of federal funds in the form of a block grant with no adjustments for inflation, caseload numbers, or state spending. Social assistance programs, however, tend to experience increased demand in recessions – more people require assistance from the government during difficult economic times. To meet increased demand, states have to increase spending, but recessions usually bring lower revenues to states, requiring some cuts to discretionary spending. Analysts were concerned that PRWORA’s change to a block grant would jeopardize social spending during times of state fiscal stress and cause states to disproportionately cut welfare spending during recession.

When the topic turned toward the entrepreneurship committee, Ronnie Sadler suggested a “best business idea” competition, wherein the winner is awarded with capital or financial help or anything that would help businesses get off the ground. He said that specific criteria have yet to be determined, however.
“It would be open to all people in the community who have great ideas about business opportunities,” Sadler said.
EDC Chairman Dan Bozarth said the tourism committee is looking to meet with the parks commissioner to ask about what’s happening with the parks at the state level. Trigg County Judge Executive Stan Humphries said he hoped they could meet with him sometime this week.
After discussion of the various CV committees, EDC Don Leibee said that many people are looking to EDC to decide what businesses and industries they want to go after.

Then as now, at least five CT board manufacturers offered products that give small-to-medium-duty applications access to the switch. They do this by imbedding the board equivalent of a digital station set inside the same boxrunning the app. Like a counter-spy (we said then), the phone-set emulator appears to the switch as a faithful digital phone set, receiving instructions on such things as dialed extension number, line and lamp status, positive disconnect status, and then turning that info over, via direct digital link or SMDI interface, to the insurgent adjunct behind enemy (PC) lines. The espionage metaphor works (and the emulation category exists) because of the major PBX manufacturers traditional hostility to third-party voice mail and auto attendant products. Telephony-board generalists like Dialogic, Pika, and Bicom and specialty companies such as VTG and Calista, therefore, have amassed considerable intellectual property by reverse-engineering the call signaling of major PBXes, cracking the code, and putting that technology within reach of developers through their boards, enclosed integration appliances, and APIs to same. Last year, we concentrated on voicemail. Theres still a great market there indeed, Calista calls all the products we wrote about last year voicemail interfaces. Calista also claims that OEM voicemail revenue is five times what it was in 98, and that theyve captured a great deal of the OEM voicemail market, including Lucents own Octel voicemail platform. VTG, for its part, is the in-skin solution for Toshiba and Mitel; Bicom does NECs. But generic voicemail is a mature, sewn-up market, more and more presumed as an OEMed in-skin. PBX integration technology vendors are now looking to expand the market for their intellectual property, and, of course, to get on the IP train. Beyond voicemail currently includes medium-duty CT for call centers of up to 100 seats, in-building wireless applications, IVR, and monitoring and logging applications. Examples: A VTG (Buffalo, NY 716-689-6700, ) VoiceBridge integration board helps an Apropos call center server get ANI and DNIS, speed call routing, reduce touch-tone prompting, and allow customer database lookup for screen pop. It even lets Apropos get to abandoned calls for call-back. VTGs digital set emulation is used in most of the current call center monitoring and recording products, including Witness Systems. These third-party apps take advantage of the service observe function of Lucent, Nortel, Simens/Rolm or Mitel supervisory extensions to listen in on or record CSR interactions. On the wireless front, wireless server adjuncts to PBXs, armed with DSE, allow the switch makers mobile phones to have the same transfer, conference, hold, and voicemail features as tethered station sets. Last summer VTG announced an OEM partnership with Ericsson to integrate its DCT-1900 wireless system with Lucent, Siemens or Nortel digital PBXs. Expected product release date is by end of this year. Creating the most interest, though, is the notion of putting remote office phones on the company PBX. This has been done over ISDN, and is now going over IP using various means of broadband connectivity. Were talking about IP gateway voice packetization for actual Nortel Meridian 2616 handsets and the like, augmented by preserving feature-phone functionality over an intranet or broadband Internet. Instead of relocating traditional handsets, these switch-enabled remote access apps may drive new IP phones, so all that needs to be added is familiar button functionality. Or no-phones softphones as desktop clients or even web-page apps with phone-like GUIs, that ring, play dial tones, transfer, conference, light message lamps, and positively detect disconnects. In this scenario, a remote worker can use a web site as an extension on the company PBX. The DSE-enabled app here is part of a remote-access server on the network, connected to digital station lines with an emulation board. Plug-and-play is most valuable to a SOHO app. Calista, due soon to be part of Cisco, took the DSE-over-IP idea all the way to end product, selling PBXoverIP Solo, a telecommuters gateway/DSE box. This packetizes voice and allows both voice and data to be shipped between identical units at the home-office and head-office. Its been selling for a year. A 24-port product, PBXoverIP Workgroup, has also been produced, relocating 24 digital phone sets for a whole branch office across the WAN. The single-user product is on hold, for now, pending Ciscos ultimate strategy. VTG, for its part, appears to still be in the proof-of-concept stage, appealing to third parties to extend PBX features over the WAN while still figuring out how to make it as shrink-wrapped as possible. PBX makers themselves have jumped into the remote access part of the station-set market, as well. See Nortels MHO (Meridian Home Office II), below.

You can stuff up to eight ISA cards per system, for up to 32 ports of integration. All boards share the same IRQ. List price for one Norstar board is $1,000; Bicom wants to hear from you for volume purchase and Meridian quotes. Bicom also continues to supply the in-skin voicemail for NEC the ElectraMail AD8 single-board computer. In four or eight ports, it connects directly into the backplane of the Electra Professional Level I and II key systems. In-skin voicemails not only save ports: According to Mehmet Binal, Bicom president, the overall cost of ownership for such systems is less than 50% of external adjuncts. Calista Calistas (San Jose, CA 408-558-9700, ) Brian Straw, national sales manager for VoIP, demoed the one-port PBXoverIP Solo product from his office in the Boston area, extension 227 on Calistas San Jose PBX. He called me through his IP-connected extension using a 384-kb DSL FlowPoint external router, and his voice was PSTN-quality. His router had four Ethernet ports for data traffic, a Solo and a Nortel 2616 handset on one side, he told me, and a DSL connection from Concentric Communications on the other. When we were finished speaking, I asked him to transfer me to the operator. It took a few extra seconds and beeps perhaps 12 to 15 seconds worth but there was the San Jose operator, greeting me with good morning at 2 p.m. EST. Calistas PBX was equipped with a Solo on its side.

Jennifer Aniston and her mother are definitely not friends. Of course, every mother and daughter have conflict at some time during the course of their lives. It’s sort of a built-in aspect of the mother-daughter bond. However, the Aniston women’s problems seem more complicated than that. So much so that Jen has banned her mother from her upcoming wedding to Justin Theroux. And this isn’t the first time. Jen’s mom was also banned from her 2000 wedding to Angelina’s current fiancÃ©, Brad Pitt.
So why does La Aniston hate her mother? Apparently, it’s because the senior Mrs. Aniston reportedly suffered from a severe case of loose lips with the media. Nancy Aniston, who is 76 years old and in poor health, failed to “keep her mouth shut about her daughter’s private life” in an interview way back in 1996.
“Being at Jennifer’s wedding to Justin was one of Nancy’s greatest late-in-life dreams Â—,” revealed an insider, “but now that dream is shattered. …when Nancy started asking a bunch of questions about the upcoming event, it set off an alarm in Jennifer’s head. She realized her mom was gossiping way too much about her wedding plans. Now she has banned Nancy from the nuptials Â— just like she banned her from her wedding to Brad Pitt…”
Yikes. Jennifer Aniston sure knows how to carry a grudge. Especially over something as minor as talking to the press. Perhaps Jen should lighten up a little. Many people have parents who commit infinitely worse sins against them–molestation, theft, and physical or psychological abuse to name only a few. Her mom’s trespasses seem pretty mild by comparison. Everyone is guilty of loose lips once in a while. Why not let her mother attend the wedding? It’s just one day at a public ceremony. What harm could the poor old gal possibly do? Plus, Jen, it might be good karma.
Just saying.

Wladimir Klitschko to defend belts against Kubrat Pulev in September
Wladimir Klitschko will defend his WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO heavyweight titles against undefeated Bulgarian Kubrat Pulev in Germany on 6 September.
The Ukrainian last fought in April, beating Australia's Alex Leapai to extend his 10-year winning run.
Pulev, 33, is the IBF's mandatory challenger and is undefeated in 20 fights, with 11 by way of knockout.
Klitschko, 38, said: "He has a sophisticated technique and I won't underestimate him."
The fight will take place at Hamburg's O2 World Arena and Pulev - nicknamed The Cobra - said: "I'm ready to replace Wladimir Klitschko as champion."
However, his Germany-based opponent has been a heavyweight champion since 2006 and has a record of 52 knockouts in 62 wins.
Klitschko, whose last defeat came in April 2004, added: "The Cobra is a challenge for me. I am looking forward to this challenge and can't wait to start my training camp to prepare for the next step of my mission."here is the problem:
while the bike is on the workstand and I start to pedal it then I stop the rotation the freewheel starts clicking, but it will spin for a second and then tries to drive the chain and spin the cranks. If I hold the pedals to engage the freewheel again then I can feel it trying to drive the chain.
The rear wheel hub is a Bontrager Race.
Is this causing me drag when I coast?
I tried to lubricate where I could, but it didn't help.
Any help and advice would be appreciated.An attractive Thatched 17th century self catering cottage in the village of West Lulworth. A short walk to the cove and beach.details

Last season, when Veronica finally tracked down the Vice President's brother (who was supposedly assassinated by Lincoln Burrows), he was portrayed by John Billingsley. And his sister, now the President of the United States, was played by Patricia Wettig.
But both actors have since taken roles in new TV series, and so they couldn't commit to the second season of 'Prison Break'.
With Ms. Wettig's character of President Reynolds, the producers at least had some wriggle room. With the eight escapees from Fox River Penitentiary on the run, the focus will definitely be Michael Schofield and his fellow "breakers". So the other plotline about the conspiracy to put Vice President Reynolds into the White House and her own attempts to clamp down the Truth leaking out can be put on the back burner for a while.
Then, if and when 'Brothers & Sisters' crashes and burns over on ABC (despite protests by producer Greg Berlanti to the contrary), the 'Prison Break' producers can move that storyline forward and back into play on 'Prison Break'.
But if after thirteen weeks the Greg Berlanti-produced drama proves to be a hit for ABC, the producers could always recast in hopes that enough time had passed for the audience to accept the difference in appearance.
With the character of Terence Steadman, the producers had a different problem. The first season ended with Veronica finally coming face to face with Steadman in the Montana home that was also his prison. That scene had to be resolved ... or at least given an ending.
Now, several months had gone by since we last saw 'Prison Break', but in the future, the episodes will follow almost instantaneously as people watch the show on DVD boxed sets. They'll pop out the last disk of Season One and then pop in the first disk for Season Two and right before Veronica's eyes, Terence Steadman will change actors.
So the casting had to be as close as possible in the changeover and they didn't do too badly in choosing Jeff Perry who used to be a cast member of 'Nash Bridges', but who's probably better known today as Meredith's Dad on 'Grey's Anatomy'. (I first saw him in an episode of 'Columbo'.)
Still, even though he appeared to ape a few of Billingsley's mannerisms for the role of Steadman, there are enough differences in both men so that within the reality of the show, it should be noticeable to Veronica. After all, she's standing right there when the change occurs.
So how to splain it away? With a 'Quantum Leap'.
At some point in the future, a researcher using Dr. Sam Beckett's technology leaped into the life of Terence Steadman; perhaps in order to better study this crisis point in American history. It's unknown if there was a different outcome in the events which the leaping researcher causes to change in order to make right what once went wrong.
Perhaps Veronica survived the encounter, which only made things worse in the future; sort of like the Edith Keeler situation in the classic 'Star Trek' episode of "City On The Edge Of Forever". Or maybe Steadman, as should have been played by Billingsley, killed her himself. Instead, this impersonator of Steadman, who's being played by Jeff Perry, chooses instead not to shoot her; leaving that fatal decision up to the Feds who come to the house in response to Veronica's call to the local sheriff's department.
At any event, as we used to see in every episode of 'Quantum Leap', Sam would appear to those around him as the person whose life he was acting out, while that person was trapped back in the future in the "waiting room". So Veronica wouldn't see anybody who even remotely resembled the actor Jeff Perry. Instead, she would still have seen Terence Steadman as he looked when she first met him, similar in appearance to John Billingsley.
Not that it mattered much. She was soon shot through the head and chopped up into several garbage bags.....
For some reason, I would have thought that this plot development would have helped push the conspiracy plotline into the background, and there would be no need to come back to Terence Steadman again. As such, it would have been only this episode that the producers would have needed John Billingsley for. Surely the producers of 'The Nine' (the show which has cast Billingsley as a regular) could have given him the time (What? Three days tops?) necessary to complete the storyline?
Since they didn't, it could be that the producers have more in store for Terence Steadman and that we have not seen the last of him. And that's why it became even more vital that they find a replacement actor.
In the past, several producers have decided to not only recast a role but then to go back and re-shoot the original scenes to incorporate the new actor, even though the audience had already seen the original actor in the role.
David Chase did that for an FBI agent played by Fairuza Balk in a season-ending episode of 'The Sopranos'. But before he began shooting the new season, he had rethought the direction he wanted to take that FBI agent and decided a different actress would be better for getting that vision across. So unless you have that original scene on tape somewhere in your collections, you'll never see Fairuza Balk in the role again, as her scene were re-shot and added to the DVD collection.
You'd think at least they'd have kept the scene in for a bonus feature, but nooooooooooo! It's as if she never existed in the show.
The same thing happened with John Randolph's portrayal of Frank Costanza on 'Seinfeld'. He did at least two episodes of the show but then was replaced with Jerry Stiller, who took the role to new heights and new lows; places which seem inconceivable with Randolph, as great a character actor as he was.
After the casting change, Larry David went back and re-shot the original two episodes which introduced Frank Costanza so that it would be a consistent portrayal by Jerry Stiller alone.
However, it was too late to go back and do the same thing with the pilot episode of 'Seinfeld' for Jerry's Dad. In 'The Seinfeld Chronicles', Jerry Seinfeld's father was played by Phil Bruns, best known for playing George Shumway on 'Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman'.
He only appeared in that one episode, and Barney Martin was brought in later to memorably portray Morty Seinfeld throughout the rest of the series' run. But by the time they considered re-shooting the role from the pilot as they had done with the character of Frank Costanza, it was decided Jerry's appearance (due to aging?) would have conflicted with the other scenes in the pilot.
So those people who watch the DVD versions of 'Seinfeld' will only see Jerry Stiller in the role of Frank Costanza (not sure if the John Randolph scenes survived as bonus material), but they'll get both Phil Bruns and Barney Martin as Morty Seinfeld.
But that splainin is for another time.
As for Terence Steadman on 'Prison Break', we may yet see him again on the show. And if so, Jeff Perry will be playing the role - I'm sure the producers made certain he would be available for them. But from a Toobworld perspective, we can say that the researcher continued to inhabit Steadman's aura in order to observe how the Reynolds presidency played out.
Anyways, because the POTUS is Reynolds and not Bush, 'Prison Break' has to be relegated to an alternate TV dimension. And I've already postulated that it would be the same dimension where we would find 'The Agency' and 'The District', which would have had a different president as well; one who preceded Reynolds' predecessor in the Oval Office.
So even after all of this sturm and drang, it really boils down to be no problem at all in the grand scheme of things for Earth Prime Time, the main Toobworld.

The program, entitled “The Safe Handling and Disposal of Hazardous Medications,” was implemented throughout the Medical Center beginning in January 2010. Since that time, the Medical Center has collected over 3,510 pounds of hazardous pharmaceutical waste for proper disposal, addressing a multitude of both worker and environmental safety issues. Furthermore, the policies and other educational materials that support this program can be easily transferred to other hospitals across the state of Maryland and beyond.
Denise Choiniere, UMMC's sustainability manager, was present at the reception to accept the award on behalf of the Medical Center. She was joined by Marc Summerfield, the Medical Center's director of Pharmacy and Bethany Shelbourne, the Medical Center's assistant director for Inpatient Pharmacy Services.

Rage built up by playing Left 4 Dead 1 or 2, usually occurs from the game not loading on the first, second or tenth time. Sudden connection loss during a really good and close game of Left 4 Dead versus. Or when after waiting a while to finally get a versus game going one of the sides quits when it doesn't win the first level in a crushing victory. And finally horrible connection lag when playing a good game, often leading to poor aim, not being able to help a teammate quickly, or, if playing as infected, accidently spawning in front of the humans with enough time for them to kill you before you can do anything.
It's that Left 4 Dead Rage, it'll get to you.
by Gundam Hater April 02, 2011Xavier's men's basketball team on Saturday gained the final member of its Class of 2014 in Larry Austin Jr., a 6-foot-2 guard from Illinois.
Austin originally committed to Tennessee before coach Cuonzo Martin left for California. After being released from his National Letter of Intent and reopening his search late last month, he narrowed his choices to Cal and Xavier.
Austin visited Xavier last weekend and ultimately decided to fill its final scholarship.
"I just felt like Xavier was the right place for me. Since I got my release form from Tennessee, me and Coach (Chris) Mack have had a good relationship – and with my parents as well. They recruited me hard, and I wanted to come and be part of the family," Austin said.
Joining the highest ranked recruiting class in program history was another draw. Austin, rated a three-star prospect by Scout.com and Rivals.com, rounds out a cast that includes fellow rookies Trevon Bluiett, Makinde London, J.P. Macura, Sean O'Mara and Edmond Sumner.
Indiana transfer Remy Abell practiced with the team last season and also will suit up for the first time as a Musketeer.
"Since (the freshmen) are coming in at the same time, we can grow together and develop chemistry," said Austin, who already knows most of the rookies from AAU ball.
Known for being a vocal, pure floor general, Austin excels in finding the open man and is confident in his 3-point shooting. The Lanphier High School senior averaged 22.2 points, 7.5 rebounds and 4.2 steals last season and is strong academically, boasting a 3.75 GPA.
For now, Austin is thrilled his college destination is settled.
"It's a big relief," Austin said.
Here's a look at Xavier's roster for next season:
XAVIER 2014-15 ROSTER
Dee Davis 6-0 G Sr.
Matt Stainbrook 6-10 C Sr.
Remy Abell 6-4 G Jr.
James Farr 6-9 F Jr.
Myles Davis 6-2 G So.
Brandon Randolph 6-1 G So.
Jalen Reynolds 6-9 F So.
Larry Austin Jr. 6-2 G Fr.
Trevon Bluiett 6-6 F Fr.
Makinde London 6-9 F Fr.
J.P. Macura 6-5 G Fr.
Sean O'Mara 6-9 C Fr.
Edmond Sumner 6-4 G Fr.

Baseless Coments:
We are constrained to respond to the most unwarranted postings in the web site of other executive association; though we wanted to neglect it, for the information of our members we are here with publishing for circulation of the letter written by Sr. GM Mysore vide letter No. G-45/SNEA/2012-13 dtd 25-10-2012 addressed to Sr GM Admn Circle office Bangalore in response to our issues pending to be settled at Mysore; which has been procured under RTI by CS SNEA vide application dated 8-11-2012 strictly for the information of our members.
We are equally concerned with the maintenance and development of SSA/BSNL. It is our members who are in the field and are instrumental in these achievements. We have never confronted on these issues with the Mysore Administration. In fact circle organisation has already placed it on record when we held the meeting with CGMT..
What is most concerned is the biased treatment we are subjected to and are fighting on these issues; which ultimately will pave the way for justice, harmony and further development. We are prepared for an impartial enquiry into the issues raised by us.
A man of ordinary prudence will never believe in a lie that if GMs are good if they oblige us for our whims and fancies. For what we are agitating is clear and open to everybody. SNEA has not forgotten that person speaking now; why did not join as DE Halasur (because it is a field work). When this single demand was considered; what happened to the remaining 6 demands raised there and then?
The issues raised by us are exhaustive and explain which are baseless and which are not; once the following letters are studied.

For the letter of CS SNEA KTK click here..
We believe in struggle against injustice and struggled at Bangalore also when 6 SDEs were relieved in the middle of the acadamic year at the provocation of the other association. We need not be preached by others which is totally uncalled for.

2nd day of Agitation By Mysore Comrades:
CS yesterday met CGMT Karnataka and also today again met Sr GM Admin on his telephonic call along with DS CO Com Chadambaram. Both CGMT and GM have told that; "already GM Mysore has been advised to discuss and settle the matter with SNEA".
But GM Mysore is continuing to be adamant on his part. Not only he is biased to SNEA but has reported many issues of having no truths or to tarnish his predecessor. According to him " Even though Mysore SSA is having nearly 600 TMs qualified and certified by our own ISO certified RTTC, not even 5% of the TMs can handle cable related issues independantly. Similar is the case with CDOT/OCB switch and present day transmission systems" and then " The Mysore system is precariously placed. MIS figures are inflated to conceal the large scale closures of land line and broad ban connections ( 13000 landlines aqnd 2500 broadband connections)" and so on and so forth.
Thus he is making false and insulting statements even in writing on the executives and non executives. This cannot be tolerated by the efficient and harworking fraternity of Mysore.
So we have requested circle administration to intervene and resolve the issue. All DSs to be in alert to as to react properly if the apprach of Mysore continues like this.
15-11-2012 :
Comrades of Mysore on Agitational Path:
The genuine issues raised by SNEA Mysore have not been resolved. Dispite the sincere efforts of DS Mysore, several times, GM refused meetings. GM Mysore has in addition initiated retaliatory actions on SNEA and transferred Circle President of SNEA with vindictive attitude. GM Mysore is proved to be totally biased in his approach. So comrades of SNEA Mysore will be on Dharna today in front of GM Office Mysore. Circle Organisation fully supports the organisational programme of Mysore comrades.

A word of THANKS to Kolar Administration.
We are extremely thankful to GM Shri Sudhakar ( GM TMK in charge of Kolar) and DGM Smt Nirmala for considering the long pending genuine demands of our Kolar SNEA members. The administration has considered the request transfer of Com Krishnamurthy SDE from Bagepalli to Chickballapur, Com Narain Nandakumar DS SNEA from Mulbagil to Kolar, Com Deepthi from Kolar to Siddlagatta. Even while alloting postings to the SDEs on incoming transfers the undue favour being shown earlier to a particular group is curtrailed and considerations are done in a transparant way without any injustice. Of course credit also should go to our young leaders like Com Nazeer, Com Narain and our District President Com Ramakrishna and all young activists of SNEA who are vigilant and persuaded the issues.

It was also decided to hold a meeting again on 23rd July 2012 to settle the issue of 6 transfers. We have informed the management that the issues need to approached comprehensivly and any decision taken in part will lead to discrimination and industrial unrest and will be untolerable.
WE ARE VERY MUCH THANKFUL TO SHRI SHUBHENDU GOSH FOR THE PATIENT HEARING AND FOR HIS VERY OPEN APPROACH AND DISCUSSION ON THE ONGOING UNWARRANTED DEVELOPMENTS IN BGTD AND HIS ASSURANCE TO RESOLVE THEM SHORTLY.
However, members of BGTD are advised to be on red alert and be prepared for the needful organisation action in the event of any deadlock in resolving the issues as decided in our district conference of BGTD held on 14th July 2012...
20-07-2012:
CS along with ACS HQ Com Hiremugadur met CGMT Karnataka Shri P Raghavan on 19th July and held detailed discussion on the issue of retaining 6 SDEs under transfer till March 2013. CGMT is in full agreement with the contents raised in our letter in this connection. But at this juncture he is not ready to interfere in the issue. This position of the CGMT was strongly protested by us.Hence comrades of BGTD have to take appropriate decesion immediately to bring proper pressure on the management to avoid the disturbance in the middle of the year.

GM on discussing further in case of relieving of SDEs from Raichur and Gulbarga informed that the working strength of these SSAs have been thoroughly checked in these SSAs and it is found that the executives distribution ( JTO+SDE ) as on date is equal or more on far with other SSAs and hence the SSA GMs have been advised to relieve all the transferred officers immediatley without waiting for the substitutes. Hence retaining them further is discrimination. The calculation details are also furnished to us.We will further persuade the cases.

Is BSNL appointed 150 new Executives in BGTD? Then where these 150 executives came from?
The legal battle waged by Com W Sheshagiri Rao and Com G L Jogi to enable the executives in BSNL to take an informed choice at the time of absorption is fresh in our memory. The benefits (an order of point to point fixation of IDA scales, proper elevated scales for executives and of course the Time Bound Promotions every 4-5 years) the executives derived out of that glorious struggle at the time of absorption till now are well known.
The stand taken by some association to blindly going for absorption on the mere promise of Rs.2000 adhoc payment, dangerous consequences that the executives faced, had the offer been accepted is also fresh in our memory.
The reasons for re-calling this very significant incident of the year 2000-2002 is a false propaganda that is being spread by certain quarters from BGTD.
The propaganda says that 150 members have joined the association along with some senior comrades. One such senior comrade is elected as their office bearer. The informed members and delegates of SNEA had defeated this leader’s attempt to occupy the important posts of our organization time and again.
We in SNEA adore democratic and transparent functioning, to be in the fore front in the fight to protect the interest of its members.
We in SNEA abhor opportunist elements, functioning and keep away the manipulators and power mongers.
Our membership in BGTD is in tact, rumors what so ever spread need not be believed. In fact we have improved our membership position not only in BGTD but also in all other SSAs like Kolar, Davangere, Chickmaglur, Hubli, Mobile services Bangalore, Circle office Bangalore etc.
Organizations are to be build by honest and dedicated works. The issue of notional fixation of 2004 LDCE candidates was taken by Karnataka SNEA, fought in the court and succeeded. Executives have got the benefit which took two years of legal fight. Success has many fathers and the leaders of other association who kept mum all these years are now promising the members that they would get the benefits to the left out candidates.
Every one must know that transfers of SDEs with less than 2 years service was not considered. It is the present SNEA circle body which fought the issue with the management and many executives for the last 3 years are getting this benefit.
At one point of time JTOs gone on long stay transfer were struggling to get back to their places even after 3-4 years. It is SNEA which fought for their transfers and successful at the end. This truth is known to the affected JTOs.
Wherever injustice is there, we from our side fully involve in the issue and fight for the them to whatever extent it is possible by us. The recent incident of Kolar is mirror before you. The management under the pressure of so called saviors of BSNL projected an innocent but very efficient JTO as riotous figure but miserably failed to prove their false allegations and the court has declared it as illegal. This case was followed up and fought by the full support of SNEA.
The 33 to 35 rule 8 and the periodical request transfers of JTOs were the persuasions of this organization.
Look at the issues of STR comrades. SNEA stood by the difficulties faced by the comrades working in very difficult stations in different parts of Karnataka and waiting for transfers for 4-5 years. SNEA stood for the cause of these comrades and successful in getting these requests are considered despite the dirty politics.
Yes our utmost priority is the BSNL services. It is SNEA in Karnataka which has taken up many issues whether it is the failures of equipment or services in GSM, MPLS, NOC and CDR issues, the shortage of store materials and equally supported all the right decisions of the management.
Even take the example recent revenue loss of Rs.3.5 crores. We did not hesitate to take up the issue with every authority like CGM, PGM, and CMD. On 30-5-2012 SNEA leadership has personally met CMD BSNL at Bangalore and brought the issue to his notice. CMD in fact appreciated the interest of this association in particular for our very serious concern in the matter.
For every common cause we have always joined hands with our counter parts giving no room for any politics. People should not forget that being opportunistic will de-stabilse the strongly built unity and trust.
It is on principles of fight for right cause that our association has grown to this towering height with very strong foundations. No body can snatch its committed members.
We shall be happy if these friends from other association desist from making false claims and incorrect propaganda.
Executives in general and from SNEA in particular are well informed, knowledgeable and capable of dismissing these false propaganda with the contempt that it deserves.

Meeting with CMD BSNL:
SNEA Karnataka under the leadership of CS Com S B Nagavi, along with BGTD DS Com M S Hiremugadur and President Com Ranganayakulu met CMD BSNL respected Shri
R K Upadhyaya,
yesterday in Ashoka Hotel after Parlimentary Committe Meeting. CS in addition to discussing staff matters like requesting for additional justified DE vacancies, generalising the notional fixation to LDCE candidates, in detail discussed on the loss created due to the artificial shortage of CTOPUP and recharge products in Bangalore TD by the wrong handling of the Franchesee issue. Though the issue is resolved temperorily it may crop in again. We have as per the decesion taken by SNEA BGTD proposed that a parallel channel of suppply be made available to avoid such shortages in future. The CTOP UP can be extended to all our field executives who are the front end managers, facing the customers and also to all other executives who are willing to sell the CTOUP products. CGM Shri P Raghavan and PGM Shri Shjri Shubhendhu Ghosh also appriciated our proposal.
We are thankful to CGM and Sr GM Admn for having arranged the meeting even in the busy schedules of the CMD.

Revenue of Rs 3.5 Crores !!!
Today morning after confirming of the stalemate between BGTD management and Franchisees, CS has written to Shri R K Upadyaya CMD BSNL through email at 1130 hours. In the afternoon CGMT Karnataka held meeting with the Franchisee and then directed them to meet PGM. Today evening the BGTD administration has agreed to accept cheques and we are expecting the normal business in Bangalore from tomorrow. For the copy of the email click here.. Now the big question before us is WHO is responsible for the loss of 10 days to the tune of Rs. 3.5 crores. It is unfortunate that this decesion would have been taken 10 days before by calling the meeting of the business parteners. Circle organisation has continuously pursued the issue with the managment for the last 10 days.
DS BGTD is holding emergency meeting on 29th at 1730 hours in NTB on this issue.

The shortage of Re-charage/ CTOP UP in Bangalore draws the media attention. Click here for the report in the Kannadaprabha Daily today. CS after seeing the report immediately visited PGM Office and met Sh Shubhendhu Ghosh PGM BGTD and discussed on the seriousness of the issue. PGM BGTD says that he is ready to accept the cheques of the prompt Francheses whose cheques have not bounced. He has also directed concerned DGM to immediately call for the meeting of the Francheses to convey them the management decesion . DS BGTD Com Hiremugadur and DP BGTD Com Ranganayakulu were also present in the meeting.

GS SNEA CHQ Com Sebastin writes to Sh R K Upadhyaya on the revenue loss of Rs 2. 2 Crores in Bangalore TD due to sudden policy change in the Franchisee Policy.The revenue loss is recurring and it will be 2.5 Crores as on today. For letter click here..
The JTOs under transfer orders were relieved by the circle administration directly today. This issue was continuously pursed by SNEA and finally the relieving has been ensured. For order click here.. However the JTOs of Hassan SSA are not covered in this order. We will strongly protest on the stand of the administration. The District Branch may also pursue at SSA level as suffcient executives have been posted to Hassan SSA.

CS S B Nagavi writes to CGMT Karnatka Sh P Raghavan regarding consideration of request transfers in the casdre of ADOL in accordance with the transfer policy/rules being followed....For letter click here...
24-05-2012:
Approximately revenue of Rs 2.2 Crores loss to Karnataka Circle !!!!
Who is responsible for this loss???
The Employees, Executives or the management ???
The average revenue collection from the CTOP Up segment in Bangalore was an average of Rs.33 lakhs per day.
From 17th May 2012 to 24th May 2012 the revenue collection from the CTOP Up and Recharge segment has become nearly big ZERO in BGTD.
This is due to a sudden change in the policy decesion of the BGTD management. Normally on cheques of the francheses the CTOP Up was released but due cheque bouncing of one or two case, the BGTD managment enforced all the francheses to buy these topups by paying cash/DD. But this condition generally being imposed on to the defaulted agency, it has been generalised to all; aggrevating the situtation by deliberately imposing the instructions on the trusted and reliable business parterners also.
CS Com S B Nagavi had contacted respected PGM BGTD Sh Shubhendu Ghosh on 18th May 2012 over phone. On 19th May 2012 an email was also sent to GS with copy to PGM/CGMT Bangalore also. CS has also contacted respected CGMT Karnataka Sh P Raghavan over phone on 19th May 2012. Again on 23rd May 2012 CS has personally met CGMT Sh P Raghavan and appraised of non resolving the issue. Today CS has met Sh Koundinyan Sr GM in charge of S&M, Sh Chandramouli Sr GM HR and Admn ( Both CGM/PGM are out of HQ) and tried to assertain the business conditions anything that have been changed. Even as on today the 24th May 2012 issue remains unresolved.
By invoking sub para 'f' of para 'K' of 2009 Franchisee sales and Distribution Policy now; sudden policy change has been imposed. When prevailing proceedure was smooth for all these years- this sudden change has created a scarcity of CTOP UP and Recharges of BSNL products in Bangalore.
While it is our sincere effort with the managment; some senior officers are trying to create an impression that SNEA is in favour of selling BSNL products free of cost.
SNEA Karnatka is pursuing the issue very seriously not to loose our revenue wihi is in the pipeline; in the interest of the company and for our bread and butter. Com G L Jogi our President has also sent a mail in this regard to all concerned.
For the mail extracts linked below gives you the stand of this association.

If issue doesn't get resolved, we may have to start organisational action in addition to writing to MOC/CMD BSNL to highlight the non-interest of the Karnataka BSNL managment in BSNL business segments....

United Forum of Executives;
Com S B nagavi CS and Com Chidambar DS CO along with Com H Y Andeli CS AIBSNLEA and Com Mahantesh Banagar ACS AIBSNLEA today met Sh P Raghavan, CGMT Karnataka to discuss on the relieving of the SDEs who are on transfer orders. We have focussed on the issue of none being relieved from Raichur. We have also served a detailed letter on the iussue. For letter click here. Later we have also met Sr GM HR and Admn Sh R Chandramouli and submitted our stand very clearly as CGM has suggested to discuss with him in detail. If these relieving are delayed/not effected, it will totally de-stabilise the agreed understanding of the associations with the managment and the proceedure being followed for years. Hence we may have to step in to organisational actions. Members are requested to be on alert in this regard.

BUILDING FUND:
Com A G Kulkarni SDE STR Hubli has donated Rs.10,000-00 and Com A Krishnamurthy SDE Civil has donated Rs.5,000-00 towards circle builiding fund. Circle Organisation is thankful to both the members for the generous donation..

Still STR administration has to resolve the issue of setting right the acute shortages in STR outdoor maintenance in various SSAs. This issue also will be taken up with the CGMT STR Chennai shortly.

It may also be noted that we have very strongly opposed the disturbances done in the last spell, that the JTOs of BGTD were posted out of BGTD. This issue was very carefully pursued by the circle organisation and was successful in convincing the circle administration; that it cannot be treated as declining of the promotiuon. We are very much greatful to Sh P Raghavan, CGMT Karnataka and Sh R Chandramouli Sr GM HR & Admn for having considered our presentation in the said issue. We are also thankaful for the comrades of BGTD for the solidarity support shown by them in this regard otherwise a struggle was inevitable this time. We congratulate the comrades of BGTD.

LEGAL INFORMATION
Important Message on the judgement in OA No.227/2009 in Hon CAT Bangalore ( 1966 case)..
It is a case where the seniority of the 1966 qualified JTOs who PROMOTED AS SDEs in 1998 is getting disturbed and the senior JTOs who are non qualified and promoted in 2000 as SDEs under 1996 RRs will stand seniors to these qualified candidates according to the said judgement.
Both the associations SNEA and AIBSNLEA have now filed the Writ Petition ( Appeal) challanging the said order to ensure the seniority of the qualified candidates over the non qualified. This is an issue where serious legal fight is inevitable. Though our association has already spent huge amount on the legal expenses in CAT and now in Hon High Court; we may be in difficulty if the affected SDEs do not contribute for the legal case. We therefore request all the concerned SDE/DEs to contribute Rs.2000/- each so as to further proceed in the case effectively.

Thanks,

Bob and Ira, I wanted to tell you it was nice to meet you while playing with Jeff Moseby. We both were using the BOOstiest II. I have promoted and demonstrated this usefull tool ever since.
I've owned and operated a studio for over 30 years and your toolbox is the defining diference in your sound, just like mics and preamps etc.
i love how the clean boost ads girth to my custom Tele. It loves Fender tones. Chords seem to be glued together, while increasing note definition. The TS circuit is blistering and even more over the top using both together. If you own a one chanel amp you'll gain 2 more channels AND over the top gain. If you have good tools there's a plan for great tone.
Thanks,
Michael Gardner
Just wanted to let you know that the amp is a big hit in my house. Even the wife sat up and took notice! It's plugged into a Matchless 1x12, ZERO pedals, and I've got an Echoplex in the loop...what more can I say? Sounds like Duane Eddy, Andy Summers, The Edge, Jimmy Page, and myself, having a hooley in the kitchen. Marvelous!
Thanks for helping me get my jangle on. all the best,
Rob
A few weeks ago I wrote to you concerning a Boostier Prototype that I had just purchased and wanted to thank you again for all of your support. Most pedals satisfy for a short time but the Boostier Prototype has become the foundation of my tone. It is on all the time. It adds magic to every tonal situation from crystal clean to heavy saturation. Marvelous! I am very fortunate to have stumbled on to this pedal and again, thank you for your support concerning it.Mark Chris Christenson on the Royal Bluesman:
I met Bob at the 2011 Namm show while I was browsing the aisles for new gear for the shop. As I walked past the Burriss booth, the Royal Bluesman caught my eye. Bob Burriss introduced himself and invited me to try the amp. I did so and took one of his cards. I then checked out most of the other amps in this Genre the show had to offer. About five hours later, I returned to order this amp. I have been playing for over thirty years and this amp is truly a pleasure. Pure Tone and what a unique piece. I have since used it on all my musical outings. Bravo Bob! Thanks for the pleasant no pressure presentation. The amp sold itself.
Cheers, Chris Christenson.
Don't say Lunchbox!
Bob Burriss' Royal Bluesman sounded great with Sting, Elton John, and Bruce Springsteen at Carnegie hall!
The Royal Bluesman is a Rythm Guitarists tool, you get the bloom without the smear.Will Kimbrough on the Royal Bluesman:
The Burriss Royal Bluesman is almost too cool to be real.
18 watts all tube with tube reverb and tremolo in a stylish compact cabinet -
I love it!Jimmy Vivino on the Royal Bluesman:
All you really need... tone and control.
Now you can practice unsafe guitar. Just plug in... nothing comes between you and your amp.
We can kick pedalboard dependancy in our lifetime with a simple 2 step program. Plug in... play!Erick Coleman on the Royal Bluesman:
After playing for over 25 years my guitar sound has never been so great thanks to the Royal Bluesman.
It looks super cool, is easy to operate and lug around but the real charm is its tone.
Chunky and clean with just the right amount of drive.
The optional Vib+ is awesome because it also powers my pedalboard. No more batteries or clunky power supplies.
Pure genius!
Don't let the 18 watt rating fool you this amp is loud and stands up well with the bigger boys when cranked through a 4x12.
Bob Burris is the real deal.
He designs, builds, & test drives his amps drawing from his years of experience as a player to dial them in just right.
Long Live the Royal Bluesman!!
Burriss amps have the best tone ever!
I love playing these amps I would recomend them to anybody who is looking for killer blues/rock sound.
Great amp (bts 38). Plenty of power, sounds really good. I play blues music in louisville ky. I get a lot of compliments on my tone. I play a 2007 les paul antique classic with a ocd overdrive, holy grail reverb, and a boss delay.Thomas Lees supports the Royal Bluesman:
I gigged the RB this weekend and had a blast. I wanted that amp for tele/grit tones, which is my base tone. I have to say however, that I was caught off guard when I plugged in a humbucker guitar and let go. Brilliant. Organic tele mojo, strat spank and rock dog drive are all there with the simple addition of a tube screamer(ish) pedal and use of the volume knob.
Best regards, TomBrad Rice (2 years touring with Keith Urban) speaks on behalf of The Shadow:
...our monitor engineer complimented our tone the other day....saying it was the best on stage! You've been super kind and generous and I really appreciate everything!!! I've tried to spread the word as much as possible and I've had a some people write, either on myspace or at my site, and say they dug the amps and tone.
They had a case built for the tour that holds both amps, my pedalboard, and a spare Orange head (just in case)....so all Chris Miller does is roll the thing on stage, take the lid off, plug the stuff in and we're off! Same thing with loading out...I think he said it takes him all of 5 mins to have us up and rockin'! I don't plan on using any different amps...A Brad Rice fan site made a testimonial about the sound of Brad's Shadow:
"My wife, 15yo son and I caught you with KU in Raleigh, NC in June. We were close down front and gotta say, your tone was right on !! Awesome show, you all sounded great and were having a great time, it was obvious !! I was in front of your Burris rig, you didn't seem to be using any pedals ? Those amps were beaking up just right !!"
"ah - those Burriss' sounded great - saw you on stage and thought, He is a loooong way from the Gold tour! congrats and great job"Tim Hollen made a testimonial about the Dirty Red:
I am a big fan of the Burriss amps; I have played through all the Burriss amps the Shadow, Switch Master, db Special, Royal Bluesman, and the Dirty Red. All, which are great amps, but the one I fell in love with was the Dirty Red amp. The sound is tight and amazing from country to blues and to rock and roll. I have played through a lot of amp in my twenty years of playing the electric guitar, but this one beats them all. I would put it against any amp out there. Fender amps can't even come close to the sound of this amp, personally I think it sounds better than the DR Z amps. Just try the Dirty Red amp out and you will see what I am talking about. I will be buying this amp in a couple of months. Great job! On this amp Bob Burriss."Eclectifish" @ jsguitarforum writes about Burriss Shadow:
I got to meet and speak at length with Bob Burris. I played through this amp on his guitars (a Tele and an SG). The Burris is a fairly new point to point handwired boutique amp (a little over a year old) so you may not have heard of it. This amp was better than anything else I played this day (and I played a lot of amps not mentioned here). The tone was absolutely sweet and fat with tons of sustain and overtones.
Although it uses 6L6 tubes it suffers none of the typical low end flabbiness associated with Fender Tweeds amps when used with humbuckers. I absolutely loved this amp. Bob explained to me that he worked quite a bit on the final gain stage to make it very humbucker friendly, and, believe me, it is. Warm with plenty of thump, but no flab. All of the character of the guitar comes through. This is now my favorite amp and the one I'm saving toward (unfortunately, it costs about three times as much as my previous favorite amp, the Dr. Z - oh well, it will just be that much longer)."Eclectifish" @ jsguitarforum writes about Burriss Boostiest II:
I really didn't get to put this pedal through its paces like I did the Keeley TS, but I didn't want to. I plugged in and the first tone that I dialed up was an Eric Johnson type violin tone that I could have played for days. Although Bob describes this pedal as TS-ish, I'm not so sure. I think every pedal maker these days is doing their 'take' on the Ibanez but, truth be told, they're all different.
The Burris pedal had a very creamy overdrive sound which still let plenty of the instrument's tone come through. This is different than the Keely TS which actually had a lot of the clean characteristics to it. The Burris, as I played it (and there are other settings I didn't try, to be sure) really was more of a full-on overdrive. Of course you can get a full on overdrive out of the Keeley TS, too, but to my ears it's not as pleasing a sound as the lower gain settings. The Burris, on the other hand, excels at high gain without, in any way, overwhelming the natural sound of the instrument. This pedal also has tons of headroom, allowing you to create some wonderful nuances and dynamics with the pick.
Another thing I noticed was how much a good pedal and a good amp work together... ...as did the way the Burris pedal interacted with the Burris amp.Secondary menu

"Awesome"
I have loved Tamora Pierce's works since I was a child and this is one of the books I always come back to. Lots of love for Kel and her friends, and all the messes she gets into.
"Love Tammy and Kel is one of my fave characters!"
Can't help but love Tamora Pierce and all of her writings. From Alanna to Aly all of her female characters are amazing and vastly different. In the Lioness Rampant we have a female knight who proves women can do all that her male counter parts can do and more. In The Immortals we have the wild mage who speaks to animals, shape shifts and learns about her magical abilities. Now in The Protector of the Small we have Kel, a young woman trying to prove she can be the next female knight after Lady Alanna and she is a wonderful character that Tamora created who stands up to bullies in all forms and protects those who can't protect themselves. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
"Great story, okay performance"
Really awesome storyline.
Nealan of Queenscove will always be my favorite. I love the relationship he has with Kel, where they have each other's backs no matter what.
This is the one thing I didn't like. Yes, Bernadette Dunne did a good job differentiating the characters from one another. However, I didn't enjoy the voice she used for Kel. It was kind of nasally and I didn't think it would be the kind of voice that a girl between the ages of 14 and 18 would have. That could just be a personal preference.
Yes, but unfortunately I couldn't. As with any audiobook, it was simply too long.
It's a really good story, with a really strong female protagonist..2002 Mercedes-Benz C240 Q&A

This year, open source ad agency Victor & Spoils did a suitably Yuletide take on it.At Christmas time we really could not leave out our little Chihuahua, so he had a couple of little presents of his own under the tree. He's like my youngest child after all. One present was a little cuddly toy with a squeaker that my husband bought with the kids. Although this looked nice, I would never have personally bought it for him as he has a reputation for being a strong chewer and destroying toys very quickly. This one lasted about a day, so my point was proven completely.
However, the present I chose for him was one I came across in our local pet shop. It features a ten centimetre by 4 cm bacon flavoured nylabone which is a durable bone shaped chew toy made out of nylon, which seems to be pretty indestructible compared to other toys. I think this is a fair description.
To put this into context, anyone who owns a dog that chews recommends the Kong series of toys. I have even had to replace Murphys Kong toys because he somehow manages to keep chewing into the rubber in the exact same place which eventually causes it to look like small bits are going to start coming off. This is the point for me the toy goes in the bin, as because he is a toy breed, he is liable to choke on this sort of thing.
However, the nylabone has been chewed an awful lot since we bought it. This has just got very small indentations around the ends of the bone. These are so insignificant you have to look extremely closely to see any marks at all.
The toy bone then has holes in the ends, through which a strong rope has been threaded and twisted around the bone, and then knotted at each end. This is the part of the toy that worried me as he is notorious for going for a weak point, and once he finds it he is like a terrier and doesn't give up till the toy is dead. I notice here although he has caught the odd thread and pulled them a bit looser, because the rope is made of so many threads of cotton, it is actually pretty hard for him to do, and so the damage to the toy is barely noticeable. This to me is the mark of a good toy for a dog who chews. Anyone who has one would know that this toy would not have survived to new years eve let alone still be looking like new a couple more weeks later.
The toy is a fairly new addition to the range of nylabone dog toys. I had not seen this for sale in my pet shop before December, and when I looked on amazon you couldn't purchase it then either although it is now available at a cost of £7.95. I paid around a pound less than this for it.
We let the dog play with this on his own in his crate when we are out, or we use it to play tug a war or fetch with him in the house. Although it is advertised as being for small dogs rather than toy dogs (ie Westie size rather than chihuhua/yorkshire terrier size) we have found that there is no reason why this is not suitable for our dog. He perhaps finds it a little harder to get the actual bone in his mouth and grabs it more by the rope, but he has found it very entertaining and he will search for it. If I put it on my coffee table he will go on his hind legs and pinch it off the table to play with.
The rope and bone are meant to be good for cleaning his teeth as he is chewing on them, and I have to say, either Murphy is suddenly growing up and has stopped fancying chewing all the kids toys when he comes across them, or he actually finds that this is more preferable to chewing on a piece of a plastic toy. He's barely chewed anything else since we got this toy which really pleases me as it starts getting expensive.
I would say I thought that this was a little highly priced when I first spotted it, but I liked the look of it, and thought it would be entertaining for my dog, and I am delighted by how durable it is proving to be. It is not often I would recommend a product within a few weeks of it being used like this, but in this case, I know my dog has only ever had one toy longer than a few days (apart from his early puppy days when he was not strong enough to combine sharp teeth with a pulling action). That toy is the Kong. And this toy is equally impressive and entertaining for my pet, so it gets 5 stars.The 2014 U.S. Open is underway in New York City.
The top-ranked woman in tennis, veteran Serena Williams, takes the court Tuesday evening against fellow American Taylor Townsend, 14 years her junior.
With a season of highs and lows, Williams has very high hopes for this year's final grand slam, "CBS This Morning" co-host Norah O'Donnell reports.
Serena Williams
Serena Williams, one of two famous tennis sisters, has been ranked number one in singles on five separate occasions
"I am feeling really good," Williams told CBS News.
Williams is calm, cool and confident ahead of this year's grand slam. She won the last two U.S. Opens and hopes to take home the crown this year.
"It would be really amazing," Williams said. "It's such a tough field this year though so I don't know, but I do know it would be an unbelievable feeling for me."
A third win for the star is in no way a guaranteed win, considering she failed to reach even the quarterfinals in any grand slam this.
"No, it wasn't--I couldn't really, there was no real answer to that," Williams said. "I couldn't really find out exactly what it was, which is one thing that was a little frustrating but at the same time...I was really, really, really, really sick."
Williams said it was "no bueno" and that she never wants to feel like that again.
"I'm much better now," she said. "I've been better since then. I took a lot of time off after that and I actually didn't leave the bed after about a week and a half...but then I was able to recover after that."
A string of recent victories has proven she's squarely back in fighting shape.
Williams is excited to once again be seeded No. 1 at this year's open, deemed by some as the sport's greatest player.
"It's just working hard I think, and really also enjoying yourself," Williams said. "For me I think you have to -- whether if you're playing the world's greatest tennis player or any other sport -- I think you have to enjoy it."
As Williams prepares to defend her women's championship, the men's division seems to be very much up in the air with last year's winner Rafael Nadal pulling out due to a wrist injury.

"I haven't spoken to him but obviously I wish him really well, and he's so competitive and he's so amazing. He'll be back next year," Williams said.
As for calling the player her fellow "booty brother," she said it's "for obvious reasons. We can all figure that one out."
At age 32, a good decade older than a lot of her competitors, Williams is still having a great time playing the game. And despite having 17 grand slam titles already under her belt, she has no plans to cede the court anytime soon.
."
As far as retiring goes, Williams said, "I know myself that I probably will do that but it's not time yet. It's just not time."Search

( പി . കുഞ്ഞിരാമന് നായര് )P. Kunhiraman Nair, also known as Mahakavi P, was a renowned Malayalam poet whose works romanticized the natural beauty of his home state of Kerala in southern India and juxtaposed it with the hard realities of his life and times..
It seems, poetry is of two types; or I felt it so. One which can be argued and substantiated as a poem but may not seem a poem in reading. Second which seems to be a poem in reading but you can argue and find many defects in it. It is clear from the above description that, the first one is the poem of intellect and the other, the poem of heart. The first type becomes noteworthy because of its depth of ideas and technical grandeur. While the other one entices us with its charm and simplicity of feelings. A fun in literary history is that, though many criticise at times that the former type are not poets, none dare to deplore them. Sri Harshan and Alexander Pope are such slandered poets. Ulloor and Sankarakuruppu were two poets from Malayalam Literature subject to this external antithesis.
Examples for the latter kind include Jayadevan, Shelley, Keats, Heine etc. If you are asked to name counterparts from Malayalam, any one will pronounce P. Kunhiraman Nair and Changampuzha. Though they are at both ends in their life style and ideas, an internal unity is clearly visible. In their heart's feelings and poetic talent, there are no other poets in Malayalam, who keep such a similarity. More over none doubts their poetic artistry. What is that unique quality which makes the poet the ruler of the minds of all people (jana gana mana adhinayaka) and gives him universal acceptance? It is related to heart. But is that alone steel their hearts in the very first reading of a poem? No. Though the infinite world of emotions is the expanse for poetry, only a few of such special moods are capable of moving the heart in a moment. The ancients called this power of words to move heart, sweetness. It is told that, Vipralambha Sringaram and Karunam are the two Rasas which sweeten the heart and make it more gentle. Vipralambha Sringaram is the temporary misfortune of love and Karunam is the permanent loss of love. Temporary separation is sadness but with a tinge of sweet-anxiety because there lies the hope and promise of reunion. Permanent loss foster deep sorrow. It is not only for persons that we feel anxiety, hope and and pain of separation, but also for abstract ideals and situations. There are some poets for whom the distress from the feelings of pain for the lost, passion for the unattainable, satisfaction for the gained etc. become the inescapable part of their personality. We can call them romantics. They are not mere romantics but extreme romantics. There are no other poems which dissolve human heart in such sweetness than their sad songs. There may be factual defects and technical demerits in their poems, but, they will make your heart flutter in the sea of feelings in a moment. Changampuzha and Kunhiraman Nair hail from this class. Changampuzha's poems are familiar in nature. Kunhiraman Nair conquers you in his first foray. “Anayukillini divya pranayapoo nilavoli Anayukillabhirama vasntha rathri! Kulirunnu manamente kudililum priyasakhi, Kuzhaloothumazhakinte nizhal kanumo? Nilavilakkile thiri vilarippoi orukkia Malarmala sakhee vadi karinhupoi. Kalabhavum verutheyay manassiruthi nhan kachi- kkurukki vachoru palin madhuram poyee, panimathikoppam ha ha hrudaya choranu varan karuthia puthu vennaniram pakarnnu akamazhinhethu thadillathikayodida koodi Mukiloli niran mama shyama sundaran!” (Pranaya Pratheeksha) But in Changampuzha melancholy, anxiety, hope etc. spurt around persons alone. He loved human beings only. As far as Changampuzha is concerned human beings mean women. It never meant men. But Kunhiraman Nair never placed human beings as the core of his poems. His topic of love is the beauteous culture of a lost society. Blending all that is eternal and beautiful in Kerala's rustic life and India's ancient thought, he envisages an auspicious and idealistic living culture which is found nowhere in the three worlds. That is Kalidasa's Alaka for Kunhiraman Nair. As that world is pious he is a devotee; as that is blessed with nature's gift he praises the beauty of nature. That is something lost. The solitary grief of his life. Since the modern machine culture kills the re-emergence of that lost culture, he is against it. He hurls vehement curses on the contemporary life. The propitious light which alleviates his melancholic angst is the hope that the bygone rich culture will rise again some day. How can the works of a poet having intense love for such a transcendental state which is abstract, indirect and imaginary, be like Changampuzha's songs of human love. Yet, for his poems with abstract and impersonal love, he finds ample images and symbols concrete, direct and sensory. So there is always vitality in his poems. See how his love for ancient songs of Kerala turns to the depiction of Pulluva girl. How much abstract that love for ancient art is, the Pulluva girl takes it to a material level. To understand how the abstractness of subject intertwines with the concreteness of poetic talent, we can read the quoted lines below from P.'s poem Pulluvapenkodi “Anthithan puzhakare ninningu Vannirangum sasikala pole nee, Anandacharithavolamekuken- Ganakavya madhugruha nayike! Jeevarakta sirayil mulappalin- Thoovamruthathinoppam kalaruvan Petta nadu patippicha pattuka- lettu patuken gramina kanyake” First four lines is the simple depiction of the beautiful ancient rustic song which quivers poet's soul with delight. While the next four lines present an apparent and expanded picture. Thus he never forget to anchor his abstract imaginations in corporeal observations. So I am happy to say that his poems are generally appreciable. Here are some examples: In the poem 'Soundarya devata'(goddess of beauty), he speaks about the loss of a fine sensation so divine and pure which was there in his heart once. As usual the beginning of the poem is abstract and indistinct- “Athramel prananum prananai ninnu nee Yatra parayathe poyathuchithamo? Vinnil velichamezhuthi ninneedumo Kanniloru kurikoodi Kshanaprabhe? But by depicting this abstract image as a village girl the poet makes it distinct and perceptible. “Sreemal kanaka kathirmala chooduma- Sreedevithan sparsametta pulthumbukal grama soundaryam velippettu ninnitha- Shyamala gathrayam Karshaka balayil however there are readers who dislike his poems. Their dislike is not about its power to move hearts. No one can make such a complaint. Heart was not at all a criterion for their evaluation. The poet's point of view was their target of reproach. Is it right in the part of the poet to deride the glories of the present by becoming the ambassador for a bygone culture? What many decays are not there in that ancient culture which the poet praises? Then isn't the poet presenting an imperfect perspective of present as well as of past? Thus go the concerns. Though such anxieties arise from a mind which doesn't know what poetry is, we should face them with due respect and give reply. Whatever one render through words with a touching style, giving life to his finer sensations, is poetry. Such poetry may have many defects, factual or scientific. But that doesn't mean it is not poem. The honesty of the fine sensation of the poem is pivotal to its veracity. It is because of this truth Kunhiraman Nair's praise for the past and censure for the present becomes poetic. There may be none who never felt that contemporary world is filled with many wretchedness and that many of the virtues of the past are lost. Then we have to concede the hidden tendency of our mind to accept the old and reject the new. It is true that the commoner who are subject to the pressures of life cannot grasp its value. Poet expresses, in his soul's voice, those moods which are forgotten, defied, ignored and silenced. Kunhiraman Nair has done that much only. His perspective is firm in the veracity of the mood. That is enough. Never yearn for objective truths in poem. When we search for objective truth in poems our view become pointless. Looking with a blunt view Kunhiraman Nair is old fashioned and against the whole modern culture. At this angle he is against modern facilities, English, western culture and technological progress. But this is not the meaning of Kunhiraman Nair's poem. To find the real expressive meaning of the poem we have to be of a sharp view. Then we must have to admit that Kunhiraman Nair is a philanthropist. He is untiringly imparting the message that, human life should be simple, relations inartificial, human love inspired of aesthetics in order to dispel falsehood and intricacies of life. His love for the past and satisfaction for the present bestowed him with the fine sensual delights to establish this message in his heart. How much soever you disagree with his perspective and message, your heart is in his possession after reading his poem. That itself is his poetic success. He proved that imagination and truth of the sense are the qualities which preserve poetry. While other poets parade social issues and mental contradictions in poem, Kunhiraman Nair took no heed of it. He is like an ascetic who has done his pilgrimage of the heart earlier and found out the real place where his poetic deity is installed. So he is in meditation watching the bloomed face of his deity alone. While Mango tree, jack-tree and banyan tree deride the shadeless coconut tree, this perky coconut tree lifts its head up with proud thought of its elixir bowls in the head. Whatever be the temptations, his prayer is this: Mattivaykolle Manohara Narthaki Madhuryamoorumee mayava guntanam Nerthoree manjani moodupadathe nee Mattayka mattayka chempaneer pushpame. Since it is so mellifluous it is better to quote than describe. “Orayiram vasanthagaloppame greeshma rathriyil Vannurangi karupputta kadakkan koniludave Marthyatmavin mauna mudrarasa leenangulikku mel Devasundarimar vannu pirannengo maranju poi Unarnnu Martha chithathilurangum divya sourabham Therichu kalveppil ninnumetho gandharva geethikal Thurannu katti Pintantamoronnum balaleelaya Olichirikkunna poornabrahmanda nidhikukbhavum Prachanna roopamametho Viswaroopa mahatbhutham poornathvathil Chalanamayi nada thala layangalai....” I quoted it so elaborate not to show the description which has the poetic beauty of a kathakali scene. This is not so a simple deal. I feel in it a soul reaching its realisation after groping through the temptations. Sometimes I feel the poem is brimmed with sorrow of losing realisation. He is searching it again and again at the backstage. Greenish painted faces and reddish drawn eyes have gone from there. Only wrinkled betel leaves are scattered. In that void the poet ruminates- “Irunizhal neelunnu venpular charthilokkeyum Ethu vanilolichu nee vidarum thoovelichame!” The poem continues, cursing the eyes which cannot see the light that played with him and then praying for light. Like many other poems of Kunhiraman Nair, this poem too hasn't got the luck to end where it should end. We can get an idea of the poet's gradual growth, as these three poems were written in three different times- the beginning of his poetic career, most praised period and during the time of his 60th birthday. Yet there may arise a misapprehension that the topic of Kunhiraman Nair is always never ending pain of his own heart. In a sense it is true. But in that pain lies the Indian culture and the ruins it suffered from time to time. His pen has a magic expertise in making the social misery his personal pain. While thirsting for freedom, worrying over the poor men's life standard, seeing the hard earned freedom wasted, youth trying to place the foreign heads on their shoulders, Kunhiraman Nair's heart aches. It is too little to say Kunhiraman Nair is a nationalist. He is boundlessly fond of anything and everything pertaining to Kerala and India. It is deeply stamped in his heart that, everything, from Kanyakumari to Himalaya, Guruvayur to Vrindavan, Pulluva song to Upanishad hymns is one and the same. Just like the lava from a volcanic eruption contains many valuable minerals of the earth, Kunhiraman Nair's poem is rich with nationalistic elements. He considers any attack against the national culture as an attack against his own heart. The poem 'Narabali'(human sacrifice), written in the backdrop of Chinese and Pak attack, reveals everything stated above. As far as a poet is concerned how does he say is as important as what does he say. If imagery is the language of poet, Kunhiraman Nair is so affluent to squander. I think this extravagance has stolen some strength out of his poetry, which deserved to be much stronger. His power of imagination is like a never emptied quiver. But, even after the prey has fallen he covers it with his shower of arrows making it difficult to find the prey. If his rich poetic skill were a little thrifty, how strong might have been those poems. The label 'devotional poet' befell on Kunhiraman Nair is so popular that it cannot be ignored. I am not at all happy with this label. His poetic talent is a decorous mix of devotion and desire. Moreover, is it right to categorise as devotional poet, adventurous poet etc? How will it feel if we call Kalidasa an erotic poet, Bhavabhoothi a compassionate poet? Let us withdraw from our effort to drag him up to the post of Mahakavi. Not because that what is dragged will slip and come down. We were satisfied to call even Valmiki, a Poet. Kunhiraman Nair's face will stand out in any crowd. Whatever turmoil is there, his voice will reach you singled out and clear to move your heart. Even his critics cannot negate it. What else an artist, a poet can desire for?Poetry formed his main genre of work (it isn't exactly known how many poems he penned during his half-a-decade classical dance-drama of his region.Kunhiraman Nair was an award winner of both the Kerala Sahithya Akademi and the Central Sahitya Akademi.His selected works: Kaliyachhan (Oriental Dance teacher, 1954) Onassadya (Onam Feast, 1960)Pookkalam (spring, 1964) Thaamarathoni (Lotus Boat, 1966) Vasantholsavam (Spring Festival, 1972)Chilamboli (Tinkling of the Anklet Bells, 1974) Ratholsavam (Chariot Festival - 2 volumes, 1978)Thamarathen ( Honey of theLotus,1983)Indira,Chaaithraraksha,Nirmala,Ramabai,VeerapratinhRangamandapam (StageCanopy,1956)Upaasana (Worship,1958),Swapnasanchari,Poonilaavu,Chandramandalam,VichaaravibhaatamSatyaraksha ,Kaviyude kalpadukal(Footprints of poet),Ennethirayunna njan(I searching myself),Nithyakanyakaye thedi (Searching for nityakanyaka).

February 23 - March 1, 2009
Welcome back to the Tapers' Section, as we close out February with some excellent music spanning the Grateful Dead's first decade.
Our first selection today is from 2/23/66, a studio rehearsal that features some cool jams that form the bread of a Jam>Good Lovin' Jam>Jam sandwich. It's one of those neat little discoveries that was buried deep within the vault, and that's our pleasure to present here today.
Next we have a couple of selections from the first night of the famed Fillmore West 1969 run, from 2/27/69, specifically Good Morning Little Schoolgirl and That's It For The Other One. There was so much great music played over these four nights that we could spend hours listening to this run. In fact, we often do here at the Tapers' Section HQ. Oh, also from that run is this excellent Cosmic Charlie from 3/1/69. Tasty stuff.
We now have a little musical interlude from 2/28/73 in Salt Lake City, a standalone He's Gone, from the superb Dick's Picks Vol. 28, which consists of two concerts (2/26&28/73) filled with stellar early 1973 Grateful Dead.
The week will wrap up with the two big jams from 2/24/74 at Winterland, Dark Star>Morning Dew and Sugar Magnolia>Not Fade Away>GDTRFB>Not Fade Away, Baby Blue. This three night run of shows to start 1974 is excellent throughout, almost on the level of the three nights at Winterland in November, 1973. Here's to hoping February 1974 gets the same treatment as November 1973 someday...
We'll look forward to seeing you next week here at the Tapers' Section as we get rolling into March.

This weeks music includes one of the sets recorded on one of the tapes my old guitar mentor (Scot Lacy or "Liquid Lacy") gave to me. The tapes were meant to introduce me to the Dead and to take me to new places where I could learn and grow as a guitarist. The tapes worked and heavily influenced my playing.
We haven't finished with the technichal part (My Uncle Danny Fincher is here visiting - he's a professional sound man who knows and has worked with EVERYONE including Hendrix and B.B. King and such), but soon folks will get to hear ME (known as Eric Finch) playing LIVE in Tennessee (TOTAL Redneck bar) where I jammed out a quick, "Franklin's Tower" (for the most anti-hippie audience immaginable) that brings you the Grateful Dead experience that you normally get from a, "Morning Dew" like this one we're listening to this week. This "Morning Dew" still influences my playing and I REALLY loved listening to it again and remembering the HIGH TIMES on the Boardwalk in San Diego when I met the strangest person I have ever met. Straight out of the Twilight Zone, Liquid Lacy materialized from the purple haze and introduced me to the Dead and forever shaped the way that I would persue and play music. Now that he's no longer with us I'm proud to have used a lick we learned together which got me a resounding round of applause from hardcore Christians. The audience participation was AMAZING!!!
Deadheads - watch for me posting places where you can download free Dead covers and original tunes from a Deadhead singer/songwriter with a lifetime of Deadhead experiences. Geez - my Dad even played (trumpet) for George Bush Jr. . . . we really get around. Let's keep the music alive!!!
DEADHEADS - the next generation man!!!
The last part of the jam sonds like "It Hurts me Too" to me, which is one of the sweetest blues songs the band ever did with superb simplicity that is uniquely Dead!
Thanks for this litte snippet of the beginning!
The week will wrap up with the two big jams from 2/24/74 at Winterland, Dark Star>Morning Dew and Sugar Magnolia>Not Fade Away>GDTRFB>Not Fade Away, Baby Blue.
so sweet and tender and tasty Jerry wow. TY
round and round
This is what it was ALL about!!! LONG LIVE THE GRATEFUL DEAD!!!

Ahhh....Winterland Feb. '74
Get the wheels turning, Dave. Theres money too be spent on this side.
I saw Dark Star Orchestra do it at the Great American Music Hall back in '07 and it's got one of the best playlists of any dead show, ever. I mean, Jack Straw, China->Rider, Candyman, full Weather Report Suite (into Row Jimmy?!), the centerpiece Darkstar->Morning Dew and then more. I have mp3s of the soundboard I downloaded from somewhere (ahem) but an official. Rhino-ized release would be very welcome.
I know that there does seem to be a considerable amount of emphasis on shows before 1979, in all the releases, but that's just a matter of demographics and marketing. The people that listen to the 60s and 70s are in their 50s and 60s. Can't market to them for many more years, while the young'uns that followed the 80s and 90s Dead will probably still be around for awhile, and probably haven't maxed out their income potential either.
Think about it.
Let me first say that the "tapers section" is a very unique piece of the history documenting the band's recorded history. However it is like the Grateful Dead didn't exist after 1974. I don't know whether the powers that be didn't like Brent...or don't think their later years are worthy...I don't know what the problem is. I know the high points were not as frequent as the 67 - 74 period, but there were still a lot of great performances even up to the end. C'mon David give Brent & Vince their due...let's hear some 79 to 95 stuff. Especially 88 to 95.
Wow, good catch! 5/28/77 is a great show, made famous by a MONSTER Sugaree.
David, I'd love to hear why 5/12/77 never enters into the release discussion (no SBD circulates, no solid AUD circulates, and the portion you have played here, including a Comes a Time, is great)
I just listened to the second set (Sugar Magnolia>Not Fade Away>GTRFB>Not Fade Away, Baby Blue) and I had this set on the back of the audio tape I had . . . except Lacy left out the Sugar Magnolia. I think I remember him apologising for that.
This is a major part of what I was listening to when I first got serious about guitar and was dosing heavily . . . nearly 20 years ago. It was an intense time of deep reflection.The coach has shuffled more decks this year than there are on all the tables in Vegas, and the Rangers still need a deal to find a true ace center.
John Tortorella can only coach ’em if he’s got ’em. With 28 games and likely at least one round of playoffs to go without a true No. 1, he says it’s also about time Marian Gaborik started looking out for No. 1.
“He’s had a mindset of sometimes trying to make an extra play or wait for people to make an extra play,” Tortorella said before the Rangers’ 3-2 loss to the revived Devils at the Garden. “I like to see him determine the play by taking pucks to the net, trying to beat people wide.
“You gain the zone and take bad angle shots, a lot of offense comes off that.”
The Rangers’ goals came from a combined angle of about 40 degrees. They were scored by Vinnie Prospal, who played his first game after almost two-thirds of the season with a right knee injury, and Ryan Callahan, who is two games returned from missing almost a quarter of the season with a broken hand.
They weren’t scored by Gaborik, back since Nov. 11 from a shoulder separation. He contributed only a secondary assist on Prospal’s 5-on-3 goal, leaving the star’s goal total from the past six games at one, his point total at four and his shot total at 14.
The Rangers have played too well in the last three games to have just one point. After Henrik Lundqvist went for six for seven in Tuesday’s 4-3 shootout loss to Pittsburgh, it was a stretch for Tortorella to suggest last night goaltending has been the consistent culprit in this winless streak.
One culprit, however, is Gaborik, the guy who is supposed to be stretching the opposition in the neutral zone, but is not doing it enough.
Tuesday night, Gaborik left the Penguins’ Tyler Kennedy in the dust at center, creating a rebound that Brandon Dubinsky knocked out of the air to Artem Anisimov. Anisimov gave the Rangers a 2-0 lead that had great promise of growing until it didn’t.
The Rangers blew the lead. Last night they almost came back. Whatever. Both times they wound up a goal short, largely because their once-and-hopefully-again star didn’t do enough.
“At times tonight Gabby had some really good battle to him,” Tortorella said. “It needs to be consistent.”
Gaborkik, gone to off-limits places when the media gained locker room entrance, hasn’t been gabby about his struggles. This, however, can be said with certainty: If the idea of a Rangers playoff run is to have any legs, Gaborik has to better use his.
Any chance of the Rangers being a strong Stanley Cup contender pivots on getting a true No. 1 pivot, because Gaborik, at his best, can come from behind the play as well as lead it. But today, he still is sitting on 16 goals, 10 of which have been scored in three games against three of the NHL’s worst teams, the Islanders, Oilers and Leafs.
The give-and-go on the Rangers’ No. 1 line largely has gotten up and left. Thus the returning Prospal instantly was put on a line with Gaborik and rookie Derek Stepan, largely because Prospal scored 58 points in 75 games last season in helping Gaborik score 42 goals in 76.
“I don’t try to be a genius,” Tortorella said. “[I] want to see if it can work.”
He has tried everything to get Gaborik going, making it painfully clear the team’s best player has to do that for himself.Appositives

The Fairfax County Economic Development Authority says companies it worked with in the third quarter on expansions or relocations are adding 1,146 jobs.
Some of the 41 companies the EDA worked with during the quarter hired just a handful of people, but there were significant expansions as well.
The largest came from CACI International Inc, which increased its Fairfax payrolls by 202 jobs. AppAssure Software Inc. expanded its workforce in Reston by 150 positions. Maximus Inc. added 90 jobs at its Tysons Corner location. And XO Communications LLC created 80 jobs in Herndon.
“Companies in a range of technology and professional services sectors continue to create jobs in Fairfax County and add to the county’s economic diversity and stability, which boosts the commercial tax base and the quality of life that residents enjoy here,” said the authority's CEO, Jerry Gordon.
While most of the new jobs came from companies with existing operations in Fairfax County, there were a also few new companies. Secure Mission Solutions Inc. is adding 50 jobs in Fairfax. Oceus Networks Inc. is adding 40 jobs in Reston.
The numbers do not include Bechtel Corp.'s plans to move 625 jobs from Frederick, Md., to Reston Town Center, an announcement made in November.Soaps Boards

Is it me or does anyone else think that the new Billy would have been more appropriate as a replacement for Stitch? I think he looks, sounds and even has the mannerisms as Stitch, in fact the first day he was on I heard his voice and was surprised to see a new actor. He could be his stand-in, the only differences I see are that he's shorter and has longer hair. Nothing against his acting, just wondering if anyone else thought this besides me...there will never be another Billy Miller for me, but I have a hard time accepting when the actors look so similar to each other. Just asking...
No it isn't just you. I saw and heard a resemblance between Stitch and new Billy. I also thought Father Todd and Stitch had similarities. They should have had Stitch be Paul's long lost son.

Gender Equality CopHutchings Career Center Students Receive Nursing Pins | Business
Hutchings Career Center held its first Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) pinning ceremony on Tuesday, December 18. Ten students received CNA pins during the ceremony. The students received dual enrollment instruction and credit through a partnership between the District and Central Georgia Technical College.
The pinning ceremony was the culmination of the students' initial journey into the healthcare profession. The ceremony signified the students' completion of the CNA program and served as a rite of passage for junior nursing students transitioning into their final years of high school.
Each student that has successfully completed the CNA coursework and clinical hours received a pin. They are also eligible to take the Georgia CNA exam this spring.
During the ceremony, students were pinned by a parent, grandparent, or friend. Regardless of their career path, the pins will represent where the students first embarked on their professional journey.Welcome to UpFront Guitars! It's a relief to finally have some decent Spring weather, and despite the temptation to go out and play, we're hard at work getting several new models and product lines up on our website. We've recently gotten some very cool new products, and we'll be bringing on more help at UpFront to improve the accuracy and timeliness of our website stock.
Since 2010, UpFront guitars has been committed to being your informative and professional source for high quality guitars and accessories. We carry North American made products from companies like G&L, Breedlove, Godin, Traynor, Emerson Custom, and Knaggs. We specifically focus on just a few selected brands that offer exceptional value for the gigging performer, serious hobbyist, or player looking to take their gear up a notch. By being focused, it also means that we keep a good stock on hand, and really know the product. and talk to someone who really cares. At UpFront Guitars we offer guitars made by craftsmen, not accountants.
We accept Paypal, MC, Discover, Visa, or call us at 508-686-6697 or if busy 508-657-1817
So What's New At UpFront Guitars?
The Solodallas Schaffer Replica - Funny name, but an interesting an unique pedal that is essentially the "Sound of AC/DC." Based on the 1970's Schaffer wireless transmitter used by Angus Young, the Solodallas pedal replicates the harmonic complexity and expansive tones so beloved by the mega-bands of the late 70's. Hard to keep in stock but worth the wait, the Solodallas pedal is perfect for blues, classic rock and roots players.
Knaggs - We recently received our first two Severn guitars with 12" radius fingerboards and medium frets. Compared to the standard narrower fret 9" radius Severn guitars, these guitars are in our minds what the Severn should be. These are arguably the most flexible guitars of the Knaggs line, perfect for almost any style of music, and definitely worth checking out. Also in the shop is a Knaggs Steve Steven's Signature model, serial number #40 out of a limited run of 100. More traditional in execution than the typical Knaggs, we think of the Steve Steven's Signature as about the best Les Paul you can buy.
David Allen Pickups - Many models now in stock for Strat, Tele, and Humbucker. David Allen makes some "vintage inspired" pickups but does not restrict himself to only replicating vintage construction. He's chasing "the tone" by using high quality materials and techniques without being hemmed in by the "replica" moniker. The result is great sound in both vintage styles and more modern flavors. David Allen is getting quite a following with top Nashville and session players, and we have not tried a David Allen pickup that we didn't like.
G&L - New guitars coming in from G&L every month and we've got some pretty neat items on the way or on the shelves.
All about the bass - Many of our favorite models now in stock: M-2500, L-2000, SB-2, LB-100, in alder, swamp ash and pine. We keep saying it, but pine works great for bass guitars, with smooth highs and clear, clean lows. G&L makes excellent bass guitars with models that appeal to both purists and progressive players.
G&L "Original Leo Spec" ASAT - For optimal sound, weight and comfort, the original ASAT guitar was designed to have a 1.65" thick body. Leo being Leo, he was trying improve on the Tele, not just copy it. However sometime in the 90's G&L went back to original Fender Tele thickness of 1.78". The "Original Leo Spec" thinner body is now available as a no-cost option on any ASAT. Besides saving about a third of a pound, it's more comfortable, especially when combined with a rear body contour. We'll have some in stock by May, and they are available for custom orders now.
G&L Fallout - One of G&L's most successful new models, the Fallout takes the lightweight SC-2 body and drops in their own excellent P-90 neck pickup and a Seymour Duncan JB bridge pickup. It's a potent rock machine that can range from smooth jazzy tones, to smoky blues, to scorching rock. An affordable USA guitar that won't sound like all your other guitars, and worth a look.
Emerson Custom Guitars - Emerson keeps upgrading their product line, and besides introducing their own super tight tolerance CTS potentiometers in 2014, they've just announced their own made in USA paper-in-oil capacitor. This is not "New Old Stock" but "New Stock" made just for Emerson. They worked many months with a US manufacturer, and these high quality components will allow Emerson to control the quality of their materials, and not be subject to the whims of surplus NOS inventory. We have the new models in stock now, and will be reducing prices on the older NOS capacitor kits.
Breedlove Guitars - A paperwork glitch at the Breedlove factory resulted in our order being misplaced, but more Breedlove guitars are now on the way! Coming soon to UpFront Guitars will be a couple of the Breedlove Legacy series of guitars. The Legacy line is the next step up from the USA Premier line and feature upgraded appointments, woods, and finishes. We've got a couple great guitars on order, a Cocobolo Legacy Dreadnought, and a Maple Legacy Jumbo. Both these guitars feature beautiful burst finishes, and the balanced expertly crafted tone that is the Breedlove signature. Also in the pipeline is a Premier Dreadnought Mahogany and a Rosewood Laminate Solo Concert.
Godin - Godin is always busy, and has several new models for 2015. Here's a quick sample of what we liked and susequently put on order:
Session Ltd - Godin has taken the popular Session guitar, contoured the body, made it a little thinner to reduce the weight, and dropped in a Seymour Duncan SH-11 pickup in the bridge instead of the standard Godin humbucker. They look about twice the money, but are just a small premium over the standard Session. These also come in some very nice metallic finishes. We've now got a gold metallic model in stock, and it's real sharp.
Session Custom '59 - Think of this as a "Godin Bluesboy" and you get the picture. But Godin switched to the Seymour Duncan '59 in the neck to provide a little more attack and a better tonal match to their Alnico bridge pickup. Good idea, and one just arrived
Core CT - We love the Godin Core line, and for 2015 Godin added a carved top, and chambered Spanish Cedar back to help keep the weight down. Spanish Cedar is really a form of mahogany, but it's typically lighter in weight than other varieties. These guitars still play an feel like the originals, but look better and weigh in the comfortable mid-seven pound range. At the moment they are only in Black and Sunburst, but I don't imagine that lasting.
Traynor/Yorkville Sound - To go with our expanded line of G&L bass guitars, we're going to carry more bass amps. First up is their Small Block bass combo amps. These are "cube" type amps that combine 200 watts of Class D power and a single 15" speaker with tweeter. At only 31 pounds, they are perfect for practice or clubs. They also feature an XLR out when you need a little help for larger venues. Our first one sold out in about 24 hours and we're now waiting for a couple more. We're giving the Hughes and Kettner line some thought too. While they don't conform to our "North America" ethos, they do offer tremendous flexibility for players who want both great cleans and huge crunch tones.
Rio Grande Pickups - It’s hard to imagine a pickup that Rio Grande doesn’t make (or won’t make). We’ve got a great selection in stock a all times and really like their Dirty Harry line of single coils for Strat and Tele guitars. Built like a P-90, they give guitarists a great way to getter fatter, richer rock tones without losing the single coil edge. There is a Dirty Harry humbucker too that splits like a real single coil.
UpFront Guitars Cables - Our guitar cables are getting a makeover with a nicer, silkier feeling tweed covering. And don’t forget our UpFront Evidence Audio patch cables. Solid core is sonically better, and these cables do make a difference. You can spend less, but you’ll only have to buy these cables once, and you’ll sound better.We offer horse training, boarding, breeding, and farrier services.

It looks like we might have another celebrity bump watch to follow soon!
It was only last month that hot couple Jessica Biel and Justin Timberlake denied the rumors that the actress was pregnant, but it looks like those rumors just won’t die down! There’s a new blind item making its way around the nets that suggest Jessica might in fact be expecting a little Timberlake in her oven!
According to the blind item, the couple want to hold off announcing their pregnancy until April. Jess and Justin also just announced their engagement and have a wedding in the works. Hmm… we wonder which one will come first: marriage or the baby carriage!
What do you think? Will we be getting a pregnancy announcement from Jessica soon? And do you think Justin will be a good dad?Your browser does not support iframes.

Nestled in the former Goodfellas Restaurant space at 7455 Melrose Avenue, and neighboring iconic hangouts such as Village Idiot and Darkroom, Cellar 55 offers Angelenos friendly open access to an extensive, affordable wine list and delectable Italian-American fusion plates. Grand opening specials, exclusive to Facebook fans and Twitter followers, will be announced through mid-October while weeknight specials and promotions will continue regularly.
One of Cellar 55’s greatest assets is its hidden back patio. Enter the restaurant and walk past the front piano, colorful paintings and the inviting bar to venture to the back patio and feel as though you’ve entered a secret Mediterranean-style outdoor living room. Ornate candles, comfortable throw pillows and lounge seating creates unsurpassed outdoor ambiance, ideal for an afternoon sangria, intimate fete or romantic wine date.
Cuisine ranges from Italian favorites to the whimsical
Cellar 55 offers a hearty menu of comfort food favorites, ranging from the classic such as chicken parmesan to the fun with beef sliders to the borderline eccentric with the “golden eye” pizza (adorned with sunny-side up eggs). For the sweet-toothed, Cellar 55 delves into the gastronomically curious with desserts like purple yam ice cream and battered PB&J. For special events, Cellar 55 can customize a menu for in-house celebrations or cater directly on-site.
Cellar 55 owners and brother-sister team, Suzy and Mike Mnatsakanyan, also of the former Goodfellas Restaurant on Melrose, wanted to create an environment which better matched their personal tastes in ambiance, décor and food/wine offerings.
“I like to pull from different genres of cuisine when it comes to my cooking,” says Executive Chef Suzy Mnatsakanyan. “I enjoy European flavors but also appreciate simplicity and classic favorites. Now that my brother, Mike, and I are relaunching as Cellar 55, we feel as though we have no limits and can offer something for everyone.”
Evening entertainment showcases local artists
Cellar 55 plans to use its piano in the main dining room for regular singers and performers including many local budding artists. Patrons are urged to check Cellar 55’s website at often for a calendar of events for live performances, as well as for planned special televised viewing events and other planned promotions.

It’s a top 10 hit from [lastfm link_type=”artist_info”]Hall & Oates[/lastfm] on ‘Tickets @ 2,’ “She’s Gone.”
Hall & Oates wrote it while they were consoling each other over heart breaks. Daryl had just divorced from his wife Bryna and a New Years Eve date had stood him up.
The song was self-described by the duo “as very autobiographical. What we wrote was real, even though it was two different situations, the melody is very sad.”
The talented duo brings a combination of a folk-y approach, blended with an urban R&B side.
We’ll look for caller #9 when it plays between two and three for a pair of tickets to see the Tchaikovsky Spectacular at the Verizon Wireless Amphitheatre tomorrow night. 1-800-232-KRTH (5784).28 Simple Slow Cooker Suppers eCookbook

State Route 522 driver-safety story | Letters
“It’s got directional signs, so if they just pay attention, it will be like navigating the interstate.” (Kenmore Police Chief Cliff Sether, May 18 Reporter story)
Which a significant percentage of Washington state drivers are not competent to do either. Driver training in Washington must be a joke, because I see people every day I drive who don’t understand the rules of the road, and/or aren’t paying attention to the task of driving, or are simply and obviously unqualified to drive, at least at the time they are behind the wheel. They don’t have a clue as to the concept of lane discipline — if you want to drive below the limit/safe speed, move into the #2 (slow) lane rather than coasting down the road obstructing traffic.
Keith Toepfer
The U-turns are very scary. And I wish the bridge dodgers would stop driving like they are late. You all know who you are. Flooding the community with Eastside drivers is just creating chaos.
Ginny Whited
There have been more accidents since the have put in the dividers... Coincidence? Bad idea from the start... Now I’m sure they will be lowering the speed limit to 30-35 because of the careless drivers.

Hi! Welcome to CafeMom!
Please feel free to join The CafeMom Newcomers Club!
It's a great place to get started, meet other moms like you, and find active conversations!
I hope to see you there!
I am a 39-year old mom of 2 children. Maryelise is 19 and a junior in college. Our son, Joey, died this past April at the age of 29 during a training exercise at Fort Bragg. He was preparing for his last mission before receiving his Green Beret. We are heartsick and miss him so much. I am a nurse practitioner, though I am currently not working outside of the home. I love dogs. We lost 2 of our dogs since June, but have 2 wonderful black Labrador retrievers, Squintz and Snookie. They are like children to us! I love to sew, play games on the Internet, and read. I am also a freak when it comes to my iPad and iPod. I take them with me whereever I go, along with my iPhone. For Christmas, I want some Apple stock! My husband has worked for the US Postal Service for 35 years. He will be retiring in June. We have been together for 16 years, married for 10. He was my mailman and I fell in love with him. He is a wonderful husband. My daughter is majoring in communications at Notre Dame College in Cleveland, Ohio. She is a 4.0 student. We are very proud of her. She will be getting her own apartment for senior year. She is more excited than we are! I am having some empty-nest syndrome right now and have been sewing a lot. I sew burp cloths, blankets, and bibs and donate them to local charities. I love this site because of the mixture of moms on it. I am also on the Board of Directors for The Mommies Network, which is another great non-profit Mom's group. I'm trying to think of what else there is to say about me...I went to Kent State University and Case Western Reserve University. I worked the majority of my career at University Hospitals of Cleveland, but also worked at The Cleveland Clinic and at a prison. That was one of my more interesting jobs. I volunteer my time for the Rainbow Bridge aninal site. I am a grief counselor for people who have lost their pets. I have made numerous friends from the site and am hoping to make friends from CafeMom. If I think of anything else intersting about myself, I'll be sure to add it. Oh, I love to play Wheel of Fortune on Facebook. I am addicted! Hope to meet you soon! Marianne

Already Joined? LOG INThe design business is filled with semi-professionals and those looking to find their way, but not Ellen Winkler. A leader in the design business for more than two decades, she’s a reliable leader, and accomplished designer.
Thanks for joining us, Ellen. Tell us a little bit about how you got started in interior design.
My grandmother was an excellent seamstress, so I had an inherent interest in fabrics and design. I owned and managed a workroom for several years and then enrolled in an interior design program. I went on to pass my NCIDQ (National Committee of Interior Design Qualification) and was President of the New England Chapter of the ASID (American Society of Interior Design) in 2000-2001.
New England is a wonderful place to work with design. Which classic New England features do you try and incorporate into your designs? How do you try and limit it?
I’ve found design trends in New England are influenced by several factors, including the location (mountains, lakefront, oceanside, rural) combined with the homeowners’ personal taste. Many of our clients have second homes in the Lake Sunapee area and while they want their home to be indicative of a lake home, they often blend this style with a more contemporary or eclectic one, which is exactly what I strive to help them achieve.
We work with clients closely throughout the design process. At the first consultation I do much more listening than talking, allowing the homeowners to tell me their likes, dislikes, goals, and dreams. We develop the design through a collaborative processing involving sketches and samples to visualize the end result of the space.
Describe some of your more challenging spaces? Does a unique layout benefit the designer by expanding their ability to be creative? Or does it limit options?
Spaces that can be particularly challenging, especially in regard to space planning and furniture layout, are long rectangular rooms with a lot of windows, doors, and large fireplaces. One recent client had such a room, where an oversized stone fireplace and hearth took up one end wall with a door located to the side of it. Typically, the fireplace creates a focal point for seating to be arranged, but in this case there was only enough room for two chairs and small end tables to be located at the end of the room with the fireplace and door, leaving the rest of the room in want. I drew several floor plan options for the client with two separate seating areas, incorporating chairs and an ottoman that are easily movable to accommodate large or small parties.
Unique layouts do force the designer to be more creative. Traditional New England homes have many additions onto a main structure which mean more doorways to work around, and often older homes have more than one fireplace not particularly in the best location. By understanding how the clients want to use their space and their current lifestyles, I can suggest storage techniques that will work in their space, i.e. built ins, cabinets, shelves, hidden storage in a coffee table, etc.
Options are only limited by the designer’s imagination and the clients’ receptiveness to his or her ideas. The better we know the client, the more options we have to present.
Open floor plans are more popular than ever and many clients are consumed with the idea of flow. How do you ensure against clutter, and that the occupant always feels stress-free in that space?
Traffic flow is an extremely important interior design consideration. Open floor plans present more of a challenge in that basically everything is visible to the guest; however, there are several design options that can organize clutter, limit it, or at the very least contain it. The kitchen pantry is a godsend for the client who spends a lot of time in the kitchen, housing large and small equipment, mixing bowls, and even food items which would normally present a storage challenge in an open, contemporary kitchen layout. Open pantries can be organized in such a way as to focus on specific items, such as a collection of dishes, rather than the ordinary items generally found in the pantry.
Built-in entertainment centers in family rooms can also be useful in keeping books, games, and sports memorabilia contained while creating a showcase for personal achievements such as metals and trophies.
Area rugs are versatile. New England homes and businesses use lots of hardwood floors. Explain how you incorporate area rugs into your designs.
It’s true New England homes and businesses have a lot of hardwood floors, but seldom do you see one without an area rug. Area rugs contribute so much to the design of a room. I love designing rooms around colorful area rugs and often let the rug selection dictate the other design elements in the room. I also design the rug and select the color palette for the perfect piece in a room.
After interviewing my clients and developing a color scheme, we start researching rugs with the colors and pattern style that will complement the space. Our vendors who work with custom made rugs email pictures of their current supply of rugs that might match the space for our consideration, or if we are designing a whole house, we travel to the vendor’s warehouse to select all of the rugs at once, ensuring they work together and create a design flow from space to space in the home. The area rug references the theme of the room and often repeats design elements. Both color and texture reinforce and influence the activities use of the room.
Rugs can also help create a cohesive design when bringing furniture from one location to a new one, or combining furniture from two homes into one.
Do you have a type of area rug that you lean on most? Or is it a case-by-case basis?
I really select rugs on a case by case basis, but I typically use 100% wool with vegetable dyes for the clarity of color tones and durability. Man-made components such as nylon give years of service in more utilitarian areas.
Are there price limits when it comes to rugs?
There really is no price limit on rugs. Most are made in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nepal by true craftsmen who have worked in the trade for decades. Some, with intricate designs and a high knot count, can easily reach $10,000, depending on the size and thread count. Antique rugs area a wonderful alternative and often fit best with no budget. There are several good options, though, to keep within any budget.
Do you have any final words of design advice?
Where can readers see your work, or make an appointment for consultation?
Our website showcases our portfolio of projects all over the country. We travel to potential clients’ homes for consultations, or if it is more convenient, we have two office locations for appointments – our Showroom and Design Center in New London, New Hampshire, and a satellite office in Cambridge, Massachusetts.Emily M.

January 1997 ... Four short months after Waldy Malouf is named Chef/Director of Manhattan's beloved Rainbow Room, restaurant critic Ruth Reichl of The New York Times awards the restaurant a remarkable three-star review-its first-and one of only three she bestows in 1997.
August 1999 ... Today, two and a half years later, continued ...Waldy is again featured prominently in The New York Times-but now as "The Chef" in the Wednesday section's eight-part chef/recipe series. Recipes in his column-which debuted on July 21st-pay tribute to open fire and wood fire cooking, the earmark of the earthy, flavorful, and inventive cuisine he now presents at his brand-new, midtown Manhattan landmark, BEACON Restaurant, Bar & Bakery. In fact, in his recent review, critic William Grimes of The New York Times commented, "[Beacon] ... delivers uncomplicated, big-flavored food, emphasizing fresh, seasonal ingredients. That's all, and that's enough ... Beacon gets it right."
Background
Waldy Malouf graduated from the Culinary Institute of America in 1975 having won First Prize in that year's Carras Culinary Competition. His extensive professional experience includes affiliations with The Four Seasons, La Côte Basque, the St. Regis Hotel, La Cremaillere (Banksville, NY), the Hudson River Club, and The Rainbow Room.
Beginning at La Cremaillere, Waldy developed a signature cuisine that presented the culinary riches of New York State's Hudson River Valley, a subject he explored to great acclaim in his first book, THE HUDSON RIVER VALLEY COOKBOOK: A Leading American Chef Savors the Region's Bounty (Addison-Wesley, 1995). The book-nominated for a Julia Child Cookbook Award by the International Association of Culinary Professionals-won high praise from The New York Times, which reviewed it on two separate occasions, naming it one of the year's "Ten Best" in "The Sunday Book Review." Bon Appetit, Gourmet, and The Daily News also lauded the work, which was released in paperback this summer by Harvard Common Press and optioned by Book-of-the-Month-Club. Waldy is currently working on his second book, MAGNIFICENT MEATS, to be published in 2001.
Over the years, Waldy has garnered a distinguished reputation for establishing an excellent rapport with his teams of chefs, and is viewed as a mentor by many in the industry. He has developed and nurtured long-term, deeply felt relationships with local farmers and growers. "It is," he notes, "the rapport I've cultivated over a period of twenty years with local purveyors, vintners, and fishermen that gives my food substance, body and emotion.
Awards, Accolades and Activities
Waldy Malouf has been the recipient of many prizes and accolades for his outstanding work. Due to his expertise at RAINBOW!, the restaurant received a coveted Mobil Travel Guide Four Star Award and was inducted into the 1997 Nation's Restaurant News "Fine Dining Hall of Fame." Nationally and internationally, Waldy has been the subject of stories in House Beautiful; Metropolitan Home; New York magazine; Ladies' Home Journal; Food & Wine; Paper; Time Out New York; CNN; The Food Network; "CBS Latin America;" "CBS Saturday Morning;" Brazilian Television; New York 1 News; and numerous Japanese magazines and guide books.
In October 1996, Waldy was one of five distinguished alumni chosen by the Culinary Institute of America to receive honors at their Golden Anniversary Gala, and currently sits on the Board of Directors of the Alumni Association. He won First Prize in the Third Annual Cointreau Recipe Contest in 1992, and has been named a "Great Chef of New York" numerous times by the James Beard Foundation. He is a frequent participant in The New School's "Behind the Scenes at the Great Restaurants of New York" series, and teaches regularly at Macy's "DeGustibus." Additionally, he judges many notable culinary competitions.
Waldy has travelled to the farms, wine-growing regions, cooking schools and prestigious restaurants of London, Madrid, San Sebastian, Puglia, and the Sonoma Valley on behalf of the NY State Department of Economic Development, the NY Wine & Grape Foundation, and as a guest chef of the host countries. Another exciting project has taken him across the US thirty times and back as a member of a group of regional chef-consultants to Northwest/KLM Airlines. Their objective is to create in-flight menus that incorporate regional cuisine from each of the airline's major US hubs.
Waldy has been a participating chef for Share Our Strength/Taste of the Nation's annual fundraising gala for years and served on the Board of Directors for the American Institute of Wine and Food (NY Chapter). He co-chaired their annual Marketplace Tasting several years in a row. Additionally, Waldy has a commitment to hunger-relief causes and culinary education, volunteering his services at numerous food world events including those sponsored by God's Love We Deliver; the Culinary Institute of America; City Meals-on-Wheels; The James Beard Foundation; and Green Chimneys. This September, he will provide opening remarks on the topic of the future of sustainable cuisine at The Joe Baum Forum on the Future at The Culinary Institute of America. Additionally, he is President of the Board of Directors of The Ballet School of Stamford.
Waldy is currently developing a thirteen-part travel & food series for PBS. He resides in a former tavern built from logs in Pound Ridge, NY, with his wife, Meg, and their two children, Max and Merrill.Starring:

Emma SANDOVAL, as Personal Representative of the Estate of
John Sandoval, Deceased, Appellant,
v.
U. S. SMELTING, REFINING & MINING COMPANY et al., Appellees.
No. 75-1787.
United States Court of Appeals,
Tenth Circuit.
Argued and Submitted July 28, 1976.
Decided Nov. 12, 1976.
Ray M. Vargas, Albuquerque, N. M., for appellant.
Edward E. Triviz, Las Cruces, N. M., for appellees.
Before SETH, HOLLOWAY and McWILLIAMS, Circuit Judges.
SETH, Circuit Judge.
Plaintiff-appellant filed this wrongful death action in state court alleging that appellees negligently caused the death of her husband in a mine in Grant County, New Mexico. The case was removed to the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico, where trial began. At the conclusion of appellant's case, the trial court held that plaintiff's own evidence of decedent's contributory negligence precluded recovery as a matter of law, and directed a verdict in favor of appellee. This appeal challenges the correctness of the court's ruling.
The measure of the sufficiency of the evidence to go to the jury in a diversity case is a matter of federal law. Kiner v. Northcutt, 424 F.2d 222 (10th Cir.). In considering the motion for a directed verdict the trial court and appellate courts should view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party against whom the motion is made. Oldenburg v. Clark, 489 F.2d 839 (10th Cir.); Weeks v. Latter-Day Saints Hospital, 418 F.2d 1035 (10th Cir.); Gulf Insurance Co. v. Kolob Corp., 404 F.2d 115 (10th Cir.). The standard employed upon review was expressed by this court in Taylor v. National Trailer Convoy, Inc., 433 F.2d 569 (10th Cir.), in the following terms:
"A directed verdict is proper only where the evidence and all the inferences to be drawn therefrom are so patent that minds of reasonable men could not differ as to the conclusions to be drawn therefrom." 433 F.2d at 571-72.
See also Stiner v. United States, 524 F.2d 640 (10th Cir.); Bertot v. School District No. 1, Albany County, Wyo., 522 F.2d 1171 (10th Cir.); Wright v. American Home Assurance Co., 488 F.2d 361 (10th Cir.).
Appellant's husband, John Sandoval, was a miner of twenty years experience and was employed at appellee's mine in New Mexico. At the time of the accident, he was on the payroll of Akers, a contract miner. Akers had contracted with appellee to mine certain levels or certain drifts in the mine. Under this contract, he was to provide the labor and the hand tools. The heavy equipment was provided by appellee. Akers was reimbursed for the cost of workmen's compensation coverage. The miners worked on a wage with an incentive increment. The miners were under the immediate supervision of the contract miner. The statutory employee issue was raised by motion by appellee, but does not appear to have been resolved.
On the day of the accident, John Sandoval and his working partner, Concepcion Villalobos, were instructed to "muck out" an area, where a preceding shift had blasted down some rock. Sandoval and Villalobos "wetted down" the area with water hoses and dislodged loose rocks remaining after the blast. While engaged in these activities, Sandoval and his partner were directed by their supervisors to continue to remove loose ore, and to prepare to remove by blasting a low section of the ceiling. Sandoval and Villalobos then proceeded to drill holes in the roof, and continued to "muck out" loose ore. When boulders too large for the mucking machine were encountered, they would break them with an explosive charge. As more loose ore was removed from the floor, they thought that they might have difficulty in reaching the holes previously drilled on the roof of the cavity to load them. Sandoval and his partner thus loaded the holes by reaching from the top of the ore pile. The rounds were fused and connected with an igniter cord. At this point, a foreman came to inspect the work. He noticed that Villalobos was "tying down" the charges some two and one-half hours before the end of the shift, and instructed the workers not to blast the overhead rounds until the end of the shift which was the usual time for all blasting.
Sandoval and Villalobos then continued to remove loose ore from the floor of the cavity until they encountered another boulder. Villalobos testified that the boulder could have been rolled out of the path of the mucking machine but that he and Sandoval instead decided to break it with a charge. After removing the mucking machine from the area, they placed a charge, lit the fuse to blast the boulder, and retreated to guard the entrances to the station. The charge was detonated, and Villalobos testified that some five or six minutes after the blast, he heard the mucking machine start up again. Villalobos was then walking away from the station to get some additional ore cars; he then also heard four additional blasts and knew that some of the overhead rounds had detonated. Upon returning to the station, Villalobos found Sandoval covered with loose rock, and he was dead by the time the rock was removed.
As previously noted, at the close of appellant's case, the trial court granted appellees' motion for a directed verdict holding that ". . . even assuming that there was sufficient evidence of negligence of the defendants to create a fact question for the jury, plaintiff's own evidence shows contributory negligence as a matter of law."
Appellant here contends the trial court erred by granting a directed verdict when it had earlier denied appellee's motion for summary judgment. She argues that since evidence garnered at the discovery stage was virtually identical to that introduced at trial, the court's directed verdict, when summary judgment was previously denied, was improper. However, a denial of summary judgment does not rule out the possibility of a directed verdict. Gross v. Southern Railway Co., 446 F.2d 1057 (5th Cir.); 5 Moore, Federal Practice (2d ed. 1969) § 50.03(4), p. 2338.
Appellant presented her evidence on the theory that appellee had negligently failed to provide a safe place of employment for her husband and that such negligence was the proximate cause of his death. The testimony must be recounted in some detail. The record shows that Richard P. Gerwels, appellee's manager, was called as an adverse witness by appellant. He testified that the defendant had contracted with David Aker for the operation of the 1300-foot level of the mine. If there were "gross violations" of the safety code, appellee would call them to Aker's attention. Gerwels' testimony on direct examination consisted for the most part of a general discussion of the operation and production schedule of the mine. On cross-examination, he testified that the operation of different areas of the mine depended on the particular requirements of the contractor. Gerwels was then examined on the particular incident in question:
"A: Blasting a boulder underneath a loaded round is contrary to all accepted safety practices by managers and also any supervisors who might be aware of it, any experienced miner should never do this.
"Q: Why is that?
"A: It's dangerous. It's apt to set off the holes up above.
"Q: Is there any particular waiting time following setting off explosives in a mine before returning to the site?
"A: It should never be less than fifteen minutes and preferably a half hour . . .
"Q: Had you, and I mean this, you personally, while working for U.V. become aware of any such blasting procedure having been done before August 30, 1971 of a boulder underneath loaded rounds?
"A: No, sir, and if I had, it would have been promptly stopped. This is contrary to all safety practices."
Appellant then called William T. Boies, the chief engineer for appellee, as an adverse witness. Boies supervised the engineering department of appellee, and was also charged with safety supervision of the mine, including the 1300-foot level. On direct, he testified that he normally did not give safety instructions to any of the contractors or miners but would correct safety violations when he saw them. He stated that blasting was normally done at the end of a shift but could be done earlier if arrangements were made. Boies then testified to the ventilation system in the mine at the 1300-foot level. On cross-examination, Boies testified that the individual contractors had safety engineers of their own, and that the safety people attempted to coordinate safety efforts. In relation to the accident, he testified:
"Q: What is the nature of blasting a boulder just per se in isolation without any loaded charges?
"A: All by itself, this is a secondary blasting situation. It is the disposition of a boulder that you hadn't planned on to had to break up so that you could handle it and proceed with the work.
"Q: In connection with the loaded rounds, is there any particular practice whether in terms of Code or otherwise in mining as to once they are loaded, what particular course is to be taken?
"A: It is a matter of practice, a matter of law, matter of common sense, you would not blast anything in the proximity of loaded rounds that could be initiated by the secondary blasting. You are not even to work in the immediate vicinity of loaded rounds."
He also stated that the safety brochure available to miners specified that they should not return to an unventilated blasting site for at least thirty minutes. On cross-examination, it was brought out that Boies had testified at the hearing following the accident that: "One of the questions that was a contributing factor to the accident here is the fact of the ventilation. I think the company should make very much harder efforts to keep these places well ventilated. . . . "
Appellant next called Merejildo Rivera who was the shift manager employed by Aker at the time of the accident. Rivera testified that at the beginning of the shift, he and Pete Martinez went to the area in question and found Sandoval and Villalobos wetting down and removing loose ore. The supervisors told them to level a portion of the ceiling in the cavity. He testified that a miner should usually wait thirty minutes before returning to the area of a primary explosion, but could return to the site of a secondary blast within five or ten minutes. He noted that the practice in the mine was that secondary or boulder blasting could be done at any time during the shift, but that a regular primary blast could be done only at the end of the shift. Relative to the accident, Rivera testified that he later returned to the site and saw Sandoval and Villalobos tying together the overhead rounds with fuses. He thought that the workers were simply going to continue to remove loose ore from the cavity for the two hours remaining on the shift. Rivera specifically told them not to blast the overhead rounds until quitting time. On cross-examination, Rivera stated that he was referring to a prohibition on blasting the overhead rounds he stated that he was unaware that the workers had been using secondary blasts to remove large boulders on the ground. In reference to a meeting between Rivera and Villalobos after the accident, the following exchange occurred:
"Q: And Villalobos, didn't you get after Villalobos that he should he and Sandoval should have more sense than to have blasted that way?
"A: I did.
"Q: Did Villalobos tell you he just plumb forgot or what?
"A: Just said he said he wasn't thinking at the time, they weren't thinking about the loaded rounds on top."
The deposition of David Romero, Aker's safety engineer, was then read into the record. Romero stated that he had run a number of safety meetings dealing with the use of explosives but could not remember whether the decedent had attended. He stated that a miner absolutely should not blast boulders underneath loaded rounds.
The deposition of Pete Martinez, general foreman at the 1300-foot level at the time of the accident, was also introduced. He stated that blasting boulders underneath loaded overhead rounds was contrary to mining practice, that he had never seen any miner do it before, and that if he was aware of the practice he would immediately stop it. He testified that the decedent was "pretty careful" in his previous use of explosives.
Appellant's primary witness was Concepcion Villalobos, the decedent's work partner at the time of the accident. Villalobos testified on direct that he and Sandoval were wetting down the station and removing loose ore when the supervisors told them to level a portion of the ceiling. He noted that he and Sandoval worked on a production incentive bonus system by which they would receive more money if they finished the station on a certain date, in this case, the day following the accident. He stated that there was no ventilation where they were working. Villalobos drilled and loaded the holes in the roof of the ceiling and continued to remove loose ore from the floor of the cavity. He testified that he was "pretty sure" that Rivera, his supervisor, was aware that they had been blasting boulders after the overhead rounds were loaded, and that Rivera later in the day only asked them how they were doing. He stated that after Rivera left, they tied the loaded rounds together with an igniter cord and continued to remove loose ore. The workers then encountered another boulder and attached explosives. On direct, Villalobos testified:
"Q: Did you just take a chance, Mr. Villalobos, in blasting the boulder, just take a chance?
"A: No, I didn't. I'd known better than that, just to say I'd go in there and take a chance, no. I just plum forgot about it. We were in a hurry to get the place cleaned up."Q: What was your attention concentrated on at that moment?
"A: More in the muck, to we was concentrating we wanted it cleaned out so we could get paid the whole thing."
Thereafter, Sandoval and Villalobos left the site to guard entrances to the station. The boulder was blasted and five or six minutes later Villalobos heard the mucking machine start, as above described. He went to retrieve more ore cars when four additional explosions occurred.
Concerning the procedure which they had used, Villalobos said the following:
"Q: Has there ever been an occasion when miners, including yourself, have continued mucking after loading?
"A: Yes.
"Q: Were you ever told by anyone in authority not to?
"A: No.
"Q: Now . . . with respect to the igniter cord, was that already tied down when Mr. Rivera made his second visit?
"A: Yes, I'm sure it was."
On cross-examination, Villalobos testified that he had worked with the decedent on previous occasions, but that this was the first time that they had ever blasted boulders under loaded rounds. As to the safety of such an undertaking, Villalobos testified:
"Q: You didn't need any safety meetings to know that that was unsafe? You knew this before this accident ever happened, didn't you?
"A: I'd say yes . . . I should have known better, yes.
"Q: As a matter of fact, you knew before this accident ever happened that was not the right way to do the blasting underneath loaded rounds, didn't you?
"A: Yes."
Later, the following exchange occurred:
"Q: . . . (Y)ou already knew by experience and didn't need any safety instructions about not working under loaded rounds?
"A: Yes, I knew, but I was I just plain forgot that the shots were up on top and we had our minds on trying to get the thing cleaned up so we would have it all paid up . . . ."
To impeach Villalobos on the question of whether they had been instructed not to work in an area loaded with explosives, appellant introduced his testimony at deposition to the effect that workers had been instructed by their bosses not to work in an area after it had been loaded with explosives.
Appellant then offered into evidence the testimony of Robert A. White, the deputy inspector of mines, who participated in an investigation of the accident. He testified that when he arrived at the scene of the accident, he noticed several misfired holes in the roof of the cavity. His basic testimony, read from the accident report which was also in evidence, was as follows:
" . . . (T)he direct cause was the four charged holes exploding directly above the deceased which had apparently been set off by plaster blasting the boulder just before. The entire procedure leading to the accident was in direct violation of safe mining practices and the New Mexico Mine Safety Code by the company, mining contractor, and the miners involved . . . ."
He testified that he made several recommendations after the accident, including that regular safety meetings be conducted and that miners be strictly informed of all applicable safety regulations. On cross-examination, White admitted that any experienced miner should know that it was dangerous to work under loaded rounds without the necessity of a safety meeting. White knew the decedent and considered him experienced enough to know of the danger.
The deposition of Joe D. Longacre, another mine inspector, was also introduced by appellant. Longacre agreed that the mine in question was required to comply with safety regulations of the state. On cross-examination, Longacre stated that it should be almost second nature that a miner should not work under loaded overhead rounds. He stated that there is a "human element" in safety procedure which causes most of the accidents. When asked about this "human element" by appellant's counsel on redirect, Longacre explained:
" . . . I'm sure that the deceased and his partner did not realize, they were in a hurry doing this and that boulder they had blasted before, they had blasted some big boulders that appeared in the muck pile, that was before they had done this drilling and they just took it for granted and they just completely forgot about those charged holes up there and blasted that boulder."
We have summarized in some detail the evidence put on by the appellant. There was no evidence to contradict the testimony of appellant's own witnesses that the practice of working and blasting underneath loaded explosives was extremely dangerous, and was obvious to any miner. The decedent's working partner testified that he himself should have known better, and that he didn't need any safety meetings to know the procedure was unsafe. The workers were in a hurry to finish the project and "just plain forgot" about the overheard rounds.
The evidence of appellant thus established contributory negligence as a matter of law. This court has held that the trial judge has a duty to direct a verdict when plaintiff's own testimony undisputedly establishes contributory negligence as a matter of law. Young v. Vincent, 310 F.2d 709 (10th Cir.). The standards are referred to above. New Mexico courts hold that contributory negligence is a complete bar to recovery, and thus we find no error.

Discovering Your Community's Walkability
A walkability checklist can help volunteers assess the safety and accessibility of the built environment surrounding the school and nearby neighborhoods. Going on a walk is the best way to discover your community’s strengths and weaknesses that impact walkability.
Members of the community to include on your walk
School administrators, parents, city planners, traffic engineers, park officials, law enforcement, mayor, council members, local/nearby business owners, and neighborhood association representatives.
Work together to improve walkability
Meet with everyone who attended the walk and compare notes. If you had an overall positive experience walking from your neighborhood to the school, you can move forward with your walking program. If you noticed areas that need improvement, identify the best people who can help fix the problem.
Solve problems
If you experienced problems with cars speeding down a street, report it to local law enforcement and work with traffic engineers to install traffic calming measures. If sidewalks vanish between neighborhoods, work with city planners to improve connectivity. Some issues can be easily addressed, while others may require a more strategic approach or policy change.
Stay the course
A walkable community does not happen by accident. It requires the involvement of many local leaders and citizens who are dedicated to ensuring that their children live in an active and healthy place. This checklist is your first step in identifying areas that you should be proud of and places that could still use some attention.
Walkability Checklist
Use this checklist as a starting point to help you decide if your neighborhood is ready to support a walking program or if some changes need to be implemented before children can safely walk.
Sidewalks
- Are there continuous sidewalks, pathways or bike lanes?
- Is there enough space between traffic and the sidwalk?
- Are the sidewalks in good condition or are there large cracks or dips that could use repair?
- Are there crosswalks? If so, are they clearly marked or raised and easily seen by drivers?
- Did parked cars or plants limit your ability to see oncoming traffic?
Is there busy traffic on the road?
- Is speeding an issue?
Did you feel safe?
- Was there adequate street lighting?
- Are there street trees that provide shade?.

However, the profound analysis of the situation in China and its international trade reveals the fact that cultural factors were secondary compared to economic effects of the opium trade. In order to understand the extent to which economic effects determined the beginning of the war between two countries, it is necessary to take into consideration the importance of the opium trade for the British Empire.
Firstly, it should be said that during a couple of decades preceding the Opium war, the trade between Britain and China grew progressively. At the same time, as the trade with China progress its economic effects became extremely negative for the British Empire. The reason is obvious – the country was rapidly progressing due to its imperialistic policy, territorial expansion of the empire, its leading position in the world and international trade, and the exploitation of its colonies. In such a way, the development of Britain was directly dependent on the effectiveness of its colonial policy and trade with other countries. In this regard, China was the major threat to the further economic growth of the British Empire because the import of Chinese products substantially exceeded the export of British commodities to China (Tan, 214). As a result, the British Empire stimulated the economic growth of China and slowed down the development of national economy. The losses of Britain were particularly obvious when silver was used as the main means of payment. The stock of silver became scarcer, until the traditional approach to trade with China had not been changed.
In fact, the decision of the British Empire to shift from the use of conventional means of payment, such as silver, to the use of opium had nothing in common with cultural background of British or Chinese people, but it was determined by objective economic factors and the profitability of the opium trade to the British Empire. The substitution of silver by opium had changed the balance in the trade between the British Empire and China radically. China increased the consumption of opium exchanging its products on the drug that was consumed without any positive economic effect. No wonder the opium trade was booming and within a decade the volume of opium export to China increased from 4000 chests per year in 1820 to 18000 in 1830 (Polachek, 231). In such a way, Britain exported opium from India, saved silver and received all commodities it got used to import from China and economic benefits of the British Empire were enormous.
In contrast, Chinese economic was affected dramatically, though social effects may seem to be more significant. In this regard, it should be said that by 1836 about 1800 tons of opium were imported to China annually and more than 12 million people were addicts (Chen, 227). Obviously, the losses of the country in the international trade enormous because opium became the main means of payment, but it could not be used to produce some commodities that could stimulate economic development of the country.
Moreover, 12 million of addicts were serious ballast for the national economy because many of them could not work normally. The lack of material resources to acquire the drug undermined social stability in society that also produced a negative impact on the national economy. What is more, the number of addicts grew progressively, while economic crisis caused by the uncontrollable opium trade was inevitable. As a result, the Chinese took decision to control the opium trade that led to the conflict of economic interests of China and the British Empire and eventually resulted in the Opium war.Artist Duane Corey depicts Negro League Baseball in Bridgeport in exhibition at Fairfield University's Lukacs Gallery October 18
Duane Corey's exhibition, "Shadow Ball in Jasper's Town" opens at Fairfield University's Lukacs Gallery in Loyola Hall on Monday, Oct. 18 with an opening reception from 6 to 8 p.m. to which the public is invited. The exhibition continues through Monday, Oct. 25. Admission is free and gallery hours for the exhibition are Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., with the exception of the Monday opening when the gallery will be open from 1 p.m. to 8 p.m. The gallery is closed Sunday and will be open Monday, Oct. 25 from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. The studio art program in the department of visual and performing arts presents the exhibition, which is part of the Arts & Minds season.
In a celebration of Negro League baseball in Bridgeport, Conn., Corey's paintings depict life during a time when the color barrier was still in existence and players like Satchel Paige exhibited their talents in the "shadows" of the Negro Leagues instead of in the major league. According to Corey, "Baseball was a way of 'Americanizing' new citizens. When the wave of immigration hit the United States in the early 19th century, the newcomers embraced the game to feel more 'American.' Many of the players in the Negro League were immigrants as were their fans, particularly in Bridgeport, and baseball was an 'American' 'Jasper."
The artist will give a brief talk at the opening reception on Monday, Oct. 18 at 7 p.m. that will set the historical context for his work.

Vol. 43, No. 63Summary: Change is slow and difficult. Reform efforts, no matter how deeply rooted, usually have many false starts. Success requires learning each failure. Doing better each time. Only a people who intensely love liberty have a chance at getting it. Here we discuss the causes of these grim truths, as we start on the road to reforming America.
“We swear and pledge ourselves to fulfill with zeal and fidelity the duties which devolve upon us.”
— Opening of the Tennis Court Oath signed by members of Third Estate on 20 June 1789, starting the French Revolution

(1) Peasant protests only vent frustration
Injustice and inequality have been the common lot of peasants since the development of settled agricultural societies. This generates tension. Peasant protests.
Effective collective action requires competent leaders — and competent followers (people willing to support their leaders). This combination is rare among peasants. Even stratified societies allow some degree of upward mobility for aggressive, intelligent peasants. This removes potential leaders from the peasants.
This is why a regime totters when unrest spreads to the Middle Class (however small), as they provide a leadership cadre for the peasants.
(2) Peasant revolts complain about the symptoms
Disorders which affect societies are like syphilis, manifesting a wide range of symptoms affecting many parts of society. Treating the symptoms leaves the underlying illness untreated. A wider vision is necessary understanding the causes of the problems.
Brad DeLong (Prof Economics, Berkeley) explains one common form of this. The peasants are oppressed by the excessive, often criminal violence of the Cossacks. They complain to the Czar, not realizing that the Cossacks work for the Czar. They do his bidding. The Czar is the problem, not the Cossacks. When they realize this truth, then the window opens for radical change.
(3) We need an alternative vision for America
Leaders can only take their followers down a visible path. Elites foreclose the possibility of fundamental revolt by using religion and education to fetter the minds of their suspects — so that they believe there are no alternatives to the present social order. The King is God’s anointed, so that rebellion on Earth means rebellion against God’s will. Or that history has ended with the triumph of the Marxist revolution — capitalist republics. As Francis Fukuyama wrote in The End of History?“, The National Interest, Summer 1989:.
(4) The Tea Party
The Tea Party movement illustrates all these things. They did the right things — poorly as usually in the sloppy real world (the downside of open source — grassroots, bottoms-up — organizations). But they lacked a deep understanding of the problem, a clear vision of an alternative, and competent leaders. Or perhaps their leaders were competent, but in the pay of our ruling elites. The result was they quickly became co-opted. They started proclaiming their independence from the two political parties, protesting the bank bailouts. In the end they acted as Republican shock troops, supporting shifting taxes from the rich to the middle class and de-regulation of banks (which leads inevitably to more bailouts).
The Obama-as-Messiah believers have traveled a similar path.
(5) The difficulty of change
Change is slow and difficult, no matter what snake-oil salesmen tell us. Nature (or Nature’s God) does not care how much we need reform (it does not heed the cries of slaves whipped in the fields). It does not care how much we deserve reform. These sad facts shock and disturb many Americans (see the outraged comments on this thread).
Reform efforts, no matter how deeply rooted, usually have many false starts. Success requires learning each failure. Doing better each time. Only a people who intensely love liberty have a chance at getting it. (McHenry, 1753-1816, signer of the Constitution, third Secretary of War, namesake of Fort McHenry)

About Occupy Wall Street:
- Occupy Wall Street, another futile peasants’ protest, 5 October 2011
.
.
It’s taken me a couple of days to organize my thoughts after reading this post, FM.
First, I want to assure you that anybody who reads this post is probably pretty shaken by it. This is not gentle medicine, sir, and it doesn’t go down smoothly.
Second, I would like to disagree with you on the nature of the Tea Party in one fundamental way. The mainstream Republican party is all about accumulating and keeping power; nothing more and nothing less. They are shocked that the Tea Party actually wants to use the accumulated power to actually do something (lower taxes on the rich and cut away the social safety net). While your definition of the Tea Party as Republican stormtroopers was accurate in the last election, the tension between the two groups is as palpable as the anger between Mitt Romney and Rick Perry.
Third, I want to make an observation about American society that is adjacent to your post. As you’ve noted before, the American and French revolutions were largely led by highly competent upper middle class citizens who had hit a powerful artificial ceiling. The upper middle class leaders were able to effectively rally the rest of the middle class and the poor to start the revolution.
In today’s American society the middle class is being ripped apart. The upper section is, for the moment, drifting upward. Speaking as member of that group, it’s a comfortable experience which does not match the experiences of everybody below us and puts us more in tune with the wealthy than with the rest of society. It seems, at least for the moment, that the American Dream is still intact for me, if not for anybody below me on the economic ladder.
The lower section of what was the middle class is gently falling into the swirling morass of clinging debt and permanently lowered expectations. They are fighting it with every tool at their disposal but, in general, are in the hopeless position of a rodent caught by a boa constrictor. I’ve seen this struggle first hand as some of my friends are in this position and it is not a pretty one to watch. I’ve done what I can for them but they lack the skills, credentials, and luck to stay afloat in today’s economic conditions.
This situation, in my opinion, is delaying the effective reform that you crave and I think we will reach a tipping point where we act more from anger than from reasoning (the late French Revolution serves as an example) before we get enough stability to do things similar to the American Revolution.
Thank you for your interesting comment, raising several important points. One, however, is IMO not accurate.
Reducing taxes on the rich and cutting the safety net have been long-term goals of the Republican Party’s rich backer for decades. Those were steps to gathering power. As seen in the network of well-funded think-tanks and advocacy groups focused on these two issues. Neither were initial concerns of the Tea Party.
Channeling the TP energy into support of their goals — and repudiation of their initial anti-bank focus — demonstrated a fantastic degree of skill and resources.
For more evidence, see the Republican primaries, in which the candidates compete to shift the most taxes from the rich to the middle class (the Cain and Perry tax plans), and slash the safety net — even to the extent of mocking the unemployed and advocating letting the poor sick get little or no care.
These things are AGAINST the interests of most Republican voters! What an accomplishment, getting people to vote against their interests!
Street theater and dressing as unicorns will not defeat that combination of power and skill. I wonder if we are yet ready to even start on that road.
Most revolutions begin without a focus or center and without leaders, although a common thread in the last 100 years or so has been the inequities within governing and economic systems. I think we are dangerously close to a Black Swan event that could spark some very violent responses throughout the world.
The defecation is going to hit the rotary oscillator if people in the US break free of the Myth of the Rugged Individual and begin to see the system as oppressor rather than personal failure. Folks don’t starve to death gracefully, especially when they (rightfully) believe that the system is rigged and the house always wins.
You may be correct. We can only guess at what lies ahead. My guesses…
(1) “Most revolutions begin without a focus or center and without leaders”
Do have any cites for that? I would like to see them. My guess is that revolutions usually start with a focus group or groups. Certainly the American, French, Russian, and Chinese revolutions did. It is the formation or resolution of such groups which can be seen as marking the start of the revolt.
(2) “last 100 years or so has been the inequities within governing and economic systems”
The studies I have seen date the rise of inequality in the US to the past generation or so. Starting roughly 1970 and accellerating thereafter. It dropped materially in the post-WWII era, until then.
(3) “Black Swan event that could spark some very violent responses throughout the world. ”
By definition a Black Swan event is unanticipated, so I cannot disgree. But I find that Americans tend to project our problems on the whole world. In fact many (not all) of the developed nations have serious problems. On the other hand, the emerging nations are doing quite well. They have problems of course, but lack most of our disturbing weaknesses — and high rates of economic growth usually dampens social unrest.
(4) “if people in the US break free of the Myth of the Rugged Individual and begin to see the system as oppressor rather than personal failure. ”
Agreed! But Harper’s published Charles A Beard’s “The Myth of Rugged Individualism” in December 1931. It still has not taken hold. Myths die slowly.
For more about this, including a link to Beard’s great classic, see We have trouble coping with our present because we’ve lost our past.
(5) “Folks don’t starve to death gracefully”
I think that’s an exaggerated fear, at least in any reasonable time frame. Look far enough ahead, into the fog of the future, and anything becomes possible — but not worth worrying.
(1) No, I have no research. More of an interested observer of history take on more modern day revolutions and freedom movements. From The Quit India Movement to the Iranian Revolution to the Arab Spring, it seems to me that these more recent uprisings began with a strong sense of inequity, while understanding that incremental fixes to a corrupt system are futile. Also leaderless, at least in the beginning.
The counter-intuitive (for most) paradigm is that these systems are not broken – they’re working just fine, and producing the results that they were designed to produce. I’ve read several posts on this site that agree with this perspective. As author(s) here have written, the elite do not surrender the status quo easily.
(2) Inequality in governing systems is as old as human civilization, no? Maybe early groups of people were more egalitarian than others, but I’m pretty sure that there have always been groups of oppressed. Isn’t it the middle class (whatever that is) that is relatively new to human civilization? Most of the course of our history was completed without a middle class, and society with haves and have nots seems to be human nature. Someone always has a bigger gun or a smaller conscience.
(3) Isn’t there a diary here today that talks about the EU moving closer to the edge of the cliff (with which I completely agree)? Blood is being spilled in Greece (Oakland, too) and if the Italian parliament is erupting into fist fights, can the population be far behind? BRIC economies are showing signs of weakening, and, here in the West, we hardly hear about the aggressive and violent repression of peasant protests in China.
I’m not trying to belabor the point, because, as you point out, predictions are tough to make, especially about the future. But there does seem to be a certain trajectory here that does not, at present, look like it will have a soft landing.
(4) That was terrific, thanks. I’m a frequent visitor here, but must have missed this (truth is I sometimes skim over a diary or two.) It’s a brilliant piece, and the anecdote about Wickersham and the dissenters of his report was perfect.
The myth also infects our communities, where families in need of public assistance are often scorned by neighbors and local officials (particularly in rural areas and smaller communities.) The families in need themselves often feel a degree of shame, thinking that the failure is theirs alone. This is an atomizing phenomena and it isolates those in need (now numbering some 50 million Americans) and diverts any blame on the economic system for producing these results to the individual. The danger to the elite with the 99%ers is that it provides a very broad movement that gives economically distressed citizens an opportunity to amplify their voice. If they can shut off Survivor long enough to notice.
(5) I didn’t mean too much here. Crime rates (esp. home break ins) in my rural county in NH are up and police are blaming the economy. In his bio of FDR, Conrad Black writes about the machine gun nests lining the procession route that were necessary because of the citizen uprisings around the country. Granted, we have more safety nets today, but if policy makers continue on the path of expansion by austerity, nothing would surprise me.
Thanks for engaging. Thinking for oneself is a significant responsibility and it helps to share thoughts and question long-held beliefs.
Thank you for your reply!
Re: revolutionary movements
“Police Crackdown Effort at #OccupyOakland Raises Bigger Questions About Movement Evolution“, Yves Smith, Naked Capitalism, 27 October 2011 — Excerpt:
Most readers by now no doubt have heard about the aggressive police crackdown at Occupy Oakland on Tuesday, in which police critically wounded Iraq war vet Scott Olsen while using tear gas, rubber bullets, and flash grenades to clear Frank H. Ogawa Plaza. The footage right before the tear gassing began does not show any signs of provocation by the protestors, but other reports say that a small group which most believe were anarchists rather than OWS members, had engaged in aggressive actions earlier.
…And that’s before you get to the issue that the New York Times raises, of provocateurs (some aggressive leftist groups as well as probable plants) who aren’t representative of regular OWS participants:
Even if this is true (likely), I’m not certain how OWS can say someone is “not us” with what amounts to an open membership policy.
… The real danger to OWS will come when there is an eruption that can clearly be pinned on the movement rather than the police, particularly if bystanders are hurt or private property is damaged in a serious way (say a fire breaks out or windows get smashed). That will play into well established stereotypes and be far too easy for media outlets to amplify. I’m sure the OWS leadership is well aware of this danger but awareness may not be sufficient to prevent it from happening.b.o.c Tulip Sandal

I would like to start making laptop-reviews. I would like to know how I can get laptops without buying them. Any tips how to start are welcome
Thanks for the help :)
It would be pretty difficult to just get free laptops for review from the get-go, you would need to establish some sort of review base before companies will start sending you their products to review.
Yea, next to impossible, especially in this economy. Companies today have really tightened up their marketing budgets :(
Thanks for the replies :) So reviewers like notebookcheck, buy the products or how should I understand it?
Thanks once again
Start off by buying and reviewing your own products, then make sure you have an audience. Once the sponsors see that you have this established, they will send you their products to review.

TS Ma, which hasn’t gotten much notice from us in the past, has shuttered and is changing things up a bit. An anonymous tipster (who may be my boss’ boss’ boss, so if this article doesn’t get published I’m out of a job – no pressure) got word to me that the new sign was put up just about yesterday. Now renamed Fusion 9th, it looks like they’ve moved from Chinese and sushi probably not worth eating to pan-Asian. I’m sure we can safely replace “Fusion” with “Multiple cuisine hodgepodge” in our minds, though, given the window.
Past the insurance shutter, you can see into the restaurant. It doesn’t look like it’s a major gut-and-rebuild operation and there are no construction permits in the windows yet. It could just be a redecoration and change up of menu. To be honest, with Aura Thai and Thai Select literally within two short blocks’ walk, Tabata, Zoob Zib, and Lunch Box slinging amazing noodle soups, and Lunch Box serving up bubble tea, the only real draw in my opinion will be the Malayasian food. I’d kill for tofu nyonya and/or char kuey tiow being readily available in this chunk of southwest Midtown. TS Ma didn’t do too great in their last DoH restaurant inspection, though – they got changed from a C to Grade Pending.
Our tipster reports that the owners sold the Manhattan location and are open in Montclair, NJ.
We’ll see what transpires as they continue building – I hold out hope for coconut rice and Malaysian curry!

The energy at any location f[sub i]t[sub i] in the speech spectrogram can be derived by convolution of the speech signal with appropriate Gaussian-shaped cosine and sine waves. This leads to the so-called pixel energy, with an integration window centered at f[sub i]t[sub i] and Gaussian-shaped in both frequency and time. Analysis of the correlation for pairs of pixels at a given mutual distance in the spectrogram provides a parametric representation of speech, which shows interesting characteristics. One such representation is the spectral correlation matrix: the correlation for pairs of energy pixels drawn at the same instance at two different frequencies f[sub i] and f[sub j], with f[sub i] and f[sub j] chosen from a range of values at appropriate intervals along the frequency scale. It is found that, for a given talker, this spectral correlation matrix stabilizes after analyzing a speech token of about 10 to 15 s: Its features are then typical of speech as such, and do not depend on the actual content of the speech token. Details of such spectral correlation matrices appear to be characteristic of the talker.The struggle of Syrian refugees in Lebanon

Yanagisawa's client had saved some beautiful vertical cypress lattice from the shoji screens in her parents' traditional Japanese house before it was torn down, and asked him to make a display cabinet for her using the lattice. Yanagisawa combined western and Japanese aesthetics in his walnut and cherry cabinet (14-1/8 in. deep by 63-3/4 in. wide by 39-3/8 in. tall). He steam-bent the lattice to make curved doors and added simple carved handles. The sliding doors are hung so that no track is visible.

aka Landusky. However, to protect their land, the Indians wanted the discovery of gold to remain secret. In 1884 Frank Aldrich, Powell Landusky, and "Dutch" Lou Meyers found gold. The news of the strike brought hordes of men to the gulches where they dug in Little Alder, Rock Creek, Camp Creek, Grouse Creek, and the other streambeds in the mountains. As soon as the placer gold was exhausted the boom was over and the area deserted (Wolle 1963).
Then in 1890 Powell Landusky located the first lode mine; the Julia, as well as another mine, the Gold Bug. Landusky worked his claim along for some time. In August 1893, while prospecting with his son-in-law, Robert Orman, they located a claim they called the August. They worked the claim at night since they believed their prospect was within the Fort Belknap Reservation and that they would be forced off. Eventually they discovered an ore shoot with a vein thirteen feet wide, which yielded $400-$500 a ton in free-milling gold. Their secret leaked out, and when it became known that their profits ran as high as $13,000 a ton on picked ore, $500 on unsorted lots, and that it was rumored that they had obtained $100,000 from a hole less than 100 feet deep, a second rush to the Little Rockies began. This rush was all hardrock mining; the deposits lay in porphysitic granitic intrusions and limestone formations. In June, 1894, a settlement called Landusky was organized by the miners and stockmen. The Gold Bug group of mines promised a prosperous future for the area until it was found that the refractory ore refused to respond to the methods of extraction that existed. When the Gold Bug mill shut down, Landusky died. After cyanidation provided a successful means of recovering gold deposits, Landusky's mines were reopened and the camp began to come back (Wolle 1963).
From 1903 to 1912, the towns of Landusky, Zortman and Ruby (first called Whitcomb) saw a rapid population increase. Zortman boomed to 200 people, and boasted a hotel, two general stores, two saloons, a livery stable, and mining company offices. Stage lines ran between Zortman and Dodson, and Landusky and Harlem. Gold production was strong during this era, with a high of $700,000 in 1909. In 1913 the Ruby Gulch Mill burned down, and mining once again lulled (Murray 1978).
Operations continued off and on in the early 1920's. The Anaconda Copper Mining Company began work on the Alabama mine, building a new mill, and driving a tunnel on the 600 foot level to the bottom of the ore body in the Alabama. Additional good and high grade ores were found at the 300 and 500 foot levels. In October of 1923, the new mill burned down and operations at Ruby Gulch again went into a lull, since rising costs offset the $20.67 per ounce price of gold (Murray 1978).
The district saw a renaissance as a result of the rise in gold prices in 1934, and the towns of Landusky and Zortman saw coincident growth. A fire raged through Zortman in 1929, and again in 1944. Though still profitable, the mines shut down in as labor and resources were withdrawn in accordance with the War Production Board's Order L-208. There were hopes that the mines would reopen after the war, and some attempts were made. By 1951, however, all serious mining activities ceased. Over the years, a total of about 308,000 ounces of gold were recovered from the Little Rockies district (Murray 1978).
The Little Rocky Mountains are a dissected domal structure due to the laccolithic intrusion of phosphycitic rock. The oldest rocks, schists and gneisses of pre-Cambrian age, are exposed in gullies underlying the intrusive. Unconformably overlying the schists and gneisses, in order from oldest to youngest, are the following formations: Deadwood (Cambrian), Big Horn limestone (Ordovician), Jefferson limestone (Devonian), Lodge Pole and Mission Canyon limestones (Mississippian), Ellis Formation (Jurassic), Kootenai (lower Cretaceous), and the Colorado and Montana groups (Cretaceous). The intrusion of the laccolithic mass caused the doming of the sediments, and subsequent deformation produced faulting along the periphery of the uplift and shearing within it (Sahinen 1935).
Gold deposits occur as veins, contact deposits, replacement deposits, disseminations and as placers. Near Zortman, low-grade ores have been mined from lodes in shear zones. Contact and replacement deposits in limestone also occur. The brecciated ores exposed in the Little Ben, Alabama and other mines allow for easy breakdown and low processing costs, once cyanide leaching was introduced to the area. Near Landusky, small pockets of high grade ore have been mined from veins which, in general, strike northeast in contrast to those near Zortman which strike northwest. Auriferous pyrite occur in the fissured zones as well as dissemations in the porphyry. Sylvanite and fluorite have also been reported (Sahinen 1935).
BOUNDARIES OF THE DISTRICT
Sahinen (1935) places the district in the vicinity of the towns of Landusky and Zortman in the southwest part of Phillips County about 50 miles southwest of Malta, a station on the Northern Pacific Railroad. Figure 1 shows the Little Rockies district as defined by the AMRB (1994) which includes the historic mining area and the heads of the major drainages flowing from the Little Rockies.
HISTORIES OF SELECTED MINES
Gold Bug Mine
The Gold 50-foot winze extending from the lowest tunnel. The ore bodies ranged in value from $4 to $100 per ton (Murray 1978).
In 1902, Jacobson, Torgenson and Nobin bought the Gold Bug from Landusky's heirs, and built a ten-stamp mill with a 10 inch Blake jaw crusher, two Frue Vanners, and almalgamation plates. Like Landusky's mill before it, the Jacobson mill was incapable of recovering enough gold from the telluride ores forcing it to shut down in 1903 (Murray 1978).
Mining activity continued off and on at least into the 1960's, when $600,000 of gold were recovered by the Little Rockies Mining and Development Company between 1956 and 1966 (Hogan and Fredlund 1978).
When the site was revisited in 1978, the remains of the Gold Bug included a small mill, rail tracks, several adits, an air compressor, and a filter tank which had been recovered from the old Landusky Mill. Two house structures were also found southwest of the August Mine complex, and may be associated with the historic mining community of Ragtown (Hogan and Fredlund 1978).
August Mine
The August Mine is located in Section 15, T 25N, R 24E. Cory (1933) states that gold mining attained significance in the Little Rockies when Landusky and his son-in-law Robert Orman discovered and staked the August claim in 1893. They worked the claim at night since they believed their prospect was within the Fort Belknap Reservation and that they would be forced off. Eventually they discovered an ore shoot with a vein thirteen feet wide, which yielded $400-$500 a ton in free-milling gold. The August was noted for high grade ores, and may have been one of the largest gold ore producers in the state (Cory 1933).
The August group eventually included 21 patented claims and 3 millsites (Hogan and Fredlund 1978).
In 1930, the Little Ben Mining Company, organized by Charles Whitcomb, acquired and resumed operations in the August, and recovered forty tons of ore that brought in $27,400. By April of 1933, the company was planning a new cyanide plant, and was shipping high grade ore which ranged from $6 to $3,300 per ton. The sudden rise in the price of gold in 1934 to $35 per ounce allowed large scale operations to continue at the August, and the company employed up to 72 men. In 1936, the company showed gross earnings of $267,039.52 and net profits of $68,075.12. In 1937, they grossed $342,152.68 and netted $108,058.62. In 1939, the gross take was $247,567.44 with net profits of $47,031.62. When gold prices leveled off, the company shut down and liquidated as a corporation (Murray 1978).
When the site was revisited in 1978, all that remained of the August group was a glory hole, a shaft, three adits, remnants of loading platforms and rails, the remains of an aerial tramway from the 300 foot level to the Landusky Cyanide Mill, and the foundations of a few buildings (Hogan and Fredlund 1978).
By 1984, reclamation and rejuvenation of the area had destroyed much of what was observed in 1978 (Herbort 1984).
Little Ben Mine
Located in Section 15, T 25N, R 24E, the Little Ben Mine was part of a separate group of claims worked in close proximity to the August Mine (Cory 1933).
Initially ores from the Little Ben were probably taken to the mill in Landusky. The mine was part of the reorganization and and revival of mining in the district during the 1930's, with Whitcomb organizing the Little Ben Mining Company along with five prominent partners - the Holter Brothers, George McKee, John Corette and James Finlen. The company acquired the Little Ben and August groups, built another mill and recovered another fortune in high grade ore from a new lead (Costello, n.d.).
When the site was revisited in 1978, the remains of the Little Ben Mine included an adit, a shaft, an ore car rail line from the adit, and a loading platform (Hogan and Fredlund 1978).
Ruby Gulch Complex
Located in Section 7, T 25N, R 25E, the Ruby townsite (originally called Whitcomb) was a small village which sprang up around 1903-1904 as a result of mining activities in Ruby Gulch. The Alabama Mine opened in 1899, yielding $55,000 in high grade ore between 1899 and 1900. The Ruby Mine followed in 1904. The Ruby Mine turned out to be highly successful, because the miners were able to drive a haulway parallel to the main vein, and run inclined raises up to tap the brecciated ore. This made it possible to make a profit on ore that contained as little as $2.00 per ton of recoverables. In addition, there was enough silver in the ore to offset what gold was still lost in the tailings. A mill was built to accommodate the mines, and the townsite sprang up around that. The initial mill had a No. 3 Gates crusher, six 300-ton tanks and six 110-ton tanks. In 1907, the old Landusky mill was disassembled, and parts used in the Ruby mill (Murray 1978).).
In 1935, Charles Whitcomb and Carl Trauerman acquired and reopened the Ruby and Alabama Mines. By 1936, they had built a 300-ton cyanide plant, and by 1938 there were 120 men on the payroll. In 1936, the operation showed gross earnings of $269,358.42 and net profits of $65,097.42. In 1937, they grossed $509.644.28 and showed a profit of $202,205.72. In 1939, the mines brought in $424,129.40 for a net profit of $114,827.76. The mine continued to be profitable until it shut down it 1942 when labor and supplies were withdrawn in accordance with the War Production Board's Order L-208 (Murray 1978).
The mines saw a brief revival after World War II, and in the last half of 1946, the Ruby Gulch Mill processed 30,000 tons of ore, yielding gold and silver valued at over $80,000. 55 tons of high grade ore were recovered from the Alabama Mine that same season. Work in the Alabama proceeded year-round as a result of blasting and breaking up large quantities of the ore in the Alabama glory hole, and transporting it out through grizzlies to the old haul way. This process helped prevent snow-melt from mixing with the ore, as it was in the old external transfer system. By 1951, all serious mining activity in the district ceased (Murray 1978).
The area continues to see mining activities, and when the site was revisited in 1978, much of the townsite was still visible, although many cabins had collapsed, and most structures had been heavily vandalized (Hogan and Fredlund 1978).
Other important mines in the area include the Julia, the Ann, the Beaver Creek and associated camp, Alder Gulch, Pole Gulch, Hawkeye, and the community of Ragtown (Rossillon 1991).
A mine called the Alhambra mine was reported in 1896 to have shipped eight tons of ore to a mill in Aurora, Illinois with a return of almost $500 per ton. This mine is outside of the town of Landusky, and may actually have been the original name of the Alabama Mine. Alternatively, the mine may not have seen any subsequent mining (Western Mining World 1896).

Nancy McClure, left, and Sharon Tharrington were competitors who became partners.
RALEIGH – Before the co-owners of ArtSource Fine Art Gallery & Framing became partners in one of the largest art consulting businesses in the Triangle, they were competitors.
They even played their own little game of industrial espionage – staking out a space in the lobby of clients in search of an art consultant. Soon, Sharon Tharrington discovered, “We kept calling on the same clients.”
It was the husband of Nancy McClure who suggested that his wife call Tharrington about joining forces. That was 20 years ago. “We began as business partners and became best friends,” McClure says now.
Bizspace Spotlight
Today, ArtSource’s client list includes the likes of Rex Hospital, Highwoods Properties, Progress Energy and RBC Bank, as well as the residences of many of the Triangle’s top executives.
When Poyner Spruill was preparing to move into new offices at the RBC Plaza tower in downtown Raleigh, the law firm’s partners wanted art on the wall by the time the phones were plugged in.
Ray Lichtner, executive director of Poyner Spruill, says several consultants were interviewed before ArtSource was picked. “We liked what we heard from Sharon, and we liked what she’d done for other people,” Lichtner says.
For Poyner Spruill, a firm with deep North Carolina roots, Tharrington and her staff focused on works by Tar Heel artists and brought in a collection ranging from original paintings and a stainless steel pedestal sculpture to framed black-and-white images and prints.
“They added a lot of value to our space,” Lichtner says.
McClure says she and the staff often work from floor plans and e-mail images to a client for review. “This helps narrow down their likes and dislikes, as art is very objective and personal,” she says. “We want the client to end up with the best available art for their offices, within their budget, that will set their business apart from the rest.”
While ArtSource has made a name for itself among corporate clients over the years, it’s also built a healthy retail business at its galleries at North Hills and in the Five Points area of Raleigh. About 50 percent of the firm’s business comes from corporate clients, with the other half split between residential clients and gallery sales.
But change is afoot. Working from two locations has become a bit much for the partners. So by the end of June, both operations will be combined at North Hills, where the gallery’s space will be doubled.
The North Hills gallery has been displaying original art from local and national artists since 2005, which was when North Hills reopened after a tear-down and rebuild. Original art is consigned to the gallery for a certain period of time, and if the work doesn’t sell, the artists will bring in new works.
Gallery inventory can often range from a $16,000 original painting by South Carolina abstract expressionist Eva Carter to a $30 in-stock print. Plus, ArtSource has access to hundreds of artists around the country. “If someone wants a 30-foot sculpture, well, we don’t have it in the gallery, but we can get one,” Tharrington says.Active volcanism beneath the West Antarctic ice sheet and implications for ice-sheet stability

The guide to current South Asian official publications (PDF format, 388KB) focuses on British Library London Reference collections holdings of major (or recently ceased) official publications series from these countries in English. The exception to this rule is Official Gazettes, which are included for each country regardless of language. We have aimed to include the following categories of publication, where identified:
- Statistical series
- Census reports
- Development plans
- Legislative documents
- Official gazettes
- Parliamentary debates and papers
Obtaining a regular supply of material from South Asian countries is problematic and our holdings contain many gaps. Even when a serial is currently received, we may not have succeeded in obtaining the latest issue. However many South Asian governments publish extensively in full text on the web. Where we have found full text equivalents of printed material on the Internet, we have included the URL in the entry.
Most of these publications must be consulted in the Social Sciences Reading Room and cannot be delivered elsewhere. Except for the major reference works which are on open access in the Social Sciences and the Asian & African Studies Reading Rooms, nearly all foreign official publications are housed in a remote store and must be ordered 24 to 48 hours in advance.
The 'Guide to current South Asian official publications' (PDF format) is arranged in alphabetical order of country. Within each country, the titles are listed alphabetically. Each entry gives shelfmarks, British Library holdings, and some annotations.

If you aren't used to this you'll need to practice on the flat. If it's a stretch to reach you may need to adjust the reach as sogood suggested. This will also shift your weight forward and give you more traction on the front wheel in corners - but you will need to get used to how the bike reacts when you brake hard in this position.Start by pulling the brake on a bit, then smoothly increase the force until you are slowing down enough. If you feel skidding or the rear wheel lifting release the brakes, then reapply once you are back in control.You are *not* going to flick yourself over the front wheel unless you grab a handful of brake far too quickly without being prepared for the response of the bike.Rather than dragging a bit constantly, you want to let your speed run up, then bring it down, and repeat that process. Once you are used to doing this, you will see that you are in control of your speed, and the bike won't run away unless you let it.This will all take time practice and care to get used to. Start by short braking intervals instead of dragging the brakes, then you can start letting it go more as you get more confidant in bringing your speed back.I hope that helps, it's a harder thing to get used to than you expect!

SANTA BARBARA, Calif. - UC Santa Barbara will start an immediate national search for a new head women's basketball coach after Lindsay Gottlieb was named the new head coach at the University of California, Berkeley on Monday.
"Lindsay deserves great things in her career. She is a good coach and an even better person," said UCSB Director of Athletics Mark W. Massari. "What I truly loved about working with Lindsay, and her dedicated staff, was their complete desire to honor Coach Mark French's legacy of producing nothing but championships at UCSB. That is a challenge most do not want or would be able to thrive in. Lindsay did."
Gottlieb was named the fourth head coach in UCSB program history on May 15, 2008 after serving three years as an assistant and later as Associate Head Coach at Cal under Joanne Boyle. Boyle was recently named the head coach at Virginia.
"UCSB is a special place and the support for Gaucho women's basketball is palpable, both from the community and administration," Gottlieb said. "I would like to thank Chancellor Yang, Dr. Gary Cunningham and Mark Massari for the opportunity to be the head coach at such a prestigious university. I leave with nothing but respect and admiration for the athletic department staff and every young woman in the program. Continued success lies ahead for the Gauchos, and I will always feel connected to UCSB and the Santa Barbara community."
During her three seasons as the Gauchos head coach Gottlieb's teams won two Big West regular-season championships, one Big West Tournament title, made a trip to the NCAA Tournament and had one appearance in the WNIT. Gottlieb's overall record at UCSB was 56-39 (.589) and 36-13 (.735) in conference games.
"I want to thank Coach Gottlieb for the three beautiful years she has shared with our UC Santa Barbara community," said Chancellor Henry T. Yang. "She has been an outstanding coach and mentor for our student-athletes. She leaves behind a strong, cohesive, and spirited team that will continue to carry forward our proud tradition. We are sorry to see Lindsay leave us, but we are excited about this opportunity for her, and we will be glad to have a friend of the Gauchos at our sister campus up north. We will form a search committee to move ahead quickly to conduct a national search for our next head coach."
UCSB women's basketball has been the dominant team in the Big West Conference for the better part of two decades, claiming 15 Big West Championships and making 13 trips to the NCAA Tournament since 1992. The team is supported by the largest and most passionate fan base in the conference, continually leading the Big West in attendance.
"Moving forward we will look for the next leader of our storied program who will develop strong women on the court and in life," Massari said. "We are invested, as a campus, in women's basketball."
Mekia Valentine became the seventh Gaucho to be drafted by the WNBA earlier this month as UCSB ranks second only to Stanford in most WNBA draft picks by any school in the west.Philip Astley was a distinguished soldier who opened a riding school in Lambeth in 1768. Together with his wife Patty, Astley began to exploit the late Georgian fascination with outdoor spectacles by performing horseback tricks and equestrian skills to the paying public. Astley’s displays of horsemanship were gradually complimented by other visual spectacles of strength and skill, such as acrobatics and tight-rope walking. After his original premises were burnt to the ground in the late 18th century, Astley quickly re-established himself by opening his new ‘Royal Amphitheatre’ in 1795, itself rebuilt following a further fire in 1804 (and pictured here).
Astley’s Amphitheatre is often considered to be the first genuine British ‘circus’ owing to its many features that are still familiar today. Horses travelled at speed around a ring while acrobats and clowns also topped the bill. The Amphitheatre, however, combined other elements of performance more akin to traditional theatres, such as drama and song. Note in this image, for example, the combination of both a stage and circus ring in front of the audience. The Amphitheatre was particularly famed for its battle re-enactments that were often accompanied by explosions and sound effects, and which remained hugely popular with visiting Londoners well into the Victorian period..Presenting the first 2008 inductee to The Deadspin Hall Of Fame ...

But he made clear only one result is acceptable heading into a cycle that has a favorable map for the GOP. Cornyn said it would be a ‘disappointment’ if Senate Republicans are still in the minority in 2013.”

PALIN: “Former New Jersey Gov.

Whitman said, "I don't think she'll win nationwide. You've got to start competing for the center. And so far I haven't seen a lot of outreach on the part of Sarah Palin for that… If she were the Republican candidate she'd have to show me a lot more than I've seen thus far as far as an understanding of the depth and the complexity of the issues that we face. I mean, I don't know her personally. So I can't comment on that.”

Laws in this matter vary widely from state to state. For instance, in two, Maine and Vermont, convicted felons may vote absentee while they are incarcerated. Most states have some form of automatic restoration after felons serve their sentence or that plus parole and probation time. But, depending on circumstances, 11 states, mostly in the West and South, can disenfranchise felons forever if they choose to do so.
Please read below the fold for more on this subject.
In Florida, felons must appeal for a clemency ruling from the governor to get back their franchise. Governors there can flat out ignore those pleas and often do. In Arizona, felons who have been twice convicted are disenfranchised for good. In Nevada, only those convicted of non-violent offenses are given their voting rights back. Virginia requires that felons convicted of non-violent offenses now have their voting rights automatically restored. That is thanks to last year's action by former Gov. Bob McDonnell, who, ironically, could find himself a beneficiary of that move if he is convicted of fraud and corruption charges. Violent offenders in Virginia, however, must wait five years before they can appeal to the governor's office to have their voting rights restored. And the process can take several more years when it succeeds at all.
This is an instance when a federal statute should be passed to take precedence.
Nationwide, according to The Sentencing Project, 5.85 million Americans are barred from voting because of felony convictions. Because of disparities about who gets arrested, tried and convicted, one in 13 African Americans is disenfranchised. This has an impact not only on the individuals convicted but also on political power.
In a 2012 article in the University of Richmond Law Review about felony disenfranchisement in Virginia, Dori Elizabeth Martin wrote:
Felony disenfranchisement profoundly impacts the political opportunity available to minority communities. Using a procedure called the “usual residence rule,” the Census Bureau counts prisoners as residents of the district in which they are incarcerated.If the goal of temporary incarceration is rehabilitation, as is supposedly the case, how can a person be fully rehabilitated if he or she cannot exercise one of the basic rights of an American citizen? Not to mention the whole "taxation without representation" bit—can you truly say you're represented if you had no opportunity to choose your representative?
The result is often artificially inflated population totals in rural, majority white communities at the expense of the (largely minority) communities the inmates ordinarily would call home.
Of course, government funding and political representation are both functions of population, as determined by the Census, so the inmates quite literally increase the value of prison communities without reaping any of the benefits, while leaving their families and neighbors underrepresented. Critics of this system have compared its practical effects to the “Three-Fifths” Compromise in the original United States Constitution, which gave slaveowning states more political influence by including slaves in the population tallies for determining congressional representation.Did the LAUSD election results signal a change for charter schools?
Perhaps, possibly, maybe.
You can make a decent case that Rodriguez’s victory in District 5 points to strong support for charters. It was a battle between two well-funded candidates with diametrically opposed views on the issue. The effectiveness and fairness of charters were the core issues. The fact that the anti-charter candidate was an incumbent and still lost speaks volumes.
Not so clear in District 3.
For that matter, I do not think it was the issue that drove the campaign or had much of an effect on the outcome.
In my neck of the woods, where a popular charter school plays an important part of the social fabric, it was not a subject that came up at any meetings I attended, or in my informal chit-chats with informed residents who are active in Valley Village’s NC and homeowners’ association.
None of the mailers or canvassers played it up either; I assume both candidates stuck to a uniform message throughout District 3’s vast San Fernando Valley footprint.
What seemed to be the prominent concern among the 3rd’s likely voters was the competence of the LAUSD board members, specifically the lack of it with regard to incumbent Tamar Galatzan. Her opponent, Scott Schmerelson, delivered a message rooted in his extensive experience as an educator, and one who was thoughtful – not a person who would spuriously embrace the idea du jour as Galatzan did with the iPads, or latch on to a figure because he was perceived to be a rising star. As it turned out, a “rising star” who left the school system vulnerable to federal investigations. It makes me wonder if Galatzan has what it takes to serve the public in her other job as an assistant city attorney.
Establishing priorities was not in her wheelhouse. She was part of a culture where oversight was an afterthought. Over a billion dollars were wasted or inappropriately allocated at the expense of vital needs during her two terms on the board.
Schmrelson will not repeat her mistakes. I anticipate he will concentrate on delivering the best value for the money. That does not mean every worthy project will be implemented; it does mean the best, doable ones will be selected.
It is difficult to understand what was behind incumbent Vladovic’s easy victory over Lydia Gutierrez. How did the voters weigh his unprofessional conduct as a board member and track record of wasting money with her alleged Tea Party ideology? I think that had to be in play. It is difficult to ignore.
Vladovic enjoyed strong support from charter advocates, overwhelming Gutierrez’s puny treasury. You must hand it to her, though. She earned 45% of the vote against an incumbent despite her lack of funds. That would indicate a fair degree of public dissatisfaction with Vladovic and could adversely affect his re-election chances for LAUSD Board president.
Overall, Schmerelson racked up the most impressive showing of the night. His 18,146 votes were nearly double than Vladovic’s and easily surpassed Rodriguez’s total.
Schmerelson just might have the most positive public image of any of his colleagues.
It would position him as a go-to person when it comes to navigating controversial issues.?

Q-Tip deejayed the CoverGirl-sponsored soirée.In the wake of a July 10 ruling against traditional marriage in Colorado, a pastor from the Mile High City issued an unusual warning for Christians who uphold the Bible's teachings on sex and other moral concerns including abortion.
As much as believers should stand for their convictions on marriage and other culturally evolving issues, Christians should guard against a “spirit of religion” that points an accusing finger of blame and shame, according to the suburban Denver pastor.
“Righteousness must never include condemnation of those who fail to stand as we do, nor can it ever be allowed to lead us to withdraw love and grace from anyone,” says Pastor Loren Sandford, who believes the Biblical definition of marriage is a man and a woman.
Sandford, the charismatic pastor of New Song Fellowship, issued a prophetic bulletin “Stand Up To The Pressure” the same day two judges in different Colorado courtrooms considered same-sex marriage arguments. In it, Sandford cites biblical passages Isaiah 51:20-21 and 2nd Timothy 3:1-5.
Even as an Adams County District Court judge dismissed the state's voter-approved traditional marriage law, the Colorado Attorney General told a Boulder District Court judge that the county clerk and recorder is issuing licenses to gays in violation of state law.
Hillary Hall has issued more than 100 licenses since June 25, when a three-judge panel of the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver ruled that Utah's same-sex marriage prohibition is illegal. Hall, a Democrat, immediately began issuing licenses to gay couples.
The Boulder judge did not immediately order Hall to stop but said he will soon decide on Attorney General Attorney General John Suthers' request.
Then, on July 11, the judge denied Suthers' petition, prompting Hall and other clerks including Denver's to resume issuing marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples.
Long before the LGBT community began its push for marriage rights across the country, gays and lesbians found an ally in Boulder County, where a previous clerk issued licenses to gay and lesbian couples hoping to marry.
Though the city of Boulder leans to the left politically, other cities within the county are less liberal and some citizens resent Hall's defiance.
Judges' decisions and county clerks' actions, along with growing cultural acceptance of the LGBT's goals, present a dilemma for believers who find themselves at odds with – not just the corruption of society – but with spiritual forces that have been around for thousands of years, Sandford contends.
The pastor is the author of several books on prophetic ministry, and his parents are widely recognized as pioneers in inner healing.
“In biblical times, the source of pressure bore the name 'Baal' or 'Molech,' the demons worshiped by the nations surrounding Israel that pressured the people into compromising their faith and devotion.” Sandford says.
Today the demonic influence is secular humanism, post-modernism or simply liberalism but at root it's the same deception, the same old spiritual principality that has been at work for thousands of years, warping the thinking of entire cultures, Sandford believes.
“The relentless pressure of Baal and Molech upon the minds and hearts of men and women increasingly leads believers to accept as normal what God calls an abomination,” says Sandford, who admits to feeling the pressure on his personal life and ministry.
The pastor says he will not change his views on marriage or sexuality but will temper his convictions with God the Father's heart of love for those who disagree with him.
“I carry, however, another weight of concern that I find equally heavy, a temptation just as demonic as the spirit of Baal and Molech – the spirit of religion that seduces just as powerfully.” It leads to Pharisaical treatment of people in need of mercy and grace, Sandford says.
“I cry out, therefore, for us who cling to biblical truth to stand our ground for righteousness and a pure passion for God but to do so always in thoughtfulness and the love with which Jesus treated every sinner He ever met. Only the Pharisee stood worthy of his condemnation,” Sandford says.
While judges and lawyers argue who should be legally allowed to marry – inevitably all the way to the Supreme Court – Christians shouldn't conform to decisions with which they disagree, or alienate themselves from people who applaud biblical immorality, Sandford says,
The judge who dismissed Colorado's law preventing gays and lesbians from marriage immediately stayed his ruling until the high court hears arguments for and against the state's ban.
His decision makes the state the 16th to have marriage laws dumped by state and federal judges favoring same-sex couples' wishes.
Last week, lawyers for nine couples – 18 people in all – from Denver and Adams counties argued that the state's ban violates the U.S. Constitution.Red Moonrise Tonight

Technically, the Schpeltiger is just an oversized scooter, but by this logic, lions are just oversized cats, so we're willing to let it slide. With its giant back wheel, deep cushioned seat, and ultra-streamlined shape, the Schpeltiger looks like the retirement-home equivalent of the motorcycles from Akira. Which makes sense, because trying to navigate this behemoth through the streets of Santa Destroy can make you feel like a senior citizen whose Towncar just toppled its third mailbox this week. While it may be a bit unwieldy, no vehicle could better convey the personality and overall weirdness of Travis Touchdown better than a mega scooter named after what I can only assume is the fake German word for "tigerwizard."
5. Shiva Sisters (FFXIII)
Hey, remember how cool you felt riding that sweet Shinra chopper in FFVII? Remember how it was just a normal motorcycle and totally not two magical robot ladies in disguise? Remember that? Because Final Fantasy XIII sure as hell didn't.
If you're not familiar, each character in FFXIII has a unique eidolon that they can use to fight alongside them. Snow, the party's brawler, uses an ice-based summon known as "The Shiva Sisters," because of course he does. As mentioned before, once the Sisters enter "Gestault Mode" they intertwine their bodies and transform into a giant feminine motorbike that Snow can then use to trample his enemies. Yes, that is a real thing that happens in this videogame and not the description on the back of a Japanese motorcycle fetish porn DVD. Unfortunately, no, that doesn't make any of it less weird.
4. Wario Chopper (Super Smash Bros. Brawl)
Long before Mario shoehorned motorbikes into his Kart franchise, Wario was already the proud owner of his own chrome-plated bi-wheeled racing monstrosity. Wario always was way ahead of the rest of the Mushroom Kingdom when it came to stylin' rides; nothing makes you self conscious about riding a giant wind-up shoe than when your musclebound cousin comes screaming by in this badass hog.
Better yet, the Wario Chopper makes an appearance in Brawl as Wario's side-special move. To clarify, this is a move where you get on a motorcyle and peel out wheelies on your opponent's stupid face. And that's not even Wario's ultimate attack; he's just doing donuts on your back like it's no big thing. That single move alone could make Brawl the greatest fighting game of all time, unless I somehow missed the motorcycle-assist button in Tekken.

This book expands upon the idea of 'soft power' in international relations and investigates how it functions by looking at case studies in Japan-China relations during the post-war.One of the best roof services throughout all of New York would be Roof Pro Incorporation. Roof Pro incorporation was founded by a family in the year of 1989. The company’s goal is to provide the highest-level of roof fixing towards the customer. Their employees have ears of experience in fixing some of the most complicated roof situations. All of the employees will tell you, the customer what caused the roof to leak or to break. Roof Pro Incorporation will always finish the project from beginning to end so the roof could look and function the best in years, probably. With help from the roof Pro Incorporation, there is no way that your roof could possibly not function, look good, and not last a long time. The company’s employee are trained in a variety of fixing roofs, they can fix flat roofs round roofs and I can go on and on.
Another good company that fixes roofs would be the Yorkstate Roofing. The main objective for the Yorkstate Roofing services is to have employees fix, replace, and install roofs at the highest level of service to the customer. This company wants to have a long-term relationship with every single one of those clients. What set this company apart from other roof services is not the employees, it is not the head of the company, but it is their vision and experience that is what set this company from all the others. their employees provides a lot of different services to you; residential service, a service that involve families with or without garages attached to their houses, the employees can also fix flat roofs, they will get rid of the damaged roof and they will replace it with new roofs and the employees can do a good job fixing rubber roofs.
Manhattan Roofing contractors would be a really good example of another good roof servicing company in New York. The reason for Manhattan to keep fixing and replacing roofs is because they are fixing for the safety of the customer. Manhattan will always give you a free estimate and reasonable prices. One of the big goals for Manhattan is not only give high quality services to their clients, but also to save lives. The employees for this company are experts in the following services; roof repair and replacement, the employees can install roofs, and they can also fix flat roofs and so many other services.
With help from the company of Manhattan Roofing contractors, you will not have to worry about poorly fixed roofs for a long time; you can enjoy your time at the house and not worry about having to deal with repairmen that do not have a clue of what they are doing.
One of the more straightforward roof services would be Roof services. I think it is one of the bluntest titles that I have seen a business do, which is a good thing at times. This company is considered one of the best roof servicing company in New York because their employees are trained to put time and effort into fixing your roof, making sure that it is still function and then testing to see if the roof still works for you and for a long time, also their prices are reasonable too. Roof services’ main purpose throughout the world of business is to make sure that their employees perform some of the tightest roof services that New York has ever and maybe, America. The services that Roof Services offer to the people is very dynamic; residential roof, commercial roofing and maybe even more.Wireless Authors: Liz McMillan, Pat Romanski, Elizabeth White, Carmen Gonzalez, Tim Hinds

Tsunade should not be on vs threads. Her main ability is medical. she is a support character. Mizukage is a front line fighter with a kekeei genkai. Its not a fair comparison.
what tsunade did in the Pein arc, mizukage could never have done. That said in a fight, probably Mei.
Lmao i actually rofl but on my couch without moving or making a sound when i saw that Jmans Panties are winning the pole lmfao, Respect for the dead i guess?
I am going with tsunade since she is the underdog lol
if this was a mudwrestling match I would give it to tsunade hands down.
Now as far as a fight to the death, I would give it to tsunade based on where the fight is taking place.
If the fight is in an enclosed area with unbreakable walls, then mei will win due to here acid mist.
If its in an open area, then tsunade will probably win via strength, her regeneration, and her summon.
I am constantly saying 'probably' because we have only seen mei fight once, unless you count her kicking an offguard black zetsu.
Mei, i dont think Tsunade cud take Mei because Mei seems like a bad match for her and also Mei is very powerful.
If this is a real fight then I'd still go with Tsunade.
I still think people are underestimating her. The majority of people are saying Mei because of her Lava and Acid but that alone isn't enough to kill Tsunade. The way I see it, Tsunade's Genesis of Rebirth could combat Mei's Acid mist. Tsunade could just regenerate through the mist. Obviously not for an extended period of time but possibly long enough to make a different. As far as Mei's Lava goes I'm sure Tsunade can avoid it. She's trained to dodge attacks after all
its tsunade

That approach usually belly-flops, only reminding the reader that he’s looking at static images, showing everybody, in no uncertain terms, that movies move, and comics don’t. Novice comic book writers, on the other hand, simply pile on the words, robbing the form of its energy and vitality, often unintentionally insulting the reader by cluttering the drawing with descriptions of the drawing, making either the pictures or the words irrelevant, and boring the reader to distraction. Still, you gotta find a way to slow the reader down without boring him, or, worst of all, confusing him. A confusing comic book hits the trash can or recycling bin faster than junk mail.” .

A few details:
The link doesn’t work. Let’s try this:
Wolverine’s claws aren’t embedded on gloves as I’m sure most of us know. Perhaps they were thinking about Wolverine props but that’s not what they said.
They more appropriately should say they resemble ninja claw-like blades.
Batarangs are simply bat-shaped boomerangs (some of them with tech-enhancements). Throwing knives are throwing knives.
I could be mistaken (I don’t think so :p) but throwing stars are Japanese, not Chinese and they’re called shurikens. Unless they were talking about where they were made in. Nah… :p
The only actual comic-book related items I saw were bat-shaped shurikens.
What’s with the comic book comparison fixation? Is it fashionable to come up with possible comic book connections whenever possible now? The current trend in movies has certainly pushed comic book awareness. :p

Or a Spirit Dvd…Correction Appended
Texas recently passed a major legislation to help combat human trafficking.
Gov. Rick Perry signed House Bill 4009 last Thursday which establishes a human trafficking taskforce in the Attorney General’s Office and will develop policies and procedures for the prevention and prosecution of crimes related to the activity.
“Texas has always been, and continues to be, a leader in the modern day abolitionist movement, and this legislation is the first of its kind in the United States,” said Rep. Randy Weber, who authored the legislation, according to the Office of the Governor.
“Most people think human trafficking happens elsewhere in places like Thailand and Cambodia,” he said, “but the reality is that it is happening in our own backyard. In fact, the vast majority of the victims identified within Texas are actually our own citizens."
According to the U.S. State Department, nearly one in five victims of human trafficking in the United States travels through Texas, with Houston and El Paso listed among the most intense trafficking cities in the country. Between 14,500 and 17,500 people are trafficked into the United States each year, 80 percent of them women and 50 percent of them children.
For a growing number of Christians, the problem of human trafficking is seen as a modern form of slavery. Many Christian groups in recent years have joined the fight against human trafficking, maintaining that they must save God’s children from enslavement.
Christian anti-human trafficking activists often point to British abolitionist William Wilberforce who, because of his Christian conviction, tenaciously fought and ended the slave trade in the British Empire.
Last week’s human trafficking law was also made possible with the help of Christians – the Texas Baptist Christian Life Commission.
"The bill signing today sends an important message: 'human beings are not for sale in Texas,'" said the Commission’s director Suzii Paynter, according to Associated Baptist Press.
Paynter said the group has worked to raise awareness about human trafficking through legislative work and educating congregants.
“Sadly, the job is not done,” she noted. “The taskforce created by this legislation will continue taking steps to end human trafficking in Texas."
There are an estimated 27 million modern-day slaves around the world today, which is more than at any time during the trans-Atlantic slave trade.
Correction: Friday, Sept. 4, 2009:
An article on Wednesday, Aug. 26, 2009, about a human trafficking legislation passed by the state of Texas incorrectly reported Texas to be the first state to pass a major human trafficking law. Other states, including California, also have human trafficking laws.Archive for November, 2010

“…A call…reported a boat load of Haitians approaching our shores. I’m all for opening the door to refugees from totalitarianism but this is more complicated. These are just people who believe they can have a better life here. They are in fact illegal aliens. We’ll have to deport them but it’s a long & complicated business due to our own laws.” Ronald Reagan, The Reagan Diaries.
Out of compassion, or being kinder and gentler, or maybe as an act of love to the natural born citizens of his country, Reagan wanted to protect the borders and the sovereignty of the United States. Reagan also confided in his diaries about having to secure the border in order to protect the sanctity of citizenship.
In fact, Reagan argued that it was the government’s duty to “humanely regain control of our borders and thereby preserve the value of one of the most sacred possessions of our people: American citizenship.”
For Reagan, the Shining City on Hill was an example to the world and not the world’s land grant college, where everybody is admitted regardless of merit.
Jeb Bush is not like Ronald Reagan, despite some recent claims. The afore is just one diary entry by Reagan on the matter of secure borders. As he pointed out, coming to America just because one wanted a better life was not enough of a reason. Certainly not enough to break the law, notwithstanding the assertions of Governor Bush several days ago.
The facts involving the schism in the GOP are well known and documented. Teddy White first catalogued them in “The Making of The President, 1960.” Even before, Bill Buckley and National Review represented a threat to the ruling class of the GOP. Buckley, a product of the best the East Coast Elite could produce, was nonetheless a true American conservative revolutionary. “I will not cede more power to the state. I will not willingly cede more power to anyone, not to the state, not to General Motors, not to the CIO. I will then use my power as I see fit.”
Reagan knew that the establishment–which loathed him and which he was disdainful of, believed in the rule of law–except when it served their purposes to break the law. This now includes corporations which knowingly hire illegals, and then hire high-priced lobbyists to plead with Washington for amnesty from fines or prosecution for hiring illegal aliens in the first place.
Now the divide is even deeper and the fight more vicious between the outsiders and the insiders. Just consider the personal assaults aimed at the Tea Party movement.
The differences are no longer just ideology or geography but also economic and cultural. The Reagan wing as it exists today and the Bush wing really have little in common anymore. One is organized around the idea of freedom and the other around the notion of security.
Freedom and security as governing philosophies have little in common, in fact they are nearly diametrically opposed. Why else would establishmentarians like Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) denounce Edward Snowden as a traitor but others like the anti-establishment Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) and others celebrate Snowden as a whistleblower and patriot?
How freedom and security fit within the phrase “American conservative” is a good concept to consider. This is not about patriotism. It is about intellectual.
Even a recent sympathetic biography of the Irishman Burke by Jesse Norman said in his time Burke was denounced as “a blowhard and an irrelevance.” One scholar said Burke believed “revolution is the ultimate enemy of reform.” But as Founding Father Benjamin Rush said in 1783, “The American war is over; but this is far from being the case with the American Revolution.” American conservatism is centered around the belief in the continued intellectual American Revolution.
American conservatism’s biological fathers are John Locke, Thomas Jefferson and Thomas Paine, individualists, intellectualists, animated by the Enlightenment, the Protestant Reformation and the notion that power moves upwards from the citizenry to the government and not the other way around. What they prized was the freedom, dignity, and privacy of the individual, “endowed by their creator.” Reagan used the phrase
“Man with God” because he also believed in a spiritual individual.
Fittingly, Reagan frequently used one of his favorite phrases “We have it in our power to begin the world over again,” Paine’s powerful proclamation in Common Sense. (Reagan also often used the phrase “common sense.”) Reagan’s use of this idiom drove some High Tories and neocons around the bend because they had different beliefs in the origination of power, more akin to the Hamiltonian-Burkean notion of top down governance rather than the Jeffersonian belief in bottom up governance creating, establishing conflicting definitions of what ‘common sense’ was.
Therefore, Reagan believed the Cold War was winnable while the neocons rejected this as nonsense. They believed the Berlin Wall was a thing of permanence, the Soviet Union would exist forever and only the naïve thought anything else.
Which brings us to the Bush Dynasty. From the time George H. W. Bush stepped out of the Reagan shadow in 1988 and took the GOP in a direction away from Reaganism by calling for new government activism and seeing America as a nation of ethnic interests, rather than a singular creed of Americans, Bush ’41 and Bush ’43 never embraced the Reagan view of American conservatism.
The eight years of Bush 43 were an experiment in Big Government Republicanism. Republicanism experimented with the same temptations of power as that of Wilson and Roosevelt, notorious Democrats. Just as shiny federally led domestic imperialism, such as the New Deal, lost its gleam. The “common sense” touted by Reagan and his more ancient peer, Jefferson, held conservatives in line with the Florida recount and later September 11, 2001 ended nearly all internal debate. For a time.
The Bush Dynasty’s path forward led farther from its Reagan starting point. At 43’s second inaugural address, he extolled nation building like a true Wilsonian, and neo conservatism, sending off giant alarms in conservative circles. It was one thing to go into Afghanistan and all supported this but fourteen years later, most are asking what they hell are we still doing there? Iraq is considered by most conservatives as another failed Wilsonian adventure yet the establishment questions why American conservatives are skeptical about a US military presence in Syria or Ukraine.
And by 2006, after Harriet Miers, amnesty, bloated transportation, agriculture bills, new prescription entitlements for seniors, federal jurisdiction over marriage, and finally TARP and the bailout of Detroit, the American conservatives had had enough of the direction of the so-called conservative movement.
So the Tea Party rose up, embracing the tradition of American conservatism. In an attempt to preserve their power within the party the Bush wing denounced the Tea Party in the most personal terms and Bush himself called the Minutemen guarding the border “vigilantes,” a term of derision to those on high.
This political journey leads us to Jeb Bush. He represents the path taken by his father and brother, but also by Mitt Romney. He favors Common Core and “comprehensive” immigration reform and all sorts of mandates from Washington to the states, which is why he is having trouble with the Tea Party conservatives who embrace federalism. He should run. And Bushism should be put on trial and examined and judged, just as Reaganism was in 1980.
The GOP will never become unified until is decides what it believes. Bush should run if only to force that debate over what Republicans really stand for. Part of the reason Reagan won in 1980 was the field against him was divided. The establishment favored Ambassador Bush or John Connolly or Bob Dole or Howard Baker but Reagan forced the debate and moved the party to the right, where much of it is today.
In 2016 the right of center vote will be divided among Paul, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), and others, just as the conservative vote was divided in 2012, allowing the highbrow Mitt Romney to win the nomination.
If an outsider wins the nomination, establishmentarians can be counted on to hold their noses and be supportive, if only to maintain their proximity to power. But if an insider like Romney wins, it will be interesting to see if they can convince the Tea Party to stick around, as Mitt failed to do in 2012. Failing that, we could see the death of the modern, national GOP. And possibly the eradication of Reaganism as a governing philosophy.
Or, if Reaganism prevails again, as it did in 1980, 84, 88, 94 and 2006, we could see the departure of the neocons from the GOP, to go back to their natural home in the Democratic Party, where they were once call Trotskyites. And see Bushism fade as a valid governing philosophy.
This coming fight for 2016 will be the Gotterdammerung for the GOP–the “dusk of the gods”– as it will determine what it stands for, probably for a long time. No one can predict the outcome, but like Ali versus Frazier–or any contest over power–it will be utterly fascinating to watch.EPA New England Topics

A Chinese human rights activist has died after falling critically ill in detention after police denied her medical treatment for months, her brother has said.
Cao Shunli, 52, who had engaged in peaceful activism for several years, died from organ failure on Friday at a hospital in Beijing, after five months in detention.
Her lawyer, Wang Yu, told the AFP news agency that Cao became ill in November but police denied her access to medical treatment for more than three months. Authorities sent her to hospital only when when she fell unconscious after suffering organ failure in late February, the lawyer said.
Cao's brother, Cao Yunli, said. "The police are responsible. Her body was weak, she was sent to the hospital too late."
Cao was set to travel to Switzerland to take part in a UN Human Rights Council review last September but police arrested her at Beijing's international airport.
She had joined a rare protest outside China's foreign ministry in June to demand greater participation in the UN's review of human rights in China, according to London-based Amnesty International and other rights groups.
's ruling party maintains a close grip on power, and new leaders who took over in late 2012 have detained dozens of dissidents and tightened control over the Internet as well as social media.
China won a seat on the UN Human Rights Council in November along with Russia, Saudi Arabia and Cuba, despite fierce international criticism.
European countries and the US regularly condemn China on human rights, citing cases including its jailing of dissidents.
Beijing argues that its citizens enjoy increasing freedoms thanks to decades of rising prosperity.

10 Customer Experience Tips for Marketers
I recently published a blog series called 50 CX Tips: Simple Ideas, Powerful Results. While all 50 are valuable, here are the 10 most pertinent ideas for marketers.
Help customers achieve their goals
Don't push your products and agendas on customers. Instead find out what they want and create experiences that fit your company into their journey. USAA does this.
"We want to create experiences around what members are trying to accomplish, not just our products,” says Wayne Peacock, EVP of member experience at USAA. ."
Regularly refresh your brand promises
Starbucks CEO Howard Shultz once said, "Customers must recognize that you stand for something." While most organizations start with a clear brand promise, focusing on short-term goals can easily push them away from delivering on it. Decisions across an organization may seem reasonable in their immediate context, but they can collectively nudge a company off its course.
“Once an organization loses sight of its brand promise it will often spiral out of control. That's what happened to Starbucks in 2007. Shultz returned to the company in early 2008 to help restore the brand promise. His assessment of the situation: "We lost our way." Starbucks closed more than 7,000 stores on one day for a three-hour session to re-instill the brand promise in their employees..
Start your brand marketing internally
Brands need to be understood and “owned” by the entire organization. It's therefore critical for companies to invest heavily in communicating the brand value to everyone in the organization. Before BMO Financial Group's new brand went live the firm launched an internal campaign, “Brilliant at the Basics,” which identified eight actions that every employee could take, including “our heads are up, not down,” “everyone pitches in…titles don't matter,” and “help in choosing, not choices.” Employees were given a brand book that covered the brand principles, including a breakdown of what differed “tomorrow from today.” The launch kit for leaders and branch managers included a DVD and materials covering key messages, talking points, and anticipated questions and answers to prepare them to lead discussions with their teams.
Bring customers to life with design personas
What makes Jennifer such an important customer to retail store chain Big Lots that CEO David Campisi would mention her several times on a single earnings call? As it turns out, Jennifer isn't really a customer, or even a real person. She's a design persona, an archetype that represents a key customer segment.
Good design personas share these characteristics:
- Represent a key customer segment. It's not a random description; it actually think they know him or her.
- Provide information for decision-making. Just knowing generic information about a customer segment isn't good enough. Design personas must include key information about that person's needs and requirements for interacting with your company.
- Are widely used. Design personas create value when put to use, so it's important to get different groups across the organization to embrace them. It's a good sign when the CEO is referring to one of the personas by name.
Map your customer's journey
BMO Financial's approach to customer journey mapping includes both the customer view and the internal view. This way the company ensures that the customers' reactions are represented for each touchpoint, and that the impact of internal policies, training, measures, and targets for each interaction are also factored in. Internal stakeholder interviews and employee focus groups provide the view of “what we think happens,” while external research identifies customers' needs and wants as part of mapping the ideal experience.
Continuously test your value proposition
Samuel Palmisano revitalized IBM during his decade as CEO. He led the company using a framework based on four questions that he used to focus thinking and prod the company beyond its comfort zone:
1. Why would someone spend their money with you — what is unique about you?
2. Why would somebody work for you?
3. Why would society allow you to operate in their defined geography — their country?
4. And why would somebody invest their money with you?
Remove jargon from customer communications
BCBS of Michigan's “Clear and Simple” effort makes the business easier to understand and do business with. BCBS of Michigan's Customer Commitment guides the way the organization serves its members. It focuses the company on being easier to understand and do business with in every aspect—from language to business practices. The “Clear and Simple” effort, which involved more than 375 employees, generated more than 50 requests from across the business to help different areas become clearer and simpler.
Innovate around customer lifecycle events
Sovereign Assurance NZ's research shows that many new parents don't have time to review their life insurance, even though owning life insurance right after having a baby is more important than ever. The company developed a program called “Choose Precious” that offers new parents $10,000 worth of free life insurance up until their baby's first birthday. New parents just need to register at chooseprecious.co.nz before their baby is six months old. The company also rolled out its ‘Breathing Space' offering. Recognizing that buying a home is a big deal and that it's difficult to get the attention of home-buyers, the company offered home-buyers $25,000 worth of free life coverage for 90 days. This provided them with interim protection until they're able to evaluate their long-term protection needs.
Make your brand values explicit
Based on customer research, Safelite AutoGlass identified five brand values: trustworthy, reliable, safe, innovative, and helpful/approachable. These values have changed the way that customers are treated in a variety of ways, from how Safelite's contact center associates answer the phones to their field technicians using the“5 Ts” to highlight their helpfulness and approachability: 1) Time: Call customers in advance to notify them of arrival time. 2) Touch: Shake hands, make eye contact, and engage the customer. 3) Technical excellence: Do it right the first time, every time. 4) Talk: Tell the customer what you're going to do and do it. 5) Thanks: Show appreciation for choosing Safelite.
Measure yourself against your brand promises
Intersil, a semiconductor manufacturer, regularly surveys customers to measure how successfully its meeting its brand promise to be “Simply Smarter.” If the company finds that it's not living up to its brand promise, the organization uses a formal process to review the results and take action. In one survey Intersil found that customers were having a hard time finding information on its website. The company determined that this broke its promise to be “Simply Smarter,” so it invested in updating the usability of its online experience.. The results of the AMPLIFY (Apixaban for the Initial Management of Pulmonary Embolism and Deep-Vein Thrombosis as First-Line Therapy) trial are being presented on Monday at the annual meeting of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis in Amsterdam and are being published in the New England Journal of Medicine. (The embargo on the trial was lifted early by the Journal after being broken by Reuters.)
The AMPLIFY investigators randomized 5,395 patients with acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) to either conventional therapy with enoxaparin and warfarin or apixaban (10 mg twice daily for a week, followed by 5 mg twice daily for 6 months). The rate of recurrent symptomatic VTE or death related to VTE, the primary efficacy outcome, was 2.3% in the apixaban group versus 2.7% in the control group (relative risk 0.84, CI 0.60-1.18). This result met the prespecified criteria for noninferiority. In addition, apixaban was associated with significant reductions in the rate of major bleeding (0.6% versus 1.8%, RR 0.31, CI 0.17-0.55, p<0.001 for superiority) and the rate of major bleeding plus clinically significant nonmajor bleeding (4.3% versus 9.7%, RR 0.44, CI 0.36-0.55, p<0.001).
The results were consistent across a broad range of subgroups and were similar in patients who had pulmonary embolism and in patients who had deep vein thrombosis. The results were similar even when apixaban was compared only with those centers where warfarin was used most skillfully.
The study results “add to the evidence that the new oral anticoagulants are simple alternatives to conventional therapy for patients with acute venous thromboembolism,” the authors wrote.
Results from a related previous trial, AMPLIFY-EXT, showed that after patients completed a standard anticoagulation regimen, recurrent VTE could be safely prevented with an extended course of apixaban.
In an accompanying editorial, Mary Cushman discusses the role of apixaban and other new oral anticoagulants in the treatment of VTE. She reminds physicians that there is still an important role for Vitamin K antagonists and that they will not “disappear from practice.” She lists 6 “key components” in the selection of a new anticoagulant in VTE patients: patient preference, patient selection. drug interactions, complicance, follow-up, and monitoring. Currently rivaroxaban (Xarelto, Johnson & Johnson) is the only new oral anticoagulant with an FDA indication for acute VTE.News | April 26, 2012
Frost & Sullivan: Upswing In Demand For IPTV And Broadband-Based Video Services Stokes Growth In The World xDSL Test Equipment Market
Focus on enhancing QoS and QoE to activate demand for xDSL test equipment products
Singapore /PRNewswire/ -- The spike in demand for Internet protocol TV (IPTV) and broadband-based video service is a major factor spearheading growth in the world xDSL test equipment market. High bandwidth requirements for IPTV and customers' higher expectations of service uptime are forcing service providers to purchase the latest test equipment and service monitoring tools.
The IPTV network infrastructure is complex with many protocol layers, including the physical layer, asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) layer, and IP layer, present between the video source and the subscriber's TV. As the video stream passes through these various protocol layers, it is prone to audio drop-out, pixelization and distortion. Service providers understand the need to perform network testing to identify the exact location of faults in the network before those faults affect their customers.
New analysis from Frost & Sullivan (), World xDSL Test Equipment Market, finds that the market earned revenues of $279.0 million in 2010 and estimates this to reach $545.7 million in 2016.
"Simple DSL metrics are no longer sufficient to support QoE, which has resulted in an upsurge in demand for multilayer test equipment capable of testing the triple play architecture (voice, video and data) in real-time," says Frost & Sullivan Senior Research Analyst Srihari Padmanabhan. "Due to heavy competition in the service provider segment, QoE and QoS in the broadband service market will assume great importance in the future and enable growth in the xDSL test equipment market."
Wireless broadband technology is witnessing significant activity. Factors such as convenience (mobility), cost of deployment, and bandwidth are pushing subscriber migration from DSL to wireless broadband technology. As network equipment manufacturers develop advanced routers and modems to optimize the reach of wireless technology, the DSL technology market is expected to be negatively impacted, restraining uptake of new xDSL test equipment.
As service providers mull significant capital expenditure (CAPEX) investment in evolving technologies, such as high bandwidth video-based services, market uncertainty necessitates careful analysis of the expected return on investment. Furthermore, a sudden demand shift for a specific DSL variant might affect a service provider's business.
As the telecommunications space is witnessing fast-paced evolution, test equipment vendors must avidly invest in developing new products and technologies to cater to changing end-user requirements.
"The xDSL test equipment market is highly competitive, with many Tier-1 companies active in the market," says Padmanabhan. "This leaves manufacturers with little control over pricing, which results in reduced profit margins."
Due to pricing pressure from customers, test equipment vendors must revise their own pricing. To be successful in such a scenario, participants must perform a careful analysis of the expected return on investment and leverage their market intelligence information to tap opportunities that lie latent in the market.

Sort By:Things have been unfolding so quickly in the Penn State sex abuse scandal that it's been hard to keep up.
We went with the original column, but added a note that it was written before the firing. Then I recast the online version at about 1 a.m. so it would make sense today.
We weren't alone. Newspapers knew Penn State President Graham Spanier was a dead man walking, but the Paterno firing took a lot of them by surprise, rendering many of today's stories outdated.
I won't keep harping on this scandal, except maybe to use a column next week to relate what happened here to the broader subject of child sex abuse and the conspiracy of silence that helps perpetuate it. It's a subject I've written about a lot.
Today I just wanted to comment on the wide divide between people who still are supporting Paterno and those who felt he deserved the condemnation he was getting. It was fascinating to follow the response to my Sandusky Grand Jury Report post earlier this week. That headline was so Google-friendly that I attracted close to 80,000 page views and 125 Comments over two days, and except to occasionally correct factual confusion or in one case to ask people not to call each other names, I stayed out of it and let people battle it out.
My guess is that one reason for this Joe Paterno Gap is that not everyone has read the Sandusky grand jury report, which not only lays out the allegations of Jerry Sandusky's crimes but also the details of the alleged coverup. I'm convinced that unless they're so blinded by hero-worship that they can't see straight, most people will conclude after reading this report that no one involved in this scandal was entitled to continued Penn State employment. I offered a long excerpt the other day, and I dropped a link into the Comments Monday, but I'll offer another link to the grand jury report here. If you still feel Paterno has been treated unfairly and you haven't read this yet, I encourage you to do it.
Of course, even if you thought Paterno deserved to leave on his own terms -- a view I don't share -- you need to recognize that the best interests of the institution are served by excising all these guys from the football program and the university at large. There could be no healing as long as Paterno and assistant Mike McQueary (the original witness to the alleged sex assault, whose status is unclear at the moment but should not be on the sidelines Saturday) were coaching.
As far as I'm concerned, the Joe Paterno "legacy" should be the least of everyone's concerns right now. But assuming nothing even more damaging comes out regarding Sandusky's activities and Penn State's coverup, I suspect that Paterno will settle eventually into the kind of beloved-elder-statesman-on-campus status that he probably should accepted years ago instead of hanging onto the reins.
What happened this week or nine years ago won't be forgotten, certainly, and he'll never again approach his former iconic status as a coach who did things the "right way." But they still love him in State College, and I don't expect that to change.
Just a note about those who think Joe's Career was stellar - in 46 years as Head Coach, he brought only two national championships to PSU. Compare that to other coaches who coached at other institutions for much shorter periods of time and won many more national titiles. Its like having the Eagles or the Vikings or the Buffalo Bills go to the Super Bowl and never win. Who cares about the rest of the season.
My two cents
Lost my belief in God, but still had faith in Joe Paterno. Sorry he has to end such an illustrious career in this sad way. Paterno's legacy in Penn State history is all about winning with honor. 18th century philosopher & politician Edmund Burke said, "All that's necessary for the forces of evil to win in the world is for enough good men to do nothing." This is Joe's moment to make up for his failure to act when he first learned of the crimes committed by his subordinate coach. I'd like to think JoePA is willing to sacrifice his coaching career for the greater good, one of promoting the protection and welfare of the innocent, and to send the message that child sexual abuse will not be tolerated, no matter what the cost. JoePA would be the first to agree. We ARE --ALL--PENN STATE!!
As events evolve so can one's position. I finally read the grand jury report at 5 pm yesterday. Made the 10 pm firing news MUCH easier to swallow. Remember when PSU linebacker Dan Connor was suspended by the football program for several games for "prank calls to assistant coaches and other personnel". Connor was an All-American at the time.
Bill, guess who the calles were to? (Initials JS) And guess what obscenities were used? (Hint: unprintable words that start with f, h, and q but have the same meaning).
EVERYBODY KNEW. EVERYBODY KNEW FOR YEARS. AND THEY KNOW NOW.
By the way, the year was 2005 I think. For Connor's suspension.
David: I'll have to disagree with you on that one, David. Two national championships is nothing to sneeze at, and he could easily have won more, but the system of depending on polls worked against him. I think he needed to retire a long time ago, but when you consider his whole career, he produced very good teams year in and year out, and some great ones.
Joe, I thought the same thing about Connor, but I went back yesterday and unless this was another coverup, his prank calls were to a different former assistant.
and of course, what's the best way for the students of Penn State to continue to pledge their undying love for Joe Paterno? well, naturally, start a riot in the streets, and destroy a news van while yelling "FLIP IT! FLIP IT!"
That should even the score now.
Grand Jury = 1
Joe Paterno's supporters = 1
bunch of idiots.
Bill, Maybe you should pass along the URL to the grand jury report to your colleague Paul Carpenter, who seems more concerned with Paterno's legacy then the welfare of a 10 year old child.
Bill, I'm with you about McQueary. He's just as culpable as everyone else. Whether he called the police immediately upon witnessing the incident isn't really the issue. I can possibly forgive his omission for the first day or two, but when no action was taken and life went on as before, it was his responsibility to blow the whistle, and not just internally at PSU. I'm embarrassed and saddened by this entire debacle.
And something else to consider: If Spanier knew and covered this up, do we not think that the Executive Board of Trustees, including our illustrious Governor Tom Corbett, were also aware of what was going on? Do we really think that they were in the dark about this whole situation? I think this mess is going to get much bigger and much uglier before it's all over.
I have a feeling you're right about that.
According to this article, the assistant whom Connor harassed was Joe Sarra, not Jerry Sandusky, though perhaps someone could have assumed the wrong guy if only initials were given.
The article is from 2006
How long will it be before someone presents a petition demanding that the Joe Paterno statue be removed? How long before that's a daily question in The Morning Call?
Bill,
When we were growing up, Each of us were told to tell a teacher or a police officer if there was a problem. The person we told then took proper steps to correct the situation. We DID NOT KNOW if they were part of the situation. The same goes for Joe Pa. Joe was told of a situation, he took it to the proper people in charge ( A.D.Tim Curley and V.P.Gary Schultz). Unknown to him the people he reported to were part of the problem. So in my opinion he did do everything that was asked of him. He thought the situation will be taken care of. Does anybody hound the police or teachers to see if the problem was corrected? No!!! We ALL ASSUME that the people in charge will take care of it. Joe Pa is INNOCENT!!! It was unfair for The Morning Call to publish his photo along side of those accused of this terrible act. It made him look like one of the accused. This is another (Not just The Call) situation that the media becomes the D.A., Judge and Jury. And Yes, After everything came to light Joe realized that he got snookered. I'm sorry if it seems like that I'm venting. But, a lot of us in Pennsylvania are proud of Joe and his accomplishments and what he did for the school and the football team. Joe brought and put honor and pride in everything for this state. Yes, I could go on, But I will leave it as is. If you wish to publish this or make a reference to it, you have my blessings.
Michael Steven Cebrosky II
Lehighton, Pa.
Yeap, they'll still love em! Seems natural. NOT that Joe was snookered.
Perhaps blinded by the Blue and White.
The real question is: Why didn't Mike McQueary go directly to the police or even try to stop the assult on the boy?
I wonder if THAT answwer is blowing inn the wind?
Mike McQueary is still an asst. coach. Even after witnessing the assult on the 10 year old boy, Not stopping it and Joe gets crucified.
Crucified for acting like the Catholic clergy?
Michael and others: In my opinion, your expectations for Joe Paterno are much, much lower than they should be. Waiting a day and then kicking it upstairs to his "superior" -- no one was Joe Paterno's superior at Penn State -- is not the right thing. The right thing is to hand the telephone to McQueary and tell him to call the police, and once the proper authorities have been notified, to keep the athletic director in the loop. Joe's inaction laid the groundwork for several more years of abuse, assuming these charges are true.
Isn't Joe's superior the athletic director (Curley)? And you are correct, Joe should have had Mike contact the police immediatley. But what if the call was to the campus police? It would've went through Schultz. The other guy in the cover up. The abuse of the boys and the downfall of a icon has angered many. And, of course, we all want answers at once. I guess I'll have to lick my wounds and remember the one song by Styx : Show Me The Way. It is a sad day for our childhood heroes to become well below human.
Bill,
First thing I would like to say that I read your article Silence Fuels Child Sex Abuse. I thought it was outstanding.
Second, according to Joe Holden (Fox 56 News), it was Mike McQueary that did not report the abuse till the next day, to Joe.
I know this doesn't make up for anybody sitting on such a disgusting, sick, perverted,situation/act that should have been reported at once.
But, we all jumped the gun ( the investigation is on going) not knowing all the painful facts.
Thanks on the column, Michael, but Joe sat on it another day before he told Curley. According to the grand jury report, Curley didn't find out about it until Sunday.
I did not know that. Thank-You Bill !!!
Paterno did the right thing by reporting the incident to Curley, and, if Curley and Schultz had done the right thing, no one would be questioning what Paterno did. It's what he didn't do after Curley and Schultz made their final decision that's in question. At that point, though, it was solely up to McQuery, as the accuser to pursue it further. If he had gone to Paterno, expressing dissatisfaction with Curley and Schultz's decision, then Paterno may have been morally obligated to urge him to go to the police. Apparently McQueary didn't do that.
And Curley and Schultz waited a week and a half to talk to McQueary.
So Paterno gets his name removed from the Stagg-Paterno trophy, gets fired, his statue is about to be removed, and he is being turned into a pariah because someone he once knew and worked with allegedly committed a terrible crime? He reports it to his superiors and expects them to deal with it and investigate as he did not witness the deed himself and they cover it up. None of the alleged crimes were committed by Paterno and yet he is the major focus of ever story and all backlash short of actual imprisonment because he is the best known name in the story. Meanwhile Sandusky may be on trial but they mention him on the news for 10 seconds and then devote 10 minutes to villifying Paterno.
I could care less about Penn State football but don't Paterno's various "punishments" seem a little out of context with what might have actually happened? Or at the very least couldn't they have waited until Sandusky was convicted and any involvement by Paterno in a cover up proven and not just hinted at?
Well, Sandusky just was interviewed on national TV by Bob Costas, is facing the rest of his life in prison and meanwhile probably can't show his face anywhere without people hissing or much worse, so I don't think he's exactly getting off easy. I had the same reaction you did to the statue story, which apparently is untrue, and I didn't like the decision on the trophy either. However, I did think everyone involved with this alleged coverup needed to be removed from the program, just based on the grand jury report, including Paterno's testimony.
I agree with HR.
Bill, As you said, it's an alleged cover-up. What happened to the presumption of innocence? Considering the good he's done during his long career, I think Paterno deserves the benefit of the doubt.
Presumption of innocence is a legal term, does not apply to the real world, only to courts. Because Mr Enron, Ken Lay, died before he could appeal his conviction, according to the law he was NOT a convict. Do you believe that? Penn State is just another case of the rich and powerful circling the wagons to protect each other.
Obviously, the presumption of innocence doesn't apply in the tabloid version of the real world.
There was hard evidence in the Enron case. This attack against Paterno, is all based on conjecture. The vast majority of the media want you to believe that Paterno knew about all of Sandusky's actions, and orchestrated a cover-up to protect the football team, putting football ahead of the well-being of children. Really? There are absolutely no facts to support that, but people love a scandal, and love to bring down prominent people.
To be realistic, if Paterno had wanted to cover up the incident, it never would have left his living room the morning McQueary told him about it.
Obviously you have an irrational view of this, so I don't expect you to really think about what I've said. Still, I can't help but keep trying.
It was not an active cover up, Joe just failed to do anything about following through on what he knew. The results were the same, more years of child abuse. If he would have actively tried to cover up, the facts would make it obvious he did so. He chose to not be involved at all after telling one thing one time, to be legally correct and morally disgusting. Inaction = cover up.
You don't know what conversations took place after he reported it to Curley. There is nothing in the grand jury report about that. Maybe he followed up with Curley, and was told that they had reported it to the authorities. Maybe they told him that they investigated it and determined that it wasn't what McQuery thought it was. We don't know. When we find out I'll readjust my opinion. As of now he's only guilty of assuming that Curley and Schultz did what they were supposed to do, and he's paying much too big a price for that. The lynch mob is treating him and everyone involved with the university as if they are all child molesters.
Lynch Mob? Joe Pa was forced to retire 2 months before he wanted to retire, after working there since 1950. What a heavy price. Working until age 80 is greedy.
By lynch mob i'm talking about the people who are demonizing him in the media, destroying his reputation, vilifying the entire university, and treating anyone who supports him as if they condone child molestation. All based on speculation.Online Fax Service Reviews

Here's good news: people can now text 911 in an emergency instead of having to call. Definitely helpful, but there are still frustrating limitations to the service.
The four major wireless carriers - AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon - have all gone live with support for national text-to-911 programs as of Thursday.
The service is meant for instances when people are hearing or speech impaired, if there is not enough signal to connect a phone call, or when calling could be dangerous, such as in a domestic abuse or kidnapping situation.
A social worker tells KSHB, "Being able to do the text instead of make the phone call could be a way to reach out for help without escalating the violence of the situation," .
But just because the networks support the service it doesn't mean the call centers themselves can receive those text messages. As of now, only select counties in 16 states are able to.
Check the Federal Communications Commission website to see if your county is equipped for emergency response to texts. If your call center can't receive texts, your phone will show a bounce-back message instructing you to call instead.
As Government Technology reports, the FCC is urging more states and counties to accommodate the service, but it will be a long time before the 6,000 call centers across the country can adapt.
Emergency officials can receive basic geolocation information from text messages, but its not quite enough. WISH spoke to the communication director for Tipton County in Indiana, which has implemented the texting service.
CHRIS BELL: "Once you ask for that help, our next question is immediately going to be, 'What is your location?' Because we need to know your location so we can get you help. That's probably the most important part of that text."
It's that kind of information stop-gap with texting that has officials saying its still best to call if you can, TechCrunch reports. Emergency dispatchers can often get important information just from listening to a phone call. CNET interviewed a dispatch supervisor on the topic:
KELLY MURCH:  the background.'"
What's more, the text-to-911 service could take much longer than dialing for a few reasons. For one thing, it takes longer to type and send texts than speak across a phone line.
And there's another factor. 911 calls are currently given priority in networks, and 911 texts will be treated as any other message, meaning it could take much longer to reach the dispatch center.Image Unavailable

Read morePublished on April 1 2004 by K. WeemsAriel Winter, the brainiac middle child on the hit comedy "Modern Family," proved she's got style. The actress was stunning in a strapless silver and gold beaded gown while attending the Gracie National Awards in Beverly Hills.
Winter played up her natural good looks with the perfect amount of makeup. She rocked a stunning cranberry red lipstick with a lip gloss finish and added tons of pink blush on her cheeks using makeup brushes. The actress played up her big doe eyes by rimming them in jet-black eyeliner using a fine liner brush. She then applied eyeshadow in shades of metallic silver, gold and pink to her upper lids and swept a bit of the pink hue on her lower lids as well. Winter finished off this va-va-voom style with long false eyelashes.
The actress's killer cosmetics worked perfectly with her stunning floor-length gown. The bodice of the dress was covered in an almost coral reef-like pattern adorned with silver and gold beading for more drama. The fabric of the dress changed at her waist into a flowy silver material with tiered ruffles. She kept her long locks down in elegant waves.
The sex differences that have been identified are small and statistical... Scientists agree there is much more overlap than difference between boys and girls in their brains and behavior...But won't they do that outside of school? What I mean to say is that, at the very least, you have to concede that boys and girls tend to distract each other. As for all that other stuff, I think studies of sex difference are pretty crude and result-oriented, but we ought to care about the way generalizations — even generalizations supported by decently run studies — are used to limit or discriminate against individuals. My instinct — possibly feminine! — is to let different experiments in education take place. Let's judge those particular schools individually, and not stereotype single-sex education as either sexist or a cure-all.
[T]he idea that “boys and girls learn differently” is unsupported by scientific evidence. Decades of research have failed to identify reliable differences in the way male and female brains process, store, or retrieve information. For example, the popular idea that “boys are visual learners” and “girls are auditory learners” is simply untrue....
While single-sex schooling does nothing unique to improve academic achievement, gender segregated classrooms are detrimental to children in several ways. First, research in developmental psychology has clearly shown that teachers’ labeling and segregating of social groups increases children’s stereotyping and prejudice.... Developmental research finds better mental health outcomes among children who develop a mix of traditionally masculine and feminine skills and interests — like playing competitive sports and discussing emotions — compared to more one-dimensional peers.
Most importantly, single-sex schooling reduces boys’ and girls’ opportunities to learn from and about each other....

Rebecca Bigler, a professor of psychology and women’s and gender studies at the University of Texas, and Lise Eliot, a professor of neuroscience at the Chicago Medical School, push back against what they call the "pseudoscience" of single-sex education:

I think the sub-text is: without males to exploit and/or punish for being male, how can schoolgirls succeed and/or have self-esteem?
With males educated separately, females would have to succeed strictly on merit, and that simply won't do.
Even worse, having males educated separately, that might actually allow males to learn without being considered abnormal/aberrant. Horrors!
If Becky Bigler does not have a son named Burke, I will be so disappointed.
The sex differences that have been identified are small and statistical...
[T]he idea that “boys and girls learn differently” is unsupported by scientific evidence.
For example, boys who spend more time with other boys become increasingly aggressive; girls who spend more time with other girls become more sex-typed in their play.
Having grown up as the only boy with three sisters I can tell you that there is a huge difference between how boys and girls brains function.
I also went to an all men's college but had no problem learning all I needed to know about the opposite sex (and sometimes more than I wanted to know).
If you can just get normal boys away from the feminist/Women's Studies/Schools of Ed bitches they'll do just fine. If that means all boy schools, so be it. Boys just need to be away from the "have you considered Ritalin for Jason" ineffective, clueless, dimwitted female teachers. Just sayn'.
"Developmental research finds better mental health outcomes among children who develop a mix of traditionally masculine and feminine skills and interests — like playing competitive sports and discussing emotions — compared to more one-dimensional peers."
-- Why don't schools teach boys to discuss emotions and let girls play competitive sports?
The people oppose homosexual education? Egad.
Oh, never mind.
If it were about children actually learning basic skills and knowledge, single sex would be the way to go, especially for boys. If it's about gender ideology, put the boys and girls together.
Then what explains the huge effort alter--to feminize--the school experience, from the "girl crisis" over a decade ago (more math), reducing competition (eveyone wins no score kept), allowing girls to play on boys sports teams...
Separate but equal is not equal, said a famous Supreme Court case.
The separation of females has always been a quasi religious choice of the Patriarchal Traditions of the parents.
The WWII experience new point of view had pretty well ended that in the USA by the 1980s.
Today's female re-separation push comes primarily from the Lesbian Community. Or we can pretend that is not so if it is more politically correct to be blind.
Studies, statistics, and bs
Who cares?
My daughter attends the same, 200+-year-old girls school that I attended. Having gone to both coed and single-sex schools, I know the differences and I know why single-sex is better for most girls, especially when they are pubescent.
That study is just for people to assuage/rationalize what they are probably seeing in their daughters as middle school hits them full force.
I'm still trying to picture how a Women's Studies professor pushes back against pseudoscience. By changing careers?
I've always been torn on this - I can see a lot of the rationalizations, particularly the distraction issue, but I've always thought that I learned a little bit more like the boys, and I don't much care for groups of females (the idea of working at a female dominated workplace makes me cringe), so I would expect that I would have been miserable in a same sex-education.
Ah, I recall with fondness my fourth grade classroom when some of the girls started to develop and the boys learned how to drop pencils.
you have to concede that boys and girls tend to distract each other.
Why do you have to concede that? If you do concede that, how is the distraction MORE distracting than distractions from same sex peers?
only boy with three sisters [...]

After 3 sisters, what was left for you to learn in college?
Seems like the Post might have mentioned that the authors of the article, Bigler and Eliot, are the Executive Director and Communications Director of an advocacy group named "American Council for CoEducational Schooling".
."
Interesting phrasing, suggesting inherent bias.
They added a pejorative descriptor to the boys while generalizing the girls.
Why not say, "boys and girls who spend more time with their own sex become more sex-typed in their play."
The statistically significant dominance of women in colleges (57%) is a bit alarming and needs an explanation too, unless of course equality is not the goal.
Earlier studies by the same authors suggest that this unequality is a merit and not a bug of the current system. link.
Lyssa -
Why are you "torn". The point is to allow choice to kids who might not be like you.
And the 200-pound elephant in the room is that only girls are allowed to have single-sex schools in the US.
If there is truly no difference, then why do women need single-sex schools? And if there really is a difference and women do gain some advantages from single-sex schooling, then why isn't it OK for boys to share in that advantage? It seems to me that if we acknowledge that the sexes are indeed different and that each has different strengths (and weaknesses) then we can judge the case for single-sex schooling better. But to claim that women should have single-sex schools (remember the screams when Mills College considered admitting men some years back?) while screaming that it is sexual oppression if men have single-sex schools is hypocritical at best.
I don't know if all boys (or girls) would prefer a single-sex environment. Probably not. but for those who do, it should be an option. Just my two cents.
Why use the term "scientific evidence" rather than just "evidence"?
The sex differences that have been identified are small and statistical... Scientists agree there is much more overlap than difference between boys and girls in their brains and behavior...
Isn't it just as true that the genetic difference between humans and chimps is "small and statistical"? And that there is much more overlap than difference between human and chimpanzee brains and behavior?
I have often wondered what happened to me. All boys high school. That explains it !
Interestingly, I helped my high school girlfriend (different all girls school) with her algebra and she is now president of the women engineers association.
I suppose our home school is sex segregated as we only have sons.
A friend visited a kindergarten class at her local public elementary school. The class runs from eight to three. There are two fifteen minute recesses. The students mostly sit at desks and do worksheets. While she was there, one student was sent to the office for repeatedly talking out of turn. (Imagine putting a five year old boy into that environment!)
Unsurprisingly, my friend's child, a girl, will be attending a private school this fall.
chickelit said: The statistically significant dominance of women in colleges (57%) is a bit alarming and needs an explanation too, unless of course equality is not the goal.
Precisely - equality is not the goal. I find it interesting - though entirely unsurprising - that the press doesn't care that men are more and more marginalized in the 'higher educational' institutions. If these numbers were reversed, we'd have screaming headlines about a crisis for women and the usual suspects would be howling about sexual oppression.
wv: procku. In favor of Calvin Klein Underwear? Hmmm...
I suspect that these women have come to understand that single sex schools are probably beneficial to one sex but not to the other. I'll let you guess which is which.
I had 9 years of public school then 4 years of high school in an all-boys high school. I don't know jack about the current conventional wisdom regarding the difference between how boys and girls learn, but it was obvious even as a 13 year old that not having girls to impress made it a hell of a lot easier to concentrate on school. I think it worked the same for the all-girls high schools. Sometimes I'd drop off my gf at her all girl's high school and all the chicks were horrified to see a boy when they hadn't bothered to do their hair or makeup. Probably saved them all a half an hour of "prep time" every day.
"I don't know if all boys (or girls) would prefer a single-sex environment. Probably not. but for those who do, it should be an option. Just my two cents"
Absolutely. Single-sex is NOT necessarily right for all children, and I don't even ascribe to any of the "pseudoscientific" supposed claims by the single sex schools that this studies' authors disavow anyway. Those are very "strawman" to me.
We are fortunately where I live in that there are all-boys options for my son as well (my daughter's school has a "brother school"). And I do think that is also beneficial, however I don't have the personal experience to know for sure.
I do know my children thank me every day for their schools. They absolutely love them.
And they get PLENTY of coed interaction - for example, at home!
Let us all have choices, not just those of us with money to burn (me, apparently!). Lets just see what's best. Children ARE different. Mine are very shy. More outgoing, extroverted children probably don't have such a strong need for single-sex ed.
"Most importantly, single-sex schooling reduces boys’ and girls’ opportunities to learn from and about each other...."
This is very true. MY seventh and eighth grace classrooms were sex segregated.
On entering the sex-integrated classrooms of the ninth grade, I quickly learned to sit two desks in front of and one row to the left of a particular Becky J.
I still have fond memories.

WTF ????
Let's see.
We need diversity of color to assure an appropriate educational environment for all students, black or white. But we also need to separate males and females because they are "different?"
Can't anyone think straight anymore?
(I went to single sex schools from third grade through the end of college. There was no lack of female distraction nevertheless. I do think coeducation would have been better for me, personally. I demand reparations.)
After 3 sisters, what was left for you to learn in college?
How to talk?
I really dislike this notion that Boys learn one way and girls learn some other way, because it gives a student a crutch to say: Oh, I can't learn that way, and they shut down.
IME The brain is a very nimble organ and it can be trained to do just about anything with sufficient motivation, but if you tell someone upfront that they can't do something one way, you're just setting them up to fail.
So what is inherently wrong with having narrow skill sets and interests and being sex-typed in your play? And as the mother of two boys, I can tell you that teachers treat boys and girls differently in the class room even if there is no difference in the way that they learn. Same sex classrooms protect students from the sex based bias of teachers.
Why are you "torn". The point is to allow choice to kids who might not be like you.
Oh, no, I have no problem with allowing choices! I only am torn on what is the "better" way across large populations, and what should public schools adopt, particularly in areas where it might not be practical to have multiple schooling options.
Girls *DO* mature in a lot of ways earlier than boys do. Young boys, in general, are still extremely excitable and emotional when girls are already learning to sit quietly and get their work done.
Holding the entire group to the same standard at every step of the game is insanity, but of course it sounds 'fair' so that's the way it's done.
In Massachusetts, for example, single sex schools are ILLEGAL. Tells you pretty much everything you need to know about that state.
Should single sex schooling be compulsory? Of course not, but ruling it out based on some intellectual fairness nonsense is a tragedy. Ruling it out based on the idea that girls and boys are, in fact, exactly the same and that there are no differences of any sort between the two is just insane.
But it sounds nice, and that's all that really matters to some people.
If more boys went to boys schools, fewer by far would end up in jail, the only boys school currently available.
FH said: A friend visited a kindergarten class at her local public elementary school.
Do most schools allow someone to just do that - sit in on the classroom even if you don't have a student there?
If so, I've got to get on that before this baby starts school. Never would have occurred to me.
For example, boys who spend more time with other boys become increasingly aggressive; girls who spend more time with other girls become more sex-typed in their play.
This isn't an educational outcome, but psycho-social.
I don't see the opposite sex as being that big of a distraction. Sure, we like to look at some of them and fantasize. But, most of the real distractions came from one of my buddies playing pranks on me (putting a tack in my seat, etc.), and other annoyances, not the presence of a young beauty with budding buds.
Do most schools allow someone to just do that - sit in on the classroom even if you don't have a student there?
Yes. We did this with kid #1 way way way back when. Wow that was a lifetime ago.
"For example, boys who spend more time with other boys become increasingly aggressive; girls who spend more time with other girls become more sex-typed in their play.
And,
"The sex differences that have been identified are small and statistical."
1. So, there's no substantive difference between girls and boys.
2. BUT when girls and boys are separated, the girls become more girlish and the boys become more boyish?
Do the authors not see the tension between these two assertions and, if so, why do they make no attempt to explain it away?
I don't think anyone is advocating that co-education be banned. Yet these authors seem to be arguing that single-sex education should never ever even be offered.
Is their case truly strong enough to carry the burden of proof necessary to say, "That choice should never be offered because this is so obviously superior?
For example, boys who spend more time with other boys become increasingly aggressive; girls who spend more time with other girls become more sex-typed in their play.
That must be a non-overlap.
Why use the term "scientific evidence" rather than just "evidence"?
Because actual experiments were devised and conducted.
The "men are visual, women are auditory" trope has been disproven by hundreds of studies, but it keeps on chugging. I believe its because it's a convenient way to make excuses.
Watching siblings, peers, my children and how I learn, I've concluded that learning has a large genetic component that is independent of sex.
A second major influence on educational outcomes is parental expectation--not involvement, but expectation. However, it seems this also has a genetic component.
As the very important differences between Apes and Humans is a matter of a very small percentage of genetic makeup, why would not some such differences between boys and girls make a shift in the "Bell Curve" as to academic outcome?
There are plenty of fine girls-only schools out there.
They're called "colleges."
"Why use the term "scientific evidence" rather than just "evidence"?"
Individual experiences and incidents are evidence that we make inferences from. Most of what we know about people uses that kind of evidence, because you can't really experiment with people that much or that well.
In law, we define evidence to mean *anything* that makes a fact in issue more (or less) likely, even by a tiny degree.
Michael K,
Congrats on your girlfriend being head of the women's engineer's association.
My daughter is a very successful Chemical Engineer and if she told me she was even a member of a women's engineers association, I would be most upset. I think I raised her better than that. If she is not good enough to be head of the Engineers Association, why should she be able to participate in a 2nd rate organization?
What is the point of a womens engineers association? An association for those not quite good enough for the regular association?
BS.
This whole lopsided idea that women can have women's associations for women only but men can't have men's associations for men only stinks.
Ditto whoever it was who beat me to saying that single sex education is for women only. When there is a all boys school, they get sued until they admit women. All girls schools are sacred.
Or scouting. I remember some years ago seeing Gloria Allred on the tube with a client suing to get into a boy Scout troop. She was quite clear that she was against any boys trying to infiltrate Girl Scout troops.
John Henry
The males overlapping the females is not a defect, unless the females like to be overlapped by other females.
I demand to hear Camille Paglia's views on this. She believed that there are enough laps to go around for everybody, both male and female. Or there were before the sex selection abortion fad became cool and so many laps were terminated.
But won't they do that outside of school?
But why would we ever let them out of school?
Single-sex education might be the only way to get boys educated, since most teaches at public schools seem to not give a shit.
The most important thing is that all children be processed identically so they are fungible and can be reliably used meet the needs of the greater good.
I don't know about the "scientific" validity of same sex education or it being more or less helpful for either sex.
HOWEVER, this comment is more valuable if you want good educational outcomes
Forget single-sex grouping. If you really want to improve the schools, end the single-age grouping. The idea that a 5-year-old from a home with semi-literate parents or no books, a 5-year-old who has been read to from birth, and a 5-year-old who has been reading to himself for a year should be in the same reading class is ridiculous.
Seriously. Children should be placed into classes where they are challenged to the appropriate level and are able to learn....even if it means that the ages of the students are different.
My brother graduated from high school at the age of 15. Until he was placed into more challenging courses, he was a discipline problem, disrupting the class and bored out of his mind. If they had drugs for boys in those days, I'm sure he would have been doped to the gills just to make the teacher's class time more peaceful. Thank GOD we didn't have that barbarity then.
My daughter was reading from the age of 3 yrs old and when placed in kindergarten was reading at a 4th grade (at least) level. Fortunately, the teacher in our small school system recognized that and gave her more advanced books to read.
Those students who are not able to handle the course work should also be placed into appropriate level classes, where they won't be so discouraged and can learn at their own pace.
Of course, non of this will happen because it would force the liberals to admit that everyone isn't exactly equal.
non = none
/sigh
I would have absolutely hated to be in an all girls school. The unending drama and petty cruelty of teenage girls cannot be underestimated.
It doesn't stop either when they become adults. The worst working experiences of my life have been in offices with nothing but a bunch of women.
"My instinct — possibly feminine! — is to let different experiments in education take place."
So you support school choice.
Can I hear a state's rights?

Not sure if がんこもん is right about girls' schools since my alma mater (K - senior high) is still all boys, but I wonder if the revelation that sex-selective abortions run in favor of boys (and thus fewer girls for all girls schools) has anything to do with it.
In any case, the "research" and "evidence" quoted is so much nonsense. My class ran the gamut from macho jocks to quiet nerds and everything in between, but I'll bet academic achievement is a little better with all boys simply because of the lack of hissy fits and crying jags.
And no soap opera.
I always thought that an all-girl school would be torture, too.
I wonder, though... would the girls act differently without the boys around? Drama and petty cruelty-wise, I mean.
For me, the biggest part of the case for single-sex schools is the same as the case for school uniforms: Put post-pubertal kids in a position where they can compete to attract the opposite sex, and they will do it, sometimes to the exclusion of anything else. It seems to be fairly mild until 6th grade or so, but at that point it escalates unbelievably fast.
It would be nice, as well, for boys in the elementary-school grades to have some experience of male teachers, and boys' schools are honestly about the only way they're going to get any.
(Never went to a single-sex school, but my husband taught at one -- a girls' school -- for a decade.)
Michelle, after 3rd grade, all I had was male teachers, most of them WWII vets to boot.
On occasions, it was quite a trip.
Balderdash.
My wife and I both attended single-gender schools for 14 years - pre-Kindergarten through High School. She even attended a single-gender college, so she never, ever had a class with a boy (or young man). My state university went Co-Ed in 1970, my first year there.
We turned out just fine, thank you very much. Our three children did, too.
Clearly some girls and some boys would benefit from same-sex education and others would not. The problem on both sides is this ridiculous notion that all girls and all boys would react the same.
This is what happens when you treat people only as members of a group and not as autonomous, unique individuals.
It's the source of any number of social policy screw-ups, not the least of which is Bloomberg's soda-banning nuttiness.
"In Massachusetts, for example, single sex schools are ILLEGAL."
My alma mater will be shocked to hear this "fact", since they've been an all-boys school for more than a century and are still going strong. In Massachusetts.
The lead author the of the paper, Diane F. Halpern, is not a scientist, she is a psychologist. Last time I checked pstchology was considered a humanity, not a science.
The WaPo article says:
. . . the idea that “boys and girls learn differently” is unsupported by scientific evidence. Decades of research have failed to identify reliable differences in the way male and female brains process, store, or retrieve information.
Why is the word "reliable" used instead of "significant"? What does "reliable" mean in this context? Have decades of research provided reliable evidence that there is no difference in the way that males and females process, store, or retrieve information?
The sex differences that have been identified are small and statistical — not a seven-fold effect. Scientists agree there is much more overlap than difference between boys and girls in their brains and behavior. That is, boys differ more among each other in academic and social skills than they differ from girls, and vice versa. Placing children into classrooms based on their gender and — and making assumptions about their physiology, brains, interests, and learning ability — will virtually guarantee that teachers’ expectations are biased and their gender-based practices are misguided for most of their students.
Is the last sentence a scientific statement?
A letter in response to the Science paper:
In their Education Forum “The pseudoscience of single-sex schooling” (23 September, p. 1706), D. F. Halpern et al. claim that there is no evidence to support positive effects of single-sex education. They acknowledge that “without blind assessment, randomized assignment to treatment or control experiences, and consideration of selection factors, judging the effectiveness of innovations is impossible,” yet they cite only those studies that support their thesis.
If find the entire tenor that genders can be divided into only two clear and distinct groups quite disturbing. Genders run the spectrum from complete and utter flaming homosexuality to strict male-female heterosexuality.
In between we find a nearly infinite combination of genders expressed by individuals. We need to end this mindless, socially defined genderness.
What enraging bullshit! Our daughter could have gone to an all-girls high school but really didn't want that, so we sent her to a co-ed parochial high school. Our son wanted to go to an excellent all-boys Catholic high school and he just graduated..
In the teacher's qualifying exam, called Praxis when I took it, it contained a question about why schools could not group students into ability groups—called tracking. According to the study guide, the correct answer was that parents would not accept this kind of discrimination.
BTW, same sex school would have been best for me. I was totally distracted from 4th grade on.
Girls and boys don't have to have non-overlapping differences in how they learn, they only need to have statistical differences that mean more of boys do better one way and more of girls do better the other.
And there are some things that we can know very well and easily and with great confidence...
More boys are on drugs for ADHD, and more boys are in special education, particularly for reading.
More boys drop out of school. More are in prison.
Fewer boys attend college than girls.
Fussing about results from selection bias and various possible explanations of *why* all-boy's schools might be better for boys (and possibly girls, for girls) misses the important element of that... does it matter *why* if the results are the same?
If the *why* isn't the proper *why* then we shouldn't do it?
My alma mater will be shocked to hear this "fact", since they've been an all-boys school for more than a century and are still going strong. In Massachusetts.
I stand majorly corrected. I got the anecdote from a discussion regarding schools with a Boston politician but clearly something got garbled in translation. I should have looked this up beforehand.
Clearly lots of private boys and girls schools, just no public schools, which is what I think the person I spoke with was referring to. We were discussing busing in Boston and it went on to what sorts of schools could best address the needs of various communities. I raised the point of a boys school being a good resource for at-risk male students and he said something along the lines that the Massachusetts constitution was amended at some time to disallow this. I've searched the MA constitution, but haven't been able to find the specific reference.
My use of the term (in bold no less ; ) of ILLEGAL was...ignorant to say the least!
Happy to see that there are lots of private boys schools at least. I'll have to read up on some of them and see what the experience is. Good, clearly, from your standpoint.

Exactly! This isn't really science, it's a policy preference, and the authors of the paper are all advocates of the policy they find scientifically "better" (All authors are founders and uncompensated board members of the nonprofit American Council for CoEducational Schooling ()).
The authors claim that "science" shows that title IX should be interpreted to ban public, same-sex schools, when title IX is no more "science" than Bloomberg's ban on Big Gulps is science.
The paper's cites are mostly humanities and education journals, not neuroscience journals.
The paper published in Science is clearly social science. The article in the WaPo, authored by two of the Science paper's authors, makes it seem as though the findings are based on neuroscience.
Maybe because the Science paper is peer reviewed and the WaPo is not?.
This is very enlightening, and not surprising. Nothing clamps down a boys willingness to take risks in class than the fear of looking silly in front of the girls. Take girls out of the equation and they don't worry nearly as much.
Boys are also, on average, MUCH (caps again, hope I don't blow this one ; ) more physically active at a young age than girls. Very few boys can sit still and 'absorb' teaching the way girls can in the early years of school. This puts boys at a distinct disadvantage, as their natural physical/emotional inclinations lead them to the principal's office while the girls natural inclinations get them praise and high grades.
We all know that, later in life, the playing field levels a great deal and boys can become extremely successful. A single sex education for boys (who want it) must be a tremendous boon in allowing them to mature and learn in something other than an emotional china shop where every wrong move can lead to disaster or expulsion of one sort or another.Seattle: 206.388.0079 Portland: 503.222.6060 Eugene: 541.687.0051

The 2007 champions needed a win to keep hope alive, although the gap with the top of the Russian Premier League would likely have been too big to close either way.
instead of Zenit taking the points, it was FK Moscow to score a winning goal through Aleksandr Sheshukov with just five minutes left to play.
FK Moscow also surpass Zenit on goal record, and occupy the third place with three matches to go.
On Sunday, Spartak Moscow face the task of reducing the gap with leaders Rubin Kazan to one point in the home match with FK Rostov na Donu.According to a July 31 report from Digital Spy, legendary pro wrestling manager, Paul Heyman, says he would be interested in managing one or more of the athletes on the WWE Divas roster. Heyman, 48, was asked if he could imagine himself managing Emma, Sasha Banks, Natalya, AJ Lee, Paige or any of the talented women coming up through NXT, and he responded by noting that he is open to the idea.
Currently, Heyman is managing Brock Lesnar, the top heel on the WWE roster. In the past, Heyman managed high-level superstars such as Cesaro and CM Punk, but lately he has focused his energy on Lesnar. Since Lesnar is just a part-time WWE performer and only competes during Wrestlemania and SummerSlam seasons, Heyman should have plenty of extra time to supervise at least one other athlete on the WWE roster, since Lesnar doesn't compete full-time.
He did not mention which WWE Divas superstar he would prefer to manage, but chances are the WWE would script him to manage a heel. Historically, Heyman walks out to the ring with and cuts promos for high-level villains. Rarely, if ever, does he manage babyface characters. Even though WWE Universe appreciates his fine work on the mic, he has always been at his best in a heel role.
That said, the promotion would likely script him to manage Paige rather than Lee. Paige recently made a heel turn and she has been receiving great heat from the fans, so now would be the perfect time to have Heyman align himself with her. Having Heyman manage Paige would do wonders for the former NXT superstar's career.
Heyman, who also formerly managed The Big Show and Rob Van Dam, is a legendary manager, so teaming him with Paige could propel the Brit's career to new heights. It's unlikely the WWE would script Heyman to team with AJ Lee since she's a popular babyface. Paige is set to collide with Lee on Aug. 17 at SummerSlam, so now would be the perfect time to script Heyman to team with her. Heyman will already be at the event to manage Lesnar for his main event bout with John Cena.

Twitter puts a slightly different spin on social networking. Unlike Facebook, it doesn’t try to be encompassing or offer dozens of features, hoping that some of them will appeal to you. Instead, Twitter does one thing and does it well. That thing is letting its users post short messages, or tweets, quickly and easily from a variety of platforms including web browsers, mobile phones, smartphones, and other devices.
Twitter users then have the option of following any other Twitter user’s tweets. The result is a stream of short messages like the ones shown here.

If ever there was a culinary mantra that typified the Baltimore spirit, Midtown BBQ & Brew's chef, Tony Harrison, has articulated it. And he wants you to know that when it comes to food and drink, his restaurant goes big or … not at all. While this Mount Vernon spot considers itself to be an old-school BBQ house, they are also inventive with ingredients, offering nine different types of BBQ sauces reflective of barbecue options worldwide. They whip it all up in-house and only use free range beef. Big on bold flavors, it only makes sense then that Harrison wants you to wash it down with something equally intense, something equally gutsy, something very hometown — the Dundalk Ice Tea.
If you're homegrown like me, you're already impressed and intrigued by the name. But if you're not as easily sold (shame on you), get ready for the challenge that awaits: You're about to experience Natty Boh, lovingly embraced by four different types of liquors. Oh yeah. Like it's Northern counterpart, the Dundalk Ice Tea is deceptively delicious but, "an anvil." as Harrison proudly confessed. Game on. Think of the drink as a Long Island Iced Tea but with an earthier flavor, as provided by the Natty Boh. This blend of locales is intentional, reflective of Harrison's own cultural intersection. "I grew up in Long Island and was weaned on Long Island Iced Teas. Loved them to death," he said. "[Now], I happen to be a huge fan of Dundalk. I wanted to pay homage to my people [and to] the 'Dindalkians.' This called for a drink with at least five types of hooch." By hooch he means vodka and rum and gin and tequila and, of course, beer, oh my.
So what does Midtown BBQ and Brew say to patrons who are intimidated by that many different types of liquor in the same drink? True to form and style, Harrison offers, "Try a Mimosa".
No, don't. Go in knowing you're getting a lot of bang for your buck, and embrace that good ole, no-nonsense, real-talk spirit, hon. It's gotten us this far, Baltimore.

When the French protectorate started in 1881, there were 12000 Italians and only 700 French in Tunisia (*). The number of Italians grew to 85000 in 1921. The French protectorate turned into full scale colonisation, but that's another story.
As Italians came in fleeing oppression and poverty, they were well perceived by the population and quickly got fully integrated. In contrast, French came in as colonials and maintained an oppressive attitude. Well, that was occupation, so no wonders here.
Here is a list of words which were doubly verified by my wife and myself using BabelFish and an actual Italian national (thanks Ezio). I'm listing the Arabic term as pronounced by Tunisians, the Italian word, the English translation of the Italian word and the Arabic translation of the Tunisian term.

That's really intresting.
Here another word:
Gazuza (Tun)- Gazoz (Eng)-Gozzoza (It).
By the way gawri seems to have another unknown origin and I think it is not related to warrior.
khanouf:
We checked "flouka" but couldn't match it with any Italian words. I don't recognise "guiata" and "stivali" as Tunisian terms. Sorry, I'm probably missing somthing here.
hannibal:
I'm adding "gossosa" to the list. I checked "gawri" against "guerriero" but I think you're right and it doesn't sound quite similar, I'll probably scrap it.
Thank you all for the comments.
hi
I didn't get what you meant by clarification, but this is what I have actually said in one of my posts:
israeli-foreign-minister-to-visit.html
Ok I just got what you said. you are referring to the post on the tunisian PM's interview published in the Yediout Ahronout newspaper and from which I just quoted some sections ( in italics). The newspaper misquoted the correct theme of the Summit.Thank you anyway!
hey,
t'as oublié bounita qui vient de l'espagnol je crois :-)
There are some errors and one suggestion:
1) Roman came to Carthage in the IIIrd century BC, exactly 264 BC (first Punic war).
2) Century numbers are written either with full letters or Roman numbers (eg. 'XVII th'); writing centuries with Arabic numbers is erroneous (Well, that's the convention)
3) "gatto", as well as "chat", "cat", "kot", ... have Arabic origin (قط), not the oposite
My suggestion is the following: why not listing foreign words that are Arabic; you will find words that you probably have never expected; such as the French "raquette", "café", "sucre", "coton", "chimie", "alcool", ... and too many others
swobodin:
Thank you for the input. I have looked at "cat" on dictionary.com and it seems like it has Germanic origins. What prompted me to list it is actually the, rather non-Arabic, term "gattous". "Gattous" is closer to "gatto" than to "قط" which suggests an "influence".
The romans waged the Punic wars starting in the 3rd century BC, but didn't actually _get_ to (what's Tunisia today) until the 2nd century BC, hence the posting.
I think I will just drop the comment on the way century numbers are written: roman digitals are hard to write and hard to read so I won't use them :)
I have thought of scavenging other languages to look for words with Arabic origins, but that's a tougher task which I'll leave for a later time.
Again, thank you for the valuable input.
-Imed
Sorry, I made a mistake.
"Cat" is from Latin "Cattus", the confusion was because of the origin of the cat itself, not its name. It appears that the cat comes from north Africa (Egyptian used to venerate it).
Regarding the Arabic influence, it worths make a research; look for example here. You should know Portuguese however :-)
ERRATA:
it worths => it is worth
Guiata et stivali sont des mots utilisées par les habitants du village de Ghar-El-Melh (Porto Farina avant l’indépendance) mais comme une bonne partie de ces habitants étaient des maltais, il se peut que ces appellations sont de cette origine c’est à dire Maltaise.
swobodin:
Thanks for the proposal and for the link. I'll try to put something together, but that will need some work.
I got a Colombian coworker who seems to be able to decode Portuguese.
-Imed
khanouff:
I'll have to reconsider your request then, I may pay a visit to Ghar El Melh in 3 weeks from now and I'll ask some natives. I'll check these terms with some Italian nationals anyway.
Thank you for the contribution.
-Imed
I do understand both Spanish and Portuguese :-)I started to develop an application that displays words whose the ethimology is Arabic, in English, French, German, Portuguese and Spanish; the application is written with PHP / SQLite, will be accessible (Creaive Commons) and downloadable (GPL).
The Wikipedia Project helps a lot, however, I need contributors on both the code, looking for the words and the data entry (will be the hardest task).
Any help is greatly appreciated.
Thanks.
Please have a look at this script; it aims to display words that have Arabic origin, written with PHP / SQLite, and tell me whether you accept to help either by code or by content.
Thanks
PS: Anyone is welcome too...
swobodin:
I hd a look at your work and it's quite nice, it looks like you know some Spanish and Portuguese but I don't know how you re cheking the origins of the words. How can you tell a certain Spanish word comes from Arabic and not vice versa?
-Imed
Sounds bit complicated but very logical:
I look for listed Spanish words whose the origin is Arabic; for example: this portal.
If I don't understand a word, I search it at the dictionary; then I can make conclusion: it's obvious for any Arabic speaker that the origin of the word almohada (pillow) is المخدة
swobodin:
I see what you mean, some words are quite obviously of Arabic origin like the example you gave. I still think that a comprehensive work will need a professional linguist/historian for some words got twisted beyond recognition in Latin languages: who'd believe that Rhazes (الرازي) is the Arabic name of a Persian figure?
-Imed
We are not professional linguists/historians, but I believe we can make better than some professional linguists/historians who did not think about a similar project, or, at least, did not think of making the project free (as in both Freedom and price)!
Some friends started to join me; of course we will make mistakes, but we will be able to fix them too...
Anyone is welcome to contribute.

I need Your help. I'm from Poland and for my research job i need to know how to write "algebra" in arabic. Please help me. mordicus@o2.pl
Algebra would be written as الجبر and pronounced: al-jabr. The verb means litterally "mending broken bones". In the mathematical sense, it's used to mean balancing both sides of an equation.
Drop me an e-mail at ichihi@yahoo.com if this still needs clarifications. Good luck with your research.

feeshta/festa/festivity/عطلة
Hi Imed, i ran into your blog and i noticed you chose the word festivity as an english translation for feeshta. To me, living in north america, people here use the word holiday as opposed to festivity when it comes to talking about a day off or days off from work. Feeshta to me is more a day off from work and not necessarily a festivity. Thanks, Best, Nabil
Thanks for this. I think your research should be backed by somelinguistic background. It is a rather a broad field and doing a range of readings will probably help you conducting such research. Good luck.

“In the last three decades of my career, I have handled cases of atrocities against women tactfully. Instead of sitting at home as a retired police officer, its better to use those skills and utilise them for betterment,” said Temghire.
He added, “I am going to lead the team from the front. I am going to educate girls on the laws and various sections of Indian Penal Code (IPC) which deals with atrocities against girls and women and punishments. I aim to counsel the students on how to tackle the culprits, tell them to help the police first by giving tip-offs and conduct many such mock drills with the volunteers.”
“Any citizen has powers under section 100 of the IPC which deals with right to private defence,” said Temghire. The former encounter specialist said that he would teach volunteers that even blowing whistle or winking at a girl by an unknown would count as an offence.
Sanjay Nahar, founder president of Sarhad, said, “Temghire approached me soon after the formation of the flying squad expressing his desire to join. These squads would be formed in 20 colleges and would keep an eye on the complaints of eve-teasing and molestaion,” he said. Nahar said that they would be inaugurating helpline numbers for women soon. “From January 12, the formation of squads will be done. We will train such youths to counsel, keep an eye on students and interact with them. Most incidents of eve-teasing happen after college hours and volunteers would be trained to inform the police and nab culprits. The training would also include tips on how to deal with cases related to misuse of technology,” he added.
“Soon after the news spread that such a flying squad is going to be established, we got overwhelming response. Many housewives, lawyers and physical education directors came to be part of the programme,” said Nahar.

Your Roof, Your Rules
Many often dream about having it all. A beautiful family, great job, nice car and ultimately, having a home they can call their own. With home ownership comes a sense of pride and belonging, two strong factors that have motivated a majority of all households to own instead of rent. And, although owning has several benefits— like having security and knowing the money you put in is going towards a great investment – there are more things to consider.
The True Value of a Home
Several years ago, home values rose substantially in most parts of the country. With a strong economy and low mortgage rates, the demand for housing pushed up the prices people were willing to pay. These rising values have enabled many to reap large profits when they sold their homes. However, home values do not always appreciate and certain areas can be hit hard when a slow down in demand occurs. We are now seeing homes drop in value, and in some cases, drop substantially.
Calculate How Much You Will Need. And, if you are like most homeowners, you will probably want to furnish and decorate it – items that can be very costly. 6% 30-year mortgage. As the chart shows, this person can probably comfortably afford buying the home with a much larger down payment. As a practical matter, the person could probably be comfortable with a mortgage in the $125,000 to $130,000 range.
Get the Home Advantage
Many taxpayers find that the interest on their mortgage and the annual property taxes they pay are large enough to enable them to itemize their deductions instead of using what is commonly referred to as the standard deduction. The standard deduction for single filers and joint filers changes every year – you may want to check the IRS website for more information..
The Power of Equity
As you make mortgage payments, you build up equity in your home. Every mortgage payment you make includes interest and principal repayment. Over time, the principal repayment reduces the remaining amount you owe. In the first few years, most of your payments will be interest.
It is in later years that your equity build-up really takes hold and you can start using it as a source of collateral for other borrowing. With a home equity loan, you essentially are pledging the equity in your home for additional borrowing. Home equity loans can be a low cost way of consolidating any other debts you have, perhaps at a lower interest rate, and you can probably get some income tax benefits along the way.
If You Decide to Sell and% and you made 100% on your money – just remember that leverage works in reverse if prices fall.

Hi all, me and a friend are travelling to Madrid this Thanksgiving. Since we're both cash strapped grad students, I'm wondering if there're any 'Awesome Eats' that are a must in Madrid and also on the cheap side?
We'll be staying in a hostal on Calle Cervantes in the Huertas neighborhood, and none of us speak Spanish. So easy to get to locations are preferred. Oh well, I know 'Agua sin gas' and 'Cafe con leche", but don't think that will help us spotting good cheap eats in Madrid.
We are adventurous eaters who'll try everything and anything tasty, but not too crazy about vegetarian dishes, but with meat sauce or seafood broth is okay, just not a all-veggi plate. Cheese is also not a must have for us. We also don't drink if that's relevant.
So please my fellow chowhound area experts, please help someone who's never been to Spain and whose knowledge on Spanish food is limited to the less than authentic Paella and Tapas in NYC.
Thanks so much!!!
You're in a good area for good food. On the corner down the hill from you is Cerveceria Cervantes, a Gallego place with mostly seafood but other simple things as well. Some of it is expensive, but their tostadas are excellent and cheap. Around the corner, in Calle Huertas, is Maceiras, with another branch in Calle Jesus. Javier at Hostal Gonzalo has recommended the Quevedo, in Calle Quevedo, up the hill and around the corner - I've never eaten there because it doesn't open in the evening until 9 (that's fairly typical, but I need to be asleep by 10 or I'm no good for the next day at the Prado etc). It's always jam packed with local people at lunch time.
A little further up, La Trucha, in Calle Manuel Fernandez y Gonzalez just off Plaza Santa Ana, is excellent - not very cheap, but not expensive either, for good tapas and efficient friendly service. I also like El Inti de Oro in Calle de Ventura de la Vega: Peruvian food.
Further afield a particular mention has to be Casa Mingo, open all day every day in the Paseo de Florida, for excellent roast chicken. Someone said here awhile ago that roast chicken can be found almost everywhere in Madrid, and probably it can - but I've never had better roast chicken than at Casa Mingo, where you get a whole chicken, more than enough for you and your friend, for 9 euros (last January's price). And across the street from Casa Mingo is the church of San Antonio de Florida, with Goya's marvellous frescoes.
I'm sure you'll get more suggestions - these are just a few places I've eaten in many times, and have enjoyed.
If you are staying at Hostal Gonzalo, I'm sure you'll enjoy it: lovely place, lovely people.
My guilty pleasure is to visit one of the Las Bravas bars in the area of Calle de Alvarez Gato and Calle de Espoz y Mina on the way from Plaza Santa Ana and Puerta del Sol. I still have not found patats bravas anywhere in Spain or the US to match the simple peeled, quartered and fried potatoes with the best spicy sauce. I don't know why no one else can make a sauce to match. You can also buy tortilla espanol and calamari with the bravas sauce. Simple and cheap with cheap beer and wine.
Don’t limit yourselves to Huetas/Pl de Jesus. Go do to Cava Baja and the streets around it in Latina where it is lined with places to eat (Casa Lucas, El Tempranillo, El Chotis, Masqueria Paloma are just a few). Or to Chueca for great cafes and people watching. Drop by the newly renovated Mercado de San Miguel for inexpensive food stalls. Up to Chamberi, around c/Ponzano for good tapas/inexpensive eats (El Doble, Beluga, Errota Zar and El Ventorrillo Murciano). Central Madrid is always lively and easy to get around.In article <Pine.A41.4.10.10002052249050.91100-100000 at acs6.acs.ucalgary.ca>, Neal Robert Melvin <nrmelvin at ucalgary.ca> wrote: > Can??

Galatasaray have clinched back-to-back Turkish Super Lig titles following a 4-2 triumph over Sivasspor on Sunday.
The win was Galatasaray's seventh successive domestic victory, with Burak Yilmaz and Selcuk Inan scoring a brace apiece to secure the crucial victory at the Turk Telekom Arena.
Despite conceding two late goals, Fatih Terim's men had done enough to earn their 19th league title, taking them above rivals Fenerbahce on the all-time list.
Big-name signings Didier Drogba and Wesley Sneijder started the match, with the Dutch international replaced after 58 minutes.

On Saturday, the Expos rallied for a run in the bottom of the seventh inning to top the visiting Medford, Ore. Mustangs 6-5 in the first game of a doubleheader.
After a popout to start the inning, Fairfield’s Jack Gamba singled and pinch hitter Anthony Kaleczyc looped a base hit to right, scoring Gamba when the throw overshot third base.
That gave Expos reliever Chris Parodi a victory after he had to forego his normal catching duties to bolster a shorthanded pitching staff.
Expos manager Brand Hanson was forced to call up a pair of catchers from the TC Legion team to help out as well.
Clayton Espino, who just completed his freshman year at Armijo, caught the first game and Carter Bins of Rodriguez was slated to catch Game 2.
Earlier, the Expos took a 1-0 lead when Gamba tagged and scored from second base on a fly ball to right field.

A little more than a week after Colorado, an original club, won its first MLS Cup and less than a week before the U.S. potentially wins a second World Cup bid, I am optimistic about the progress of American soccer overall. The progress made since the 1994 World Cup has been incredible, and the U.S is positioning itself to become a player in international soccer.
MLS has become a solid part of the American sports landscape. While not in the same category as the NFL, soccer is becoming more and more a part of the sports rotation for Americans. Next season, MLS will continue its expansion to add two great new markets in Portland and Vancouver. These with other recent additions like Seattle are spicing up a league with established franchises. And despite our complaints about a geographically stupid (and next year expanded) playoff system, the playoffs are producing compelling playoff matches and allow many teams to compete for a championship, a kind of parity other sports are also trying to achieve.
The quality of play is improving overall, due to the rise of young players (see below) and overseas talent. While the designated player rule has not yet helped a team win an MLS Cup, it has brought much needed attention to the league. It started with David Beckham, who’s signing gave international legitimacy to the league, and continues with Marquez and Henry. Don’t dismiss this development; although these players are no longer at their top form, they could easily choose to play in Qatar or the UAB, where they could make more money.
One of the areas in which MLS is really growing is its youth development. I know people got tired of hearing how Omar Cummings and Chris Wondolowski came up through the original reserve division, but the truth is the original reserve league did help with youth development, which is why its return was greeted with so much praise. Between the reserve league, youth academies, and Generation Adidas, youth is flowing through American soccer. The Juan Agudelo goal shows the youth development is churning out the young talent that will be critical to US success in the 2014 cycle.
Speaking of 2014, I am not a fan of the Bob Bradley rehiring and the way in which it was done. However, it still does not diminish the progress the American national team is making at all levels. The faults in the national team (no scoring from forwards, aging defense) look like they can be answered within the next few years (Altidore/Dempsey maturation, young up-and-coming players). The South Africa friendly was a good preview of what could be coming for the USMNT. While it was not like beating Spain (which the US did in 2009), the US found a way to get a result in front of a hostile crowd. And it was the youths that did it; the goal by Agudelo and play by Diskerud et. al. was impressive. Speaking of Diskerud, he is a young potential star that has dual-nationality that looks to have chosen the U.S., just like his teammate Teal Bunbury; after the Guiseppe Rossi loss the U.S. is working hard to keep stud players that could play elsewhere nationally.
Is everything perfect in American soccer? Far from it. MLS could fall victim to labor/financial problems and the national team could fail to develop under the current leadership. But I am cautiously optimistic about the direction of American soccer; we’ve come a long way from the days of the Continental Indoor Soccer League and I don’t expect us to be going back.
54 Responses to Why I’m Optimistic for US Soccer
I agree on a lot of points. The league certainly has come a long way from where it started. And the academies, reserve teams, etc are something every US fan should be excited about.
Regarding the playoffs, however, I really do think that they (this system, not playoffs in general) have turned off a lot of casual soccer fans. To prove my point, just google “MLS Playoffs are” and go through the first 3 pages of results, I think you’ll find that the results are mostly critical.
Warning Relevant Re-Post-ignore if you like ;):
That said, I don’t think anyone is saying that the matches themselves have been boring. If they are, they clearly they didn’t watch RSL and Dallas in the first round. The biggest gripe for playoff wannabe playoff reformers (not removers) like myself is the tournament format.
Let’s say the playoffs go to a single bracket, 2-leg tournament like the CCL, Copa America, D2 Playoffs, Mexican Playoffs, etc. Do you think the matches would be any less exciting if your Sounder’s had New York in the first round? Or if every fan has the opportunity to see their team play for a championship?
If you ask me, Colorado playing for the MLS Cup in front of their own fans, after possibly knocking off both RSL and New York, would be a great moment in a Cinderella story.
Anyone blogging about soccer is NOT a casual fan, that is soccer only fan….and yes they don’t want anything different than what their favorite ( non-MLS ) league does.
There’s a lot to be excited about with the national team and the youth.
CM,
The playoffs turn off the casual fan and also the traditional soccer fan. We know what a real soccer league looks like and it’s not playoffs (and certainly not half the league making the playoffs)
I hate to say it but I think the best thing for domestic soccer in the US is if MLS were to fold . Or better yet a rival league that understands the history of the sport and how it is structured globally.
Wow,
So the reason they sold out many of hte playoff games waaaaas..because playoffs turn OFF the fan ? hmm interesting theory, not supported.
Yeah if MLS folded I see money just streaming into professional soccer on a level never seen before. Probably have Arab, Russian, and US money streaming in like it does for the big franchises in England.
yes playoffs to decide league champion turn off the traditional soccer fan in this country. No other successful league in the world uses playoffs to decide the seasons league champion. (Dont bother mentioning the Mexican league. I said successful)
of course you can get fans to show up at the stadium. But the television ratings were horrendous.
I guess all domestic cup competitions should be abolished too, since they’re just giant playoff systems that turn off the casual fan. And the World Cup should be a single table league. So should every major international tournament for that matter, because the knockout stages turn me off.
And that piss poor Mexican league. What is it? Only a top 20 league? And let’s ignore most of Central America and parts of South America, because that doesn’t count as part of the globe you speak of.
Your image of the soccer world smacks of Eurosnobbery. The lack of playoffs don’t make the clubs better anywhere else. The money put into the clubs to get better players makes the clubs better. America is no exception.
no dude…i’m talking about an end of year playoff to decide a league champion. It’s not what a real soccer league looks like. You would still of course have league cups which are playoffs which would be separate trophies.
We should be emulating what works. Look at Japan. Their domestic league started just 3 years before MLS and they now have over 100 clubs in a pro/rel pyramid.
hell… with pro/rel and single table you would have a lot more playoffs during a domestic season ; playoffs to decide the final champions league slot , playoffs for promotion and relegation, the league cup which is a playoff, the USOC which is a playoff. I’m not against these playoffs. I’m against a dopey 10 team end of year playoff to decide the league champion. With a balanced schedule the league champion is the team with the most points.
It’s pretty simple. Why do people have to keep repeating this stuff to you uneducated MLS-snobs?.
However, as regards to the development of soccer as a whole in the US as well as the MLS itself, I agree there much, much more development now. Lots more people are tuning to the game in America and it could be as big as other leagues in the world one day.
BUT, that one day is a long time to come. If it’s ever come. MLS and US soccer are far from being a player in international soccer. In fact, they are not one of the players in international soccer at all. As long as MLS continues to ignore the international dates and worst, keep playing on during the World’s biggest event and the sport’s biggest champonship a.k.a. World Cup, they won’t go anywhere. It’s the same as having no respect to the game and the players at all. If MLS has no respect towards the game’s biggest tournament (not to mention FIFA Confederation Cup where USA was almost its certain contenders everytime), no respect to the international dates thus no respect to the players who wanted to play successfully for their club and country, and no respect for the clubs by depriving them of having their best players playing week in, week out for their regular season games, then MLS and US soccer certainly have no rights to call themselves as international soccer players.
Not to mention no A-list players will joint MLS during their best years because the league is depriving them from achieving their dreams in both ways. LD is an exception because USA has no other players as talented as him, not even those playing in Europe. So they need him even though he’s playing in a much lower level league. But, everytime LD is gone for the country, MLS has deprived his club and its fans from having their best player playing in the league’s competitive games. So, it’s a win for USMNT but a loss for MLS and the fans.
It doesn’t mean that MLS has to change their schedule to the standard August-May like those in Europe. NO. They can still stick to their own schedule like they did. I am very much wants to see US soccer grow and for MLS to be as big and successfull as EPL, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A and so on..but until they change their system to accomodate all of the international dates and respect all of the clubs’ and players’ desires to be successfull for clubs and countries, then MLS and US soccer will have a hard time to achieve their dreams to be international players.
.”
And what percentage got their start in MLS when no other league would take them?
I enjoy the playoffs. Not the format this year, especially the seeding. Obviously that needs to be fixed. Also I’d rather get rid of conferences, and I don’t have the answer to wether the league champion should be crowned at the end of the season or by winning MLS cup. I think being first all season is harder, however no one can tell me that LA was better than Dallas in the final. No one. I like cinderella stories and the unexpected. I couldn’t care less about the EPL when ManU or Chelsea (probably spelled wrong… whatever) win it with 4 games to spare. At that point i turn my attention towards the bottome of the EPL… because I want to see the unexpected and that isn’t really happening anywhere else. Again, I don’t pretend to have any answere, just (i believe) a valid opinion)
Oh, I’ve played soccer all my life, through college, and into my adult years. Growing up I got up at 2:30am to watch European soccer. I saw two 1994 WC games in person. I’ve support whatever MLS team I am closest to, though I will probably stick with RSL for life now. I take friends that can’t even spell soccer to games with me. My point:
I am a “traditional soccer fan” and the people I take with me, including my wife kids, are casual soccer fans. We love every minute of the game. My daughter asks me “Daddy, when are we going to a soccer game?” (she speaks well for a 2 year old). Practically no one that I see on a daily basis would have any interest at all in soccer without the MLS. It’s not perfect but I’d rather have MLS than go back to driving 50 miles to find a hole in the wall pub and watch soccer with strangers.
One final thing. I didn’t care at all about tradition when I was playing on the field. I just wanted to do the best I could and win. I hope the USSF leaves respecting tradition to the historians and does the best that they can no matter what anyone else thinks.
Robert HAY ( not to be confused for obvious reasons ),
I find it very interesting that you failed to mention the place where most of the studs are coming from right now….COLLEGE.
Everyone that has US player developement in mind should have read MoneyBall. Trying to guess who is going to be a stud at age 12-18 is as close to random as it gets. Baseball has been failing at it for decades. I personally know guys that have signed for millions of dollars to never even play one inning in the Big Leagues.
The ONLY reason for a franchise to do it is for money making reasons like Ajax.
It is funny, the MLS single enterprise guy ( me ) likes for open system to be the determiner of which player is going to get the chance to shine, but the get rid of the salary cap guys say, no let some rich guy who runs a very controlled environment, determine who gets the chances to be a stud in the soccer markets ?.
Is it a coincidence that Zakuani left Arsenal to go play for Akron, and now is getting a trial at Everton ? No, he found the best option and went for it. It worked out well for him.
Finding the right choice, best coach, etc will happen, but not if we only have academies as the only real option. Love the great stuff about it or hate the very bad stuff about it….The college rout will be a HUGE part of the US success.

.”
AMAZING !!!
I wish the person making that kind of statement had the international experience in order to make such a bold or empty statement. You know, Charles, the way you see soccer is completely the opposite of pros working with youth for generations in other nations.
And like always you always use the exceptions to make your point but the sport is not developed by exceptions.
College should NEVER be an important portion of your development. NEVER. It should be, in fact, used as your last resort. At the age those kids arrive in college, at 19, in any soccer nation in the world they should be ready to play as a pro. But as I told you before, MAYBE the American way to develop soccer will revolutionize the way other nations do it, but I don’t think so.
Use the exception to make my point ?
I hope you are not talking about Zakuani?
I can’t figure out what you are talking about, because there ais no way you are talking about Zakuani as the EXCEPTION.
I just re-read what I wrote. You are using Zakuani as the exception aren’t you ?!?! Do you follow MLS ? At all ?
ps. just looked up the median age of the EPL, 31. I guess the 19 year olds are being balanced by the 40 year olds.
I dont believe that the US will change the rest of the world, they are not set up to have college sports be such a big factor, but it is the way for the US teams to use it to figure out who the real talent is.
Read Moneyball and let me know where it is wrong.
just looked up the median age of the EPL, 31. I guess the 19 year olds are being balanced by the 40 year olds
I’m kind of surprised by this? If you found it through answers.com or something like that, do you know how they worked it out?
Although even if this is true, you’re wrong to deduct that that it means that 19 year olds are being balanced by 40 years old. It just means that the number of players aged OVER 31 is equal to the number of players aged UNDER 31.
“College should NEVER be an important portion of your development. NEVER. It should be, in fact, used as your last resort. At the age those kids arrive in college, at 19, in any soccer nation in the world they should be ready to play as a pro”
@Sergio:
I agree with you for the most part, but I don’t think you give the college game the props it deserves for growing the sport.
Even with the MLS Academies and Development Academy system, the vast majority of players probably won’t sign a professional contract. However, that doesn’t mean they don’t make a valuable contribution to the system as a whole. Behind every great professional, is a legion of players who never made it as far (but may have actually been better at the time). The college game gives those players who didn’t make the cut at 17-18 years olds something great to play for: a chance to get a degree and continue their development. If they manage to make it on a professional level after that, awesome. If not, you have a college graduate who loves the game (and a potential coach). Certainly not bad either.
That said, is the quality of college soccer (and high school for that matter) as good as it could be? No, of course not. But no private amateur clubs (at least, none that I know) have the kind of quality infrastructure of our universities. There’s a lot of potential for building great players (whether they go pro or not) in our schools. The stone just needs a lot of polishing.
I did not say that. I agree that TODAY colleges are responsible for what we have and of course we should appreciate that but MOVING FORWARD I believe we should never use college as our major tool for development. And that is what Charles said and I disagree completely.
will crush the rest of the world in player developement very soon, if they are not already
Ha, wow, you really think that???? It might be a crap-shoot to guess who will make the grade at the age of 12*, but at 16 you should definitely be learning with the pros, not in a college.
*That’s not entirely true. It might be true that some kids that look good at 12 will flake out by 16, it’s incredibly rare for anyone to make the opposite transition. (i.e. from average 12 yr-old to pro-level adult).
Is it a coincidence that Zakuani left Arsenal to go play for Akron, and now is getting a trial at Everton
If you think that is evidence that the college system is a good way of developing pros, that’s like saying:
- Ian Wright played Sunday-league amateur football till he was 21, then went on to be an Arsenal legend. So the local pub team MUST be a great way to develop players.
- Dean Windass was rejected as a pro at 16, worked on a building site and drank too much until he was finally re-discovered at 21. He went on to play in the EPL . Therefore laying bricks and drinking beer is a good way of developing pro-caliber players.
Just because you can find one or two freak examples doesn’t mean the college system is a good alternative to the traditional path.
Good point, but how about this :
Zakuani, Gonzalez, White, Wallace, Pontius, Frei, John
That was the first round 2009.
Mawanga, Tchani, Opera, Bunbury
That was first round 2010.
I only included guys that are starting/playing quite a bit, there are PLENTY more guys that made rosters, got secondary amounts of playing time.
There is at least one later than first round pick: Tim Ream.
Charles, you just don’t get it, man.
Oh I get it.
You could put together a GREAT team with those players.
MLS quality is going through the roof and it has been on the backs of guys that developed in…..COLLEGE.
The infrastructure is there, the money is there, and the future will be there too.
We will talk next year, there will be another 5 more from the 2010 class that are total studs, and 4-5 more from the 2011 class.
IF you disagree, and there really is no way you can, then you don’t get it.
Ha, you’ve got a different interpretation of “great” if you think you could make a great team out of those guys.
I’ll have a chance to see the young players beginning this week as all of the academy teams and the USMNT U17′s will be in Phoenix for the 2010 Development Academy Winter Showcase and Nike International Friendlies.
I suspect that some of the players I see will be on MLS rosters next season as the new roster rules come into play.
I was at this event last year, met some scouts from Man U and Tigres(Mexican Primera) as well as college scouts. A fun time for a footie fan. Come on down if you can make it and judge the progress of some of the US’s best young players for yourselves.
Americans have reasons to be optimistic but there is little reason to think that Yanks are anywhere near close to being a major-consistent player in world soccer.
Vious,
Almost making the final four in 2002 and final 8 this year aside of course. right ?
Is this just wishful thinking on your part ? NO WHERE CLOSE !?!?
We just won CONCACAF with Mexico in it. And a group stage of the WCup with England in it.
The US didn’t make the final 8 in south Africa. It was knocked out by Ghana in the second round (i.e the last 16).
And though the US may have had a good (if lucky) run in 2002, you also have to consider that they were garbage either side of that (in 1998 and 2006) – i.e. they’re not a consistent force, exactly as Vious said.
Hold on a second here. Every respectful soccer annalist in the world agreed that the South African World Cup was the worst technically played in the history of the game, so, let’s not forget that. Charles again using the exception to make his point.
Oh my word,
So you are using the 2010 World Cup wasn’t very good as your arguement ? Wow.
We have hit new lows, so the arguement is:
no the US was not consistantly good, because the whole World Cup stunk when they did well.
WOW…and you are saying I don’t get it…wow.
Sergio’s point (that the S Africa world cup wasn’t technically very good) is both stupid and irrelevant. What is relevant is that the US did not make the last 8 in South Africa.
To be fair Dave C I believe he meant almost making the last 8. Which they did almost make it.
@slyc
After re-reading Charle’s initial comment, I realize you’re right – he meant the US “almost” made the last 8.
Charles, I’ve read a lot of your posts and while I often disagreed, I could at least understand your position however, when you start singing the praises of college soccer as a basis for future development, you have totally lost me! College soccer is a wasteland where white suburban players go to end their careers. The style of play is medieval — England from thirty years ago. If college soccer was such a treasure trove of players, then why are many/most MLS teams establishing their own development programs. And why do so few college draft players even make their teams. It’s fine to support US Soccer but to do so blindly does no one any good. The US Is at best a mid-level soccer country, FIFA rankings not withstanding. Our natural peers are countries like Austria, Switzerland, South Korea, Denmark, etc. The 2010 WC draw gave us a perfect path to the final 8 and England paved the road but despite that we struggled at every step. We won games through sweat not skill and skill is ultimately the measure of great teams — sorry we aren’t even close yet.
Shortpasses, Thanks for the post.
When we beat England for first in the group after tying them head to head, it sounds like England is our pier no ?
I got the feeling you didn’t want them that high, maybe I don’t either, but not far behind, but whatever, maybe I am wrong on your intentions as South Korea has probably been right on par in the World Cup if not ahead of England anyway in the years the US has been relevant…the last 12.
LACK of players making the MLS teams ? You need to brush up on your MLS fact dude. You are missing a LOT of great ( yes Dave C. I said great ) soccer players. See my list above for a VERY incomplete list.
If Sergio is being sincere, thank to you too. I appreciate opposing view points, nothing to be learned from talking with people that agree with you.
yeah, beating Italy (2006) = garbage
Please stop the US hating, they are one of the top 16 teams in the world and moving up very quickly.
It is just wishful thinking on your part to think otherwise.
We never beat Italy in 2006. We drew 1-1.
The national team may not be as good as some of us think, but if your barometer for having a good national team is to make the best 8 every World Cup, then you’re just being difficult.
Hey, Charles. Thanks, brother.
Cheers.
Alan Rothenberg in Zurich making a pitch for the 2022 WC: “We’ve made a ton of progress: when we got the Cup in ‘88 there was no pro league, now the pro league continues to grow and build; the national team has done well; and for the last World Cup the TV rights brought FIFA more money that from any country in the world. What is disappointing, however, is that over the last 10-15 years I don’t think we’ve developed as much talent on the field. On one hand, it’s great we got past the first round of the last World Cup, but when you step back we had a fluke goal against England, fell behind Slovenia and went to the 94th minute to beat Algeria.” He must be a US Soccer hater too!! LOL
MLS only needs to be “good-enough” in order to have a league where fans don’t fret about how long the league will survive. Look at college football vs. the NFL, or the NBA vs. college basketball. Hell, look at La Liga vs. FMF, or Bundesliga vs. Eredivise:
1. Drop single-entity. It was never needed in a hard salary-cap league.
2. Make DPs tradeable/loanable.
2a. DPs don’t count against the cap or roster spots.
3. Drop the draft, you have to recruit your own players.
4. Non-cash benefits and bonouses tied to winning games and titles are exempt from the salary-cap.
5. Bottom two teams can’t pay bonouses, and don’t get revenue sharing (I’m assuming no pro/reg). 1st place reg. season team gets 50% of this money, MLS Cup champ gets the other 50%.
5a. No sharing of non-MLS reg. season/Cup money.
6. 8 team playoff, high seed hosts, high seed chooses their opponent, double elimination.
7. Scrap Superliga, and put all ex-Superliga resources into USOC. The USOC beginning at the round of 128 becomes a single elimination tourney played during the summer, like March Madness. Non-MLS/D2 teams qualify via regional tournaments.
Re-reading the posts. I find it amazing how insecure people are about US soccer.
I can understand the wanting the US soccer to not succeed, once the US passes some of these countries in talent/results there will be no reversing it.
But the insecurity is a mystery to me.
MLS has a player, one of the best 11 this year, a very good player no doubt, who played with Everton and looking like the one of the best if not the best player out there for Everton and one of the best players on the field against teams that actually have a shot of beating Barcelona. They are guarenteed 10th place finish every year in the EPL, a very good league with tons of talent and they are begging for him to come back.
I said he is great, but it isn’t like the rest of the best XI pale in comparison. It isn’t like he is playing against 10th graders when he plays. There are so many players at/close to his level.
He didn’t win the MVP ( don’t think he was a finalist ? ) and I didn’t hear one word of complaint…from anyone.
The national team won CONCACAF, not a playoff which some hate and think is random, the HEX. Very difficult to do. Mexico has been one of the most consistant finishers in the World Cup over the last 30 years, the elite of the elite match their record of getting out of group stage…and that is it. Period.
MLS is great! USA national soccer team is great! Let’s not criticize! Because in United States I had learned that criticizing is not good. So, maybe Dave C is right, all former players and coaches from Europe and South America who said the last world cup was very week are all stupid and irrelevant, because in Dave’s head, you are not good as your competition, so, in his mind winning a week tournament is the same as winning a strong one, yeah, we are all stupid, he is the smart one.
And Charles, beating Mexico by inches is great..? With all due respect for the Ermannos, but Who ta hell is Mexico in the world of soccer? WHAT DID THEY WIN? EVER? At any level? Under 15, 17, 20, 23, pros? We are talking about UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!!!!!!!!! Why is so difficult to find some Americans with old folks mentality? The ones who could not accept being behind anyone?
Did you realize that MLS and the USA Soccer Federation don’t ever give you a date or a time when they think they will be competitive? Do they have goals for achievements or they expect you as a fan to buy tickets, watch bad games for your entire life while they make money now instead of reinvest the capital into the sport? For how long? What is the time frame? Ten years from now, twenty, thirty?
You write my words, if you fans and all your soccer management people don’t start kicking your own buts right now putting pressure on those executives, Chinese people will start a soccer program and will end up becoming a contender sooner than USA. Everybody is talking they are the ones for 2026 WC. Do not expect they will host a world cup without having a good team.
Let’s stop being satisfied with one of our players making the big leagues in Europe. We should be the BIG LEAGUE!
Let’s forget about Americans for a second. USA has forty million Latinos living inside the country and with money to spend, including in soccer, their only sport. Add the millions of Americans who love the game and you already are one of the largest soccer markets in the world. But why do you guys who love to defend MLS think MLS is not a big NFL yet? The product stinks!!! You may love MLS and the National team but your emotions or your opinions won’t make them win championships or increase their credibility in the eyes of the soccer world.
But I’m good. My native country is considered the best soccer country in the world and the team I had the honor to play for, to coach and direct for many years was just elected the 12th best of the century with 3 FIFA Club World Championships. I am very happy. I love to win.
Cheers.
“..credibility in the eyes of the soccer world” is EXACTLY the insecurity that I am talking about. Why would I care what some idiot who still thinks Everton might win the EPL someday think ? First of all he could care less about the Rapids, second I DON’T.
You are barking up the wrong tree. Remember I was the guy that wanted Landon here, not Europe. The only reason I bring his success in Europe up is that some need proof MLS guys are good enough. I don’t, I don’t think you do either….we all should be able to see a Tim Ream one year out of college and know he is very good player….without the insecurity of “well he ‘only’ plays in MLS.”
I think the US WILL be the best league in the world and of course I want it that way.
The difference between between us, Sergio, is that I think the US is definitely going in the RIGHT direction and your think the opposite. I guess time will tell.
Winning the HEX, making the round of 16 are BIG accomplishments !
Unless you want to count grass roots teams that didn’t make it, like FC Seattle, that everyone but me on this thread thinks is the solution to US Soccer. The US has only had real teams/real league for 16 years now.
So is equal with Mexico the END, the accomplishment, no it is a stepping stone, but a pretty big one…and it is definitely forward.
Charles, this has nothing to do with insecurity. Soccer is not an American game, you are measured by what you do in the world against the best teams of the world. My biggest issue against MLS is the way they treat the players. They pay the lowest salaries in the WORLD for a professional league but some of the teams are already making money while giants like Barcelona is 186 Million Euros in a row and Real Madrid 400 Millions. Just because their fans won’t accept other than great teams. Now, do you really think you are in the same level? MLS paid third division salaries to its players, IT IS A SHAME! United States of America is not China where people work for nothing just to make the state rich. If what you keep saying about the quality of the players is truth, then is even worst, so, pay the players more than 40k a year. NO, because if they do that they won’t make any money. That is why a lot of rich guys are entering the business of MLS, they pay amateur like salaries to 90% of the players and get one or two stars and guys like you get crazy about it. You are happy with the league because you don’t know better. You are confusing MLS with something American, IT IS NOT. Pay that kind of salaries and offer crap show is exactly the opposite of what it is being American. People who really love soccer not just because it is American really hate MLS. It is impossible to watch, I am sorry, Charles, but I am not the only one who thinks that, believe me. It doesn’t give me any pleasure to disagree with you. It is just because guys like you should be the ones on my side of the argument. If people who support can’t see what they are doing, then we are all screwed.
Man I typed an essay, like you and I have been doing and it didn’t take.
Summary:
MLS pays the lowest salaries because people don’t support the league. Only the Sounders, on the verge of becoming the most profitable team in the world, no expenses and huge revenue, are in a position of way under paying.
Why doesn’t the median LaLiga team pay as much as Barca and RM ? that was a joke to do that comparision and you know it.
You can argue that MLS gets rid of a salary cap, but the fan they are trying to attract, like me, would jump ship. We are NOT going to support LaLiga Joke League. Champions being crowned last Monday in 5-0 games just doesn’t work. I would start watching the NBA again before that. Ok maybe not, but it is a toss-up, it is that much of a joke. They don’t support it in Spain, and they love soccer there. Sounders are the third highest drawing team in LaLiga. Not sure which teams are the top two.
I am the first guy to protest if MLS doesn’t raise salaries to match revenue. Mariners didn’t and I, who used to go to 20-30 games a year, skipped MANY MANY games. I still don’t. I was not alone.
The spending on “superstars”, it is a stupid way to run a league, they need to be able to go after US Nat members ( and other great players ) instead of signing Ljungberg’s for millions. I was angry about Ljungberg before he made the AllStar team last year….what a joke. MLS must be making money on jerseys. IF it helps MLS financially it might be a neccesary evil.
even my summary was an essay.
Are you sure these Sounders are that good? You always talk about them, I will follow them to see if you are not …pulling my leg, like you guys say. If they are bad…
I am against huge salaries, but, if you guys pay salaries like the ones paid in South America, the appeal of living in US would bring a lot of talent here and then, when mixing with those talent and coached by GOOD COACHES you would start forming your own line of players one after another and then you would have options. You don’t have to go crazy like the Europeans are doing, but give some pros a chance to look at MLS as a viable option. I have great agents in Brazil who are friends of mine who keep asking me about the market here and I don’t have anything to tell them. You don’t need Beckhan or Henry, they’re gone. You need new hunger talent. Level A players who could in fact, even play for the American national team.
C’mon Charles…Help me out man.
Cheers
If I write to you today again, I will probably get a boot from my wife. So, see you soon.
Not saying the Sounders are that good, you can judge for yourself how good. Some are very optimistic and think the league is doing great. Some, well you read their comments, MLS is 77th best league in the world.
I am saying the Sounders are profitable. I bet they made $40 million in revenue, and had less then $5 million in expenses. Just WAGs ( wild ass guesses ) on my part, but is just the amount of money the are rolling in to be guessed at.
Montero just signed a contract extension today. I haven’t seen any numbers but more than $400,000 per year.
THIS IS HUGE FOR MLS. Guys like him ( and Donovan ) are the guys the MLS needs to sign and keep in the league to succeed long term. Others were signed and rumored to be signed to keep them here too.
Man I can’t wait for next year. There are going to be some great teams out there.
I thought Mexico won the Hex.
Nah. We won it.
Gave Mexico a good run for their money at Azteca as well.
US soccer is going to take a step behind Mexican Soccer this next go around. I even think Mexico will win the Gold Cup. Gold Cup is a sham of a tournament because US has hosted it several years in a row. Let Mexico host it and see what happens.
The reason, Mexico has more and more young players playing in Europe and their domestic league is in the top ten in leagues around the world. You can not compare their youth system (Pumas, Chivas, Pachuca) to ours and the crop of players who won the U-17 world cup are now hitting stride. Not to mention Chicharito playing for Man U who will destroy our CBs.
So you are saying Mexico, who has been very good forever is getting better.
I hope so. US needs someone to challenge them locally.
Well, the coaching uphevel that Mexico has been dealing with is one of the reasons for the recent downfall. If i were bradley I would capping every one in site who is eligible to play for both US/Mexico.
American MLS – Highlight Videos i have founds here ,
Charles,
The Sounders are not on the verge of becoming one of the most profitable teams in the world. When you combine that statement with your earlier one where you suggest the US might already be crushing the rest of the world in player development…well, you lose all credibility.
Good lord, have just a bit of perspective, will you?-

POLICE BLOTTER
Bainbridge Police reported the following incidents:
March 5
5:45 p.m. The Suquamish Police Department called to alert Bainbridge officers about a felony warrant subject spotted during a family function on the island.
The suspect had a warrant for escaping from the Department of Corrections. The Suquamish officer asked Bainbridge officers to wait until he asked for backup to avoid spooking the individual.
After the suspect was detained Bainbridge officers were called to help search the individual and place him under arrest. He was transported to the Kitsap County jail.
March 7
8:55 p.m. Officers were notified of an intoxicated male yelling profanities at a construction crew and throwing construction cones into the roadway at Winslow Way and Madrone Lane.
When the officer arrived he was told that a white male in his 30s walked into the construction area and began yelling at the workers. He walked away from the site and grabbed a cone and threw it in the roadway.
The officer was given a description of the man, and spotted a male matching the description standing at the rear door of a Winslow bar.
The officer asked the suspect to speak to him near the patrol car about the incident. The man said he didn’t do anything and was just walking home.
His speech was slurred, he could not stand straight and was swaying back and forth.
Two members of the construction crew positively identified the man. He was placed under arrest and transported to the Kitsap County Jail where he was booked for disorderly conduct.
His bail was set at $2,500.
March 6
2:24 a.m. A Bainbridge resident called to report a domestic violence incident.
When the female called she was speaking at nearly a whisper and told the officers that she was angry at her boyfriend who was drinking at the casino instead of spending time with her.
The female sounded intoxicated and was slurring her speech while crying and laughing.
The female said they were in an argument about their weekend plans when he grabbed a brick and threw it through the window of her car and threw a drink at her.
The officer told the woman that his actions were domestic violence and malicious mischief.
The woman became upset and said she didn’t want her boyfriend arrested.
They had recently moved to an apartment in Silverdale, but she refused to give the officer the address, saying that she just wanted to report only the broken window and she didn’t want him to be arrested.
She would only give the Bainbridge address for her parents home.
No other information at this time.
9:06 p.m. Officer stopped a vehicle for erratic driving and arrested the driver for DUI.
When the officer spotted the vehicle the driver had just pulled out in front of an on-coming vehicle, causing the other vehicle to brake to avoid a collision.
The driver was female and driving a Cadillac. She drove up over the inner circle curb at Madison Avenue and quickly accelerated over the speed limit before the officer performed the traffic stop.
The smell of alcohol poured out of the vehicle when she rolled down her window.
Her voice was slurred and she told the officer that she was driving like she was due to the music she was listening to on the stereo.
She agreed to perform field sobriety tests. It was clear to the officer that she was under the influence of alcohol and was placed under arrest.
She began screaming and crying once inside the vehicle. At the police station she provided a breath sample of .175 and .185 blood alcohol content. She was booked for DUI and bail was set at $10,000.
March 8
7:20 a.m. A local fitness establishment called to report a possible burglary.
The property manager called the police station to say he was contacted by the owner of the cleaning company about a problem the previous night. Cleaning workers found a young man in the shower area when the cleaning crew arrived around midnight to 3 a.m. that morning.
The male was sitting in one of the shower stalls on a chair. The crew could smell smoke but was unable to identify the source. The male was asked to leave, and he did.
Around 7:15 a.m., the male returned to the gym when it opened and walked toward the shower room. The property manager questioned the male as to why he was in the building when it was locked up for the night.
He said he was a gym member and gave his last name. The manager attempted to look up the boys information and told him to told to sit down while law enforcement was contacted.
The young man then slowly walked to the back hallway before running out the back door. He was chased, but jumped over a concrete wall.
He was described as white, late teens to early 20s, with short hair and wearing a sweatshirt and jeans with a green backpack.
The gym determined that the individual had stayed in the building after the doors were locked for the evening.
There were no signs of forced entry. The police were unable to locate the young man.

I actually don't have a problem with your use of XLinks here, and I might be misunderstanding you, but I think you might be getting a bit hung up on the serialization.

Multi-touch attribution provides deeper insight into buying behaviors.
by James Masuoka
The marketing industry is being redefined by changing consumer habits, virtually unlimited choices for advertising placement and greater access to customers through a variety of channels. As a result, many businesses are actively shifting the balance of their marketing initiatives from outbound channels to inbound, interactive campaigns such as search, mobile apps and social media.
This shift has created the need to understand the complete customer journey across owned, earned and paid interactions. It has also raised the bar in marketing analytics to not just simply see what touch generated a sale, but to understand the interplay and influence of marketing efforts. This level of insight demands technology that can move at the pace of marketing, work at a granular level and deliver game-changing results.
More marketing is not necessarily better—it can quickly sound like useless chatter. With new analytic capabilities, marketers can cut back on quantity and instead focus on quality in an integrated series of marketing investments that harmonize together to drive higher conversions, profits and customer satisfaction.
Attribution is the foundation of optimized marketing performance. There are two types of attribution:
To provide the greatest efficiency and value, any multi-touch attribution application must be comprehensive to include the growing number of customer touch points. It must also quickly incorporate vast amounts of available data, analytics and insights into operational business processes that transform go-to-market strategies and tactics.
When sophisticated algorithms are used to analyze prized data from weblogs, search engines, and social and mobile engagements, organizations gain deeper understanding and greater flexibility in how they value interactions—and a more accurate reflection of the customer to improve planning.
Savvy marketers know that every customer impression can impact other channels. Display ads and email have an indirect lift on search, for example, while mobile search is often linked to immediate in-store purchases. Granular multi-touch attribution can illuminate and visualize these patterns to provide better information that allows organizations to:
Multi-touch attribution is an analytically driven competitive advantage that is fundamental to optimizing marketing spend, mapping the customer journey and amplifying return on marketing investment (ROMI) or return on advertising spend (ROAS).
As the value of multi-touch attribution becomes clear to marketers, they are seeking out sophisticated solutions that provide extreme flexibility. Teradata Aster delivers a solution that simplifies the analytical heavy lifting without sacrificing advanced analytic functionality. The solution offers these customizable multi-touch models:
UNIFORM WEIGHTING
Every touch on the customer journey gets equal value with uniform weighting. For example, with five interactions, each touch is assigned a value of 20%. Although each interaction is weighted the same, a lot of analytics can be employed, such as adjusting the time windows from seconds to months, and fine tuning and qualifying interaction types, durations and actions.
These seemingly simple modifications can significantly improve the results of the attribution analysis. For instance, an email click that leads to a bounce can be excluded while other clicks are included. This is often a good place to start doing marketing attribution analysis.
EXPONENTIAL DECAY-DRIVEN ATTRIBUTION
Nurturing audiences quickly through the conversion funnel is critical to driving business performance. With exponential modeling, the value of successive touches increases closer to the point of conversion.Later touches have a higher weight, so earlier ones have less impact. With this model, if an email drove the initial site visit but the conversion came after an organic search, the search gets a higher fractional share of the credit for the conversion.
As a first step in considering decay, the time and number of interactions are used when determining the path to purchase. Analysts derive business value by defining a set rule for the decay rate of every interaction and creating a model that reflects marketing efforts over time. Iteration and testing of this model develops accuracy so that analysis does not need to be performed on every interaction.
PRECISION CUSTOM WEIGHTING
Sophisticated users can perfect their models by customizing the weights associated with each interaction. This enables them to give different values to various touch points. Weighting can be driven by order, quality of the engagement and other criteria. For example, users can place greater weight on the first and last clicks.
Customizable weighting allows analysts to integrate deep business knowledge into the models. Analysts can also deliver models more closely aligned to the business and develop highly sophisticated models without significant customization. Uniform and exponential models deliver a high degree of flexibility while employing adjustable parameters, windows and selection criteria. This lets users improve modeling accuracy with more precise time windows, tracked events and time-based value.
A TRIO OF INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS
Combined with a data warehouse from Teradata and the Aprimo Integrated Marketing Management (IMM) application suite, the Teradata Aster multi-touch attribution solution enables organizations to make quick, accurate decisions about which customers to target for specific campaigns via their preferred channel of communication.
The solution captures and analyzes customer data, and the results are entered into the data warehouse where they can be shared across the enterprise. Then, the Aprimo IMM software leverages those unique insights for campaigns that communicate with customers in the best way possible. For example, it’s not enough to know that homeowner John Doe lives in Atlanta, with three sons under 15 years of age, two Great Danes and a passion for tweeting about college football. It’s critical to know that Mr. Doe makes buying decisions from emails linked to mobile-optimized websites sent to his iPhone during the morning commute.
The IMM software enables marketers to have the right creative assets ready to compile the best possible combination of email messages, text alerts and website display ads for Mr. Doe on a Friday before the big rivalry game. The campaign management software is advanced enough to translate the attribution analysis into actionable outreach.
Teradata’s ability to bring together analytics, data warehousing and sophisticated campaign management is a core differentiator that’s unique in the marketplace. Working together, multi-touch attribution, a data warehouse and integrated marketing management can deliver:
TAKE THE CRITICAL STEP
Multi-touch attribution analytics are essential for marketers who need to understand today’s customer journey. Shifting from single-touch attribution to granular, multi-touch attribution is a critical step in adapting to compete in today’s data-driven marketplace. The rewards are clear: a better understanding of the customer, a higher level of customer engagement and a veritable gold rush for marketers.

There is no mutation, but rather evolution characterized by progress. Seven Cups is a lucky company in so many ways, and one of the most significant areas where our luck is great and continues to get better is the Seven Cups staff. One of the areas where our staff really shines is their knowledge of Chinese tea and Chinese tea culture. The quiet expert that has worked at Seven Cups since 2007 is Andrew McNeill. There are few people in the tea industry in the West that know as much about the subject of tea than Andrew. He also knows the company inside and out and has done every job that the company has, from serving tea at the teahouse to doing the books. Anyone that has spoken to him on the phone, or dealt with him in person, know what a pleasure he is to work with. His customer service is impeccable and his service to the company has always come from the heart, he even learned to speak Chinese so that he could do his job better.
Zoe Rose Lambert is a Tucson native that started with us more than a year ago serving tea at the teahouse. From the beginning she showed talent with photography and video editing. She has moved over to work with us in the warehouse, focusing on the artistic side of our company, redoing the photographs of our catalog, and helping with the upcoming version of out website, hopefully that will be published within the next couple of months. She even worked with Zhuping to produce brewing instructions videos for everyone of our teas.
Andrew and Zoe Rose are going to be taking over the Seven Cups tea blog from me, and will be working with Zhuping to put together more consumer education oriented blogs while I work on a project that will need my undivided focus for the foreseeable future. I will continue to publish some blogs from time to time, and I will do my best to act as an editor helping Andrew and Zoe Rose, but this will be my last tea blog for a while.
I am very proud to hand this over to them and I have great confidence that you will appreciate their writings about tea and tea culture. They will also be looking after out social media feeds. I can still be reached via email to answer questions. I want to thank the readers of the tea blog. I am going to be doing research in China and other tea growing areas with the hope that I can bring a deeper understanding of tea culture and history, so that people can become better educated about how the tea industry has come to it’s present state and where it might be going in the future.

Warren keeps RAT Board running behind the scenes
Thursday - 8/5/2010, 11:00am EDT
Encore presentation, Originally aired June 10, 2010 -- Jim Warren runs one of the most public federal Web sites in government -- Recovery.gov.
As the CIO of the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, Warren must ensure that the site meets all of its customers' needs.
Warren, who is on detail to the board from the Interior Department, says there are several changes coming to Recovery.gov over the next year, but the popular and much-analyzed site isn't his only priority.
The board continually is trying to improve data quality to show where Recovery Act funding is going. Warren also wants to add the ability of citizens or project managers to upload photos showing before and after pictures of the project that is being done with Recovery Act funding. He also wants to offer a blog tool to promote interactive discussions and give states the ability to download specific data elements to post on their Web sites.
Warren says another priority is to see how the board can further use cloud computing. Recovery.gov was the first governmentwide site to live only on the cloud.
He says several agencies have asked him about the decision and its challenges of moving to the cloud.Tonight I made 3 margaritas, drinking small amounts of each.
Each was made with a half lime squeezed, about half-ounce triple sec, 2 ounces tequila. Well stirred, no ice. After tasting each, I added a dash of Grand Marnier to each, which was a slight improvement.
The first used a blend of tequilas I made which incorporates a South African tequila-like drink. This did not work well, due I think to that South African drink which has a very earthy flavor I find hard to like.
The second used only 4 Copas Blanco. This was better, but the big vegetal flavor of tequila rang through and I am not used to it (I almost never drink tequila).
The third one used only Herradura Reposado. This I liked the best. The tequila flavor was evident but seemed more refined, tamed. There were no earthy green pepper notes or rather they were much more subtle than in the other versions. With the Grand Marnier (just a light dash) this was an excellent drink and I am finishing that one.

In a bench ruling in the case, City of Miami General Employees’ & Sanitation Employees’ Retirement Trust v. C&J Energy Services, Inc., Vice Chancellor Noble concluded that “it is not so clear that the [C&J] board approached this transaction as a sale,” with the attendant “engagement that one would expect from a board in the sales process.” Interestingly, the Court called the issue a “very close call,” and indicated it would certify the question to the Delaware Supreme Court at the request of either of the parties (at this time it does not appear either party has made a request). The decision provides guidance regarding appropriate board decision-making in merger transactions, particularly where one merger party is assuming minority status in the combined entity yet also acquiring management and board control.

“Something More” Than “But For” Required in the Ninth Circuit
The Ninth Circuit recently reversed a ruling by the U.S. District Court of Nevada granting summary judgment in favor of the SEC in a case alleging violations of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 in connection with the sale of unregistered securities. The SEC’s complaint alleged that 1st Global Stock Transfer LLC (“Global”), a transfer agent, and Global’s owner, Helen Bagley (collectively “Defendants”), assisted in the sale of unregistered securities for CMKM Diamonds, Inc. (“CMKM”), a purported diamond and gold mining company. The SEC’s complaint further alleged that CMKM had no legitimate business operations but instead the Company concocted false press releases and distributed fake maps and videos of mineral operations to its investors. While CMKM was one of several defendants in the action, the SEC only moved for summary judgment against Global, Bagley, and CMKM’s attorney. The District Court granted the SEC’s motion for summary judgment against the three defendants, but only Global and Bagley appealed that ruling.
In perpetrating the scheme, CMKM’s attorney was alleged to have provided hundreds of false opinion letters supporting the issuance of unregistered stock without restrictive legends to indicate that the stock was unregistered. Relying on these opinion letters, Global and Bagley issued additional CMKM stock without restrictive legends, believing that the issuance was legal. After a year and a half of this practice, Bagley became suspicious and asked a second law firm to confirm the opinion letters. The second law firm, however, relied on the first attorney’s opinion letters and also issued an opinion letter stating that the issuance of additional CMKM stock was valid. Based on the additional opinion letter, Global and Bagley continued to issue CMKM shares without restrictive legends. 
In the SDNY, Hindsight Is No Substitute for Red Flags When Alleging Scienter. 
Texas Court Rules that Regardless of Fault, CEOs and CFOs Will Have to Pay Up Under Sarbanes-Oxley Section 304 requires CEOs and CFOs to reimburse their company for any bonus or similar compensations, or any profits realized from the sale of company stock, for the 12-month period following a financial report, if the company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance committed as a result of misconduct.
Baker and Gluk, who were not alleged to have participated in the misconduct that led to ArthoCare’s restatement, challenged Section 304 as unconstitutional, arguing that the SEC could not require them to repay bonus compensation and profits from stock sales for merely holding CEO and CFO positions during the time of the alleged misconduct. In particular, they argued that Section 304 is vague and is unconstitutional because it does not require a reasonable relationship between the triggering conduct and the penalty as is required by the Due Process Clause.
Judge Sam Sparks of the Western District of Texas rejected the Officer-Defendants’ constitutional arguments. Judge Sparks first held that Section 304 was not vague because it clearly referred to misconduct on behalf of the issuer of the allegedly false financial statement. Judge Sparks noted that Defendants “should have been monitoring the various internal controls to guard against such misconduct; they signed the SEC filings in question, and represented they in fact were actively guarding against noncompliance. As such, they shouldered the risk of Section 304 reimbursement when noncompliance nevertheless occurred.” 
New SEC Rule Requires Securities Exchanges and FINRA to Work Together to Improve Monitoring of Trading Activity in the U.S.
On July 11, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved a new rule, which will require the national securities exchanges and self-regulatory organizations like the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) to establish a market-wide consolidated audit trail. The new consolidated audit trail will improve regulators’ ability to monitor and analyze trading activity. With the approval of Rule 613, the exchanges and FINRA must jointly submit to the SEC a comprehensive plan of how they plan to develop, implement, and maintain the consolidated audit trail. Rule 613 also requires that the consolidated audit trail collect and identify every order, cancellation, modification, and trade execution for all exchange-listed equities and equity options in all U.S. markets. Chances are you have seen an AT&T commercial on television in which a man gives a group of young kids a simple choice and concludes, “Bigger is better. It’s not complicated.”
It’s as if everybody knows that bigger is better, which the man illustrates with swimming pools and cell phone networks.
Is there something to the message he seeks from the kids?
A recent Gallup survey in each state asked people if their state was one of the best states to live in. The top-rated state by its inhabitants was Alaska. The worst state was Rhode Island. Maybe bigger is better. Or maybe lower taxes were a factor.
Maine, “the way life should be” state, finished fifteenth, topped by both New Hampshire and Vermont in New England.
But whether bigger is better is a good deal more complicated than the television ad would have us believe.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has begun talking about “New Russia,” which has its historical roots in an area far larger than the current Russia. It would include the Ukraine, possibly Belarus and maybe even Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia.
Putin and many Russians have not recovered from the loss of their country’s world influence when the Soviet Union was broken up, and they would like to restore its standing by creating a new and bigger Russia.
Bigger may be better for the Russians, but it obviously worries their neighbors. The way Russia took over Ukraine’s Crimean territory reveals how it might create a bigger, “New Russia.”
Americans, who generally like bigness, are beginning to worry about the rise of Russia as a new complicating factor in world affairs thanks to Putin’s version of “bigger is better.”
Then, there’s China. With a population of almost 1.4 billion people, it is the biggest country in the world. The United States is third, after India.
At the end of this decade, China is expected to have the largest economy in the world. Americans, used to having the Number One economy for almost 100 years, may have trouble no longer being the biggest.
On a per person basis, the United States will continue to have higher wealth than China for quite a while. And it should be pleased to be passed by China.
As countries become more prosperous, they seek to gain influence more often by economic means than by force. The United States can compete well on an economic playing field, and almost everybody would prefer such competition to military conflict. Bigger won’t necessarily make China better than the U.S., only better than China used to be.
And, of course, there’s the perennial debate about the American government. Is a bigger federal government better? That question is at the center of American politics now, just as it has been since the Constitution was written.
To some extent, government grows as the population grows. When the government provides services or monitors those it funds or regulates, it needs the personnel and equipment to cover more operations and deal with more people.
But congressional Republicans argue the federal government is involved in too many programs and has grown too large. They want to cut the size government and use the money saved to reduce either the federal debt or income taxes.
Much of the struggle with Democrats is over which programs to cut and by how much. The bipartisan agreement on agriculture policy, cutting funding for both farm subsidies and food stamps, was a rare example of how the two sides can work out a compromise reducing the size of government.
The obstacle to reductions frequently boils down to people wanting government programs to be cut, but not the ones from which they benefit.
The two major target areas for reducing the federal budget are the cost of entitlements, especially Medicare, and military spending. Savings in most other areas would be more symbolic than effective.
Medicare may look like a blank check to pay for ever-increasing costs. The solution would have to be some kind of cost control, which competition alone cannot sufficiently provide. But Congress has been unable to come close to agreeing on controlling health care cost increases.
As for the armed forces, according to some studies, the United States now spends more than the next nine countries combined. Congress sometimes gives the military more than it requests or needs, because it creates jobs, though it blocks direct, job-creation programs.
When it comes to the federal government, many would agree, “Bigger is not better.” How to get to “smaller” is the challenge.J.K. Rowling Elizabeth II Author J.K.

- From: "Peter Jason" <pj@xxxxxxxxxx>

The decline of civilizations is more likely due to a
plurality and confluence of factors; not just one. The
classic scenario is drought, disease, war, emigration,
plague and an invasion of giant rats.

Listeros,
An important detailed record of rainfall fluctuations in
ancient
Mexico has been researched. There is a new 1,238 year long
tree ring
chronology, the longest and most accurate in Mexican
history. One
large ancient drought that began in the ancient Southwest
extended
into Central Mexico from 1149-1167 CE. It would have
devastated maize
crops and perhaps dealt a fatal blow to the Toltec
civilization. The
record also precisely dates two other severe droughts that
may have
led to the rise of the Aztecs. The record also gives
independent
confirmation to the Terminal Classic drought that may have
led to the
collapse of the Maya Civilization. The new record narrows
the time
span to 897-922 CE, and it extended into Central Mexico.
The team
studied 74 core samples from Moctezuma Bald Cypress trees
growing in
Queretaro
The study will be published in the Geophysical Research
Letters, a
journal of the American Geophysical Union.

The video tells the story of a young woman who runs away from home, steals her dad’s motorcycle and finds freedom through a community of riders. Like the previously released “Hey Jane” video, the clip is filled with evocative images and cinematic touches, but also a lingering sense of dread.

The Real Estate Development Fund (REDF) has distributed 3,000 plots to citizens in Hail province as part of the government’s efforts to ease the housing shortage in the Kingdom.
The REDF implemented the land grant project in collaboration with the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs.
Hail is the first province to benefit from the joint program that was launched two months ago.
The preference in the land grant is given to applicants whose names appeared on a list of people selected for REDF’s housing loans. As such, this grant removed the obstacle for a number of citizens who could have been denied their right to build their own homes after receiving REDF loans worth SR 500,000.
The land grant is finalized only after the municipal authorities’ approval and only after they ensure that the beneficiary did not get a land grant on an earlier occasion, Al-Eqtisadiah business daily reported yesterday.
The new program is expected to bring down property prices and break the hold of real state businessmen on property prices, according to reports. The program also permits the construction of houses at any location; hence it does not constrain the beneficiary to a land plot decided by the real estate businessmen with vested interests.
Hail Gov. Prince Saud bin Abdul Mohsen had earlier urged the fund managers and the Hail municipality to speed up the land grant process in the province.
The program has also asked 16 mayoralties and 244 smaller municipalities to complete the formalities needed for the land grants and to ensure all the applicants for housing loans are fully qualified for the loan.
Fawaz Al-Shamri, director of the Real Estate Development Fund in Hail, reassured citizens that the land grant project would be effective immediately in Hail, thereby allowing the applicants, whose loans were approved, to commence the construction of their houses as soon as possible.
Economic consultant Abdullah Al-Ajaji said the construction of 500,000 housing units ordered by Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Abdullah at a cost of SR 250 billion would help reduce real estate prices and rents.
Another factor that has kept the house prices high is the spiraling land price.
Unemployment among Saudis is also said to be one of the reasons that intensified the country’s housing crisis.
According to some studies the housing demand will continue to outstrip supply, requiring SR 500 billion in financing to construct 1.25 million houses by 2014.
Total real estate financing is also forecast to reach SR 60 billion by 2013.
Hasan Al-Yamani, director at the Abdul Latif Jameel Real Estate Installments, said recently that the new mortgage law would have a moderating effect on the Saudi real estate market over the short to medium-term, allowing up to 80 percent of Saudi citizens to become first-time homeowners.Takahiro Kambe wrote: > In message <468AACBE.7070706@berklee.edu> > on Tue, 03 Jul 2007 16:08:30 -0400, > Louis Guillaume <lguillaume@berklee.edu> wrote: >> I was just installing ruby18-base from pkgsrc-2007Q2 on Linux (redhat) >> and found this... > ... >> => Checking file-check results for ruby18-base-1.8.6nb1 >> ERROR: ************************************************************ >> ERROR: The following files are in the PLIST but not in /usr/pkg: >> ERROR: /usr/pkg/lib/ruby/1.8/i386-linux/dbm.so >> *** Error code 1 > This is typical case that ruby's configure script couldn't find dbm > (or its compatible) library. > > Dose your system installed dbm library, gdbm or somethine? > Yes it does.

A new take on pushing
If coached pushing is potentially harmful, why do as many as 80 percent of hospitals and obstetricians continue to rely on it? “I think that a lot of what happens in the second stage of labor has been based more on tradition than on evidence,” says Edmund Funai, M.D., professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Yale University School of Medicine. “But where we’re heading now is to have women push when they feel like pushing.”Main Content

We joined the man behind the monthly “Off the Record: A Listening Party” series at saki record store on a hunt for his next albums.
Sam lewis
As Sam Lewis recalls, the idea for Chicago’s new monthly music series “Off the Record: A Listening Party” happened almost by accident. “We had a separate meeting at the DCASE offices last December to talk about a night-time farmer’s market in Logan Square, [but talk turned to a music series],” he relays as we meet up for some vinyl shopping at saki record store.
Lewis is the director of the Elastic Arts Foundation, who, along with saki, were each provided a one-year contract by Chicago’s Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events (DCASE) to produce free monthly events celebrating a local musician or band with an upcoming release. The one caveat: it must be on vinyl.
The advance listening party also features a performance by the band and interactive elements like Q&A, plus light food fare from a local vendor. DJ Ayana Contreras (the host of “Reclaimed Soul,” a weekly radio program at Vocalo) keeps the momentum going in between programming.
Lewis produces the events with artist/urban planner Theaster Gates, and together they have welcomed musicians including The ONES and Joshua Abrams’ Natural Information Society at the inaugural event in January and David Boykin in February, all at the University of Chicago’s Washington Park Arts Incubator (the events saki produces are all in-store).
“The community we are building will have ripples,” Lewis says of the attendees that have included university people, neighborhood revelers, and even north siders. “I’m happy we can be part of the catalyst in reviving the arts scene on the south side. Of all that’s happening in those neighborhoods right now, this sends a good message.”
While at saki, Lewis picked out albums from three of his favorite artists—a dream list for Off the Record; or maybe just fodder for DJ Ayana.
Curtis Mayfield
“I was in New York when he had the stage accident, and he was never the same.”
Isaac Hayes
“We’re from the same town of Covington, Tennessee.”
John Lee Hooker
“I always appreciated his longevity, to be relevant for so long. And he always had an excitement for playing music.”
Off the Record’s next installment features experimental rockers ONO, who will preview their first album in 26 years. Check them out on Saturday, March 9 at the Washington Park Arts Incubator, 301 East Garfield Boulevard. The event is free.

The Gaels (15-6 overall) are defending their South Central Calhoun Duals championship today in Rockwell City.
St. Edmond will open the event against Eagle Grove at 10 a.m., followed by matches with Hampton-Dumont, Lawton-Bronson, West Monona and South Central Calhoun.
The Gaels already own dual victories over Eagle Grove and Hampton-Dumont and are looking to finish the regular season on a positive note.
"We want to gain some confidence and momentum heading into the postseason,'' said first year head coach Tanner Utley. "It's easy to look forward to sectionals, but we need to make this another steep toward the postseason.''
Fourth-ranked junior Kaden McClintock (31-0 at 113), fifth-ranked senior Teddie Harvey (30-0 at 145) and top-ranked Vinnie Harvey (31-0 at 220) will look to finish the regular season unbeaten.
PROBABLE LINEUP
St. Edmond
106 - Ryan Szalat, soph. (30-3); 113 - Kaden McClintock, jr. (31-0); 120 - Colten Lastine, sr. (16-11); 126 - Nick Johnson, fr. (26-6); 132 - Eddie Harvey, sr. (14-20); 138 - Matt Stumpf, sr. (22-13); 145 - Teddie Harvey, sr. (30-0); 152 - Parker Huebsch, jr. (8-7); 160 - Jimmy Averill, jr. (16-18); 170 - Kyle Lawler, jr. (0-1); 182 - Dillon Nelson, sr. (27-7); 195 - Jacob Salisbury, sr. (13-19); 220 - Vinnie Harvey, sr. (31-0); 285 - Open.
Sophomore 106-pounder Ryan Szalat (30-3) entered the rankings at No. 8 this week.
The Gaels won the tournament last year by defeating the Titans in the final dual.
South Central Calhoun enters with two ranked wrestlers. Senior Chase Goodman is seventh at 126 pounds and junior Aron King is seventh at 285 pounds.
"The dual against South Central Calhoun has always been pressure packed,'' Utley said. "It will be good for our team and individuals.
"They'll be competitive matches and it's the kind of dual we like to be in.''
Lawton-Bronson's Ron Singleton is ranked 10th at 220 pounds.

Не могу больше ждать(((Like the best people, the best looks are the ones that don’t take themselves too seriously. I think most of us can agree that a sense of humor is the most attractive trait for any person. That’s precisely why I was drawn to today’s Fashionista. Her ensemble has that “just thrown together” vibe that reads equal parts stylish and approachable.
Take note of how this Fashionista’s outfit balances of-the-moment trends with classic pieces. She is rocking the tights with shorts trend on bottom while sporting a basic sweater and traditional, plaid scarf on top. This pairing allows the outfit to extend beyond today’s fashion bubble and work well into the future.
I also appreciate how this Fashionista adds a pop of neon with her computer bag for a pleasing shock of color. This unexpected touch brightens the rest of her look but doesn’t overwhelm. Neon is a tricky trend to pull off but in small doses it can add a much-needed dose of whimsy. She finishes her ensemble with a great pair of black oxford boots. These not only add weight to her outfit but also complement the slim line of her legs.
The slouchy silhouette of this Fashionista’s look reminds me that sometimes we can take our comfy clothes to a new level of chic. We don’t always need to scream pulled together in order to appear stylish. The vibe of today’s example brings to mind the “boho-chic” ensembles of Kate Moss and Mary-Kate Olsen. Use these muses for inspiration to create your own version of this carefree style philosophy.
First things first, find a great sweater and a bold scarf to hide behind during these chilly days. Add eye-catching accessories like this neon satchel or this bold headband to keep things interesting. Don’t worry too much about how the pieces are matching. Instead, focus on keeping the hues in the same color palate. Today’s Fashionista is wearing mostly muted tones, for example. But above all, remember to have fun with it because, in the end, that’s what really makes this style work..

Roger Hickman's Restaurant
Derek James
Monday, May 13, 2013
8:54 AM
Something very unusual happened when DEREK JAMES took his wife Bridgette to Roger Hickman’s Restaurant in Norwich to celebrate their wedding anniversary.
I could tell she was struggling but I never thought I would see her put her spoon and fork down...and admit defeat.
For the first time in living memory my wife had left a piece of chocolate on her plate. “I just can’t,” she said. “I can’t finish it. I am stumped!”
She puffed out her cheeks, sighed and sat back in her chair. Left on the plate was a lonely slice of chocolate.
The dessert we had both chosen, following two substantial courses, was the following:
Chocolate fondant with Greek yoghurt sorbet, coffee anglaise and chocolate and peanut mousse.
It tasted as good as it sounds and Roger Hickman had achieved a first.
He had served up a delicious dessert which my wife, who has had a lifelong love affair with chocolate and has had a daily chocolate fix for most of our married life, couldn’t finish.
“I am so sorry,” she told our waitress, “but I just can’t manage that last piece of chocolate.”
This was the woman who has eaten at least one Kitkat and four squares of Lindt 70 per cent a day since we were married in 1970.
We had decided to push the boat out and mark our 43rd wedding anniversary by visiting this restaurant under the Hickman name for the first time.
The last time we called in, several years ago, it was run by the top chef, the legendary David Adlard, so did it match his high standards? He had set the bar pretty high.
Was this still among the best restaurants not only in Norwich but across Norfolk?
The answer to both questions is yes.
The former head chef Roger Hickman has made this stylish and elegant restaurant his own and serves up food to savour. Meals you will remember. Food which challenges the tastebuds.
Ambitious and original courses which have the hallmark of a talented chef in control of his kitchen stamped all over them. Not afraid to try something different.
For a weekday night Hickman’s in Upper St Giles was busy with people of all ages. It was good to see several families eating together - adding to the atmosphere.
We were offered a taster menu from £55 or the table d’hote dinner menu which costs £34 for two courses or £42 for three courses.
The three courses we chose from the table d’hote menu were all rather special. They looked good and tasted better.
I started with pan fried salmon which was a delight, the fish was fantastic and I then had loin of venison which came with a individual tasty little venison pie (and braised red cabbage.)
My wife selected the pigeon breasts followed by the pan fried sea bass which was also delicious.
Much thought had gone into preparing these dishes along with the appetisers and palette cleansing dishes which were served during the meal.
It all came together so well.
And as for the dessert - it was magnificent. I am proud to say I finished mine. Every last morsel.
It used to be the case that the more up-market the restaurant, the less food was served on the plate. Not so in Hickman’s.
If you are looking for top class food served in friendly surroundings then head for Hickman’s - a place we can all be proud of.
We see them on the television most weeks but Norwich can be proud of its very own its very own master chef - by the name of Roger Hickman.
The bill for the two of us, with wine and sparkling water, came to just over £100. It was worth every penny.

Responding to debate in Germany after Loew's team struggled to beat Algeria 2-1 in extra time in the last 16, Koepke said switching Lahm from midfield where he has failed to shine was a possibility.
"There is no doubt that Lahm is a super player as a right full back," Koepke told reporters at Germany's base camp in a resort on the Atlantic in north-eastern Brazil ahead of Friday's quarter-final against France. "It's not the case that we won't deviate from certain things if we feel they'll lead to success. We're not sticking stubbornly to our point of view," he added after many Germans, including Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere who is also the sports minister, have said Lahm is playing out of position.
Loew has started Lahm, 30, as holding midfielder in Germany's first four matches at the World Cup but he has played poorly to moderately, getting mainly negative marks in German media. Only after being switched to right back in an emergency due to an injury to Shkodran Mustafi late in the match against Algeria did Lahm impress German fans, the media and a long line of former players.
"As far as the public discussion in Germany goes, we're naturally discussing these things internally as well," said Koepke, who is the goalkeeper coach but spent much of his news conference answering questions about Lahm. "At the end of the day we have to do what we are convinced is the right thing to do. We've just got to see what's the best line-up against France."
Moving Lahm, one of the best right backs in the world, to midfield is part of Loew's grand strategy to start four tall centre backs with strong heading skills, a tactic increasingly criticised as cowardly after Germany have played such entertain football in recent years. There are no speedy full backs in the line-up and they had been a key part of Germany's attack.
Their absence was most glaring against Algeria when Mustafi on the right and Benedikt Hoewedes on the left had their worst matches of the tournament and failed to get forward to crack open a tight defence. What is also baffling is that Germany have a plethora of outstanding midfielders on the bench, including Lukas Podolski and Andre Schuerrle, but a dearth of top defenders.
Goalkeeper Manuel Neuer said he would also be happy to see Lahm return to the right back slot but was careful to avoid criticising his coach. "I'm happy when Philipp plays right back," said Neuer.
"He brings a lot of zip to our game. We're stronger offensively when he plays full back. But I feel comfortable when he's in the midfield. He can play both positions almost perfectly."

Most American men at the age of 47 do not have what are known, in the body-building trade, as "abs." Indeed, the very anatomical existence of "abs" was unknown until about 20 years ago, when various commercial entities and magazine publishers decided that there was money to be made in persuading men that they needed these things desperately.
Having really good abs was necessary for your mental health, we were told. A man was supposed to be cut, ripped, shredded, lacerated, flayed, eviscerated and so on -- all wonderful things to be in gym-rat speak.
The problem is, there is another, competing paradigm, one that comes to a man more naturally. That is the paradigm that says that when you are entering middle-age, it is time to develop a substantial presence that includes a "tummy," a protuberance of excess flesh so pronounced that you find yourself reflexively patting it as though it were a house pet.
For many of us, self-esteem is inextricably connected to our sense of being massive. We want to enter a room and immediately distort the spacetime continuum. We want others to feel the floorboards shuddering and see the hors d'oeuvres running for cover.
All of this explains why these photos of Obama in Hawaii are deeply disturbing. We already knew he was a gym rat, but do we really want a president who has no body fat at all and seems to have been working obsessively on his abs?
Look at him: He may be the new Leader of the Free World, but he doesn't look like a good eater.
When was the last time he had a cheeseburger? Or has the pressure of running for president turned him into a political Thomas Merton, a fanatic for discipline, someone who can't feel totally in control of his life on any given day unless he's performed 300 sit-ups and eaten nothing but wild greens, whole grains, acorns, tree bark, tubers, and (as a wild indulgence) a single, three-ounce medallion of poached chicken (from an animal raised humanely on open prairie, with a heated coop and piped-in Mozart).
This isn't jealousy talking. It is good that the man sets a fine example. Indeed, the moment I finish typing this, I'm headiing to the gym (and then on to the House O' Liposuction). This is merely a good-government issue. I'm concerned about Obama's apparent agenda:
1. Rescue American economy and way of life.
2. End Iraq War.
3. Work on quads and delts.
4. End dependence on foreign oil.
5. Moderate global warming.
6. Tighten glutes.
And so on. There's just a lot on his plate, figuratively; now that he's won the election, maybe he should let that be literally true as well.
--
Like many of you, no doubt, I spent a good chunk of the morning riveted to the TV/Internet, watching the Swift Water Rescue Team of Cabin John save a bunch of people who were trapped in their cars in a river that hadn't been there earlier in the morning. Mind you that it was 19 degrees outside. Mind you also that these rescue folks are trained to operate in actual rivers, and not in the downspew of a busted water main. It was pretty thrilling to watch, and reminded me that, when I take the kids to school, I should remember always to wear shoes, just in case I have to wade and scramble out of a surprise river. Question: In driver's ed classes, do they teach you these days how to get into a basket lowered by a chopper? Good news is that everyone seems safe. But my teeth were chattering just watching it.

I assume this article is written somewhat tongue-in-cheek, but I think it's fantastic that our president-elect exercises regularly. In a country with one of the highest obesity rates, Obama's exercise routine can serve as an example of how Americans can model positive behavior. Maybe he'll inspire a few more people to improve their health through exercise and healthy eating. In a high-stress job such as Obama's, it's all the more important to be physically fit.

It's one thing to have a President with great abs and eating humanely-raised chicken and greens. It's another to have a smoker in the White House. I really don't understand how such a health lifestyle can be maintained if you're also a cigarette smoker. Mr. Obama, take out that cigarette!(please!)

Queen Victoria thought that Millard Fillmore was the most handsome man she had ever seen. But back then, I doubt if presidents donned swimtrunks, with the image available for public consumption.
Millard Fillmore was the only president to be born in a log cabin, although others tried to claim such humble beginnings. I've wondered if being raised by a welfare mother trumps a log cabin?
I wonder how many men give pet names to their girthy guts?

And to us men of a certain age, do not be intimidated. These so called "abs" are nothing but some cunningly-devised body armor. Really. It's all titanium alloy.
Now and again I have been motivated to get in touch with my inner Clooney. Like when I was 15 after that whole "Aimee at summer camp" business. Or after I watched Iron Man and wondered if Robert Downey Jr looked that way despite of or because of years of drug abuse.
I break out my weights and the jump rope and put on the Theme from "Rocky." (I sensibly draw the line at the raw eggs though.)
But here's the thing. Body types are heavily influenced by genetics. You got your mesomorph and your ectomorph and your mallamarmorph and what not. You can work out all you want and the results will still not be what you desire.
Case in point. Recently I was lifting weights in the basement when my daughter asked if maybe I should buy some new ones. I asked why, and she, with the irritating honesty of youth, strongly implied that my old ones were clearly not working right anymore.

Oh, don't be impressed by the copter rescues, Joel. They do it because it's faster and easier than trying to set up lines and wade people out in 19-degree weather. It's dramatic but that's no reason to get excited about it. All in a day's work.

Dandylion, when I opened it, the ambience was set to "water"-- it's a kind of watercolor with a big whitish "sun" set in the middle, with a thin horizon.
The colors change everytime it's played and the colors change throughout...
It started off with a slow expansion from dark purple, then quickly went to a very intense red-pink, with changing loops, lines, flowers outlines on the "sun", slowish rhythm-- with puffs of red smoke.
Around 1/3 ways through, it faded to grey and then a very bright sky blue, and the tempo increased on the "sun", a lot of vibration--it made me think of tense water. Then 2/3 way through, it changed to green and to yellow... seems more a funky beat, not sure-- it ended with yellow.
I haven't seen that much "action" in the water ambience visualization of any song-- not boring. I particularly like the middle of it. So well done!

Or we could just read the WaPo coverage:
//Neustadt said the depth and speed of the current also made it too dangerous for workers to reach the site where the 44-year-old pipe had ruptured and turn off the valve. Instead, workers cut the supply from the Potomac Filtration Plant, near the Mormon Temple, to reduce the amount of water flowing through the pipe, which is a direct line from the plant. They located two valves up the line from the break and were trying to close them in order to stop the water entirely, Neustadt said. //

Wilbrod, thanks for the visuals, I only learned last week that some media players do an electronic interpretation of the music that they render. I'll give you my best shot at trying to describe the music.
It starts out with an electric guitar, distorted, playing an upbeat, catchy little riff that gives way to violins that repeat a motif as more instrumentation is added, including the drums. It gets heavier and heavier as it melts into a pounding violin / slap bass duet which, in turn climaxes into a chipper pop-style bass and keyboard routine. After the bass is finished, the clarinet and flute take over the keyboard and the piece gets soft and quiet. Then the bassoon moves in like a dark cloud with a few deep, elongated notes. This sets the tone for the violin rally, Vivaldi style, which begins somewhat daintily and plays along with the base, wind instruments whose rithym had been established by the keyboard. It gradually charges into a full blown violin frenzy and ends with a punch.
Hmmm. After reading what I wrote I have a notion that a picture might be described in a thousand words, but it may be impossible to describe music with the written language.

You obviously don't work out much, do you, or even spend time at a gym gawking, and wondering why people your own age look better than you do.
The President-elect is an ectomorph; he has a slim man's body, looks good now and will continue to look good for years. He is not ripped, nor does he have no body fat. He doesn't have the much-prized vascularity and he has no six-pack. That's not a slam, simply the facts. He's in excellent shape for his age, but it's primarily his genetics.

laloomis, I know you're a stickler for getting facts straight, so I wanted to let you know that Pres J Buchanan was also born in a log cabin. Originally in Cove Gap PA, it has been moved to Mercersburg PA. My understanding is that a handful or so of our early presidents were born in log cabins. Not a big surprise, seeing as aluminum siding was so far in the future (yes, I know bricks were made on site back then, and that plenty of houses were made that way...I was going for humor).
On a different topic, I was recently reminded that Ezra Pound's full name is Ezra Weston Loomis Pound. Knowing of your fascination with genealogy I thought I'd mention it, in case you weren't aware, and he turns out to be another distant relative.
About the fly-by posters, geez, some people just don't get humor. I bet they don't know why the Horwitz brothers were funny either.

ScienceKid#1 and I both find Weingarten tremendously funny. I have no beef with him. I think he's one hell of a writer, both purely for humor and in feature-writing. His chat persona is, obviously, just that: a persona, a public face that is an intentional exaggeration of personal behaviors, especially the unattractive ones, as a satire of himself and everyone who remotely resembles him in gender, political outlook, etc.
I once offered a comment to his chat that there seem to be folks who hate and despise him with a deep and thorough-going passion, but who nevertheless make it a point every week to follow the Tuesday chat, apparently to refresh their supply of outrage and contempt. Given this, and the fact that it is trivially easy to figure out where he lives, I wondered if this ever bothered him in a, y'know, "fear for life and limb" sort of way. Oddly, this question never was posted to the chat.
It is the job of a humorist, especially a political humorist, to push the envelope of acceptable discourse. That means that there are people who never will find that humorist to be funny. What I don't understand is those people who find the humorist not merely unfunny, but personally vile and repulsive, as if they have ever been in the presence of the actual person instead of his public persona and have had the opportunity to assess his actual ethics and morals and personal habits.

Isn't that the joy of cooking with real ingredients, Jumper? If you don't like ginger, you just leave it out. If you were using a pre-packaged mixture, you wouldn't have that option.

I have never found GW particularly funny, like Ma Frostbitten I still bemoan the loss of Kornheiser's column in the Wapo Sunday Mag. But, Wapo is very lucky to have as its unfunniest humorist someone who is better than most.
I will not eat organ meat, I don't care what domestic or game animal it came from. Ma Frostbitten can drive me mad with the tantalizing smell of liver and onions, the sort of aroma that makes one happy just anticipating the first delicious bite. Alas, the texture makes me gag. Once in Officer Candidate School, back in the day when you cleaned your plate for fear of being identified for some sort of ridicule, I took liver and onions in the chow line. (I was so very hungry, and the 15th meal in a row of veal -frozen breaded patties made a million different ways-made me ready to submit to any gastronomic insult.) I sat down light hearted and eager to dig in, realizing too late I could not swallow the first bite, much less more. Candidate Petersen, where ever you are now, and to whatever rank you rose, I am forever in your debt. I mark the day you let me slide my plate up to yours and scoop the liver over, without a single word exchanged, as one of the happiest of my existence.

I was taking a few minutes to myself, catching up on backboodling.
laloomis, not that you'll ever reply to me or in any way indicate that you read my posts (either this one or the previous) but I saw there was something on the last boodle about federal employees never being laid off. In 1995/96, there were two furloughs of federal employees (one, beginning just over a week before Christmas was the longest in US history); the effect on the public and the trickle-down effect on other non-governmental sectors was staggering. CRS 98-844 gives a good overview of those effects, if you're so inclined to educated yourself on the topic.
Also, I don't think you can go after someone for something they might have implied six months ago, and you can't go after someone for liable/slander when what they said was true. Doesn't work if you started it either. Kinda like throwing the first punch in a bar fight, getting the cr@p kicked out of you, then crying foul. Can't get any traction on something like that. Besides, 6 mos later, you'd have to show actual harm, not just the potential for it.

Recently the US Embassy here started a weekly section called “Ask The US Ambassador” in the newspaper. I thought that was very good PR. Last week someone asked :
Q: What does 'G.I.' in the US Army stand for?
G.I. is a term describing members of the US military or items of their equipment. The term is often thought to be initials for "Government Issue", "General Issue", o "General Infantry" but actually refers to galvanised iron
The letters "GI." used to denote equipment such as metal trashcans made from galvanised iron in US Army inventories and supply records. During World War I, US soldiers cynically referred to incoming German artillery shells as "GI cans"; it was assumed that "GI" stood for "Government Issue".
The term was later applied to all military equipment then to the soldiers themselves. The term reached its climax with the deployment of American troops during World War II.
However, the term G.I. was always used much more by civilians and the media than it was by Army soldier: themselves. By the time of the Korean War, the term was largely restricted to use by the press; war correspondent in particular.

Good morning, all! In the spirit of the season, I slept past my normal time of arising. Oh well, that's okay for today. At least I didn't completely miss dawn patrol. I didn't, did I?
Everything's ready here, as best I can tell. The major task for the day is to take presents to twin boys. Although I've had them since June, they weren't wrapped Sunday when the babies were here. An excellent excuse for a Christmas Eve visit!

Morning all... Shriek... thanks for the Christmas "card." I love your house... and your family looks wonderful. Nice to finally see you, too!
Christmas Eve... it's Birthday Eve for my sister E. I was the Christmas Baby until she was born five years and three days later! In a snowstorm!
Tomorrow the G family has what we like to call "Jewish Christmas." We relax all day (after opening presents, of course), then go to a movie together in the late afternoon and then dinner at a Chinese restaurant. I love it.. best Christmases ever. Relaxing, quiet and lots of good family time. Any movie suggestions? I'm proposing Australia or the new Brad Pitt movie.
We have our Big Family Christmas on another day (this year it was last Saturday), so we're free to celebrate The Big Day the G way. As sad as it is to have lost both my parents, there are some benefits to being an adult orphan. This is one of them.
Have a Happy Christmas Eve everyone! I'm off to work (very happily) and will get home early to wrap presents.

Good morning all. You know, those words in the kit about the self-esteem of being massive have triggered an old memory.
As a young teen I suffered from the "Gumby Effect" in that my weight didn't keep up with my height. At the towering height of 69 inches I typically hovered around 120 pounds.
So for a brief exhilarating period in my life my personal self-improvement goal was to gain weight.
Ah, youth.
With great effort, and many, many peanut-butter and honey sandwiches, I gradually expanded my physique. I remember quite clearly going to a dance and sauntering confidently across the gymnasium floor while reveling in the glorious sense of massiveness that came from being nearly 135 pounds.
I remember thinking that, one day, I might even reach my ideal weight of 149 pounds.
Now, in the years that have passed many things have changed. Peanut butter and honey sandwiches are no longer my friend. I seldom get accused of being gaunt. And dancing "The Hustle" is right out.
Yet, ironically, I have maintained one thing in common with those distant days. I still maintain the awesome dream of reaching my perfect weight.

We have last-minute food preparations to complete before the in-laws arrive. Apples to peel, things to chop, and, of course, the Christmas plates to haul up from the basement.

RD,
I too weighed around 125 at high school graduation. It was a pain to find 29 waist dress pants. I used to shop at Merry Go Round in the mall because they had the best selection of skinny clothes.
For my sophomore winter break I visited my parents in Italy and ate pasta for three meals a day. I haven't had trouble finding jeans in my size since.
I once heard a rule of thumb that part of our national weight problem is that we gain two pounds each holiday season and then never lose them. Over 25 years, that is a gain of fifty pounds. Which seems a pretty reliable estimate in my experience.

My ideal weight is 107, she says with a chuckle. I was there once, when I was 12. Not ever since. My excuse now is that I have much more muscle than I did then (really! it's what using an Airdyne for 23 years will do) and that weighs more than fat. Oh, and the post-menopausal gain.

Just in time for Christmas...chatter from my husband about his company's "new" severance package. When I asked him this morning why he was talking about the details, he said that the information was on the internal company website and some folks had already been offered severance packages. This does not bode well for the new year.
This is a season I have chosen as no stress, no fuss, no muss. There is no tree. There has been no decorating. The front yard is immaculate, though, with all leaves cleaned up. There are no gifts--since it's been replacement spending. We replaced the lamp shades that had been damaged long ago in the cross-country moves--the plastic behind the linen had big cracks in many places. If we had turned over once more on our old flannel sheets, our toes probably would have made holes, so we ordered new ones online since none of the local stores carry Cal King.
Big discounts from book retailers--so treats here: Ackroyd's history of the Thames, Jane Mayer--wish I had gotten her autograph in Austin (as Doug Brinkley had when they both were on the dais, Brinkley mentioning how hot her book is), Tom Friedman for the first time, and a tome from Yale University Press about the British and Spanish influence on the North American continent from 1492 onward.
I have not baked. There is no special dinner tomorrow. We shall probably be eating East Indian food at a restaurant tomorrow, perhaps among Hindus. I hope for the dine-out. I would love to see a movie, but that probably doesn't pass the realm of possibility since my husband is on-call. Long 15-hour day for him yesterday.
Hpefully, a relaxing, quiet day Thursday with no calls from corporate.

I'm posting this without comment...except to add that I received notification of my pay raise yesterday, and it is 3%, not what's in this report (I know that'll please Loomis no end):
Bush issues order implementing 3.9 percent pay raise
By Alyssa Rosenberg
December 19, 2008 President Bush on Thursday issued an executive order implementing the 3.9 percent pay hike for federal employees included in the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance and Continuing Appropriations Act passed in September.
The 3.9 percent figure is 1 percentage point higher than the administration initially proposed in its February budget, and brings the 2009 civilian pay increase in line with the raise for members of the military.
National Treasury Employees Union President Colleen Kelley said she was pleased with the pay raise, but wished the initial proposal had been higher.
"It is disappointing that in every year of this administration, it has failed to make the connection between fair and competitive pay and the ability of agencies to secure and keep the high-quality employees they need if they are going to meet public expectations of government service," she said.
The executive order was necessary to specify how the overall civilian pay hike will be divided between base and locality pay. Bush allocated 2.9 percent to basic pay, and 1 percent to locality increases.
For General Schedule employees, base pay will range from $17,540 for employees in Grade 1, Step 1, to $127,604 for employees in Grade 15, Step 10. For employees in the Senior Executive Service, pay will range from $117,787 to $177,000 for executives in agencies with certified SES performance appraisal systems, and from $117,787 to $162,900 in agencies without such systems.
Members of the SES paid the current minimum salary of $114,468 will receive guaranteed 2009 raises of 2.9 percent to bring their salaries in line with the new floor of $117,787. Raises for other senior executives will be determined on an individual basis and will vary by agency.
The Office of Personnel Management posted updated locality pay tables to accompany the order.
Employees in the Washington-Baltimore-Northern Virginia area will receive the highest total pay adjustment, at 4.78 percent. Those in the "rest of U.S." category will get an overall boost of 3.52 percent.

Happy Christmas Eve everyone! I am working a half day today (although I say it's on PST so technically I finish at 10 a.m.!). Then, heading out to the stadium for the Hawaii Bowl to see our Warriors go up against the Fighting Irish. I believe the point spread is 3. Should be interesting. Alohaspouse usually ends up at the Hawaii Bowl each year with the rest of the Aloha family going to an Xmas party. This year we thought we'd make it a family Xmas Eve event. Somethin' different.
It's breezy and a little cloudy here. Hope you all are staying warm up there!

It is a double-edged sword working for the Government.
The base salaries really are significantly below those of the commercial sector. I could easily be making more than 25 percent more as a contractor - even with the bad economy.
Further, Feds have to deal with far more regulations and restrictions than do most employees, and in certain areas the rules mandate intrusions into personal privacy that would horrify many.
And, of course, being a Fed makes you an easy target for disdain. Especially for those who work in areas where they are legally forbidden from fighting back.
On the other hand, the benefits are great and the job security high. Finally, of course, there are some who really do think that working for the Federal Government is part of a higher calling to public service. A way to truly improve the system instead of just grousing about it from a safe
distance.
Finally, realize that the civil service isn't an inherited class, nor are positions handed out by royal decree. You need to compete for such positions. So feel free to apply.

Morning all, finishing up a few work chores from home then at 2:00 it's time to go over to the rental place we're letting the dott use for the holidays. Double edged sword there, I'd rather have paying guests in it but we are not quite at the adult relationship where having her in my home is preferable to down the road a piece. No tree at Chez Frostbitten, which doesn't feel as bad as I imagined. Our real tree is in St. Paul and I put up an undecorated fake tree in the rental for Frostdottir. I think her best present this year will be the 3 crates of long unused ornaments and instructions to "decorate the tree any way you want." Mr. F has seen it, and suggests I have a couple glasses of wine before the official unveiling this afternoon.
If I don't get back here today, Merry Christmas, and whether you celebrate or not, all the best to you and yours.

Snow in Victoria, snow in Vancouver, snow in Seattle! It's really coming down, on top of all the snow still on the ground and in the streets. The good news is that it's slightly above freezing, which gives me hope that one of these days it will warm up enough to become rain. Then we get the heavy, rain-soaked snow which causes roofs to collapse...but we won't get into that now.
Christmas Eve is the day I enjoy. After the excitement of Christmas morning, I get the holiday letdown. Today is all about the possibilities (tomorrow, the reality).
And I'm the backup oncall person today, which wouldn't be so bad, but some bright people scheduled a power outage at one of the data centers today, so there is a probability I'll have to help out.

So not only is Obama our Coolest President Ever, he's our Hottest President Ever.Checking out modules: Web Links
Another item checked off on my slowly-progressing To Do list: I've converted my once-static Links page to a new dynamic Links page, built with the Web Links module. How's it look? Hmm, I don't care for the default theming I'm getting, with weak title text overshadowed by the link URLs. Some tweaking of the theme and/or the Web Links settings is in order. For now, though, how about the functionality?
Web Links treats each link as a node, with fields including node title, the link URL, and some description. The purpose is to allow dynamic sorting and listing of links, as well as nifty tricks like automated checking of links for viabiliy.
In typical Drupal fashion, Web Links isn't the only solution tackling this need; there are several floating about. You'll find a nice overview here:
Comparison of Links Page modules
As the page suggests, Web Links is perhaps the most feature-complete solution, and appears to have a future thanks to active supporters. (I was fond of an earlier solution, the Janode module, which unfortunately has dropped off the map in the D6 age.) Reviewers on the Drupal Module site speak highly of it too. One drawback is that its multitude of setting options would benefit from more documentation (there's currently nothing in contributed modules documentation); perhaps I can add some notes in the future.
Another solution, of course, is to use CCK to create a node type for links, with Views to create lists. I've done this too, with one main advantage: with a simple node structure, I can post links using my external blogging client, MarsEdit. Thanks to taxonomy and Views, I can create easy groupings of links. But that's still not ideal: I have to put text and URLs into the body field (MarsEdit won't recognize a dedicated URL field), and there's no automated checking of links.
I would love to hear from readers on suggestions or problems related to my new Links page, and solutions or problems you've had in managing links on a Drupal site.

The concept gives a “clear indication” of what the production S60 will look like when it debuts in 2010, Stephen Odell, Volvo president and CEO, says in a statement.
“The concept car shows part of our future, it’s a hint that the all-new S60 will be one of the strongest contenders in the C/D premium segment,” he says.
The image released by Volvo reveals the coupe-inspired silhouette of the new S60, a carry-over design cue the auto maker says gave the original model its unique stance.
“The concept car’s design gives a visual promise of enthusiastic driving characteristics, and I can assure you the all-new S60 will deliver a sport drive like no Volvo before,” Odell says.
The car’s roof line, accompanied by contoured shoulders, resembles a “gentle double wave” from the headlamps to the taillamps, says Steve Mattin, Volvo design director.
“The inspiration comes from the Swedish coastline’s cliffs and seas,” he says. “The concept car takes our design DNA to the next level. We’re talking about a dramatic new approach, meaning that we gradually turn up our cars’ visual volume.”
The concept car’s interior features a floating center stack made of hand-crafted Orrefors crystal, which forms a transparent wave from the instrument panel to the rear-seat backrest.
“In a concept car, the aim is to give your imagination a free rein and our iconic super-slim center stack was the perfect object,” Mattin says. “Using pure crystal is a thrilling experiment. We may well see interior features in crystal-like materials in the future.”Santigold Says She Is Hands-On in All Aspects of Career
Santigold will release her sophomore album ‘Master of My Make-Believe’ in 2012 and the rapper recently sat down with fashion publication V Magazine to discuss the process and her view of the fakery surrounding some of her fellow pop stars. But make no mistake — she doesn’t consider herself a pop diva.
Santigold, looking fabulously fashion forward with painted on eye accessories, revealed that the new album took a bit longer to release – her debut ‘Santogold’ came out in 2008 — since “lyrics came slowly” for her. She said she writes to the music and this time around, she was learning to trust herself. She admitted, “I also had expectations. Never have those!” Noted.
The rapper also headed to Jamaica to write, and that’s when the lyrical floodgates opened. “I think that time really colored the record,” she mused.
Santigold also shared the fact that she oversees every aspect of her career, in order to keep it real.
“I’m really hands-on with everything,” she said, noting that being so control-oriented “is the difference between an artist and a plain pop star.” Now, that’s the truth.
Despite that comparison, she doesn’t view herself as a pop star, admitting, “I think I am looked at by people as a peer but in reality I’m like a stepchild. I’m trying to be like that on my own terms and everyone respects it, but it doesn’t make the money. You’ve always got to come harder than everybody, but with less.”
She also revealed that she titled her album ‘Master of My Make-Believe’ because of how our culture has been diluted by things like reality TV nonsense. “I want it to be about creating your own reality,” she said.
Expect to be a part of Santigold’s reality in 2012.The Universal Notebook: Dictates of the dead

Their dreams, which focused on becoming a Top Gun pilot and women chasing after them, soon became a stark reality. Most of the men were assigned to anti-climatic enlisted jobs that involved working in linguistics departments, medical facilities, becoming EMTs, working on airplanes, etc. After men watched the movie, reports showed that careers of wanting to become a Naval Aviator increased by an astounding 500-percent. However, very few military personnel can complete Top Gun training and actually succeed in Flight School.View doc

Mall shooting victim was a lawyer
By Debra Cassens Weiss
Dec 17, 2013, 01:01 pm CST
The man who was shot and killed in a carjacking outside an upscale New Jersey mall has been identified as a 30-year-old lawyer from Hoboken.
Dustin Friedland was shot and killed on Sunday as he and his wife, who is also a lawyer, were returning to their 2012 Range Rover after Christmas shopping, report the New Jersey Star-Ledger, the Bergen County Record, the New York Daily News and the Asbury Park Press. Dustin Friedland had opened the car door for his wife and was walking behind his SUV when he was confronted by the two assailants.
The Range Rover was recovered in Newark on Monday outside a boarded up home.
Friedland and his wife, Jamie, are both graduates of Syracuse University’s law school, the New York Daily News says. Dustin Friedland’s LinkedIn profile says he is a project manager and estimator who also analyzes construction-related legal claims at Epic Mechanical in Neptune, N.J., which is his family’s HVAC company, the Asbury Park Press says. He worked as a patent lawyer before joining Epic Mechanical.
Jamie Schare Friedland, 27, works at the Adam Leitman Baily law firm, which has offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to an arrest in the case. Baily told the New York Daily News he believes Friedland resisted his attackers out of concern for his wife.
“Dustin was rational, intelligent and had great judgment,” said Adam Leitman Bailey. “I highly doubt that he fought the attackers to save his car. I do believe he would fight for his wife’s life.”Originally posted by Jinni

Firing missiles into other countries was a game the Germans started. Saddam, an admirer of Adolf, liked to do this as well.
Germans also liked to forge peace agreements to by them time and then when they were ready simply violated these plans.
This was a strategy that kept Europe and the world setting on their hands while the Germans built its war machine.

IThe points we are raising here is we are comparing Israel's behavior in Palestine to that of Nazi Germany's on Jewish citizens of Western europe. So we are pretty much on the topic. And although I do believe the photo editorial is probably arab propaganda - the basic facts are true they are treating Palestinian with similar levels of aggression and disrespect that the Nazis did.

But just so you know where I am coming from on Israel. It is their homeland and the Palestinians are squatters. The wars we see today around their are age old, continuation of centuries of conflict.
The current problems? The faces have changed. The arguments are made with modern day philosophys of any number. But it boils down to Arabs hating Jews.Dr Roberta Sonnino

Rhone Red Blends from Chateauneuf-du-Pape, Rhone, France
Winemaker's Notes
A blend of 60% Grenache and 40% Mourvèdre.
Aged for 24 months in two to four years old barrels. The 2005 was an out-standing vintage and the most impressive appellation. Balance! Strength! Structure! Complexity! With the entire range of magical aromas from Chateauneuf. Brandied cherries, squashed strawberries, trufle, thyme, black olive tapenade. Bottled without any filtration.
Critical Acclaim
The Wine Advocate - "The 2005 Chateauneuf du Pape is superb, a blend of 50% old vine Mourvedre and the rest Grenache, aged in old used small barrels. The wine has a dense purple color and a full bodied style with plenty of tannin and sweet roasted meat smells intermixed with blackberry, licorice, incense, and forest floor. The wine is broad, dense, and in need of 2-3 years of bottle age. It should keep for 20 or more years. " International Wine Cellar - "50% grenache and 50% mourvedre, all from La Crau. Inky ruby. Fresh raspberry and kirsch on the nose, with exotic incense, tapenade and lavender notes adding complexity. Deep, brooding bitter cherry and licorice flavors are brightened by juicy acidity. Finishes with impressive grip and thrust, but with a surprising lack of hardness for such a powerful wine with this much mourved. ...Clos Saint Jean produces a total of five different red Chateauneuf du Pape wines and one Chateauneuf du Pape Blanc. ...Mobile Site You Are Here > BBR Home > Box Scores > New Orleans Hornets at Los Angeles Lakers Shot Charts, January 7, 2011

ElsewhereYou should all know Pope Francis is pretty kick-ass by now. He takes selfies with normal people and hangs out with the homeless. Last year, Time chose Pope Francis as their person of the year, giving him the cover spot while also giving a bunch of militant Catholics reasons to complain about the nomination. He also accomplished a bunch of other feats that impressed the Internet and LGBT community, earning himself a spot on countless publication lists, and tying him to one of the coolest things of 2013.
He’s also a novelty at times, and today comes another headline that makes Pope Francis even cooler/stranger. Reports have flooded the net saying that Pope Francis is totally welcome to the idea of baptizing alien lifeforms. “Who are we to close doors,” he says, which sounded kind of reminiscent of what was said about the gay community wanting acceptance in religion.
Pope Francis said Catholicism is a church of “open doors,” and whomever wants to accept the Holy Spirit absolutely can, no matter how “unthinkable” and “unimaginable” they may be. He then quoted the Bible, continued on speaking about unthinkable beings, then dropped the bomb on everyone:
If, for example, tomorrow an expedition of Martians came to us here and one said ‘I want to be baptized!’, what would happen? Martians, right? Green, with long noses and big ears, like in children’s drawings.
Damn son. If Martians came to Earth, I don’t believe one of the first things asked would be “Can you baptize me?” But that’s what makes Pope Francis cool— the fact he can say whatever he wants, have it come off as open-minded and accepting, while still holding Catholic-ideals, and drop the Internet a nice quotable. Plus, who doesn’t want Catholic aliens?PENSIONERS are afraid to cross a busy main road because a set of pedestrian lights have been out of order for a month following a crash.
The crossing in Chingford Mount Road, by the junction with Hampton Road, was installed in the 1990s after a fatal smash and has been well-used by walkers in the area ever since.
The lights were broken after reportedly being hit by a car around four weeks ago and have been replaced. But residents have been left frustrated because they have still not been turned on.
Maureen Goodwin, 70, of nearby Kingsley Gardens, said she feared someone would get run over unless it was brought back into use soon.
She said: "It's a dangerous bit of the road because cars go very fast and the crossing is near a blind bend.
"The other day I just about managed to get across when a car whooshed behind me, and I'm a fairly quick walker.
"I saw another elderly man going across with his blind daughter and they only just made it.
"People are afraid and I don't want to go across at night because I am so concerned about it. It's not safe unless we have those lights.
"It's an accident waiting to happen."
There remains confusion over the reason for the delay in getting the lights working again.
Mrs Goodwin said she had contacted both Transport for London (TfL) and Waltham Forest Council but both reportedly said it was the other's responsibility.
Reverend Malcolm Boulter is the pastor of South Chingford Congregational Church, which is located right next to the crossing.
He told the Guardian: “We are concerned about it. We do get crashes there occasionally but usually it's repaired within a couple of days, so I'm surprised it's been going on this long.
“The situation has made it quite difficult for our elderly folk, most of whom use the crossing and of course don't move that quickly.”
The Guardian is awaiting a comment from TfL and the council.

Tom Thumb says...
Hardly a surprise as both are thoroughly useless. TfL's number one priority is keeping motor vehicles flowing as fast as possible, irrespective of how this affects other road users. All over London crossings for pedestrians are either being removed or having their timings changed to give pedestrians less time to cross. Blame Boris Johnson for this.
But locally things are no better under our council. For example, the advisory flashing speed sign across the road from the dog stadium has been broken for years. So are lots of others all over the borough. They were put up to provide a photo opportunity for Councillor Loakes, then not maintained. The one at the junction of Woodstock Road and Forest Road disappeared one day. I rang up the town hall and asked what had happened to it but nobody had a clue why it had been removed or where it had gone to.
But as we know from the Leyton bike shed farce, this council can't even run a bike shed efficiently.
Chingford Mount Road is a good example of everything that is wrong with transport planning in London at both a local and city wide level. Regular car crashes are regarded as just one of those things, the sleazy Met has no interest in enforcing speeding or any other traffic laws, and pedestrian crossings like this one are not maintained because walking is not important to the limo-lifestyle "essential car user" managers and councillors in local government.Find Other Top Rated Gentlemen's Club in Pahrump

1. Scope
1.1 This test method covers the determination of the coefficient of static friction of corrugated and solid fiberboard or of the materials used to make such board.
1.2 This test method contains the following two methods:
1.2.1 Horizontal Plane Method -The horizontal instrument requires some means of movement of the specimen in relation to the surface upon which it rests. The coefficient of friction is measured directly from the resistance to that force and the applied weight (see 7.1).
1.2.2 Inclined Plane Method -The incline plane is raised until sliding begins. The coefficient of friction is equal to the tangent of the angle at which sliding begins (see 7.2).4521-96

The opportunity to one day play "Hamlet" might be the dream of many actors, but Andrew Rally isn't necessarily one of them.
Presented with the daunting role, the young television actor, now far from the comfort of his familiar Hollywood, is in a fluster as he rehearses for opening night in New York City.
It doesn't make it any easier that Rally has received a lucrative offer to star in a television series, and he feels he has to choose between Shakespeare and fame. Adding to the frustration is his girlfriend, Deirdre, who believes that intimacy should wait until marriage.
What's a confused thespian to do?
The answers play out in Stage Right Community Theatre's season-opening comedy, "I Hate Hamlet," Thursday through Saturday and Oct. 20 through 22 at Boyd Community Center in O'Hara.
It all promises to be spooky fun as Halloween approaches, says director Bill Ivins of Indiana Township, also theater president and artistic director.
During a seance conducted by Rally's real-estate agent, the spirit of John Barrymore is conjured, providing the actor with guidance on the ways of theater and love. Rally's angst only increases when he realizes his ghostly mentor has betrayed him by seducing his beloved Deirdre.
Paul Rudnick's play appealed to the actor in him, Ivins says. "Here's a story about a guy who gets one of the best, but most-demanding, roles in theater, and he's absolutely terrified," Ivins says. "I enjoy the homage paid to the craft of acting, and the pep-talk speech by Barrymore's ghost is sheer poetry."
The script is a love letter to theater, as much as it is a satire of the theatrical world, says Adam Kukic, of Aspinwall, who portrays Rally. Kukic, a graduate of Shadyside Academy in Fox Chapel and Allegheny College in Meadville, taught acting and directed in Salzburg, Austria, for two years, and is a recent "Director of the Year" in Pittsburgh theater.
"I couldn't pass up an opportunity to be a part of this show," he says. "Andrew wants to be taken seriously as an actor. It's easy to relate to his self-deprecating sense of humor, as well as his conflict between acting as a career versus acting as an art form."
Kukic appreciates that there is a depth to this play "that heightens it beyond just being a comedy."
"I have been telling people that this is a great comedy, played by an ensemble of great actors," Ivins says. "Rudnick is a great storyteller and the dialog moves along beautifully, with each character given great lines to help shape their characters." The six actors are making their Stage Right debut, although one, Jeanne Kingsland of Aspinwall, has been the set painter and designer the past few seasons.
Ivins read the script a few years ago and liked it, but was somewhat worried about being able to attract actors capable of portraying Rally and the legendary John Barrymore. "Fortunately, my timing was right, and I had the incredibly good fortune of finding Adam and Brad Sadler."
"Barrymore is extremely witty, funny and full of himself, and those roles are always a lot of fun to perform," Sadler of Penn Hills says. "This is a show with laughs, drama and even an exciting action sequence (a sword fight)."
Ivins encourages his actors to follow their instincts in their characterization. "Part of Stage Right's mission is to have fun producing quality theater, " he says."It was amazing to see how quickly the cast seemed to get their characters, and the chemistry was remarkable right from the first rehearsal."
Intermission brings light refreshments for the audience, provided by the theater. The venue, a community gymnasium, is more relaxed than some theater experiences, Kingsland says. It is set up with tables with checkered tablecloths and tea candles, and audience members can take their beer or wine.
She is looking forward to taking the stage for the first time in the role of Lillian Troy, Rally's elderly German agent, who, years earlier, had a "little fling" with Barrymore.
Kingsland's mother, the late Doris Hackney, was a professional actress and a leading lady at the old Pittsburgh Playhouse through the early 1970s until her last role in 1988 at the Pittsburgh Public Theater. "I grew up hanging out backstage and in the dressing rooms, and absolutely loved the magic and excitement of putting on a production," she says. "She is definitely my inspiration for this role, one I'm certain she would have loved, as well."
Everyone loves a comedy, says Jordan Christian of Pittsburgh. She is enjoying the role of Deirdre "an innocent, yet passionate actress who longs for a storybook romance."
Andy Coleman of Pittsburgh's North Side tries to capture some of that attention as Gary Peter Leifkowitz, Rally's good friend and manager. "I immediately saw the character as a cross between George Costanza (of "Seinfeld") and Nathan Detroit ("Guys and Dolls"). He is so much fun to play onstage," he says.

Perry’s intuitively creative personality permeates every one of the collection's 44 songs.
Martin Longley 2010
This two-CD set concentrates more on the "Friends" than the "Scratch", but regardless of whether Lee Perry is actually performing or manning the mixing desk controls, his intuitively creative personality permeates every one of the collection's 44 songs.
Disc one spans 1974-76, the second 77 and 78. These were the prime years of Perry's Black Ark studio, before he burned it down. All of the tracks are taken from Jamaican 7" singles on his various labels, featuring differing degrees of Perry's trademark production radicalism. Strangely, the first disc represents the more extreme material, but it's a testament to his skill with the merging of experimentation and catchiness that these are invariably the best-known songs.
Perry's Upsetters open with Enter the Dragon, his wobbly proclamations cloaked in deep echo and surrounded by bendy metal percussion. Susan Cadogan's tuneful quaver turns Hurt So Good into a bouncy hit, and then Junior Byles provides a striking hair sequence: his Curly Locks is neatly followed by Dreader Locks. There's a spread of vocals, from super-deep to squeaky.
Perry's own Stay Dread is an up-tempo rallying call, with pert organ, stalking bassline and griddle-sizzle hi-hat. Cadogan makes a swift return with her seductive in-the-ear temptations on Nice and Easy. This is a prime example of how Scratch will take a pop melody and subject it to mixing desk extremity, upping the flute and reducing most of the band to a background presence. Here, the vocals are everything.
Bury the Razor finds Perry zooming in on his own voice; he raises the trombone, phases the guitar and scrunches the Upsetters together into a single entity. On the skeletal Roast Fish and Corn Bread, Perry's ultra-distinctive voice enters nursery rhyme territory. Max Romeo's Sipple Out Deh (aka War in a Babylon) and Junior Murvin's Police & Thieves take the track 17 and 19 places, which is some illustration of disc one's transcendent quality.
Disc two is a worthwhile complement, but its dub techniques are less marked, and the featured songs are more conventionally pop-reggae in nature. But there are gems: Vibrate On makes for a trouncing start, with Augustus Pablo doing battle with a studio full of mooing cows, his melodica swirling defiantly, and there are also unpredictably outstanding cuts from Lord Sassafras, Debra Keese, Mystic I and George Faith.Okay, these Dale Earnhardt Jr. Twitter selfies are really getting out of control...

I hate it when a small group, or one person, ruins everything for the larger group that they claim to represent. This video was introduced to me by Jason, Gold_ultima from MyIGN and forum moderator here at SheAttack under the same name. I felt the need to share it here to show what not to do when trying to have a voice on the internet.
This is a video made by many gamer girls that felt compelled to counter the online abuse that plagues all gamers from time to time. It would seem they took it personally as gamer girls and set out to combat this abuse with a YouTube video.
While watching this video, in the beginning, I have to admit that I was a little empowered by it, but as the video progressed, my view on what the message of the video was changed drastically. By the end of the video I was frowning in confusion. Why did these women feel the need to make this video? Was this a joke video? I felt it was cheesy and overdone and that the need for this video was invalid. We then watched a response video that just made everything better.
Warning: There is swearing in the following video.
She essentially discredits the Manifesto by saying that what these women are doing is not helping the image of girl gamers. Making a video about it and saying that you want respect will not grant you respect. YouTuber, InuitInua, suggests that instead of feeding the trolls, simply beat them at their own game. No discussion is needed. Don’t talk. Just do.
While I watched, I agreed with pretty much everything she mentioned. Even if you don’t agree with her, at the very least, it is thought provoking.
This “gamer girl manifesto” is not the way women should represent themselves in the gaming world, professionally, or otherwise in my opinion. Actions speak louder than words, so if we want to change the way women will be treated in the future, we have to start small and work our way up. But, I’m sure we all already knew all of that. Good luck and have fun out there.

Zhu Jun wrestles control of Shenhua
The complicated row over the control of Shenhua Football Club will soon be settled with Zhu Jun, the club's major investor to officially take command, according to Soccer News.
Background: Shenhua's financial distress
Zhu sent an ultimatum to the other five club owner, all from State-owned enterprises last week, demanding the large stake transfer promised long ago, otherwise he would stop paying wages and bonuses.
Shareholders of the five SOEs agreed to complete the transfer by the end of 2012, which will push Zhu's stake share, currently 28.5 percent, to 75 percent, according to the newspaper.
Shenhua players were spotted skipping regular practice over the weekend in a move believed to show their discontent with wage arrears.
The funding stalemate also jeopardized the future of Didier Drogba who joined the team in July. Italian giants Juventus is targeting the former Chelsea striker to step in if Shenhua can't afford his reported weekly salary of £200,000, according to foreign media.
Lin receives master's, eyes Rio Olympics
Breaking records is common for Chinese badminton player Lin Dan, but this time the achievement is in the field of academics and not on the courts.
Lin obtained his Master of Public Administration from Huaqiao University in Quanzhou, Fujian province on Wednesday, becoming the sport's first athlete to achieve the accreditation in China.
In 2006, the Bayi club reached a cooperation agreement with the university under which the club sent coaches to the university in return for degrees for its players.
Lin reiterated at the graduation ceremony that he will compete at the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics.
"I will try my best to make the Rio Olympics. It matters most to me," said the defending champion of the London Olympics and 17 world titles holder. "I hope you all stand by me."rfa

ive been listening to past episods and in fra 73 i had the same thing happen with norton goast and i use to have the letter thay sent me but after holding it fot almost 2 years i think i threw it away
BinRev is hosted by the great people at Lunarpages!It’s official. My case of cabin fever has moved beyond the stage of being curable — at least, that is, by anything other than time. No amount of willpower, movie watching, exercising, music listening, Valentine’s Day-ing (though I must say my valentine is one very bright spot, even in these sunless days) or cookie eating is going to tear me from the threshold of these winter blues. It happens every year, and so I’ve come to expect it and, like a flower wrapped tightly in its bud, wait (mostly) patiently for the impending thaw of springtime, when it bursts in a colorful force through the crunchy gray snow and melts all of it — and my wintry woes — away.
In the waiting, however, I’ve learned to create for myself an arsenal of survival tools — a really good book
, some good company, a few cups of warm tea. And now, perhaps, this bread, as rustic and reliable as one needs when he or she is feeling cabin feverish. This bread — this rieska, this Finnish wonder of ridiculously easy bread baking — is a true companion in these darker days.
I don’t know what it is about this recipe that first caught my attention. Maybe it was the simplicity of it, or the basic roll call of ingredients. Maybe it was the description — a “cakey drop biscuit,” an “easy baking powder bread,” “packed with whole grains.” Or, perhaps, it was the adventure of creating something I never had before.
Or, maybe it was because I just wanted a really good sandwich.
In any case, rieska is one recipe I won’t be leaving behind. It’s durable enough to hold a few slices of meat, cheese and veggies, but soft and moist enough to warrant its “cakey” descriptor. It takes less time to throw together than it does for me to get dressed in the morning, and its buttery and mildly sweet flavor is unusually refreshing — not at all how you’d expect it to taste at first sight. It’s just the thing for those, like me, who are anxiously counting down the days to when the sun re-emerges from behind the clouds, when the birds start chirping and the chilly trees clothe themselves once again in fragile, flapping green leaves. Until then, this bread will keep me satisfied.
Rieska

Yields: 2 dozen 2-inch squares
Ingredients:
1/2 cup old fashioned rolled oats
1 cup dark or light rye flour, or pumpernickel flour (I used dark rye)
1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons sugar
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 1/2 cups buttermilk
Directions:
Preheat oven to 500 degrees F. Lightly grease a 13-by-9-inch baking dish and set aside.
In a large bowl or bowl of a stand mixer, whisk together oats, rye flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and sugar. Add butter in small cubes and cut into the dry mix, using a fork or pastry blender, until the butter is thoroughly distributed. Stir in buttermilk until well combined.
Pour batter into prepared dish and spread evenly with a spatula. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until top of bread is golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove from oven and allow to cool in baking dish completely before slicing or serving.
Very interesting recipe! And you say it holds up well in a sandwich? Talk about easiest bread ever!
This sounds perfect for the veg sandwiches I eat. Always need a good sturdy bread to give the sandwich some extra oomph. Those people over at King Arthur are geniuses.
hahaha, interesting survival tool, plus delicious.
That looks fantastic!
I tend to be more “hands on” when it comes to cutting in butter. Do you think it would matter much if I kneaded it in (like you would for biscuits), or is the temperature of the butter important?
I’m probably overthinking this, the recipe doesn’t look very finicky, but still 😛
Johanna — You incorporate the butter a lot like how you would for biscuits, so yes, using your hands to cutting it in works just fine.
Mine burned badly… 16 minutes. Any thoughts? Also, how many servings do you get when you use it for sandwiches?
Kristen — I’m so sorry to hear that! I know everyone’s oven behaves differently, so maybe next time bake it at 450 degrees F and see if that helps. Also, it’s been forever and a day since I’ve made this recipe so I don’t exactly remember how many sandwiches it makes, but my guess is about 6 to 8 sandwiches.Note: To protect the privacy of our members, e-mail addresses have been removed from the archived messages.

The novel has been described as a cross between GONE WITH THE WIND and THE THORN BIRDS. This tale of forbidden, doomed love gains a fresh twist from its setting --- a picturesque coffee plantation in Coorg in southern India at the time of British colonial rule. The Coorg people, portrayed in the book as a tough and fiercely loyal group who live by a strict code of honor governed by intricate clan relationships, are relatively little known even within India. TIGER HILLS turns a lens on this land and its people during the late 1800s and early 1900s, during a time of great cultural change that was sweeping the Indian nation.
The birth of Devi, the seventh child in the Nachimanda clan, is heralded by the arrival of hundreds of herons, which suddenly swoop down from the air to land in a silent cloud of white by her laboring mother's feet. Devi's mother and the old village priest have misgivings about what this mysterious occurrence might foretell for the newborn girl. But the child grows up to be beautiful and impetuous, resilient even in the face of the early death of her mother, and all the more pampered and doted on by her father and grandmother as a result. When the Nachimandas bring a wealthy and orphaned young boy, Devanna, into the family to raise as their own, he too is immediately smitten with Devi. While Devi and Devanna are inseparable as children, with Devi functioning as timid Devanna's fierce protector and idol, they inevitably drift apart as the years roll by.
Devanna catches the eye of a German missionary, a man determined to atone for a youthful transgression by acting as a father figure to the young boy. At his urging, Devanna goes to live with the priest and a group of nuns at the mission, where he immerses himself in the study of botany and the search for rare orchids from the Coorg hills. The quiet, reserved boy excels in his studies and soon enrolls at a prestigious medical college in the city to prepare himself for life as a doctor, with the goal of bringing modern medicine to his people. During his difficult and lonely time in medical school where he becomes the target of bullying by a particularly vicious older student, Devanna consoles himself with the thought of Devi waiting for him at home. He envisions a happy union with her as the natural outcome of their childhood closeness.
What Devanna fails to see is that Devi already loves another man, one of Devanna's own clansmen. Many years ago, Devi and Devanna had attended a tiger wedding --- a Coorgi ceremony honoring a tiger-killer --- in honor of Machu, Devanna's older cousin. Machu is a hero in the classic mold: a handsome, proud man who, armed only with a knife, manages to bring down a tiger single-handedly during a hunt. He gains the instant admiration of Devi, who, even though she is only 10 at the time, knows that she wants him for her own. With great patience, Devi turns down countless proposals from other men over the ensuing years and, with some calculation and effort, eventually manages to catch Machu's eye. But even as the stars appear to align for Devi and Machu and they fall in love, a sudden and chilling turn of events forces the lovers apart, and results in a series of tragedies that befall the three central figures --- Devi, Devanna and Machu --- forever altering their lives and that of their children.
Sarita Mandanna's TIGER HILLS is an epic, old-fashioned love story that draws you in and holds your attention with great ease for nearly 500 pages, making it an impressive debut effort. Mandanna has chosen to focus on a rural, agrarian society with deep ties to the land. This is a departure from the urban, middle class and/or high caste setting that is often more familiar to readers (and writers) of Indian literature in English.
Mandanna uses a subtle touch to shape a complex world populated by flawed characters. Here, the most likable characters do venal things; the least appealing characters are heroic and weak by turns. Fathers and sons are alike yet dissimilar, with different traits becoming distilled out in successive generations: a parent's heroism might show up as foolhardiness in the next generation, while the bookish awkwardness of one generation might manifest itself as quiet scholarly fortitude in the child. Devi herself, while always captivating, is not always sympathetic, especially in her role as a biological mother to her own child and as the usurper of another woman's child. The reader is put off by her hard and brittle persona in her later years, even as they empathize with the circumstances that have made her angry and bitter. This nuanced depiction of human behavior makes for an engrossing page-turner of a novel.
In a story shot through with pain and suffering, each fateful turn of the plot is heralded by the reappearance of herons. Mandanna never fully explains the significance of the birds, which serve only the purpose of sounding a fateful note at every tragic intersection. In this context of the characters being the playthings of fate, the reader is even coaxed into looking the other way as a central and sympathetic figure commits a brutal and inexcusable act of violence that is entirely out of character. Even as the protagonists make their futile struggles against what fate has in store for them, we still root for each one to overcome, to survive, and to find joy in the face of the tragedy that mars each life.
Spellbinding as the love story and even the bloody aftermath it leaves in its wake are, the standout feature of this book is the beautiful and vivid descriptions of Coorg. Indeed, Mandanna's ability to create a sense of place and time with her well-chosen words makes TIGER HILLS read like a nostalgic love letter to a land and its people. While it occasionally gets bogged down in pretty and picturesque descriptions of places and things to the point of distraction, the writing as a whole is lyrical and lush, with a strong sense of immediacy. Coorg, now known by its native name of Kodagu, was prized by the British as a cool "hill station" to which to retreat during the brutal Indian summer. Its natural beauty has turned it into a bustling tourist attraction once again in recent years, and no doubt this book will do its part in attracting more people to this part of the world.

Our nation is facing a dearth of engineers, scientists, inventors, and technologists. High school students are just not very interested in science and engineering. I guess it has become old hat.Recognizing this dilemma over 20 years ago was Mr. Dean Kamen, and in his passion and determination to help young people discover the excitement and rewards of science and technology he started FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology). His vision is “To transform our culture by creating a world where science and technology are celebrated and where young people dream of becoming science and technology leaders.” FIRST programs in grade, junior, and high schools involve students in after-school projects in robotics.The key to this successful organization is their volunteer mentors — engineers and scientists that give their time to advise the school teams. I decided to find a real-live mentor to interview and managed to track down Paul Koniarski, an electronics engineer at Qualcomm and mentor at Hilltop High School in Chula Vista, CA.Paul’s been involved with FIRST since 2007, when he mentored the grade school version (FIRST Lego League) at his son’s 5th and 6th grade classes. He then followed his son into the middle school and then high school versions. His son is now a junior and still on a FIRST team.Paul and the Hilltop High team. Paul is seen here at the center, fourth from the right.Paul says the satisfaction that comes from working with a student on practical applications is definitely worth the effort. “When you see the kid light up about a real-world application they can solve, it’s extremely gratifying” he said. He said the teams routinely change from having 20% of them interested in going to college to 80%.He suggests that if you want to join — pick an existing team with others that have some experience — it’s just a lot easier that way. His team meets for two hours a night, two nights a week. But when the project gets going, and the students want to win their contest vs other local teams, they spend a lot of other nights and weekends. And then, if they go to the finals in St. Louis, there’s use of vacation time and other commitments. The team at Hilltop has twenty student members and four mentors, two of which are teachers.Paul noted that there were times when it was midnight and the kids were right there, completely involved, and you just can’t walk away. So be forewarned.To check it out, go to this website, which will give you the e-mail address of your local contact:. ■ Learn more about Electronic Products Magazine Add Comment Text Only 2000 character limit Please login to comment on the article

The EDJ2104BFSE/EDJ2108BFSE is a 2-Git DDR3 synchronous DRAM that requires 30 percent less cell area per bit compared with Elpida's 30nm process. It also saves power compared with the Elpida's 30nm process products by using 15 percent less operating current and 20 percent less current when on standby, Elpida said. The 25-nm 2-Gbit DDR3 SDRAM can supports 1,866-Mbit per second transfers at 1.5-V operation and is compliant with 1.35-V operation with transfers at 1,600-Mbits per second. The part comes in 4-bit wide and 8-bit wide configurations and is rated for operation over a range from 0 to 90 degrees centigrade. Elpida said both sampling and volume production of the 25-nm 2-Gbit DDR3 DRAM are expected to begin in July 2011. By the end of 2011 Elpida plans to begin volume production of 4-Gbit DDR3 SDRAM products using the 25-nm process. In addition, the new 25nm process will be used to support further development of Mobile RAM, Elpida's mainstay memory product.

2010 Mazda CX-7 ReviewThe Good
The 2010 Mazda CX-7 offers car-like handling and SUV capacity behind a stylish new façade.The Bad
Comfort is lacking, inside and out, in the 2010 CX-7’s suspension and seats.
The CarGurus View
While the CX-7 offers impressive handling, the ride quality is lacking enough to offset the benefit. The efforts Mazda has made to improve the interior are impressive, but still not impressive enough to assuage consumers who still complain about an overall cheapness. Tackling the suspension, turbo lag, and interior materials, however, could mean a hell of a crossover for Mazda.
At a Glance
Mazda’s crossover, the CX-7, gets changes big and small for 2010, with a new base naturally aspirated engine, new trim levels, and freshened styling throughout. This five-seat, four-door crossover comes in SV, Sport, Touring, and Grand Touring trim levels, the latter two available with AWD. To stay in step with the rest of the Mazda lineup, the CX-7 has received a literal facelift, with the friendly “smiling” grille now showing up here as well. Additional exterior visual changes include larger side air intakes and a slightly revised rear fascia.
Drivetrain
Standard for SV and Sport trims is a new, naturally aspirated 2.5-liter inline four-cylinder (I4) engine, potent despite its small stature. With 161 hp and matching torque, the engine manages an EPA estimate of 20/28 mpg on regular-grade gasoline. Its five-speed automatic transmission is compliant and even a bit sporty with the manual-shift mode available, making this setup perhaps better off the line than the turbocharged 2.3-liter engine standard in the Touring and Grand Touring trims, which suffers from turbo lag despite maximum torque showing up at an impressive 2,500 rpm.
However, once you get moving, the 2.3-liter, direct-injection, turbocharged I4 is plenty peppy, and the paddle shifters for the six-speed automatic do help in overcoming that ever-present turbo lag. With 244 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque, the 2.3 offers a maximum towing capacity of 2,000 pounds, and with the required premium gasoline, returns fuel economy of 18/25 in front-wheel-drive trims and 17/23 in all-wheel-drive trims.
Ride & Handling
The CX-7 offers almost car-like handling that actually surpasses that of much of its competition, with strong brakes, a tight turning radius, and a confidence-inspiring grip. Sadly, this doesn’t translate into a comfortable ride, as the overly stiff suspension translates far too many road imperfections through to the driver, exaggerating them into an almost-constant jiggle, wiggle, and general boogie-woogie as the car shimmies laterally and horizontally when passing over rough road.
That said, the CX-7 isn’t unsafe, just mildly uncomfortable. All-wheel-drive versions are especially confident in both grip and response, with standard traction control and anti-skid coming with all trims.
Cabin & Comfort
The interior of the CX-7 received a lot of attention, with a new steering wheel complete with audio controls, a restyled center console, and a new LCD screen as seen in other Mazda models. Similarly, the interior materials have been upgraded, however complaints have been heard about the overuse of hard plastics and cheap “metallic” paint that fails to fool anyone even before it starts chipping off.
Seats are comfortable and offer support to match the agile handling of the CX-7, but those taller in the torso as opposed to the legs may find some issue here. Headroom can be lacking due to a high seating position, and the seats fail to rise high enough to provide adequate comfort or support for taller drivers. Rear seats offer ample head- and legroom, although some have complained about an awkward seating position that puts the legs at an angle too high to be considered comfortable.
Safety
With its multitude of safety features, the CX-7 has received five stars in NHTSA tests excepting rollover resistance, in which it earned four stars. Traction and electronic stability control are standard, as are antilock four-wheel disc brakes with brake assist, dual front, front-side, and curtain-side airbags with rollover, and a tire pressure monitor.
What Owners Think
The CX-7's refreshed styling has been well received, as has the inclusion of the new engine, sluggish as it may be. Many have praised the overall handling of the CX-7, but its ride quality and resulting lack of long-distance comfort have been a point of contention. While the interior has been improved, it still lacks the overall quality many consider a given at this price CX-7 Questions

In the cfgrid I have "appendkey=no" so no url vars are added, and in the

You may want to create a cross-reference to text or figures in your e-book. In iBooks Author, cross-references take the form of hyperlinks that make a text selection into a tappable item that can then open a web page in the iPad’s Safari browser, begin an e-mail message in its Mail app, or jump to another part of the current e-book.
You can add bookmarks to specific text locations, providing a destination for a cross-reference hyperlink. When you create an object that has a title, such a bookmark is automatically created.
To add a bookmark, follow these steps:
Insert the text cursor in a text box or shape on any document page, except a chapter or section opener or a figure caption.
Alternatively, select a word or phrase in a text box or shape.
Select a word or phrase so that you can more easily find the bookmark location later; the bookmarked text has a blue frame placed around it. (This frame doesn’t appear to the reader in the e-book on the iPad.)
Choose Insert→Bookmark.
The Hyperlink inspector’s Bookmark pane appears, listing the bookmark and its page number. If you selected a word or phrase when creating the bookmark, that text appears as the bookmark’s name; otherwise, the word Bookmark is used.
Double-click the bookmark’s name to make it editable, and then enter the name you want to use.
To create a cross-reference to a bookmark you created, follow these steps:
Go to a location in the book that you want e-book readers to be able to tap to get to that bookmarked location.
Select the text that the reader should tap.
Choose Insert→Hyperlink→Bookmark.
The Hyperlink inspector’s Hyperlink pane opens.
Choose the destination bookmark from the Name pop-up menu.
After you add the hyperlink, the origin text (what the reader taps to jump to the destination bookmark) is highlighted with a blue rectangle (which isn’t visible in the e-book on the iPad) and styled as blue underlined text (which is retained in the iPad’s e-book so that readers know the text is a hyperlink).

Junior Lee McCoy finished tied for first in stroke play at 8-under 135, senior Mookie DeMoss tied for 14th at 3-under 140, while freshman Zach Healy tied for 61st at 2-over 145. Former Georgia golfers Butler Melnyk (5-over) and Keith Mitchell (11-over) missed the cut.
“I couldn't be any happier,” said McCoy of sharing the medal. “Well, I guess I could be. I'd like to be holding the trophy at the end of the week but that being said, it is a long week. It's great to be a high seed going into the weekend, but you know, main goal is still in check. I am still trying to get that trophy.”
McCoy, the 2012 Georgia High School Player of the Year at Habersham Central who is playing in his first U.S. Amateur, was buoyed by local support.
“Oh, it's awesome,” he said. “I got so many ‘Go Dogs’ out there on the golf course today it was unbelievable. It's awesome to be so close to home, and I've got plenty of friends and family out here to support me this week.”

Group of hundreds of congress activists led by Lal Singh Jhala, president Udaipur District Congress (Rural) gathered outside Collectorate and handed over a memorandum to district administration in the name of State Chief Minister.
According to the letter, congress committee alleges that the frequent visit of Kirodilal Meena to Udaipur is a part of creating disturbance in the tribal belt, as well as the city of Udaipur. As per the letter, Meena is provoking tribal in the name of land and creating caste discrimination.
In the memorandum, they further mentioned that on 16th of January Meena came to Udaipur without any prior information and permission, where he held a mass rally and put false allegations on Lal Singh Jhala.
Last year also, Kirodilal Meena had allegedly misbehaved with some of the Government officials outside collector’s office for that he was banned to enter in the Udaipur district, but after few months he started arriving in Udaipur often. Congress also pointed towards the disability of the administration that doesn’t receive the information before his visit.Abu Hamza, radical Muslim cleric on trial in US, denies any role in kidnapping of tourists in YemenBy North America correspondent Lisa Millar, wires
On trial: Radical Muslim cleric Abu Hamza (2L).Reuters: Matt Dunham
Radical Muslim cleric Abu Hamza has denied any role in a kidnapping of tourists in Yemen that led to the death of an Australian man.
Sydneysider Andrew Thirsk was one of 16 tourists kidnapped in 1998 by an Islamic militant group in Yemen.
He and three other British hostages were killed during the rescue bid. His wife Catherine Spence survived.
Hamza, who is on trial in New York on terrorism charges, has pleaded not guilty to conspiring to support the kidnappers.
He told the jury he had provided a satellite phone for rebel soldiers months before they kidnapped the tourists and spoke to their leader just three hours after the hostages were taken.
But he insisted under questioning from his attorney that he did not know about the kidnapping beforehand and said he felt betrayed when he was told about it.
"Innocent people are not to be touched," he said. "You can see this in my preaching."
He said he was merely a mouthpiece for Yemeni Islamists, comparing his role to that of Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams.
When he received a call from the militants' leader three hours after the kidnapping,."
Hamza claims attack was 'Islamically' justified
The jurors heard last week from two of the hostages, including Mary Quin, who interviewed Hamza in London years later. During their recorded conversation, the imam said the kidnapping was "Islamically" justified.
Hamza's lawyer, Joshua Dratel, also asked him on Monday about a comment he made last week, when he said he "loved" former Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
Hamza said that the "undisciplined" bin Laden caused Afghanis a lot of pain with his tactics.
"I've held him accountable for that," he said. Hamza, including one in which he praised the September 11 attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people in the US.
In a nod to those speeches, Mr Dratel noted on Monday that Hamza had used a lot of "harsh language" and said: "You've been a pain in the neck."
"A squeaky wheel," Hamza replied.

- 1Havahart® Large 1-Door Animal Trap is rated out of 5 by 4.Rated 5 out of 5 by tmc68 from Durable and works great!! Don't buy cheap others I just bought this trap about 2 weeks ago. I had rented a Havahart trap from the local hardware store and trapped one groundhog the next morning. The problem...I discovered the one trapped was well smaller than the very large groundhog we'd seen near our barn. I discovered there were 5. So I bought this trap. 2 weeks later (this weekend) when I had time to deal with them, using this trap (using a trail of pieces of peach for bait) I caught one on Friday, two on Saturday, and Sunday (today) caught the big mamma one (9 pounds). This trap works great and is easy to set. It's also very durable. Don't buy cheap ones (TSC, etc) as the animal will tear them up. JUST ONE RECOMENDATION...The Havahart trap I first rented from the hardware store is even easier to set and release. It is called the large 1 door "easy set" trap. It's a few dollars more, but when you go to release the potentially very mad animal, it allows you to open it and step away. Had I paid attention when ordering I would have bought it. Anyway, huge success with this trap! Best investment in ages!!Date published: 2015-05-17Rated 5 out of 5 by James from it certainly worked. something had been killing my mom's chickens so my dad came home with this, baited it with a dead chicken, first night nothing, 2nd night I was surprised to find not a coyote as expected but a Great Horned Owl! very rare for these parts.Date published: 2015-05-16Rated 5 out of 5 by raylynn from Great Product Very happy with my purchase. I have several feral cats I need to trap. These work great.Date published: 2015-05-08Rated 2 out of 5 by Thor from No good for armadillos I bought this a couple of months ago and quickly trapped two racoons. However, I primarily wanted it for armadillos and when I finally caught one, it eascaped with no problem. It easily bent the locking wire. I repaired it, but the same thing happened when I caught it the second time. This model is useless for Armadillos.Date published: 2015-05-06

Members of the Common Council considered pushing for more money, but eventually approved a Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) program for the second of three phases of renovation work at Liberty Gardens Wednesday.
The council voted 6-0 in favor of the deal as proposed at its Wednesday meeting. The vote followed a work session in which some members repeated a previous inquiry about whether the $300 payment per unit in the 50-unit phase of work. Representatives for the project — a collaboration between complex owner Rome Housing Authority and its Albany-based manager and partner Omni Housing Development — said an increase in the payment would require substantial reworking of the funding plan and a new presentation to possible private financiers.
"Is there flexibility there?" asked Councilor Frank R. Anderson, R-5, so project officials. "Is $350 rigid?" Some councilors were pondering a $450-per-unit deal. "I’d had to see this project done in because of $7,500," said Councilor Louis J. DiMarco Jr., D-7. The original proposal would mean $15,000 a year for the city — $300 per unit for the 50 units. An increase to $450 per unit would have bumped that up to $22,500.
One key for the city is that all the PILOT money is new for Rome’s coffers, as the complex has never been subject to property taxes before. So, the three-phase project, at $300 per unit for all 180 units, would mean a total of $1.62 million over a 30-year period. The first phase will generate $702,000 over 30 years, the second phase would generate $450,000 and the third phase would generate $468,000 if that PILOT is approved when that phase is close to starting.
The complex at Liberty and Levitt streets is undergoing a massive transformation. A number of units are being removed to make room for expanded existing units, and a group of new apartments are being built to replace those, since the complex will start and end with 180 units. Phase one is ongoing. Funding for the second phase is being arranged. The entire project will take about five years to seven years.
The council also set a public hearing for a proposal to establish a property tax benefit for Cold War veterans in Rome. The council will hold a hearing at 6:55 p.m. on Wednesday, May 9 — five minutes before its regular meeting that night — in the council chambers at City Hall.. It would save veterans an estimated $88, but is meant more as an acknowledgement of service "for people who deserve it," said Councilor Anderson, R-5, who is co-sponsoring the legislation with Council President John J. Mazzaferro.
The council also gave its approval of the plan to out a Social Security Administration satellite office in City Hall, which will be in the Parks and Recreation Department in Room 2D on the second floor. Starting Wednesday, May 2, the office will be open 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. This is meant to partially offset the closure of the regular Rome office tomorrow. It is being consolidated with the Utica office.Already know your needs? Submit your RFP here and it’ll be assigned to one of our destination experts.

Self replicating DNA nanostructures
Dr. Corinna Maass
Center for Soft Matter Research, New York University
Procreating one's genomic information through generations of copies is one of the most basic characteristics of biological life, and there has been a scientific interest in creating self replicating systems outside biology ever since von Neumann's Theory of Self-Replicating Automata. In designing an artificially replicating nanoscale system, DNA is a highly useful building material: we can design sequences to hybridise into almost arbitrary shapes and patterns, while its characteristic base pair binding enables us to design highly selective interactions between multiple species of DNA objects.
Based on Ned Seeman's pioneering work in DNA nanotechnology, we present a binary system of DNA tiles designed to transmit their sequence information to multiple generations of daughters.
A detailed study of the system has resulted in thermodynamic study on multiple sticky end attachment as well as a method to effectively catalyse tile bond formation by immobilising them on a template.I know it's a stupid question.

Turtle Derbies: A Race Our Turtles (and Children) Can't Win
By Collette Adkins Giese
Every summer in small towns across America, children search woods and waters for turtles to compete in annual turtle races, longstanding traditions that often raise money for important causes.
But our nation's turtles are now dying off at alarming rates never-before seen, and it's time to end this tradition, which threatens to spread deadly diseases to both wild turtles and children.
After the races are over, most people release their turtles into the wild, undoubtedly thinking that no harm has been done. But races can expose turtles to disease, which then can spread to wild populations when turtles are released.
Threats like overexploitation and habitat loss have caused dramatic population declines in almost all U.S. turtle species, with many now either protected as endangered under the Endangered Species Act or under consideration for such protection. A new and emerging threat is a deadly wildlife disease called ranavirus that has caused turtle, frog and salamander die-offs in more than 25 states.
Ranavirus infection has been confirmed in Maryland in wild eastern box turtles, a popular entrant for turtle races in the Northeast. One confirmed case of the disease showed up last summer in Harford County, home of the Bel Air Annual Turtle Derby -- one of Maryland's largest turtle races.
Turtle races can also spread Salmonella to people who handle turtles, including young children who can become severely ill or even die. Salmonella are naturally occurring bacteria in turtles, and infected turtles usually do not appear sick in any way.
That's why the Center for Biological Diversity has asked the sponsor of the annual turtle race in Bel Air, Maryland to stop using wild caught turtles. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources also issued a statement advising against using wild caught turtles in races.
Despite the risks, the Bel Air Turtle Derby has explained that they will go ahead with their turtle race as planned on the Fourth of July. But hopefully this year will be the last time that wild turtles are used.
Turtle races strain native turtle populations that are already under terrible pressure from habitat loss, road kill and other threats. In fact, a recent study found that nearly half of all turtle species are at risk of extinction. Some turtle species have lost more than 95 percent of their historic habitat.
While many of the threats facing wild turtles are difficult problems to solve, the threat posed by turtle races has an easy fix: just stop using wild caught turtles.
Many small towns across the country have replaced their turtle races with wildlife-friendly festivals that use creative substitutes for wild caught turtles, such as river races using rubber turtles or races where people pull toy turtles on strings. The John Hopkins Turtle Race in Baltimore does not use any wild caught turtles, instead racing turtles brought in from U.S. turtle farms, to which the turtles are returned.
For generations, that magical moment when many a child first understood our bond with all things wild was kindled by staring into the eyes of a small turtle as it crawled across their outstretched hand.
That bond now requires that we put our own traditions aside and do what's best for our turtles, before it's too late.

But the House is stepping in to urge that one specific food be added to that list over the protests of scientists: white potatoes. Potatoes have real political muscle behind them:
Although the Obama administration has tried on a few occasions to limit the amount of money the government spends on feeding people white potatoes, lawmakers from the roughly 40 potato-growing states, backed by the potato lobby, have worked to turn back those efforts. They voted to thwart the Agriculture Department's 2011 recommendation that french fries only be served twice a week in federally subsidized school lunches.Now, the House included a measure in its budget bill calling for Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack to put white potatoes on the approved list for WIC or explain why. According to a potato spokesman, it's not that the National Potato Council wants to sell more potatoes to WIC recipients, it's just battling "the perception that potatoes are not as nutritionally valuable as other vegetables and fruits." Which is a case you could possibly make, if most potatoes were consumed baked or boiled with little added fat, instead of as french fries. Here's the best part, though:."They're not wrong! But WIC is basically a paternalistic program top to bottom. The details of approved foods lists very from state to state, but in red Alabama and blue New York alike, WIC can be used for 100 percent fruit juice but not lemonade, specific kinds of cheese not including shredded cheese or mixed cheeses, Cheerios but not Honey Nut Cheerios, large but not extra large eggs, brown rice but not white rice, and so on. If lawmakers are only discovering their outrage over this program being "inconsistent with individual choice and promotion of self-responsibility" when it comes to a product grown in their states and widely turned into junk food, with all the promotional muscle that implies, that outrage looks ... less than purely liberty-focused, let's say. Almost like they're more concerned for potato growers than either individual choice or the nutrition of WIC recipients.

Advertising provided in part by:
Ninja Gaiden is a game series for the hardcore. For gamers who want to test their skills and push them to the limits. The Sigma series has always offered some stellar, slick smash 'em up / beat 'em up gameplay without dumbing it down. Ninja Gaiden 2 was originally an Xbox 360 exclusive and made its way to the PS3 a couple years back, but now Vita owners will have a chance to play it with the newest port of the game: Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 Plus.
Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 Plus requires players to take care in their use of combos and hits, and to mesh them together with defense moves. This makes the gameplay in Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 Plus much more enjoyable than say, something like Lollipop Chainsaw. You won't get tendonitis smashing buttons, and once you figure it all out, Sigma 2 feels like it breaks away from the kind of repetitive smashing you can find in God of War. Still, all that being said, Sigma 2 Plus' combat is decent, but not great. Little surprises like limb dismemberment, energy absorbing (powering up), and neat combos keep things fun. Regardless of its slightly interesting fighting system, Sigma 2 Plus doesn't give us a combat system that keeps us addicted. Even with the flow between ranged and melee attacks, the mix of defense moves and combos, Sigma 2 Plus' gameplay just doesn't take your breath away.
Ninja Gaiden games, as mentioned above, are also an intense challenge. While Sigma 2 Plus tones down the difficulty a little bit, there are for sure some trying times while playing. Whenever I got stuck, I wanted to say it was due to my lack of skills, but often it felt like design flaws. For better or worse, Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 Plus makes very little use of the Vita touch controls, which will be a good thing for Ninja Gaiden fans, but a bad thing for those who want a game to utilize their Vita to its full extent.
The Plus port brings us at least as much blood and gore as the Xbox 360 version had, a few new costumes, along with a ninja mode which lets you play through each level with a time limit cap (this is mostly for trophy hunters and completionists). Online co-op mode has been removed, and replaced with an A.I.-heavy Tag Mission in which you and an A.I. partner tackle waves of enemies (instead of working with a real live player). Due to the lack of good A.I. and the fact this mode just simply isn't very exciting, it not really worth the experience.
Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 Plus isn't a bad game, nor is it a great game. The retail version suffers from major performance issues, and the game in general has a strange blandness, probably due to its age. Despite the handful cool looking moves / combos, Sigma 2 Plus just lacks a feeling of variety; it feels lost in a weak port. There's no reason for those who have played the original version to ever play the Vita version, but for those who have a Vita and are dying to get their hands on Sigma 2 (or just make it portable), then this is the way to go.

STORIES FROM AROUND THE WEBThe following is a guest post by Senior Music Specialist Ray White.
Portrait of Victor Herbert. Harris & Ewing Collection, Prints and Photographs Division, Library of Congress.
Victor Herbert’s 152nd birthday is this month. If you recognize his name, you might recall that he composed operettas. Perhaps Babes in Toyland comes to mind. Its best-known number, “Toyland, Toyland, little girl and boy land…,” recorded by Doris Day, Johnny Mathis, the Supremes, and a host of others, is still included on occasional Christmas albums. From other operettas come “Italian Street Song” and “Art Is Calling for Me,” sometimes programmed by operatic sopranos as “lighter” showpieces.
Herbert’s spheres of activity, however, were far broader than his reputation as New York operetta composer might suggest. He was born in Dublin, Ireland, on February 1, 1859. His father died when he was 3 years old; his mother remarried, and the family moved to Stuttgart, Germany. It was as a cellist and a composer of orchestral music that the young Herbert first made his professional mark. His earliest significant compositions were large-scale and serious, and included 2 concertos for cello and orchestra.
In 1886 he moved to New York, newly-married to noted Viennese soprano Therese Förster. She had been engaged to sing leading roles at the Metropolitan Opera, beginning with opening night of the season that fall. As part of the deal, her husband was given a job playing in the orchestra.
Cellist Herbert quickly became involved in New York’s music scene, appearing as orchestra member, soloist, and chamber musician. He later added conducting to his resume, leading the 22nd Regiment Band of the New York National Guard and then the Pittsburgh Symphony and the Victor Herbert Orchestra. He also joined the faculty of New York’s National Conservatory of Music.
Victor Herbert. George Grantham Bain Collection, Prints and Photographs Division, Library of Congress.
At age 35, in 1894, he wrote his first operetta, Prince Ananias. Forty-two more would follow over the next 30 years, including such picturesque titles as The Wizard of the Nile, The Rose of Algeria, Eileen (The Hearts of Erin), The Enchantress, The Fortune Teller, and Naughty Marietta. The famous Babes in Toyland debuted in 1903. Herbert did not limit his subsequent work solely to operettas, however. In 1916 he wrote the score for the silent film The Fall of a Nation, possibly the earliest through-composed score to accompany a feature film. His last orchestral work, Suite of Serenades, received its premiere on February 12, 1924, on the same program with the first performance of Gershwin’s Rhapsody In Blue.
He took a keen interest in issues relating to copyright and the compensation of composers. He testified before Congress during hearings on the revision of the copyright statutes. In 1914 he became a founder of the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (“ASCAP”), and he served as vice president for the remainder of his life. He died in New York of cardiac arrest on May 26, 1924.
The Library of Congress holds the preeminent collection of music manuscripts of works by Victor Herbert, in addition to a small quantity of correspondence, photographs, scrapbooks, and programs. An online finding aid to the Herbert Collection is now in preparation. In the meanwhile, we invite your inquiries about the compositions of this very remarkable musician.Subject: Re: [ecasound] alsa plugin for monitor

Now Commenting On:IQ difference between 1Ds II and 1Ds III ?
I currently shoot with a pair of 1Ds IIs as my primary cameras. I really like them. Unfortunately, I'm feeling myself getting a little bit of new camera lust. The 7K for the 1D X is just not justifiable. I tried out a 5D3 at a camera shop yesterday. It didn't feel right in my hands--the grip hit my fingers in a funny way. I was completely lost trying to select focus points, as was the salesman--no sale.
I tried a 1Ds III a year or so ago on a few sessions, and thought the LCD and battery were big improvements, but didn't see any real improvement in IQ over the 1Ds II. The menu changes reminded me a lot of the 50D, and I've got a few of those, so that wasn't a big deal. I really didn't find the larger file size to be a big deal either. The 1Ds IIIs were selling used for $5000+ then, so it was a no-brainer--no sale.
Now, the used price of the 1Ds III has come down to the lower $2000s, so it's quite tempting to pick one up.
My question is, would the improved LCD and batteries be the biggest difference?
Are there tangible differences in IQ that I didn't see in my tests?

(this blog entry continued over at my FreeUFinally…fall has arrived, which means you have permission to try all sorts of new pumpkin creations that you may not have craved previously. Pumpkin juice, the kind that Harry Potter might have enjoyed, is one such pumpkin concoction that we start brewing at our house this time of year.
Not that you need an excuse to enjoy pumpkin juice (or Harry Potter.) But, this specialty drink perfectly complements most any autumn dish you might prepare and is quite the conversation starter at a party. Ask someone if they have ever tried pumpkin juice and you’ve opened the door to discussions about Harry Potter, Universal Studios, Orlando…just try it!
This specialty punch is the perfect blend of apple cider, pear nectar, pumpkin puree and spices. I’ve seen many variations around the internet. But, this version is inspired by the pumpkin juice recipe at Food.com and Party Through the Parks. It passes the taste test (and yes, we’ve had our share of pumpkin juice from the Wizarding World of Harry Potter) and it is so simple to prepare. It’s also tasty using apricot nectar or peach necatar in place of the pear variety.
Be sure to pin this recipe so you won’t need to head to the WWOHP to get a pumpkin juice fix!
As a matter of full disclosure, you should know that we are big Harry Potter fans…we even have a sweet pup names Sirius Black, who is pictured in this post for Poppy Chow Popcorn.
- 16 ounces of apple cidar
- 5.5 ounce can of pear nectar
- 6 Tablespoon pumpkin puree
- ¼ teaspoon apple pie spice
- ¼ teaspoon cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon nutmeg
- Blend all of the ingredients in a blender and serve cold.
Enjoy a cup of pumpkin juice with any one of these tasty fall recipes prepared by the awesome #SundaySupper contributors..
Ha! Who knew it was so easy to drink like Potter?
And to think we use to drive over to Universal Studios to get our fix. Luckily it’s not that far away!
What a great fall beverage! I can see this being quite popular at a Halloween party.
It’s a fun fall party punch!
Is it sacrilege to suggest that it might be a nice warm drink too? Those flavors sound wonderful and I can just imagine sticking my nose in a nice warm cup of that. Perhaps with just a tiny whiff of rum.
Sounds like a good plan!
Wow I’ve never heard of anything like this! It sounds soooo good and perfect for fall! So many delicious fruits all in one drink. I can’t believe I live in FL and still have not been to the Wizarding World of HP…and I’m a huge Harry fan. I’m awful =(
If you are a fan, you really must go. It really is spectacular…if you go when it’s not too crowded.
Oh, I love it! I couldn’t wait to see this when I saw your title. My kids would have a blast with it, as well. The first HP came out when my oldest was really young, and we went to see every movie together…it became tradition! And of course, the younger ones enjoyed them too when they a bit older. We even stood in lines at midnight to get books on their release date.
Thanks for this, Marjory!
How fun! All the books were released by the time my girls were old enough to read them. But, we did experience the last movie at midnight, fully dressed in Harry Potter gear. Very memorable.
Hi Marjory,
It’s so nice to ‘meet’ you through Sunday Supper! What a fantastic beverage to celebrate fall! I have got to read those Harry Potter books!
Happy Fall!
Roz
It’s a pleasure meeting you as well!
What a fun Holiday Drink! I can’t wait to try this with the kids.
you’ve got to be kidding me. And I mean that in the… “holy wow I need some of this stat!” way. I have never… had anything like this… and that HAS to change because with my love affair with pumpkin… yes, just yes. FABULOUS recipe!
I never heard of pumpkin juice, but with cider and spices in it, it screams fall! Must try it.
What a great drink for autumn!
I have never heard of pumpkin juice, but all the flavors sound like they work well together. What a great, and unique, drink for fall!
So, as a giant Potterhead, I love this! And I haven’t been to WWOHP yet, which is just unbearable.
How fun! And tasty =) I can see how this drink would work magic at a party and ignite a whole string of lively conversation.
I love it and your bottle you made is just adorable!!! Fun recipe!!
What an interesting and fun drink. Cheers to fall!
Just mouthwatering…looks delicious!
I’ve always wanted to try this!
Yum! Can I spike it with rum?
I wasn’t sure to think when reading the title of your blog post, but this pumpkin juice actually sounds amazing!!! Thanks for a yummy autumn drink idea!
I’m with Stacy, it sounds like it would be fantastic as a hot drink!
What a cool drink idea!
hahaha I bet that is so good!
This is so fun! I love Harry Potter, and it sounds delicious!
Love the Harry Potter reference! (Andy, by the way, your puppy is adorable.) I’m going to be keeping an eye out for pear nectar so we can make this!
WOW! i didn’t know what to expect when I saw pumpkin juice but that sounds amazing!
Wow! I’ve never heard of pumpkin juice before, but your recipe looks fantastic! Thanks for sharing!
I’ve never heard of pumpkin juice! After reading your recipe, I’m feeling awfully parched – this sounds delicious!
You may be interested in knowing the origin of the food.com recipe. It was borrowed, word for word including directions and quotes, from. Great website with tons of theme park recipes.
Hi! Thanks for your comment. I enjoyed looking through your site and added a link to your recipe to the post.
We had passes to universal studios last year and the line for pumpkin juice was so long! I would rather make it at home
I was telling my kids about this today, it sounds great. I’m going to make it for them!.

The yuan is poised to recover from declines that have made it Asia’s worst-performing currency as China seeks to prevent an exodus of capital that would threaten economic growth, according to the most accurate forecasters.
Nomura Holdings Inc., which had the best estimates for the yuan over the past four quarters in data compiled by Bloomberg, predicts a 3.3 percent advance to 6 per dollar by Dec. 31, matching the median projection of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Japan’s biggest brokerage said the People’s Bank of China engineered the yuan’s 2.3 percent loss since the start of 2014 to help curb speculative bets on appreciation. Second-ranked Scotiabank forecasts a year-end exchange rate of 5.98.
“The last thing they want to do is create an environment where the market sees the yuan is going to depreciate over the medium term,” Craig Chan, Nomura’s Singapore-based head of currency strategy for Asia ex-Japan, said in an April 4 phone interview. “Capital flight could be very large and destabilizing for the domestic market.”
China is trying to ward off speculators as controls on the exchange rate and borrowing costs are loosened in a shift toward a more market-based economy. The yuan has strengthened 33 percent since a dollar peg ended in July 2005, trailing only the Singapore dollar among 24 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg, and expectations of one-way moves in the currency spurred bets on continued gains.
Structured Products
The reversal in the first quarter hurt holders of offshore yuan structured products known as Target Redemption Forwards. Morgan Stanley estimated last month that there were some $150 billion of the contracts outstanding, held mainly by Chinese companies, and these were losing about $3.5 billion at an exchange rate of 6.20 per dollar. A slide to 6.38 would increase the losses to $7.5 billion, the U.S. bank said.
The currency rose 0.25 percent today, the most since March 24, to close at 6.1968 per dollar in Shanghai, according to China Foreign Exchange Trading System prices. The offshore yuan in Hong Kong climbed 0.28 percent, the biggest gain in a month. Bloomberg graded forecasters based on margin of error, timing and directional accuracy in each quarter, with the final ranking coming from the time-weighted average of the four quarterly scores.
The central bank reiterated last week that it plans to keep the yuan “basically stable,” saying it will closely monitor capital flows. It doubled the currency’s permitted divergence from a daily reference rate to 2 percent on March 17 and has since cut the fixing by 0.3 percent. The spot rate was 0.9 percent weaker than the reference rate today.
. If that’s the case, I will be forced to revisit my forecasts.”
Slowing Inflows
Yuan positions at Chinese financial institutions accumulated from foreign-exchange sales, a barometer of capital flows, rose by 128.2 billion yuan ($21 billion) in February, the smallest gain since September, official data show. Increases are a sign of inflows and the latest change followed a decline in exports for February, as well as slowdowns in industrial production and retail sales in the first two months of 2014.
The Chinese currency has had greater price swings this year after the central bank said it will allow more two-way fluctuations. One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected exchange-rate moves used to price options, rose eight basis points this year to 1.93 percent today. It touched 2.75 percent on March 17.
“Things are no longer as stable as before,” said Tihanyi. “There is more volatility and upside for the dollar versus the yuan. I might have to tweak my interim forecasts a bit, but am still fairly comfortable with the year-end one.”
Manufacturing, GDP
China’s Purchasing Managers Index for manufacturing was 50.3 in March, higher than the previous month’s 50.2, according to official data on April 1. A reading of 50 signals expansion. A gauge by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics showed factory output contracted for the third month in a row.
Gross domestic product will expand 7.4 percent this year, the slowest pace since 1990, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The World Bank yesterday trimmed its forecast for China’s growth this year to 7.6 percent, from an October projection of 7.7 percent.
The government will roll out measures including railway spending and tax breaks to stabilize growth and create jobs, the State Council, or cabinet, headed by Premier Li Keqiang said in an April 2 statement. While the nation can’t ignore the “difficulties and risks” from increasing downward pressure on the economy, it is confident it can keep growth in a reasonable range, Li said in a separate statement on March 28.
Global Push
“Hard-landing risks should be somewhat mitigated by easing in monetary policy,” said Nomura’s Chan. His firm sees the PBOC cutting the reserve-requirement ratios of major lenders by a total of 100 basis points to 19 percent this year.
The Bank of England and Germany’s Bundesbank signed agreements with the PBOC last month to enable the clearing and settlement of yuan transactions. The currency was ranked eighth in terms of global payments in February, according to the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications.
A more flexible and appreciating exchange rate will help achieve China’s goal of transforming its economic growth model to one driven by domestic consumption, Chan said. The currency is “still undervalued” and further gains will also spur demand as policy makers seek to make it a global reserve currency, he said.

I finally have my miracle baby **GIRL**!!!
I got married to my (now ex husband) on June 19, 1999. He had three children from a previous marriage. We had tried getting pregnant right as soon as we started dating (stupid, I know...) in May of '98 because I had always dreamt of having a baby by the year 2000. I was bbt'ing & charting. I was a community leader on a ttc board on ivillage. I was doing everything right & not getting anywhere. I couldn't even detect my own ovulation! By 2002 I still wasn't pregnant so I started seeing a fertility specialist. We tried Clomid for 6 different cycles & my doctor suggested getting one of those $200 digital fertility monitors so I could try to detect ovulation that way while on the Clomid. Nothing ever happened. Shortly after that I was diagnosed with PCOS. I was told I'd be on medication for the rest of my life & that women with PCOS have a harder time getting pregnant because they don't ovulate regularly. My cycles weren't exactly normal either. I was told the medication might help but that I might also have to lose some weight to have any luck. My ex and I kept trying until 2005 when I found out he was having an affair for the last 2 years of our marriage & had successfully gotten her pregnant for the 2nd time. (I guess she had an abortion the first time since he was still married to me.) So, in 2005 my ex husband left me for "her" & as far as I know, they have a healthy little girl together. When he left me he told me to give up on trying to get pregnant because it would *never* happen. He crushed me completely.
I met my current boyfriend August 1st, 2005. We stayed friends for the longest time because he didn't want a serious relationship. After what I had just been through, I didn't really care to have anything serious either. My boyfriend has 4 children with 4 different women. They are all 5 years apart. Amanda Nicole is his oldest & she is 22. Charissa Jac is his second & she is 17. Nathan Charles is his only son. He's 12. Heaven Leigh is his baby, she is 7 now. He made it clear very early on that he didn't want anymore children. We were very careful for the first year we were together to make sure I didn't get pregnant. We didn't always prevent during that first year, but we weren't trying to get pregnant either. Three more years went by & we gave up on birth control because it was pretty obvious I wasn't getting pregnant. I was losing weight over the years. 95 pounds total since my divorce. I was still on the metformin for the pcos & my cycles had regulated after just a couple years.
On April 13, 2009 I was 6 days late for my period. I bought a test & took it over to my boyfriend's house. We had been joking that I was probably pregnant. (not ever really thinking that I actually could be!) I took the test & I made him go into the bathroom to get the results because I couldn't handle seeing another BFN. It'd been years since I had even tried taking a test & it wasn't exactly that I needed it to be positive, I just didn't ever want to see another negative. I've seen enough of those in my life. He put the test in front of me. It said "pregnant." We were both in shock. I cried, a lot! I had never seen a BFP, ever!!! My boyfriend just sat there quiet. This isn't exactly the news he wanted at all.
This baby was conceived on March 22, 2009.. The day after my boyfriend's first grand baby was born.
(..this is a picture of me & Eisley Leigh born March 21, 2009.. this is my boyfriend's first granddaughter!! the second picture is me helping her mama give Eisley her first bath. at the time these pictures were taken (3.26.09), I had no idea I was already pregnant..)
I called my doctor, the same one that diagnosed me with PCOS all those years ago. Of course I wanted to see him since he knew my history. He hardly recognized me when he saw me for the first time in over 5 years. I had lost so much weight. The first thing he did when he walked into the room was throw up his hands & yell "it's a miracle!!!" *lol* You don't have to tell me twice.. I already know.
So, here's our miracle..
** Cynder Lilly DeGrave**
This is probably the most unorganized post ever. I have times for everything but it all kinda runs together. Bear with me.. & just to warn you, I've taken tons of pictures..
Cynder's birth story...
On Wednesday December 16th I went into the hospital to be induced. Daddy & I arrived at 5:20am. (20 minutes late, oops!) At 6am I had blood work done & by 6:20 I had my iv. They attempted the arm iv but the nurse didn't get it in the right place, ouch! so it was placed in my hand instead.
My doctor came in at 6:45 & broke my water. I was 2cm dilated at that time. At 7:30am I felt my first contraction. Wasn't bad at all!!! 8:00am it was time for antibiotics because I was gbs positive. I decided to go for a little walk before the pitocin which was started at 9:10am. My mom showed up at 9:30 & my dad came into town & showed up at 10:00. They had originally planned on coming into the hospital with me at 5am. I told them to enjoy their sleep. Good thing I did!!!
By 10:30am I was having contractions every 3-4 minutes. They were very noticable now. The pitocin was starting to affect baby & she wasn't liking it. Her heart rate was starting to go down with contractions. It was affecting me too. My blood pressure was going way down & I was starting to feel nauseous. The anesthesiologist came in & had to give me a shot of ephedrine. Not long after that I puked for the first time. Blah.
At noon the nurses placed an internal monitor in me to better keep track of baby because she wouldn't stop moving around & they'd lose her vitals completely They decided to stop the pitocin. By 1:00pm my doctor came back to check me again. I was 3 & a half to 4cm dilated at that time. He came back at 3:00pm & checked me again. I was almost 5cm dilated & I finally got some iv pain meds & asked for my epidural. Looking back on it now, I wish I wouldn't have. :(
At 3:30 I was given my epidural. That was the last time I felt my legs or anything below my b**bs for the next 36 hours. 7:15pm I was checked & still at 5cm. I wasn't progressing since I got the epidural so the pitocin was started back up. 8:30pm still at 5cm. Doctor said he'd give me one more hour to make any kind of progress or I needed to have a c-section. Really he wanted to do it right then but I begged him for one more hour. I was heart broken. 10:00pm came & you guessed it. No change. Time for my c-section. :?
I cried so hard as I was being wheeled into the operating room. All of the stress made me puke again. I was having a panic attack. It started when they told me I'd have to take off my necklace, the one my bd gave me 4 years ago when we met. I never take it off. I kept hearing Cynder's daddy telling me to breathe & felt my anesthesiologist wiping my tears from my face. He also helped wash my hair a little since I threw up in it before they could get me a puke bag.. I didn't want my baby to think I smelled like puke!! I couldn't believe this was how my induction was going to end. I felt so guilty.
At 10:37pm my Cynder Lilly was born weighing 6lbs 12oz. Is that all??! She has dark hair, but I'm pretty sure it's not going to stay that way. All her daddy's kids have white blonde hair. For now she has her daddy's blue eyes. I think it's funny because all his kids look exactly like him. Cynder looks just like me.
I was in labor for 16 hours!!! Her little head was bruised & raised from where she had been trying to come out of my unchanging cervix. My poor baby!!! Cynder was jaundice so we had lots of extra pokes before they weren't worried about her anymore. No lights!! She lost almost 10% of her body weight by the 19th. 9.8% to be exact. She was down to 6lbs & the nurses almost made me supplement but my milk came in just in time. When it did we ran into another problem.
Cynder doesn't like me. *lol* I mean, she doesn't like my b**bs. She got so frustrated in the hospital when it came to eating. She was so hungry but just couldn't figure out how to latch onto me. I had two lactation consultants ask for back up. My baby was hungry & I was full!!! I was given a n****e shield & nursing has been going well ever since. Now our only issue is that she wants to nurse *constantly* & I'm not sure I can keep up with her. She's never known a bottle. Even in the hospital before the shield I was pumping & giving her milk from a syringe & onto my finger for her to suck off. I wouldn't mind so much if I was giving her my pumped milk from a bottle, but there's no milk to give!! She drinks it all. I'm going to go as long as I can before offering formula. It's my last resort.
***UPDATE*** At Cynder's 2 week appointment she was up to 7lbs 2oz!!! I had been trying to get Cynder off of the n****e shield but she wouldn't have it. At her appointment the LC came in & wanted to see what Cynder was doing when I tried to latch her without the shield. My little stinker latched right away, both sides, no shield!!! She just wanted to make a liar out of me. We haven't used the shield since.. But at 6 weeks we did start supplementing with formula. I had to let her dad do it cuz I just couldn't bring myself to feed it to her. I felt like such a failure, but I was struggling to keep up with her.. Plus I needed to get her used to a bottle for when I go back to work. She takes 4-6oz of formula once a day, every other day. I pump that feeding for her so that she has only breast milk for when she starts at the daycare. Thankfully I work at that same daycare & also in her room with the other babies, so hopefully we can keep up with the breastfeeding as long as possible.
We got to go home on Sunday December 20th. Cynder was back up a little in weight. 6lbs 2oz.
So, now I have my beautiful daughter. The miracle baby I never thought I'd have. I couldn't ask for a more perfect little girl. I can't stop looking at her. (Or taking pictures of her!!!)
Hope you got this far!!!! :)
.xoxoxox.

I have a variety of reels and all have cork drags.. I always rinse of the reels after every use and lossen the drag nobs all the way when in storage. During the winter I do clean ,but I am not able to remove ALL old lube (I don't use Gink,but will if that is recomended). So.. I re-lube with Penn lube or Abel lube not WD-40 ,etc. and I put neets foot oil on the cork drags (Also got a type of oil from Larry's Tackle shop on the Vinyard which he swears is the lube for cork drags which I have used and it seems to keep the cork moist ,etc.). that's about it... What I wanted to know is how are any of you removing ALL old lube, if at all, and are you using a standard lube for the metal and a standard type lube for the cork drag. I guess I am asking for some down home experience in this area and the best process available. Thanks vBulletin® v3.8.7, Copyright ©2000-2015, vBulletin Solutions, Inc.Mushtaq Sheikh

I heard an explosion around 12:00 AM near the corner of 5th and Wooster. Woke me up.
So is that what caused all the potholes in the roads around Wilmington?Fans of mech combat will be happy to know that the open beta for Hawken will start soon.
Meteor Entertainment announced that the date for the public session will be December 12. Players can sign up for the beta on the official site for the game.
Hawken is an action game where players use mechs to fight each other in team-based missions. For more information, check out GameSpot's hands-on session with the title below.
Signed & already played for a moments. unreal engine is very suited to this futuristic battle genre. the gameplay is thrilling, i love the siege mode. too bad there aren't any campaign. the control and the movement is matched perfectly. you will felt the difference between light class mech and heavy class mech the moment you move your mouse.
the best is you can upgrade your unit even without paying any subscription, with more efforts offcourse :p
The only cons for me is the starter mech unit is too boxy....... literally.
looking forward to it
Yup, signed up for that one...Oh, wait, what am I getting so excited for, it's just another 'How to animate metal crates and pass it off for a mech' game...I must be getting desperate in the long wait for another good anime mech game...
I got to play this for a couple days, have to say it's pretty damn fun from what I've seen. Only complaint is the gathering of in-game currency appears to be rather slow. That could be changed though. Other than that gameplay is fun, Mech customization is pretty uncomplicatedish, graphics are amazing. I can't say how it'd perform on low-mid range PC's but on mine everything on max at 1920x1080 it looks and runs great.
Interface looks awesome; the graphics are obviously great. But this really is CoD at heart.
Mech Warrior is not really serious, any pro gamer will notice after comparing with Hawken.
Im in the closed Beta, so far so good.
As a tip: you may want to turn off the grain and bloom effects if you intend on engaging at long distances
Look forward to playing this game, but will have to be next month, silly internet data caps.
This game is pretty fun, I just hope the final version isn't P2W
To bad mechwarrior online don't look or play that good.
This game looks really impressive especially for indie devs.
I'm in the closed beta and it's fun although it runs a bit sluggish when you have physx enabled.
@illmatic87 I think grain alone should do it, bloom looks good on modern day graphics
@Truth_Hurts_U thats really sad, i was really hype about it. Thanks to the crappy F2P model and online only.
when are we going to get a true mechwarrior 4: mercenaries experience?
@y3ivan
I play MWO every day and I'm loving it. Can't wait to try out hawken so that I can see both sides of the "competition" (because scrubs can't help but pick sides and talk trash).
The lack of campaign does suck for MWO, but I consider the multiplayer great and very deep with heavy emphasis on teamwork. I'm one of the players that doesn't have bug issues though, others have their game crash regularly.
@y3ivan
There is a sticky the past 3 patches and in the command chair they are putting more effort into fixing the crappy frame rate, sound and lag.Wheel balancing has always been a costly bottleneck in auto assembly plants. Weights were manually applied with operators being required to select from dozens of weights arrayed in bins, and pounding them onto the wheel rim. Balance was not precise and scrappage was high.
Now 3M and Esys Automation have combined to produce a robotically automated balancing system using a proprietary, lead free, conformable, metallic composite material. The weight is cut from a continuously fed roll of material and robotically attached adhesively to two rim locations. Because each piece is cut to specification from one roll of material only one or two part numbers are required instead of as many as 50 or 60 in manual systems. One unit replaces two manually operated stations and the old bins thus reducing the footprint. Both labor expense and cycle time have been reduced. Increased precision, reduced scrappage, and lower cost have resulted in rapid OEM assembly plant and after-market acceptance."America in its wake and then watching the gradual dissolution of that hope. A new Constitution and two rounds of elections did not improve the lives of ordinary Afghans; the Taliban regrouped and found increasing numbers of supporters for their guerrilla actions; by 2006, as they mounted an ambitious offensive to retake southern Afghanistan and unleashed more than a hundred suicide bombers, it was clear that a deadly and determined opponent was growing in strength, not losing it..Sports Photos

Environmental chambers evaluate product quality and reliability, and identify manufacturing flaws and weaknesses in those products before they are released to the general market. Common tests undertaken in environmental test chambers are extremes of temperature and sudden variations of temperature in temperature chambers and cryogenic chambers, the effects of humidity and moisture in humidity test chambers, and salt spray test chambers which record the degrading effects of salt water on objects for manufacturer analysis. Other types of chambers include: AGREE chambers, altitude chambers, thermal shock chambers and vacuum test chambers. Causal environmental conditions such as airborne and structural vibrations, shock, dust and sand, electromagnetic and UV radiation are further tests carried out in test chambers to evaluate a product’s reaction to the elements. As the nature of the tests which environmental chambers perform is widely varied, the common sizes of the chambers are also as broad. Test chambers can range from simple, smaller benchtop test chambers which can be used to test a small component, to a variety of sizes of altitude chambers, to the larger, more complex walk-in test chambers, and even drive-in chambers for vehicles and aircraft.

The validity of environmental test results is important as it is these results that future product modifications and improvements are based upon. Therefore, design and construction of the environmental test chamber has to be carefully considered. As it is a process test, chambers typically. The consistency with which an environmental test is performed is crucial to the reliability of the results, therefore it is wise to refrain from including unnecessary man-made interference with the process to keep it as uniform as possible. Each element of the test and testing conditions has to be taken into consideration – such as already existing environment and climate, the potential addition of interior chamber lighting and thus extra heat, and the variations that already exist between products and materials. Strict control during the process will yield the most accurate and useful results from the tests.
Test chambers are designed with the capacity to replicate not only normal, but also extreme environmental conditions. Temperature chambers can typically reach temperatures above 350 degrees Fahrenheit, and cryogenic chambers produce temperatures on the other end of the scale achieving lows of -300 degrees Fahrenheit, or even lower with the help of liquid nitrogen. In addition to temperature variations which can be further tested by thermal shock chambers, humidity and air moisture content can be replicated with humidity ranging from 10-100% in most humidity chambers. These are basic tests which are commonly carried out on most products. Altitude chambers simulate extremely high altitudes to test the effects of pressure and air change, and routinely 100K ft. to 200K ft. are achieved in vacuum environmental chambers. Means must be implemented to record the data of the product response to these tests for analysis, verification and future development and adjustment planning. Therefore, there is a two areas of focus within a testing chamber – that of producing the controlled conditions for the testing of the object or product, and the accurate recording of the results of that testing.
Industries.SUPREME COURT:
EPA win streak the lone bright spot in a tough term for Obama
While the Supreme Court dealt President Obama some heavy blows this term, the administration largely got what it wanted on environmental policy.
The two highest-profile environmental cases -- the challenge to U.S. EPA's greenhouse gas regulations and the assault on the agency's regime for air pollution drifting across state lines -- produced what were arguably the administration's biggest wins in the term that ended last week.
"I would have to say that EPA had a quite good Supreme Court term," said Willy Jay, a former Department of Justice attorney now at Goodwin Procter LLP.
The administration even prevailed when it took an anti-environmental stance in a case involving a North Carolina hazardous waste site.
Those wins came as the Supreme Court ruled against Obama in some of the most closely watched cases this term. In one, the court struck down aggregate limits on campaign contributions. It also trimmed Obama's recess appointment authority, nullifying three picks for the National Labor Relations Board (Greenwire, June 26).
Further, the court in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby sided with challengers to Obama's health care overhaul law that claimed it infringed on their religious beliefs by requiring them to cover contraception costs in insurance policies for female employees.
Those decisions stand in contrast to the court's upholding EPA's Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, or CSAPR, in April. After a federal appeals court threw out the regime for 28 Eastern states, EPA asked the Supreme Court for review.
The result was a 6-2 win for the agency in EPA v. EME Homer City Generation LP. EPA's two previous attempts to regulate cross-state pollution under the Clean Air Act's "good neighbor" provision had been vacated in court. The Supreme Court decision, which deferred to EPA's decision to consider costs in setting emission limits, resurrected CSAPR (Greenwire, April 29).
Justin Pidot, a former DOJ attorney who is now an environmental law professor at the University of Denver Sturm College of Law, said the decision illustrated a reluctance by the high court to wade into esoteric details of the agency rule.
"The Supreme Court likes to meddle, but when things get too highly technical, they back off," Pidot said. "The EME Homer case is a classic example of that.
"It was a big win for EPA in the end," he added. "Their track record on the interstate transport rule had been pretty bad."
EPA fared nearly as well in a broad challenge to its first regulations for heat-trapping gases. After a federal appeals court upheld the entire program, 17 states and a host of utility and chemical trade associations asked the Supreme Court to review nearly every aspect of the regime, from EPA's finding that greenhouses gases endanger public health to motor vehicle standards.
The court agreed to consider only whether the tailpipe rules triggered the inclusion of greenhouse gases in compliance permits that stationary sources must obtain before construction of modification. The limited scope of the case was viewed as an early win for the agency.
And in a 5-4 ruling two weeks ago, the high court trimmed EPA's authority, holding that the agency could not require stationary sources like power plants, chemical facilities or industrial boilers to obtain Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD, permits because they emit only greenhouse gases.
The court also threw out EPA's "tailoring rule," which revised the tonnage threshold for greenhouse gases that qualifies a source for the PSD program.
But that rule was rendered largely irrelevant because the court also ruled that EPA could require facilities that already qualify for the program because of emissions of other conventional pollutants to take steps to limit their greenhouse gases. Those sources currently account for 83 percent of the country's greenhouse gases, while EPA's more expansive rule would have covered 86 percent -- a difference of only 3 percent (Greenwire, June 23).
Michael Gerrard, an environmental law professor at Columbia University, said EPA likely welcomed the decision.
"It's remarkable that EPA emerged from this assault ... with its basic authority reaffirmed and its regulations only bruised," Gerrard said. "One small corner of one secondary program was annulled; everything else is intact."
Still, others cautioned that there were ominous signs in conservative Justice Antonin Scalia's opinion.
Roger Martella, a former EPA general counsel who now represents industry interests Sidley Austin LLP, said Scalia made it clear that EPA does not have a "blank check" in drafting climate change regulations.
That language will be important to future challenges to EPA's proposed greenhouse gas standards for new and existing power plants. The agency plans to finalize those rules next year, and they are sure to be challenged in court.
Specifically, Martella said, the ruling may rein in EPA after other recent legal wins that have "emboldened EPA to go farther and farther."
Pidot agreed that there were some "alarming signals" for EPA in Scalia's opinion.
Scalia, he said, seemed to be saying EPA "can't interpret their authority in a way that is too expensive or expansive. If that's true, that's a huge deal."
What will be most important in a challenge to the power plant standards, should they reach the Supreme Court, Pidot said, is whether Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court's usual swing vote, "buys that logic." He added that it is immediately unclear whether Kennedy backs such a sweeping principle.
Jay, of Goodwin Procter, added that the two rulings show EPA has done unexpectedly well at the Supreme Court.
"Despite what one says about it being a pro-business court, the EPA's win-loss record in the court is really quite good," Jay said, "and one of the biggest losses -- [2007's] Massachusetts v. EPA -- was a case where the court sided firmly with broader regulatory power."
The third environmental case of the term, CTS Corp. v. Waldburger, involved an attempt from two dozen Asheville, N.C., landowners to recover damages stemming from toxic groundwater contamination at a former electronics manufacturing plant.
CTS Corp., of Elkhart, Ind., argued that the lawsuit was barred by North Carolina's 10-year deadline on filing from the last instance the defendant acted. In this case, CTS sold the property in the late 1980s.
The Obama administration intervened in the case on behalf of CTS because the Department of Defense faces about a dozen similar lawsuits stemming from groundwater pollution at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville, N.C. (Greenwire, April 8).
Despite the landowners' contention that the federal Superfund law was intended to pre-empt such state deadlines, the high court sided with CTS and, by extension, the Obama administration (Greenwire, June 9).
The day of the ruling, the administration sought to dismiss the Lejeune cases filed by Marines and their families (Greenwire, June 10).
Winning by avoiding a fight
EPA also benefited this term from cases that the Supreme Court declined to take up.
For example, the high court in March opted not to review a broad challenge to EPA's decision to revoke a Clean Water Act permit for a mountaintop-removal strip mine in Logan County, W.Va.
EPA in 2011 retroactively vetoed several parts of Arch Coal Inc.'s 2007 Army Corps of Engineers permit. It was one of the first times the agency had used such authority for a permit that had already been issued.
Business interests claimed that the decision created regulatory uncertainty surrounding the Section 404 permits, claiming it showed EPA could revoke them whenever it wanted.
"The decision below destroys regulatory certainty and overturns the settled expectations of the regulated community," Arch's attorney, former U.S. Solicitor General Paul Clement, wrote in its petition to the court (Greenwire, March 24).
By not taking up the case, EPA, which won in lower court, sidestepped a high-profile and politicized case.
"Not having to deal with mountaintop-removal issues at the Supreme Court is a big win," Pidot said. "Not that EPA wouldn't have won -- maybe they would have -- but better not to have to fight the fight."
Next term
EPA's wins this term may also to stand out for some time because the agency appears unlikely to make a return to the Supreme Court next year.
The next high-profile EPA policies of the Obama administration -- its greenhouse gas standards for power plants and recent regulations to expand the number of water bodies that qualify for Clean Water Act protections -- are sure to be challenged in court. But that litigation likely won't reach the Supreme Court by next year.
Industry has asked the high court to review an appeals court ruling upholding EPA's air standard for smog-causing ozone, but it remains to be seen whether it will grant review. The justices have previously passed on challenges to EPA's air standards.
"EPA is going to have a lull year next year," Pidot said.

NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO, June 15 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc
, facing a raft of lawsuits from investors seeking to
recoup losses from its botched IPO, laid out on Friday how
cascading Nasdaq trading glitches might have contributed to the
confusion surrounding its May 18 debut.
The No. 1 social network and lead underwriters Morgan
Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and JPMorgan
Chase & Co filed a motion requesting that dozens of
shareholder lawsuits over its $16 billion initial public
offering be grouped together in Manhattan federal court.
The filing, while standard in cases with multiple lawsuits,
hints at how Facebook may choose to structure its defense.
Nasdaq spokesman Joseph Christinat declined to comment.
More than a dozen shareholder lawsuits have accused Facebook
and its underwriters of hiding the company's weakened growth
forecasts ahead of the May 18 stock offering, one of the largest
IPOs in U.S. history.
Nasdaq OMX Group Inc has also been sued by
investors who claimed the exchange operator was negligent in
handling orders for Facebook shares.
Facebook's IPO was to have been the culmination of years of
breakneck growth for a social network that became a cultural and
business phenomenon. But shares in the eight-year-old company
founded by Mark Zuckerberg in his Harvard dorm room have shed
almost a quarter of their value, or $24 billion, since their
debut at $38 a share.
In the motion filed late Thursday, Facebook - which was the
first American.
Facebook also cited a series of press reports which
described how trading errors compounded uncertainty on May 18,
after commencement of trading in its shares was delayed by about
half an hour.
The motion cited lawsuits "alleging that technical problems
and other trading-related errors affecting Facebook's stock -
which Nasdaq has subsequently admitted - created market
uncertainty and caused investor losses."
In court papers filed late on Thursday before the U.S.
Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation, Facebook and the
banks said the U.S. District Court in Manhattan was the "most
appropriate and convenient forum to oversee these coordinated
and/or consolidated proceedings."
In afternoon trading on Friday, the stock was up 2.2 percent
at $28.91.“Race To Space” didn’t really come together for me until the end, when Virginia is reading the comic book her son left on the kitchen table and imagining its hero as Bill Masters, caught somewhere between the earth and the moon. Up until that point the episode feels a little scattered and unsatisfying, offering a lot of foundational tension but not a lot of climax. But that final moment, where both Masters and Johnson are mulling over their own isolation, questing after something that neither of them fully understands, is rather beautifully structured. The song at the end of the episode is James Blake’s sublime “Retrograde,” a surprisingly modern choice for a period piece but one that captivated me nonetheless. Masters Of Sex doesn’t often resort to non-diegetic music, making the choice doubly interesting.
Primarily what I’m getting out of the first two episodes of this show is that William Masters is researching sex because he doesn’t understand it in the slightest. It’s hard to hate him, because he is so clueless about his own behavior, but he sinks rather low in this episode—firing Virginia on a whim, jerking his wife Libby around with fertility treatments, and steadfastly refusing to understand or even acknowledge his own sexual impulses (whether those are for Libby, Virginia, or the nice prostitute whose vision he treated). He’s not driven by malice, but his self-delusion is so pernicious that it makes him callous and bullheaded. Masters spends most of “Race To Space” freezing out anyone who tries to help him.
I think that Masters Of Sex is working to paint a portrait of Masters as an example of perfect sexual repression—a man who is so frustrated and disappointed by the messy complications of sex that he literally turns a microscope on it to try to dissect it further. Despite his frustration at his own humanity, Masters has deep compassion for the humanity of his patients, so it confuses him to no end that they keep running around pursuing sex for fun, when he finds it so deeply shameful or overly complicated. Presumably, the most repressed man is the one protesting mildly that he is not repressed at all. Maybe Masters keeps pushing the envelope on his research because he refuses to acknowledge that he is turned on by prostitutes or watching women masturbate or couples having sex. As prudish as the provost is, at least he can admit that he has those feelings of sexual interest.
Masters’ self-deception comes off as cruelty towards the women in his life who he sees on a regular basis. His own wife Libby (who is nicely coming into her own as a character with some weight) begins to realize in this episode that her husband doesn’t see her as a sexual being. (Bafflingly, he says that he loves her too much to watch her pleasure herself.) And Virginia tries to confront him about his inexplicable rage toward her—which she suspects has more to do with his jealousy that she slept with Ethan than any other sabotage of the study—but he can’t even locate his own hypocrisy, leaving her in a tentative limbo in regards to her job.
Hypocrisy is infuriating, and it’s hard to watch Masters go through these unlikeable contortions. At the same time, once this man lets loose, it is going to be quite a sight. We have seen Virginia enjoy herself during sex, but we have yet to see Masters get truly uninhibited. I don’t think he’s even taken his shirt off for us—which mirrors the prostitutes’ assessment of him, that he’s “just like that john who wouldn’t take off his shoes.” The pace of the episode could have been faster, but I imagine the rewards down the line would not have been as interesting, either.
Other than that arc, which is sketchily constructed at best, the episode is pretty scattered. “Race To Space” tracks Masters’ continuing efforts in getting his study funded and his dealings with the prostitutes in Betty’s brothel, who are his current patient base. Betty herself has resorted to a form of blackmail in bargaining with him, which you can hardly blame her for. Virginia struggles with raising her kids while also pursuing her career, as well as maneuvering her way back into her job after Masters fires her. As we’ve come to expect from her character, Virginia is tenacious and clever, and she essentially continues her work as if nothing has changed to let Masters work off his little tantrum. But it does all still feel like setup, so it’s hard to get too excited by anything yet. At the same time, the show is still wickedly funny and awkward and touching in ways that feel thrilling and unexpected. This episode is a necessary step for even a great show. Let’s see how it pays off.
Stray observations:
- The prostitutes in the “cathouse” are really fantastic in general. Virginia flatters them by calling them experts in the field, as she tries to get them to sign up for the study. She’s not wrong. Betty has about as modern and practical of a viewpoint on sex as any woman might today. They also provide a refreshing cavalcade of frank women’s voices about sex, which is always nice to hear.
- Jane, too, is proving herself to be a fascinating character. The handsome doctor whom she conducted her “study” with last week, Austin, tries to get her to continue their “study” in “private” now that Masters’ operation has been moved out of the hospital. She isn’t having any of it. Sure, she likes sex, but she was really motivated by doing something for science. Also, she’s reading Simone de Beauvoir. Austin and Ethan are so staggered by her that they don’t know what to do except laugh.
- Ethan’s whole subplot, in which he tries to forget Virginia by sleeping with other women from the hospital, didn’t do a lot for me. It certainly illustrates the fickle nature of desire—he thinks he’s looking for a certain act with a woman, but he’s really just looking for Virginia—but right now, I don’t like him enough to be too interested in him. At least he apologized to Virginia, I guess.Posts Tagged «kernel»!

The iPhone OS also works on the iPod Touch, giving developers a potential market of 30 million devices (17 million iPhones and 13.7 million iPods, according to Apple).
The iPhone benefits from massive advertising, too – seems that O2 is spending all of its money on full-page iPhone adverts at the moment – whereas Android's marketing is more about word of mouth.
At the moment the numbers are firmly on Apple's side, although that may change over the next year. Manufacturers including HP are reportedly considering Android-powered netbooks, HTC is planning more more Android handsets, and Google's Andy Rubin suggests that Android could run on set-top boxes, sat-nav systems and home entertainment devices, including TVs.
Money talks
If you're a developer writing mobile applications, Apple has the numbers and the profile, and as endless reports of iPhone developers coining in the cash demonstrate, having a successful iPhone application can be extremely lucrative. Because of this, the iTunes App Store makes the Android Market look positively tiny, featuring as it does a huge selection of applications – good and bad – in almost every category.
The range doesn't just cover the usual suspects such as social networking apps, mobile Ebay, Shazam song recognition and the inevitable, unfunny fart applications, either: it also includes things like artist-branded rhythm games from musicians, utilities for controlling Sky+ boxes, games franchises such as Metal Gear Solid and many, many more.
Even accounting for some well-known problems, including Apple's reluctance to give the green light to fully written applications for trivial reasons, the growth of the App Store has been enormous. In July 2008 it launched with 500 available applications, and by September the number had increased to 3,000, with some 100 million downloads delivered.
The number of available applications has reached 65,000 and over 1.5 billion apps have now been downloaded. That's even more impressive when you consider that it took iTunes three years to deliver a billion music downloads.
Apple has the hardware, the hype and, most importantly of all, the killer apps that make people choose one platform over another. Until Android appears on more phones (and perhaps on netbooks too), Google's offering appears to be to the iPhone what Microsoft's Zune is to the iPod: interesting, but not enough to give Steve Jobs sleepless nights.

This new trailer, which is one of many unofficial Fifty Shades videos out there at the time being, gives us a brief glimpse of Zac's buff bod rolling around between the sheets (ooh-la-la), proving that he fits the bill as far as Christian's physical appearance goes even though he's a bit younger than Grey is depicted in the book. (You can't put an age on those sexy biceps.)
But if Zac Efron does wind up being cast, he's going to need a hot counterpart to play Anastasia Steele, which is why the actress cast in this particular video is a little bit puzzling.
Take a look at the clip to see someone we haven't heard yet as a possible Ana. Hint -- she's a blond.
Kirsten Dunst? As Anastasia Steele? Huh. Out of all of the possibilities out there, I never would've thought of Kirsten as an option. (And not just because of the hair thing.)
I mean, she's not exactly Hollywood's "it" girl right now, but maybe that's what Celebrity Dirty Laundry was going for by casting her in the part? And maybe changing things up a bit in the movie and making Ana a blond instead of a mousy brunette isn't such a bad idea. The lighter locks would definitely sex her character up and make her a bit more edgy -- which would help fans separate the book from the film. (It could work, right?)
What do you think about Zac and Kristen as a potential Christian and Ana?

Have you ever picked up an American Heart Association pamphlet at the grocery store on cholesterol or attended a lecture at your local hospital on controlling blood pressure? These are both elements of a health promotion program, a program meant to inform and persuade people to make choices that contribute to better health. Health promotion focuses on improving the quality of people's lives, not just by increasing their chances of living longer or without serious disease, but also by getting them to feel better and be more active.
Health promotion activities can be divided into four levels:
For a health promotion program to succeed we believe it must meet three criteria:
It's also important for the program to be attractively presented and well organized.© The Financial Times Ltd 2015 FT and 'Financial Times' are trademarks of The Financial Times Ltd.

Since it was established in 2003, the London Design Festival has expanded to encompass a wide range of displays and events, from conceptual installations to industrial exhibitions and themed lectures. Here are 10 of this year’s highlights.
Geometric by Cole & Son
Cole & Son, the company that has made wallpaper for Buckingham Palace, the Houses of Parliament and the White House, will be launching its autumn collection, entitled Geometric, at the Andaz hotel on Liverpool Street. This op art-inspired series ranges from subtle honeycomb trellis patterns to bold harlequin diamonds. Effects such as trompe l’oeil and batik have been used to create distinct designs that will be presented as 3D origami sculptures and panels.
September 17-25, Andaz Lounge, Andaz Liverpool Street, EC2M 7QN
Toto
FT columnist Tyler Brûlé once divided the world into “Washlet haves” and “Washlet have-nots”, and some have described these hands-free toilets as bathroom essentials. Overstatement or otherwise, the Washlet has certainly inspired discussion. The latest range will be on display at Toto’s London showroom and chief among them is the Giovannoni Washlet, which claims to embody Japanese technology, German precision and Italian style.
September 19-23, 140-142 St John Street, EC1V 4UA
Moooi Mermaids by Marcel Wanders
The Moooi showroom in the White Building will become a 21st-century Atlantis. Products will be exhibited across the showroom as if swept up in a tidal wave and the walls will be adorned with photos, by co-founder and designer Marcel Wanders, of mermaids swimming around submerged items of furniture.
September 19-25, Moooi UK, The White Building, Portobello Dock, 555 Harrow Road W10 4RH
Molteni & C with Arik Levy
Molteni in Covent Garden will be displaying ready-to-buy and conceptual designs from Paris-based Israeli designer Arik Levy. Levy’s conceptual work is based on “Powers of Ten”, the 1968 documentary by designers Charles and Ray Eames, which examines the relative scale of the universe in factors of 10. He has reinterpreted his well-known Quake Table in 10 different ways: one model has been shot by 100 arrows, another painted 10 different colours and another weighed down by 10 times its own weight.
September 17-25, Molteni & C Dada, 199 Shaftesbury Avenue, WC2H 8JR
Swedish Design Goes London – Hemma
Sweden will be showcasing its home-grown interior designers in an exhibition titled Hemma (Swedish for “home”) at the residence of Swedish ambassador Nicola Clase. This impressive 18th-century house, designed by Robert and James Adam, will also play host to a number of discussions with top Swedish designers.
September 17-24, Swedish Ambassador’s Residence 27 Portland Place, W1B 1QA
Galleria Illy
Galleria Illy will be exhibiting at the showroom of Italian design firms Flos and Moroso. The show, directed by Michelangelo Pistoletto, whose Mediterranean mirror table “Love Difference” will be the centre piece, will include a range of Illy coffee cups designed by artists including Anish Kapoor, Jeff Koons and Pedro Almodóvar. Galleria Illy will also host talks from the likes of Marina Abramovic, Patricia Urquiola and Martin Parr, as well as coffee preparation courses.
September 13-October 16, 15 Rosebery Avenue, EC1R 4SP
Matilda
This exhibition will showcase a range of objects inspired by the Australian landscape. Established names such as Brodie Neill, best known for the @Chair, made from a continuous loop of carbon fibre and chrome, will be displayed alongside up-and-coming designers including Daniel Emma, a duo known for their simple, Bauhaus-inspired Desks Objects range.
September 22-25, Designjunction Victoria House basement 37-63 Southhampton Row, WC1B 4DA
Alsos* and Akousmaflore by Scenocosme
Singing plants may not be the next trend in interior design, but this exhibition of technology at the Watermans Arts Centre gives the visitor some idea of what it might be like if interiors were to respond to us as we do to them. French artistic duo Scenocosme have installed plants sensitive to electrostatic energy in a subterranean wonderland. Visitors will be invited to interact – and a touch will elicit a scream or a melody.
Until September 30, Watermans, 40 High Street, Brentford, TW8 0DS
Textile Field by Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec
The V&A Museum is again a centre for London Design Festival activities. This year the Queen, who loans the Raphael cartoons to the V&A, has granted permission for the Raphael Gallery to house an installation by the Bouroullec brothers. Their third project with Danish textile company Kvadrat is a gently inclined structure covered in a sea of Hallingdal upholstery in green and blue. Visitors will be able to lie on it to look up at the cartoons, which depict scenes from the lives of St Peter and St Paul.
September 16-25, The Victoria and Albert Museum Cromwell Road SW7 2RL
100% Design
This show is a one-stop shop for a huge variety of products. This year’s Director’s Cut area is dedicated to British designers and manufacturers. Edward Barber and Jay Osgerby, who designed the 2012 Olympic torch, will be showing their new chair, the Tip Ton. With more than 170 new exhibitors this is a good place to discover new designers and smaller producers from around the UK.

Missing the adrenaline rush of the hunt, he dons the cowl once more, but doing so triggers the re-emergence of old foe The Joker from a catatonic state. The return of Batman also brings him into direct conflict with Superman, apparently a government stooge in this future. Miller’s masterpiece is a must-read for any comicbook fan.
When Bruce Wayne first dons the cowl in Batman: Year One, he isn’t sure yet if he can trust Lt. James Gordon
Year One
This time just serving as writer, Frank Miller re-examined Batman’s origins with artist David Mazzuchelli. Weaving Bruce Wayne’s story with a then-young Lt. James Gordon who has just arrived in Gotham and learns how corrupt the police department is. We see a Batman who has just returned to the city after years spent training and honing his skills. Instead of the grizzled veteran crimefighter, this Batman is young, unsure of himself, and prone to mistakes.
The Killing Joke sees Batman deal with The Joker’s twisted plot to drive him and Commissioner Gordon as nutty as the clown has become
The Killing Joke
When Alan Moore took on the challenge of giving The Joker an origin story, he also took the clown on a mad crime spree. A victim of unfortunate circumstance, artist Brian Bolland skillfully shows the unnamed comedian’s descent into despair as he aches to provide a better life for his wife and unborn child. Years later though, Joker systematically attacks the psyches of both Batman and Commissioner Gordon, pushing each to the brink of their sanity by whatever means necessary.
The Long Halloween
Returning to the “Year One” era early in the Bat’s career, writer Jeph Loeb and artist Tim Sale tell a year-long crime drama in a film noir style. A serial killer is attacking Gotham mob boss Carmine “The Roman” Falcone and his associates, but only on holidays. Imagine Batman in the setting of The Godfather and you get a taste of what The Long Halloween is about. The inevitable tragedy in this story, that is the final fate of District Attorney Harvey Dent, is made even more painful after the threeway pact he makes with Gordon and Batman in the early chapters.
Hush
Jeph Loeb teamed up with superstar artist Jim Lee for this tale of the emergence of a new Batman villain named Hush who has a long standing history with the Wayne family. A multitude of Batman villains guest star, even as Batman brings in allies like Nightwing, Huntress, Robin, and even Catwoman into the fold. This was the first story that considered returning the then-slain Robin Jason Todd back to the land of the living, and helped make The Riddler into a more significant foil for The Dark Knight.

Ed Cox Stars Tonight as Richard III
Buffalo, NY - Tonight, NY GOP Chairman Ed Cox will give the keynote address at the Independent Oil & Gas Association’s annual meeting with a speech entitled: "Andrew Cuomo: Hamlet of the Shale" in which he will make a call to open the fracking floodgates in New York during his party’s ‘winter of discontent’.
The Sierra Club Atlantic Chapter’s Roger Downs responds:
“Tonight’s speech shows how out of touch Ed Cox is with NY voters. Poll after poll demonstrates that New Yorkers are increasingly opposed to fracking and understand the economic downside of drilling is as severe as the threat to public health and safety.”
"Cox’s demand to permit fracking in New York comes at a time when the Pennsylvanian fracking boom is busting, with the exodus of drilling rigs leaving deep scars of joblessness and debt across the State. The implosion of the fracking economy has put PA Governor Corbett’s job in jeopardy – yet it is the model Cox demands that we bring to New York. Conversely, a new report by the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center shows that jobs in the clean energy sector have grown by 24 % since 2011 in MA, with nearly 80,000 people directly employed in the new green economy. That’s more than twice the number of natural gas jobs created in Pennsylvania during the entire fracking boom.”
 listless oil and gas industry in New York. One has to wonder if he is really thinks this move will help his party or is he just cashing in with the frackers, like a defeated despot willing to wager his kingdom for a horse.”

The 2001 hunting season was the 23rd year of our annual turkey population survey. The continuing cooperation of turkey hunters has made the survey possible. Your assistance is greatly appreciated. The information you provide is valuable in several ways.
In 2001, 493 broods were seen..96 poults seen in 2001 did not differ significantly from 7.15 the previous year. The statewide production index of poults per observer (21.34) was up slightly from last year's 18.22. The average number of poults per hen was 2.2 in 2001. An average of 3.0 or above is considered an indicator of good production. These data suggest that on a statewide basis turkey production is still somewhat depressed and can be considered at best fair, especially compared to the excellent reproduction in 1993-95. Cyclic, up-and-down trends are a natural aspect observed in wildlife populations, especially in turkeys as reproduction can be greatly affected by unpredictable, spring weather conditions. The continuing drought in Georgia can also impact reproductive success because of decreased insect production and reduced habitat quality. Managing for quality habitat should remain a priority to avoid additional limitations during seasons of low production and to take advantage of when production begins to cycle upward again. Overall, our total population is still excellent and should remain so in the foreseeable future.
This survey is conducted during the spring gobbler season with hunt data being supplied by hunter volunteers. Specific information requested about each hunting trip from our hunter cooperators is the date, hours hunted, county or region of the state hunted, the number of turkeys seen, and the number of gobblers heard. The number of gobblers killed is asked for but is optional.
The hours of hunting effort per turkey observed is used as an index of the hunting population. The correlation between this index and the production index is used in evaluating annual production and resulting hunting season populations.
Hunt information in usable form was supplied by 526 of the 2,000 hunters contacted in 2001. They reported making 4,603 trips totaling 16,883 hunting hours. The season hunting effort per cooperator was 9.0 trips totaling 32.1 hours. This is a decrease of 3 hours from the 2000 season average effort.
A total of 9,960 turkeys (hens and gobblers) were seen. The statewide population index of 1.7 hunting hours per turkey seen matched the previous year and was again among the lowest ever documented during the 21 years surveyed. The lowest effort per bird seen was in the Piedmont Plateau counties, and the greatest was in the Appalachian Highlands and Blue Ridge Mountain counties.
Cooperators reported hearing 7,374 gobblers. The hours of hunting per gobbler heard averaged 2.4 hours. Good to excellent reproductive success in 1993-95 along with an abundance of adult gobblers once again were factors contributing to the continued low hunting effort per gobbling bird in 2001. Similar to previous seasons, the least amount of time hunting per gobbler heard, 1.8 hours, was in the Piedmont Plateau, and the greatest amount of time, 5.4 hours, was in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Statewide, peak gobbling activity, 3.9 gobblers per trip, occurred during the middle of April.
The statewide harvest during the first seven days of the season accounted for 30.0% of the total season harvest. The average amount of hunting effort to kill a gobbler, 27.9 hours, increased by 1.3 hours from 2000. Statewide hunter success dropped significantly to 46.6% with 245 of the 526 cooperators taking at least one bird. Of these, 103 (42%) hunters took one bird, 79 (32.2%) took two birds, and 63 (25.7%) took three birds. Cooperators reported 42 gobblers killed by companions.
Georgia's estimated 83,923 turkey hunters had only a fair spring season in 2001 harvesting about 52,871 birds statewide. The average harvest per hunter (0.59) was down slightly from 0.63 in 2000. Across the state the 2002 spring season in general should be fair to good again depending upon the weather. Because reproduction has been down somewhat the past three years there are fewer jakes and two-year-old birds this season. However, overall the state's turkey population is still very strong. Hopefully, reproduction will rebound and the future will remain bright for Georgia's number one game bird. Good luck and good hunting.The Great Piggy Bank Adventure®

Been to 5 doctors in my life...so far. No offense to staff or doctor because I'm sure that they're just following some sort of "cookie cutter" approach that increases earnings per share, BUT, I felt like just another number...another rat in a maze. Poor frame selection too. Vision 4 less is exactly right. Those who don't care too much about their eye sight should continue to visit vision 4 less....I will not be.

I decided to get contacts -- and generally, when I want something, I'm not happy unless I can have it NOW. :) Not only did the Dr see me, I didn't have to have my eyes dialated (she gave me that option) and I left the store with a new pair of contacts until my ordered ones came in 3 days later! The first time EVER that I've left after seeing a physician and actually had better vision then when I went it. When my lenses came in later, I simply went and picked them up. It was awesome! No hassle, no upsells, no "lessons" since I was an experienced wearer. Simple and straight to the point. I don't know what the issue was with this other reviewer, but I have never had a problem at Dubuque's Vision4Less. I went back for glasses, and had them within an hour as well. Which is unusual since I have a very strong prescription. I'm taking my daughter in tomorrow for her glasses because I'm thrilled with the service here and couldn't imagine going anywhere else for eyewear. CHEAPER THAN WALMART! :)
Excellent!

no problems at all. got to see a dr. the same day i walked in, had a pair of contacts when i left.

The Prius is at least 2-3000 Euro more expensive than comparable cars. It's got that famous Toyota reliability. Besides that it's got few selling points. Still sales are good. Coming from a large SUV this car must seem to have good mpg. From a European point of view this car has not got a good mpg. More or less any diesel car will easily outperform the Prius by at least 20%, maybe 30% lower petrol consumption. Now most new cars are diesels. I'm really puzzled about Toyotas success in selling this car.
6th Jul 2008, 22:16
1. US currently does not have any small diesel engined cars. 2.0l VW diesel is the first small diesel in years.
2. You need to check your MPG figures, the Prius will average 45mpg US at least if not more. That's better than anything but a tiny diesel motor.
3. Diesel is currently 20% more expensive than gasoline in the US.

Really? My Audi A3 2.0 TDI has 140 HP, does 0-60 in 9 sec, has 320NM of torque which is comparable to a large normally aspirated V6. And it does 4L/100KM, that is about 60MPG if I'm easy on my right foot. And I think there's even a "econo" version of my car that has even better fuel consumption.
1st Nov 2008, 20:19
The Audi is a far better choice for many, many reasons. Better build quality, looks, handling, refinement, driving pleasure etc, etc. Better environmental choice too. Toyota has the largest carbon footprint of any motor manufacturer.
1st Nov 2008, 20:21
One of my vehicles is a 1992 1.4cc, four cylinder, petrol engine ford escort. I average 43mpg. It is little wonder that the Prius is such a revelation in the US. I really feel for you guys, we have had good economy from our cars in Europe for years. My problem with the Prius is the impact the manufacture and disposal of the batteries has on the environment, has anyone considered this?
14th Nov 2008, 00:18
Yes the U. S needs to allow more Turbo Diesels that get far better fuel economy than most small cars now. It's crazy, damn goverment regulations.. doesn't matter soon, we'll all be driving cars that run on water. Hydrogen baby!
As long as the big oil companies don't kill the inventor.. rip Stanley Meyer. Japanese have a H2O car now. We'll see. We just need to accelerate this technology because we are killing the ozone with all our carbon emissions, and polar bears :(
19th Oct 2007, 10:18
In regards to fuel economy and the Prius, I think it's safe to say that this car was intended primarily for the North American market. Reason being that many states do not currently permit diesel cars. The Prius gets excellent fuel economy for US standards.
My wife's dad has a 2002 Prius and so far the car has been trouble-free. I wouldn't say that it is the most attractive or fun to drive car, but it does get roughly 50MPG, which while not close to the 60MPG Toyota claims, is still pretty decent. He also lives in Upstate NY, where it gets below zero in the winter. I'm amazed that the batteries have held up that long.Vern. "Chara": "Gut Dode".

Chief minister Akhilesh Yadav had ordered the withdrawal of the cases to protect the honour of the party workers, said ruling Samajwadi Party state spokesman Rajendra Chaudhary. While he used the word 'fake' to describe the cases, RM Shrivastav, the principal secretary (home), described them as frivolous cases and added that their withdrawal was part of an ongoing process. Shrivastav said a committee of the home and the law departments had been examining such cases to recommend their withdrawal.
On his part, Chaudhury said the government had identified nearly 3,000 fake cases lodged against the party workers. He accused the previous regime of letting loose a reign of terror against the SP activists and misusing the SC/ST Act. Alleging that the bureaucracy was completely politicised during the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) regime, he claimed even senior IPS and IAS officers were involved in mobilising votes for the party. Even senior SP leaders were harassed, he alleged, adding that nearly 150 cases were lodged against party national chief Mulayam Singh Yadav in various districts immediately after installation of the Bahujan Samaj Party government in 2007.We’re sorry.

Further, the party members vowed to take their case to county and state Democratic organizations, pledging not only to withdraw any future support for Senator Rodney Tom but also threatening to cut off resources to any other Democrats who stand with him.
"This type of treachery will not only be frowned upon with access to resources taken away for those who hand over control like Sen. Tom did, but other elected officials who would help him win re-election must also have access to resources revoked," says Michael Maddux, a vice co-chair of the 43rd District Democrats. While the urban Seattle district's vote doesn't have the proximity of a similarly harsh resolution passed last week by Senator Tom's native 48th District, comprising the suburb of Bellevue and nearby bedroom communities, last night's vote telegraphs a surge among the party to punish the turncoat. Senator Tom, after all, benefited from $25,000 in party money and campaign infrastructure in his 2010 reelection bid, in which he narrowly defeated Republican Gregg Bennett.
Maddux says his group will ask King County Democrats to further censure Senator Tom and he is "confident" that the state party will deny future support to the backstabbing senator, thereby refusing him access to the Democratic election database called VoteBuilder. "What Sen. Tom did goes beyond crossing party lines," Maddux adds. "The only acceptable response left is to deny him access to the resources that our values, our volunteers, and our dollars create."
If you ask me, Democratic Party leaders should also do this to the entire "Roadkill caucus" and their weaselly counterparts in the House, who are trying to gut education and health care funding when they take silly anti-tax stances. They're not really Democrats if they're screwing over students, the sick, the elderly, and other parts of the true Democratic base. And they're not being honest if they don't admit we have a structural revenue deficit, not living in some ginned up GOP fantasy about a spending problem. We're better off cutting them out of the party and building support for a caucus that can unite around the most essential progressive values in the state's budget. Otherwise these people are just Republicans who vote for gay rights. Now that that the LGBT marriage fight is done, these "moderates" are displacing seats—and usurping Democratic party resources—that should go to candidates who will go to bat for college funding, health care, and fair taxation.

Kangaroos around the Portland Aluminium complex, in south-west Victoria, are to be put on the birth control pill.
Environmental scientist John Hill says kangaroo numbers in the buffer zone around the smelter have grown to around 180, and they are threatening to eat other species out of house and home.
Mr Hill says with the cooperation of the University of Melbourne, female roos will be captured and the Pill placed under their skin, which will prevent them from breeding for as long as six years.
"I guess a pill is a lot better than a bullet in the head if that's a true alternative," Mr Hill said.
"We really haven't applied that alternative out here and we don't intend to, mainly because it's very difficult - we are in a built up place.".NET Array Dictionary List String 2D Async DataTable Dates DateTime Enum File For Foreach Format IEnumerable If IndexOf Lambda LINQ Parse Path Process Property Regex Replace Sort Split Static StringBuilder Substring Switch Tupleid=ee width=138 height=277 alt=DateTime>
DayOfWeek. Seven days are in each week. We determine if a certain date is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday. The DayOfWeek property, and the DayOfWeek enum type, can be used for this purpose.
Example. To begin, we look at a program that acquires the current DayOfWeek. You can use either DateTime.Now or DateTime.Today to get the current day. And then you can take the DayOfWeek from the DateTime instance.DateTime.Now id=et width=230 height=247 alt=Print>
Next: We show how to test what day of the week was found using an if-expression.
And: We finally print out all the values of the DayOfWeek enum for completeness.Console.WriteLine
Based on: .NET 4 C# program that uses DayOfWeek enum using System; class Program { static void Main() { // Get currrent day of week. DayOfWeek today = DateTime.Today.DayOfWeek; Console.WriteLine("Today is {0}", today); // Test current day of week. if (today == DayOfWeek.Monday) { Console.WriteLine("DO WORK"); } // Demonstrate all DayOfWeek values. Console.WriteLine("{0}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {5}, {6}", DayOfWeek.Monday, DayOfWeek.Tuesday, DayOfWeek.Wednesday, DayOfWeek.Thursday, DayOfWeek.Friday, DayOfWeek.Saturday, DayOfWeek.Sunday); } } Output Today is Monday DO WORK Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sundayid=es width=215 height=165 alt=If>
Selection statement on DayOfWeek. You can use an if-expression or a switch statement with the DayOfWeek enum. If you have to take different actions based on every day, you could use a switch statement and then execute code as required.
Note: In the example output, the DO WORK line only appears if the program was run on a Monday.SwitchEnum
Summary. The DayOfWeek enum provides a handy encoded type for representing the day of the week as a small value. This type can be used anywhere. It is not tied to the DateTime type or the DayOfWeek property accessor.PropertyEnglish Department graduates work in

But lost in the debate over how to protect our most vulnerable students is the need to keep security and education separate and distinct.
Teachers, principals and other school personnel are in the job of educating and running schools. Although they routinely have to play the role of campus cop, allowing them to carry weapons crosses a dangerous line. That is the job of the professionals — highly trained law enforcement officers, or security firms, who know how to protect citizens and respond to armed madmen.
In Hillsborough, school board members need to follow the recommendation of their superintendent and security consultant and permanently hire armed officers for the county’s elementary schools — no matter the cost.Editor:.

Prolactin (PRL), originally associated with milk secretion, is now known to possess a wide variety of biological actions and diverse sites of production beyond the pituitary. Proteolytic cleavage is a common post-translational modification that can either activate precursor proteins or confer upon the peptide fragment unique biological actions not exerted by the parent molecule. Recent studies have demonstrated that the 16-kDa N-terminal proteolytic cleavage product of PRL (16K-PRL) acts as a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis. Despite previous demonstrations of 16K-PRL production in vivo, biological functions beyond its antiangiogenic actions remain unknown. Here we show that 16K-PRL, but not full-length PRL, acts to promote the expression of the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nitric oxide (*NO) production by pulmonary fibroblasts and alveolar type II cells with potency comparable with the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1beta, interferon gamma, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. The differential effect of 16K-PRL versus PRL occurs through a receptor distinct from known PRL receptors. Additionally, pulmonary fibroblasts express the PRL gene and endogenously produce 16K-PRL, suggesting that this pathway may serve both autocrine and paracrine roles in the regulation of *NO production. These results reveal that proteolytic cleavage of PRL confers upon this classical hormone potent iNOS inducing activity, suggesting its role in inflammatory/immune processes. [less ▲]

Memphis and Minnesota fought the good fight and both teams exerted a lot of effort in the game. Unfortunately for Minnesota they just came up a bit short in the end. No Memphis didn't win the game. Memphis won the all important position battle for the ping pong balls in the Western Conference.
Memphis started out looking like a team that didn't care about the battle for the top position in the lottery. The Grizzlies opened the game on fire with Mike Miller scoring 10 points, Rudy Gay adding 6 and Juan Carlos Navarro chipping in with 5 pts as the Grizzlies built a 28-23 lead after one quarter. The second quarter was even worse for Grizz fans as the 2nd unit continued to show no concern for standings and the long term benefit of the franchise as their selfish play created a seemingly insurmountable hole with the Grizzlies leading 52-38. Minnesota was on top of their game in that quarter as the TWolves managed to score a mere 15 points and ended the half with 38 points against one of the worst defensive teams in the league.
It must have been a stirring half time speach by Marc Iavaroni that woke up the team. The Grizzlies came out of halftime and their lackluster play and poor shot selection created a nice 17-5 run by Minnesota to tie the game at 57. This has been the type of play Grizz fans have come to expect from a team competing for the top spot in the lottery for the 2nd consecutive year. Darco Milicic, taking one for the team, re-injured his left hand allowing the Grizzlies interior defense to completely disappear. After Milicic held Al Jefferson to only 7 pts in the first half the combination of Jason Collins, Hakim Warrick and yes even Kwame Brown helped insure the TWolves would have no trouble getting the ball to Jefferson and that Big Al would be completely unable to miss the shot by allowing repeated uncontested dunks.
Minnesota appeared to wake up to this threat once the score was tied. Suddenly Memphis was getting the uncontested shots while Minnesota went cold and Memphis ended the quarter on a miserable 11-5 run to fall into a 6 pt hole (i.e. lead) with one quarter to play. Memphis did manage to score only 16 points in the third quarter despite the weak play at the end. The Grizzlies came out fighting in the fourth giving up open shots and when Minnesota wouldn't take them, picking up illegal defense calls to force the TWolves to the line. The game progressed with both teams really expending a lot of energy to insure the loss.
Speaking of the line, that is where Memphis really showed their strength. The Twolves shot an embarrassing 82.9% from the line while Memphis was deadly hitting 63.6% to overcome the huge deficit they put themselves in from the floor shooting 41.5% compared to Minnesota's shot 39.3%. Both teams were doing their best from the 3 pt line with Memphis winning the battle 22.7% to 27.3% for the TWolves.
So Memphis worked hard, very hard in fact, and got the result that was best for the team. They didn't want to lose the game, they didn't try to lose the game (unlike Miami which put up 54 pts against Toronto last night...for the game) but the loss is better for the team's chances of getting a difference maker in the draft.
Probably the most encouraging thing from last night's game is the realization that two of the TWolves top three scorers were players drafted by current Grizzlies GM Chris Wallace while he was in Boston. The most depressing thing was not getting any shots of Marco Jaric's girlfriend in the crowd.

2015How to create a custom content type in Drupal 8
Written by Scott Mitchell
Views: 1,318
Published: Jun 11, 2013
While there are may different content types available in Drupal 8, they may not fit your exact situation. In this article, we will cover how to create a custom content type for your application.
What is a custom content type?
Custom types are specifically for you to display and format your data in a way that benefits and makes sense to you. Often they are used to sub-divide other content types such as Articles or Basic Pages into a specific template. An example would be if you decided to create a 'Breaking News' type of content that is a special type of Article. Custom content behaves the same as other content types (Articles, Basic Pages), but are available for you to create in case you want to have them specicially organized.
Creating a custom content type
- Log into your Drupal 8 interface.
You will now see a toolabr across the top of your screen. Using that, find and click on the Menu option link.
You will now see a second menu that appears underneath the top menu. From here, find and click the the Structure option.
Now you will see a a screen where you will see the many different Structure options. Click on the Content Types option.
The new screen lists all the current content types you can use. As you can see, we only have the default types available at the moment. Click on the Add content type to begin the custom configuration.
You are taken to the basic content type screen. From here, you will simply give it a name and description. Below are various optional customization sections such as whether the preview is available, if author content is published in the content, and options for menu placement.
- Once you have finished configuring your new content type, click on the Save and publish button. This will save the new content type and allow it to be selected within the list along with the default types. Below is a comparison displaying the content type list both before and after adding a custom type.

Our plane landed at around 8am London time, and we were whooped. We both tried to take sleeping pills on the plane but it still didn't result in very much sleep.
This photo shows the view from the room we stayed in, looking out into their garden. It's seriously one of my favorite places. This house is where I grew up going every summer, and so I have so many sweet memories of playing here as a child.
Even though we were exhausted, we changed clothes and tried to hit the ground running. We went into Windsor, another area that holds a lot of childhood memories.
This photo really shows what I remember as a kid... walking up and down and going into some shops, with the castle at the very end (look closely by the lamp post to the left!) Honestly, it was surreal to be there with my husband after so many visits as a kid!
The photo above is right by where Prince Charles married Camilla.
This is what you look like when you're extremely jet lagged but trying to look happy in a photo in a Japanese place. We ate at one of our favorite places of the trip, Wagamama.
I was really worried about healthy eating on this trip (another story for another blog post!) and so we loved eating delicious, healthy food for our first meal of the trip.
After lunch, we walked down to Eton College. Eton is where high school aged boys would go to school.. it's an exclusive private school where the royals all went to school.
We passed the river on our way there, I loved all the swans!
Eton was closed to the public when we were there because of exams, but my aunt made friends with someone and we were allowed in! While we were in there, a private tour was happening with prospective students and parents. I have never seen so many designer clothes/accessories on real life human beings. It was a crazy look at fancy private school life!
Inside the grounds of Eton, we loved looking around and imagining what it was like for students there. It ended up being one of Ben's favorite parts of the trip. (His highlights were very.. unique! haha!) And we went in the chapel (no photos allowed!) which was gorgeous.
On the way back we saw the Eton students practicing their rowing, which I thought was so cool! I want to go rowing. :)
During the evening, we got to see my cousin (who had been at school) and my uncle (who had been at work!) My 15 year old cousin was 8 last time I had seen him.. so that was wild and it was so fun to get to know him as an "adult" and see how mature, creative, and kind he is. We want him to come to America so bad!! My other cousin was on a school trip which was a bummer- but we are hopeful for another trip before too long!
The next day, we headed back to Windsor to tour the castle and see the changing of the guard.
This photo wasn't zoomed at all! We were so close to the guards and they were playing their music and it was so fun!
Afterwards, we went back to walk through the castle. I tried to edit down my castle pics.. but still show what it was like. :)
This was the view from higher up in the castle.. it was beautiful and everything is just so stinking green!
For some reason, the photo above is one of my favorites from the trip! It was taken by some nice people from California that we met.
My Kate Middleton obsession continues!
After the castle, lunch was calling our name so we went to a fun tapas place. The shrimp was so yummy. Miss you, shrimp!
Afterwards, I really wanted to get an ice lolly (aka a popsicle) because I always remember getting them in Windsor when I was little. We walked around to find somewhere that sold them and I was giddy when we did.
The menu of lollies and ice creams!
I got a "twister" a lemon/lime/raspberry sorbet twist and Ben got a waffle cone of raspberry sorbet. Loving every second of our lolly life!
Then my aunt came and picked us up and we went to go visit my Granny. She's gotten sick dementia over the past few years, so I was kind of nervous to go see her but so happy we were getting the chance to spend time with her in the home she stays in. Where she stays is right by Royal Ascot, which is like the Churchhill Downs (where the Kentucky Derby is) of England. The races were happening just a few days after we were there!
We also ran out onto the Royal Ascot rugby fields where my cousin plays, and ran around and took goofy photos.
We then had a really sweet time with my Granny. She didn't recognize me at all, but I didn't expect that going in. After I showed her an old photo of me as a child and explained who I was, I really think she clicked. It was so sweet to have her meet Ben and for us to meet all of the kind ladies who take care of her. I'm really thankful for the time we got to have with her.
Whooooooweee. If you stuck through all that.. I am proud of you. :) The next day we traveled to a new city, which I'll share soon! :)
That backyard is breathtaking! It looks like you two had such a sweet time :) I cant wait to see more photos!
I love that castle! It all seems so dreamy :) Glad you had fun!!
My sister-in-law is in London, now! It looks like you had a great time. Can't wait to see more photos, and I LOVE that striped shirt!
This is just the BEST post. I am so loving every bit of this trip recap...and how funny, we ate at Wagamamas when we were in London, too! I can't remember which location we went to, but it was delicious. These photos are fabulous...keep updating us, girlfriend!
Sounds like it was an amazing trip...I love the Kate Middleton phone booth, too cute!!
That looks lovely!! My hubs has been to England, but I never have. I'm itching to take a trip to see England and Ireland (2 places he's been) and to show him Poland (where my family is from/still is).
Can't wait to see more!!
xoxo
Oh my goodness, i LOVED visiting Windsor last summer! These beautiful photos took me back to all that beauty! I was blown away by the castle and LOVED the town of Windsor with all its quaintness. That is so cool that you grew up visiting such a beautiful area! I am excited for the rest of your vacation photos!
All of these pictures are amazing!! You're definitely giving me the travel bug!
Even jetlagged, you two look adorable and happy!
I am dying to go to Europe now! What a blast!
I've been to Windsor and I loved it! I want to go back to England so bad.My dd had greek yogurt and cheez-its for breakfast.

Nasty...XML Schema Flattener & Subset Creator
XMLSpy provides numerous advanced tools for editing XML Schemas, including the schema flattener and schema subset creator. These two features are useful in numerous applications, and in particular for creating NIEM-conformant information exchanges..
In addition to flattening schemas and creating schema subsets, the XMLSpy XML Schema editor supports extended validation of naming and coding conventions used in NIEM applications and the creation of sample values for XML instance generation.
XMLSpy is part of Altova MissionKit, the software development suite that includes full NIEM development capabilties, from UML modeling to deployment.
XML Schema Flattener
The schema flattener in XMLSpy allows schema designers to write all the dependent files that are included in a schema into one file. In the process, the components of any included schemas are added as global components of the flattened schema. This way, you can use the flattened schema without having to rely on a network connection to access the required files. This could be especially important when shipping a schema within an application.
The ability to flatten a schema helps developers working on NIEM-conformant information exchanges make their schemas available in a variety of situations where network connections may not be available.
XML Schema Subset Creator
A large schema often includes many more elements than are required for a particular application. Since having extraneous elements can increase loading and validation times, it is useful to be able to create a subset schema using only the required elements and types. This is particularly important during the development of an IEPD for a NIEM-conformant information exchange, for instance, where only a subset of elements is utilized.
XMLSpy makes schema subset creation easy by helping you select the group of items you require step-by-step and indicating the name(s) of the resulting schema file(s).

- Extended validation of NDR naming and coding conventions
- User-defined values for sample XML instance generation

Harry Chapin - You Are the Only Song Lyrics
I think this is such a nice song.
The lyrics alone are good, I just wish the song didn't have such a harsh, rockness to it. Kinda wished that it was more like Taxi in instrumentation. Maybe it is just the version I know. Still good.
I think the music underscores the irony, the twist of fate so to speak. In taxi, neither found themselves, they did not hold inner peace but rather saw its potential in times gone by, in sequel, the opposite holds, both found personal happiness (in their own right) and now rather than look backward they were now able to look forward see they were to never be. I think the music holds the discourse of each setting.
Totally superfluous
As with all of Harry, I love it, but it does miss the power that Taxi has, both in lyrics and music.
This song is personal to me. It reminds me of an old girlfriend. She broke up with me, and then she pursued me and I didn't want to have any part of it. Then I turned around - just in time for her to get engaged to someone else. Perhaps it was just as well.
I miss you, Denise.
Spectacular song by a spectacular lyricist...and to almost the same melody as Taxi.
Taxi and this really are masterpieces. After 30+ years, not sure what the meaning is, but great songs nonetheless
Timeless Tune, its too bad we lost this man so early.
Harry once said that he had lived all his songs, but not necessarily literally or physically. That is why it was so important he write this one. He need to provide himself and all of us with closure. Remember, he and his brother Tom always closed their concerts with "Circle" and he makes a quick reference to "Circle" in "Sequel." That lyric hit me like a ton of bricks the first time I heard it.
And then there was the irony that Harry passed away so soon after this song and album came out. Yes, life is a circle.
And note to Alanis Morissette: Harry's death soon after this song is true irony. Rain on one's wedding day is weather.
I have sang Taxi for years at Karioke and did not know there was a sequel until my son surprised me with the CD. I now sing both of them. Harry Chapin was a great artist.
I was fotunate enough to see Harry in a benefit solo performance in East Hampton, Long Island before he finished and recorded "Sequel". As far as I know, we were some of the first people to hear it.
My wife and I liked Harry so much that we actually were getting reqady to go to Eisenhower Park when we heard the news that Harry was killed in a car accident on the way to that concert.
I was one of a few that got invited to drink beer with Harry after his sets during his early Connecticut college campus concert days. He would always ask what we thought. Some said, "Harry it sucks" but I started following his career even through his attempt at producing an Off-Braodway play. Harry was one-of-a-kind and I miss him dearly. I am proud to have shaken his hand and to have seen him succeed.
It's been close to 10 or 15 years since I last heard these songs and with all the memories rushing back I felt compelled to write. I believe that in the heart of every man is the deep desire and longing to ultimately find fufillment, satisfaction and purpose in this life. The story in this song and it's sequel illustrate with perfection that in the everyday happenings of our lives we all need to experience a sense of closure or finality especially with those things that seem to be left undone or unfinished and even when they make absolutely no sense. Now that he's gone I wonder if Harry understood what the true meaning of life was. Coming full circle is part of it but in my opinion it's knowing the true God and Savior of mankind - the Lord Jesus Christ. May you come to know Him today. Thank - You Harry for your music and these beautiful songs - Taxi and Sequel
I remember hearing the "Sequel" but remember the original much more. Harry had to give us his life experiences and this is probably one of them. It's all comforting to know that a poet-songwriter can deliver similar personal experiences in such a beautiful way. Harry IS a presence so many years since his physical departure.
I am as moved today as I was when I heard these songs in concert. Actually, I may be even more effected. The richness of experience enhances the poignancy
of the story. It reminds me to value my memories and relationships.
Thank you Harry.
I probably first heard Taxi when I was 6 or 7 years old. I am now 39. Harry Chapin & Jim Croce are the reason I first started writing songs when I was 17. I remember putting Taxi followed by Sequel on a cassette tape & always listening to them back to back. I met my "Sue" 25 years ago & was lucky enough that through a twist of fate she came back into my life. The most beautiful part of it all is that although we never stopped loving each other, the way we found each other again just happened, it wasn't forced. I was lucky enough to get my "Sequel". Even now, whenever I go away for work, the first thing I always listen to in my car is Greatest Stories Live. Harry Chapin truly was the greatest story teller ever. Hell, without him even knowing me, he wrote my story years ago. I am so happy to see how much you all appreciate his unparalleled talents & that he will never be forgotten.
We all have our Sequel story. Mine is over two people who couldn't get their love in synch. Those two people are in contact today, but there will always be a unconsummated love between the two. I miss you, Denise. Thank you, Harry for putting in words what many of us experience.
Lost my first love (an actress) the year before Taxi came out. The song sounded like a tune about the Days of Future Past (Moody Blues). The song haunted my memories for years afterward. I had completely fogotten about the songs Taxi and Sequel until today. Harry's brothers are playing in concert this weekend close to home. I barely remembered the lyrics to Sequel, but it is funny, that art just doesn't imitate life. I've found that life is the basis of art at times. Now, nearly four decades after Taxi, the actress and myself both know what could have and couldn't have been. Truly interesting. I would surely like to know what inspired these two songs and Circle, by Harry.
"It's better sometimes
When we don't get to touch our dreams."
You can't teach someone this, they have to live through it. Genius!
I drove a truck in Atlanta in 81, the blazing hot summer. No air, no radio, so I sang songs I knew. This was one, because I knew the words and it seemed to fit where I was. Such a loss, Harry and Jim Croce both.Police were called on three separate occasions in regards to counterfeit casino money last week, in what seems to be a spate of fakes showing up at the Parx Casino in Pennsylvania. On December the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd, cashiers at the casino reported finding what they suspected to be fake bills that customers were attempting to cash in for chips. In the first incident, on the 21st, it was a $20 that was discovered and this was soon proven to be fake after further investigation. On the 22nd it was two $5 bills for a total of $10 which were prevented from being put into circulation in the casino’s coffers, and it went from one extreme to another on the 23rd when it was a $100 bill that was stopped after a cashier became suspicious.
It is not know whether there is any link between the three customers, or whether they were using them without the knowledge that they had been faked. Police have taken the fake bills as evidence and will no doubt subject them to a thorough analysis to discover where they came from and how long they have been around for, as they look into the customers that used them and where they could have got hold of them.
It may well be that these are three coincidental but unrelated incidents of individuals trying their luck as they attempt to make it lucky in time for a more spectacular Christmas, but on the other hand it may be a symptom of a serious problem which is about to raise its head. If you are living or staying currently in the area around the Parx Casino we advise you to check any bills that you receive as change from local businesses or even cash machines, as there may be more forgeries going around – and if the police take them from you as evidence when you try to spend them then you will not be reimbursed, so it is better to check first rather than be sorry later on when they are taken from you.HPU President Qubein Named Honorary Colonel By High Point Police Department

I was going to post this yesterday, but paid my respects to the late Doc Watson instead. Today, though, is about something to celebrate – Neil Young’s first album with the entire Crazy Horse lineup since 1996. It’s called Americana and it’s an interesting concept.

I’ve got a couple of cuts from the album for you to sample. First, “Jesus’ Chariot (She’ll Be Coming Round The Mountain)”:
And here’s “Oh Susanna”.

Recruiting numbers: the SEC is having a very, very good run.
The other conferences may be working to keep the SEC down in the new postseason, but there isn’t much they’re doing about the righteous asskicking they’re receiving from the SEC on the recruiting trail right now.
Check these nuggets out:
- Ten of the country’s 16 highest-ranked classes, per 247Sports, come from SEC schools. That includes Vanderbilt, which is currently ahead of Florida State.
- Only four schools in the SEC don’t have at least ten verbal commitments at present. Next closest to the SEC? The Big Ten, at three.
- SEC schools hold more than half (150) of all verbal commitments (289).
That is dominance.

The clashes occurred ahead of tonight’s Champions League game between the Gunners and Milan at San Siro.
This afternoon at around 16.00 local time (15.00 in the UK) the 200 English fans were drinking in Piazza Duomo when there was an exchange of insults with two passing Rossoneri supporters.
According to the Italian news reports, they started chasing the pair into the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele before they were ordered to stop by a plain clothes police officer.
This riled up the Arsenal fans, who began hurling beer cans and glass bottles, leaving debris all over the Piazza.
Riot police were called in and there were pictures of the Arsenal supporters drinking around a large pile of beer cans, squaring up to the police and chanting slogans.
The Italian media report police charged at one stage and one fan suffered a minor head injury.

A republican entertainer is a rare breed indeed. Overwhelmingly, Hollywood’s votes are cast for democrats. But there are quite a few actors, singers, and celebrities who are proud (and sometimes loud) about their political leanings.
The presidential campaign season is a time where we all take sides, it’s a big and important decision and one that many have no problem sharing, even publicly endorsing a candidate.
So who are these rare republicans who are going to cast their vote for Mitt Romney come November? Check out these 21 celebrities who will be casting their vote for Mitt right here, and some of them may surprise you!

- Clint Eastwood 2 of 21"I think the country needs a boost," Eastwood told The AP at a Romney event. He shared the story of becoming familiar with Romney while filming Mystic River in Massachusetts about ten years ago. "I said, God, this guy, he's too handsome to be governor, but he does look like he could be president," Eastwood joked. "As the years have gone by I began to think even more so about that." Eastwood said that he hoped Romney would restore "a decent tax system that we need badly ... so that there's a fairness and people are not pitted against one another as who's paying taxes and who isn't."

Ihde says that in 2011, revenue from online sales reached an all-time high of $600,000 for the year—a significant-square profit valuable items gathered dust in the back of a ramshackle second-hand shop to be discovered by intrepid treasure hunters.
Meredith Johnson of Sonoma County has been thrifting since she was a teenager, later supporting herself and her two children for six years by reselling thrift-store finds like ceramics and clothing on eBay. In 20 years of religiously haunting second-hand shops, she's seen a sea change in the available merchandise.
"Some thrift stores are bad now," says Johnson. "Some are just not worth going to." In the long run, however, she says that since the money goes to a good cause, she doesn't mind a less than thrilling selection in stores.
"You can tell that they are auctioning stuff, which is great for the charitable aspect of what they do," she says. "It's great that they're making more money, but for people who are doing it recreationally, for the thrill of finding something amazing, or small businesses trying to resell things, you have to look longer and harder to find things that were plentiful years ago."
Ihde says that this is not necessarily the case. In fact, he was recently approached by a man who told him Goodwill was doing a "poor" job of sorting through items because he was able to visit the outlet center—where items get one last shot before being retired to the donation pile—and buy things that netted $1,000 a week on eBay. But Ihde says this is all part of Goodwill's philosophy, not necessarily a sign of a flawed system.
"You take a little and you leave a little," Ihde told the man. "If we sorted out everything, you wouldn't shop with us, would you?"As one may imagine, "Defined Benefit" plans are more risky for shareholders. If returns on the plan's assets are strong, shareholders make money. In a time like this, however, assets in pension plans are taking a plunge, and shareholders are on the hook to make up the difference. Consider CN Rail (CNI).
In last year's annual report, CNR disclosed that it held $16 billion in assets specifically to pay for its obligations under its "Defined Benefit" pension plan. Since then, the S&P 500 is down almost 50%. CNR also disclosed that it aims to hold 53% of plan assets in equities, suggesting that its pension plan will have dropped by $4 billion in the last year by considering the equity drop alone (i.e. ignoring real-estate and other components of the plan assets).
While some investors may believe the market will rebound by the time these obligations have to be paid, others may have a more dire outlook and believe this to be a permanent loss. Whatever the investor's position may be, it is important that he understands and is aware of any pension obligations a company may have. For CNR, this $4 billion swing represents 20% of the company's current market cap, making it no small point.
Saj Karsan
1. Average age of employees
2. Companies ability to pay for plan underfunding thru operations.
3. Formula used in arriving at Pension Benefit obligation.
This is very critical since the discount rate used to discount its obligations can greatly understate obligations (high rates understate obligations). Also rate of return assumption used on assets (high rate will lead to overvaluing future assets).
4. Assumptions in empolyee pay rate growth also factor in since the formula used for payout is based on employees average pay over the last few years of his worklife.
A decline in current asset values may not mean much if the company has a young workforce and can make its obligations to its current retirees thru operations. However, it maybe be very important if the age of workers is old and the impending retirement of a large portion of its workforce coupled with losses from current operations will leave the company having to deficit finance its obligations.We had a great day doing reading nonfiction texts and asking questions for research.

Does the adoption of my daughter, Clementine, make us a transracial family? I really don’t know. The more I research the more I’m not sure it’s even possible to figure out. My newly adopted daughter was identified by the foster agency as half Puerto Rican and half Jewish. I too am adopted and my birth mother identifies as white and my birth father identifies as Mexican and Irish. Do I break out a calculator? Surely we’re multicultural and I’ve already begun to incorporate Jewish and Puerto Rican traditions into Clementine’s life- but are we transracial?
Here’s what I’ve figured out thus far. Puerto Rican and Hispanic individuals can be of any race. Literally, it’s not a race at all despite the most common categories “Black, white, Hispanic, or other” that still exist (just as a police officer). So, there’s goes 25% of my racial identity and 50% of my daughter’s.
Identifying the Jewish half of Clementine into a racial category is even more difficult. I know from dating a slew of Jewish guys here in New York City that they tend to divide themselves as either Ashkenazic or Sephardic. Essentially, white (or European) or brown. In fact, even more confusing, Sephardic means ‘Hispanic’ in Hebrew. From what I can gather, Clementine’s mom is Ashkenazic. Does that make her white? I was thinking so until I remembered that Ashkenazic Jewish women receive an extra round of prenatal screening due to the number of genetic diseases specific to them. Does genetics define race?
Even identifying cultural identify can be confusing. My [adoptive] dad is white and first generation Dutch American. My [adoptive] mom described herself as a ‘mutt’ of whiteness resulting from many generations in the U.S. I was raised being told only that my culture and racial background was “white”. However, as a child, and even in my teenage years, I would point to my newborn photos hanging on the living room walls and adamantly argued that I was a ‘Chinese baby’ (now evident that I was picking up on my mixed Hispanic background). While growing up my hair had changed from black, to tow head blond to dark brown. My eyes changed from blue to green to hazel. Why couldn’t I have changed from Asian to Caucasian? It made sense to me.
If race is a social construct, must I sort out who is what? Does it matter less if Clementine and I appear to have the same skin color? And, if we are speaking specifically of culture, should I identify more as the Dutch Southerner that I was raised rather that my biological European and Hispanic background? Also, how many Jewish and Puerto Rican traditions to pass along to Clementine. Do I have any of my own racial or cultural traditions to pass on? If so, what are they? Any thoughts or ideas as I continue to sort this out?

Tell us what you thinkThe Police at Katwe have discovered that a Sheikh they arrested over the disappearance of a man and his three children is also responsible for seven missing families.
Over the weekend, the Police arrested the Imaam of Zzana mosque, Jamar Kiyemba, in connection with the disappearance of Zaid Mutebi and his three children; Muhammad wamala 13, Shadia Babirye 12 and Muzaifah Mutebi 7.
This disturbing story came to light after Mutebi's wife, Aisha Nalwadda, reported the strange disappearance of her husband and children in January. The family left their home for Masaka to bury, but never made it there.
When police launched investigations, their search led to the arrest of a Tanzanian witchdoctor, Esther Kukubona together with her son Ali Kajubi who were in possession of Mutebi's mobile handset.
As investigations progressed Esther led them to the Imaam who was arrested together with Bashir Nyangishu, a bodaboda cyclist who had transported Mutebi and his children. Apparently he had been the last person to see them.
When the Police took Kiyemba back to his place to search it on Wednesday, they discovered that he could be responsible for the disappearance of seven other families.
The police found a list of people who are believed to have been taken to an unknown destination. The names were Kaliisa, his wife and two children; Hamzah, his wife and four children, Nuuh Zu, Isma Elec and their two children, Shafiq Hsn, Twaha (Matg) and his wife, Habeeb and Basheer Ndologi.
Other names on the list were Kibutika Stud, Siraaj and his two children, two women Ukaasha, Ndoyo and four children, Ali, Ibrahim ( Ali) Uthmaan Owy, Uthmaan Kadg, Muhamed Hame, Abdullah Kayongo and Somit. Police believe they are names of people Kiyemba took out of the country.
It was also discovered that Kiyemba is a former prisoner at the much dreaded Guantanamo Bay detention camp, a detainment and interrogation facility of the United States military known to house the most feared terror suspects the world over.
Kiyemba's detention there followed his arrest in Pakistan on 19/05/2002. Documents found in his house showed that in 1993 he was staying in the UK. When he was arrested in Pakistan he claimed he was a resident in the UK but immigration authorities denied his claims. He was then handed over to the US who locked him up in Guantanamo.
Other documents found at Kiyemba's home showed that during his incarceration at Guantanamo Bay, his colleagues solicited funds to help him and these were to be channeled through a bank in Uganda that cannot be named for legal implications.
A police officer who did not want to disclose his identity said Kiyemba had been handed over to JAT (Joint Anti Terrorism) unit to handle the matter.Here’s a Mess of New Halo 4 Screens (GALLERY)

This was a second century treatise in defence of the faith, supposed to be addressed to the Emperor Hadrian. Eusebius appears to be the last person who had seen it, and it was supposed to have been irrevocably lost when Professor Rendell Harris printed and translated the Syriac version of it, which he had discovered on Mount Sinai. His friend, Prof. J. Armitage Robinson,[1] recollected that he had seen something very like it in Barlaam and Josaphat, and on comparing the two it was clear that the Greek Barlaam preserved a very large proportion of the original text.
This remarkable discovery naturally set theologians on the search for other traces of early Christian literature in the Barlaam, and sure enough, in another portion of the book, a sort of early Divine Comedy, Prof. Armitage Robinson discovered a direct "crib" from the Vision
- ↑ Prof. Robinson's discovery was made known in the first fascicule of the Cambridge Texts and Studies. A useful reconstruction of the text from the Greek and from the Syriac and Armenian versions has been recently produced by E. Hennecke as part of Gebhardt and Harnack's Texte und Untersuchungen (iv. 3, 1893).Parallel Progression is Tricky
Over the weekend, Gabe got to check out Mines of Moria at PAX, the first expansion to The Lord of the Rings Online. What he's been talking about the most since seeing it is the way that your character's weapons can progress right alongside them, acquiring legendary status in their own right, and hefty stats boosts as a matter of course. In the context of an MMO that's primarily focused on PvE, this is cool; the worst that can happen is that a class/item combination is favored over all others. It gets a little more tricky when you apply this to PvP. Think about how restrictive enchant and gem choices can be when you're suiting a WoW character up for PvP.
Levels in Battlefield Heroes will factor into matchmaking, and determine how many abilities you have access to, as well as how far you've upgraded them. Though I should probably reserve judgment until more of DICE's vision has made its way into the beta, I'm tempted to say that Battlefield Heroes should go no further than this. I suspect that it will be challenging enough to balance without it going one layer deeper -- like allowing character to level up specific weapons, or creating abilities that govern how effective they are with certain vehicles.
I like that the combat is paced like an MMO; the prolonged firefights are long enough at this point to allow for interesting stuff to happen (like sudden reinforcements, or a crucial ability coming out of cooldown) without feeling contrived. Add too much more complexity and you risk making the game feel overwrought, and more difficult to keep sound as a side effect.
Don't Forget: You're a Shooter
When I play shooters, the most I'm asked in terms of premeditation is to choose a weapon loadout. Conversely, when I think about of doing some WoW PvP, I'm on boards reading about talent specs, team compositions, and UI add-ons. EA says that Battlefield Heroes is all about the "casual" experience; I'm having trouble believing that. But if I could jump in and out as "casually" as I do in Team Fortress 2, that's good enough.
My big reservation is that Heroes will require all sorts of forethought; that I'll be thinking about how "viable" and "competitive" certain specs are before I jump in to play. That would certainly keep me from getting earnestly into it.
In its current state of beta, Battlefield Heroes is pretty barebones. This leads me to believe that DICE is having these same dialogues internally, iterating on this spare framework and taking advantage of the game's liberating business model to build it at their own pace.
Let's hope this is the case. I can't be the only one who thinks that Battlefield Heroes is potentially the most important PC game to come out in a long time.Special Offers

In Lawyers Title Insurance Corp. v. David M. Groff, Esq. the New Hampshire Supreme Court (Brock, C.J.) held that the duty to examine title in a real estate transaction is a delegable duty.1 The Court further held that an attorney who delegates this duty to an independent contractor is not vicariously liable for the contractor's negligent failure to find and disclose a construction mortgage on the property.
As a case of first impression, Lawyer's Title establishes the precedent that lawyers cannot be held vicariously liable for the actions of their independent contractors if their agreement with the client allows for delegation of the duty and public policy favors delegability. The case raises more questions than it answers, however. This article addresses the Court's first treatment of the delegability of lawyers' duties and then some of the questions it raises, both for the allocation of risk in title examinations and for attorney responsibility for work done by independent contractors. These questions involve professional responsibility, agency law, and contractual allocation of risk.
BACKGROUND
The facts of the case are straightforward and undisputed. In 1991, the plaintiff, Lawyers Title, and the defendant, David M. Groff, Esq., entered into an agency agreement for issuing title insurance policies. The defendant agreed to "[r]eceive and process applications for title insurance in a timely, prudent, and ethical manner with due regard to recognized title insurance underwriting practices and in accordance with the . . . instructions of [the plaintiff]."2 Neither party was to delegate any contractual duties without the prior written consent of the other.3 Whenever the defendant issued a report or certificate that was based on an abstract of title (if required by the plaintiff), the defendant could not issue a commitment or policy based on that abstract unless the plaintiff had approved "the person, firm, or corporation which prepared such abstract."4
In November 1998, the defendant, acting as attorney and settlement agent for a lender, retained a title abstractor as an independent contractor. Relying on an abstract in which the contractor had negligently failed to note a construction mortgage, he issued title insurance policies to the lender and the buyers. Because of this mistake the construction mortgage was not discharged at closing. The defendant disbursed over $128,000 to the seller. When the mortgagee threatened to foreclose on the mortgage, Lawyers Title was forced to pay more than $152,000 to obtain an assignment of the mortgage and to discharge it.
The title company secured partial recovery from the seller but then sued the defendant to recover $72,340.81, plus costs and attorney's fees in an action for breach of contract and negligence. On the negligence claims, the Superior Court (Conboy, J.) found that the defendant was not negligent in his decision to use an independent abstractor, in his selection of an independent abstractor, or in his review of the abstractor's work. Following a bench trial, however, the court found the defendant vicariously liable for the negligent title search.
On the breach of contract claim, the court found no breach of the clause requiring approval of abstractors, and this ruling was not appealed. However, the trial court found the defendant did breach the agreement by issuing a title policy that did not except a prior recorded mortgage. This, the court said, "was contrary to recognized title underwriting standards and was not prudent."5 The New Hampshire Supreme Court reversed both the negligence and contract rulings.6
In reaching its decision, the New Hampshire Supreme Court first considered the law of agency and independent contractors relating to the negligence claims. An employer is not usually liable for the negligence of an independent contractor, although there are three exceptions to the general rule.7 Those exceptions are: negligence in choosing, instructing, or supervising the contractor; employing the contractor for work that is inherently dangerous; and situations where the employer has a nondelegable duty.8 Here, the New Hampshire Supreme Court held that the duty to examine title was not nondelegable and therefore not governed by that exception to the rule against vicarious liability.
NONDELEGABLE DUTIES PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED IN NEW HAMPSHIRE
The New Hampshire Supreme Court does recognize some duties as nondelegable,9 although this issue of whether there are any nondelegable duties that lawyers owe their clients was a case of first impression in New Hampshire.10 The nondelegable duties that the New Hampshire Supreme Court has recognized are an employer's duty to maintain a safe workplace11 and the duty of a business owner to maintain safe premises.12
In Rounds v. Standex Intl., the court held that the employer's duty to maintain a safe workplace could not be delegated.13 Rounds was injured at work while operating a textile-rolling machine and brought a products liability action against the manufacturer's successor. After the New Hampshire Supreme Court invalidated a statute that barred actions against co-employees for non-intentional torts, Rounds amended his writ to add claims against four supervisory employees. The new defendants moved to dismiss the claims for failure to state a cause of action. The trial court granted the motion finding that the duty to maintain a safe workplace is nondelegable and that none of the defendants was Rounds' employer and thus owed him no duty. Rounds appealed, but the New Hampshire Supreme Court affirmed because "the employer's duty [to maintain a safe workplace] is nondelegable in that the employer cannot escape liability for breach ... by purporting to delegate to another the duty itself."14
Neither can a business owner delegate the duty to maintain safe premises for its invitees. In 1998 the New Hampshire Supreme Court adopted the business owner exception to the vicarious liability rule in Valenti v. Net Properties Mgt.15 In Valenti, the plaintiff broke her hip when she slipped and fell at the entryway to the Bedford Mall. An independent contractor had designed the mall's entryway for the defendant. Another independent contractor had been hired to maintain the entryway and floors. At trial the plaintiff alleged that the defendant was vicariously liable for the negligence of the independent contractors. After a verdict for the defendant the plaintiff argued on appeal that the trial court erred by instructing the jury that a business landowner may delegate its duty to maintain the safety of its premises. In reversing the trial court, the New Hampshire Supreme Court expressly adopted section 425 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, which subjects business premises owners to vicarious liability "for physical harm caused by the contractor's negligent failure to maintain the land ... in a reasonably safe condition."
Before Lawyer's Title ,New Hampshire had adopted only these two duties as nondelegable, neither involving the attorney-client relationship.
ATTORNEYS' NONDELEGABLE DUTIES RECOGNIZED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS
Courts in other jurisdictions have held that lawyers do owe certain nondelegable duties to clients, often arising out of various codes of professional responsibility.16 These nondelegable duties include the service of process,17 the duty to reasonably inquire into the facts and the law before signing a pleading,18 fiduciary responsibility for client trust accounts,19 the duty to preserve client funds,20 and general duties required by the rules of professional conduct.21
Service of Process
The Court of Appeals of New York decided in 1993 that an attorney has a nondelegable duty to exercise care in the service of process.22 In Kleeman v. Rheingold, the plaintiff came to defendant's office with a potential medical malpractice claim just five days before the statute of limitations would expire. The defendant prepared a summons and the complaint and delivered them to a process service agency, one the defendant regularly used, and instructed that the service be made "immediately." The trial court found that the agency, and not the defendant, chose the licensed process server who would serve the papers and directed how service would be made. The papers were served within the statutory period, but the process server had given them to the secretary rather than to the doctor himself. By the time this issue was resolved the statute of limitations had run and Kleeman had lost her cause of action against the doctor.
In the ensuing malpractice action the trial court granted summary judgment for defendants, concluding that the process server was an independent contractor and the defendant had no control over the way process was served. After a divided Appellate Division affirmed, the Court of Appeals modified by denying the defendant's summary judgment motion. It held that as attorneys for the plaintiff, the defendants had a nondelegable duty to her and could not evade that duty by employing the services of an independent contractor process server.
Most important to the Kleeman court's holding was New York's "extensive and comprehensive Code of Professional Responsibility that governs the obligations of attorneys to their clients[.]"23 The Code prohibits lawyers from "seek[ing], by contract or other means, to limit prospectively the lawyer's individual liability to a client for malpractice."24 The court stated that the average client and the public could reasonably perceive that everything connected with the implementation of a lawsuit, including service of process, would be done by the attorney or someone under his direction. Furthermore, even if the client was aware that process servers were used and that they were independent contractors, the client would not understand the legal significance of the attorney's immunity from liability. This immunity from liability would be "contrary to sound public policy."25
Client Funds
New Jersey has found nondelegable duties relating to client funds.26 In Matter of Stransky, the New Jersey Supreme Court suspended Attorney Stransky because he had turned over his bookkeeping functions to his wife, who then misappropriated over $32,000 from the trust account for her own use. Because he trusted his wife, Stransky failed to supervise his attorney (and personal) accounts and the misappropriations continued over several years. The Office of Attorney Ethics (OAE) was finally informed when Stransky overdrew his trust account. It was a year later, however, that Stransky learned of the misappropriations and his own temporary suspension from the Bar. Because his wife handled all the mail and telephone calls, she was able to keep her misappropriations and the notices of OAE proceedings from Stransky for a full year. In recommending a one-year suspension, the court found that Stransky "was completely irresponsible in the management of his attorney accounts and totally abdicated his fiduciary responsibilities to his clients for at least an entire year."27 These fiduciary duties were nondelegable.
REASONING IN LAWYERS TITLE V. GROFF
At trial, the court ruled that the duty to examine title was nondelegable both because the agency agreement contained a nondelegation provision and because the court found that the duty was essential to the representation of the lender. The New Hampshire Supreme Court reversed, concluding that the agency agreement expressly contemplated delegation and that the duty to examine title was not so essential to the representation that it became nondelegable.
The New Hampshire Supreme Court addressed the nondelegation provision first. The trial court found that the defendant could not delegate his contractual duty of "a careful title search" because the no "right, interest, or duty" arising under the agreement was delegable without the prior written consent of the other party.28 In reversing, the New Hampshire Supreme Court held that the contract specifically contemplated delegation of title searches and the defendant had only to exercise "due care and diligence" when he obtained reports that others prepared. The parties, had they intended that the defendant not delegate these tasks, could have provided for that in the agreement. The agreement also provided only for the defendant's liability for his own acts and omissions and not those of others. Again, the agreement could have easily provided otherwise if that was the intent of the parties.
As for the duty to examine title being an essential element of the representation, the Court reversed the trial court on policy grounds. Citing New York's decision in Kleeman, the Court stated that policy considerations would determine whether to categorize a duty as nondelegable. If the duty were classified as nondelegable, it would create an "unrealistic and undue liability channel not only with respect to the relationship of attorneys to [title abstractors] but, by analogous extension, also to many other relationships in which attorneys retain specialists and experts in the discharge of their professional obligations to clients."29 The Court emphasized that this nondelegability does not allow the attorney to escape liability simply by hiring an independent contractor to examine the title. The attorney would still be liable for his own negligence in hiring, supervising, or training the abstractor. Similarly the attorney could be liable for his own negligence in reviewing the abstractor's report or in rendering an opinion based on the report.
New Hampshire's Code of Professional Conduct is apparently no obstacle to an otherwise proper contract limiting liability for negligent performance of delegable duties. Rule 5.3, "Responsibilities Regarding Nonlawyer Assistants," while evidently intended to cover independent contractors30 is directed only to assuring that the nonlawyers comply with ethical requirements such as confidentiality. It would apply in a Stransky situation, but not in Lawyer's Title. Rule 1.8(h) prohibits an attorney from making an agreement "prospectively limiting the lawyer's liability to a client for malpractice. . . ."31 In Lawyers Title, the defendant did make an agreement that "prospectively limited his liability," but it was for the actions of others, not the lawyer's, and for an abstracting error, not malpractice. Because the agency agreement permitted the defendant to delegate the duty to abstract the title to an independent contractor, the defendant was not liable for the abstractor's error. In fact, the New Hampshire Supreme Court allowed the delegation to avoid the slippery slope of "open[ing] up an unrealistic and undue liability channel"32 that might extend to the other specialists and experts that an attorney retains to assist in the representation of clients.
ALLOCATING THE RISKS OF TITLE EXAMINATION
As a rule, agency law shields the principal from liability for an independent contractor's negligence.33 That can, of course, be varied by contract. So what will the effect of Lawyers Title be on agency agreements between the title insurance companies and the issuing attorneys? Will the title insurance companies now require indemnification clauses in the agreements, in case an abstractor overlooks something? Or will the title insurance companies prohibit delegation of these duties altogether and require consumers to pay increased costs necessarily passed on by the attorneys? The New Hampshire Supreme Court based its holding in large part on the equal sophistication and bargaining power of the parties to the agreement and the agreement's specific language contemplating the delegation of the abstracting work. But will attorneys agree to indemnify the title insurance company if the lawyer's independent contractor negligently overlooks a recorded encumbrance? Someone must bear this risk, but Lawyer's Title suggests it should not be the typical consumer who would be forced to pay higher fees if the lawyer cannot delegate particular duties to a contractor.
Much of the apparent difficulty stems from New Hampshire's common reliance on attorneys to secure abstracts, a system almost unique to New England.34 Outside New England "[a]ttorneys tend to emphasize that title search and title examination are separate functions,"35 a distinction implicit but not clearly stated in Lawyer's Title..36 In many states title insurance companies maintain their own title plants and do the abstracting in house..37 In some states abstracting is done by substantial independent businesses that are licensed, bonded, and often affiliated with title insurance companies. In such states the functions are clearly separated, with large economies of scale and low labor costs. The attorneys who write opinions do so on the basis of an abstract bought directly by the client from the abstractor, and they have no involvement at all with the work of the abstractor's employees.38 In the absence of a comparable system New Hampshire must deal with the fact that critical work is commonly performed by uninsured individuals who cannot cover the cost of mistakes that even the most capable and careful of them will sometimes make. A loss necessarily will fall on the attorney, the title insurance company, or the client. The title insurance companies are in the better position to spread the risk, but, given the way the work is typically organized in New Hampshire, the attorneys are in the better position to minimize it by selecting, training, and monitoring their abstractors. Informed clients with substantial business (lenders or developers) might accept some risk to reduce costs. The decision in Lawyer's Title simply leaves the matter to contracts among the parties rather than imposing it automatically on attorneys.
PROTECTION OF THE UNSOPHISTICATED CLIENT
Lawyers Title involved sophisticated parties to a detailed, written agency agreement, rather than an attorney and a typical lay client. What would the New Hampshire Supreme Court do in other circumstances? When a duty is delegable, the important questions are when and how is the delegation accomplished. An uninformed client will likely be protected by the law of apparent or ostensible agency which protects those who "justifiably rely upon the care or skill of [an] apparent agent ... [from] harm caused by the lack of care or skill of the one appearing to be a servant or other agent as if he were such."39 This well-established principle has been increasingly used against defendant hospitals relying on independent contractors for such 'in house' functions as anesthesiology or emergency rooms,40 but it is not limited to cases of physical injury.41 Some of the cases erect a presumption of reliance if there was no reason the plaintiff should have known of the independent contractor arrangement and the apparent principal failed to give meaningful notice of it.42 This doctrine, briefly mentioned as an alternative ground for decision in Kleeman43 would likely have given adequate protection to the clients for whom the New York Court of Appeals was concerned without prohibiting all contractual risk allocation. It was this concern which led New Hampshire's Court to reject nondelegability in favor of freedom of contract. So long as attorneys are obliged by the rules of apparent agency to give meaningful notice of the true status of those who appear to work for them, there seems little threat to the unsophisticated client.
OPEN QUESTIONS FOR THE LEGAL PROFESSION
The New Hampshire Supreme Court would probably find that service of process and control of client trust funds are nondelegable duties because decisions so holding were cited favorably in Lawyer's Title. What other duties, if any, the Court might hold to be nondelegable is uncertain, but the tone of the opinion suggests a reluctance to invoke the doctrine.
The few attorney duties held to be nondelegable in other states are activities for which reasonable clients would almost certainly expect personal responsibility absent some specific notice and agreement. Outside that core is a gray area of lawyerly activity (such as abstracting title records or financial planning) where an attorney seeking the benefits (and possible savings to the client) of delegation will risk a finding of apparent agency unless clear disclosures and agreements are made. With some contracted services, presumably those of most expert witnesses and consultants, claims of apparent agency will be implausible whether or not the attorney makes a specific disclosure. However, absent further litigation or new provisions or interpretations of the Code of Professional Conduct, there is no clear boundary. While a lay client might be held to expect the independence and separate responsibility of non-legal expert consultants and witnesses, it could be argued that it is easy to mention them and disclaim liability for their possible negligence in a retainer agreement. Not all experts supply clearly non-legal services, as the endless arguments over alleged boundaries between law and accounting demonstrate. There are also other ways around the independent contractor rule. Even with clearly non-legal experts, their selection might be imprudent. Must a lawyer inquire into their financial resources? The New Hampshire Supreme Court now tacitly mandates (for all practical purposes) malpractice insurance for lawyers by requiring disclosure to clients if the lawyer does not maintain a minimum level of insurance.44 If an attorney hires an independent contractor without insurance (or assets to pay a claim) would that constitute negligent entrustment? While such an argument was not raised in Lawyer's Title ,it is predictable , yet its logic would have the same cost implications that led the Court to reject nondelegability.
CONCLUSION
The New Hampshire Supreme Court correctly held that abstracting a title was not the attorney's nondelegable duty because the sophisticated parties in Lawyer's Title had entered into an agreement that permitted delegation (with the consent of the other party) and that did not require indemnification by the attorney-defendant. This will presumably stimulate efforts by attorneys and insurance companies to clarify and allocate the risks of loss in title examinations. The homebuyer (the public) in Lawyer's Title was not harmed and was not a party to the lawsuit. In a case like Kleeman, though, where an uninformed client loses her cause of action or property because of the independent contractor's negligence, the New Hampshire Supreme Court will likely invoke the apparent agency rule to uphold reasonable public expectations.

Fran Whitaker, Class of 2004, Franklin Pierce Law Center,Online Reading and Direct Downloads
Direct download sites have always existed; sites like Tidwah and Squiggle-Manga have been around since 2004, and NarutoFan, one of the biggest Naruto download sites, was launched in 2003. StopTazmo, NarutoFan's "arch-nemesis," has also been operating since 2004. However, usage of direct download sites was low during the first and second generations of scanlation. Most groups protected their "work product" and wanted manga fans to come to their IRC channels or websites in order to get their scanlations.
Between 2006 and 2007, a new wave of direct download sites came into existence. These sites were popular among those new to scanlation because of how easy they made it to download scanlations. By 2007, some of the more popular download sites included Mangadownload, StopTazmo, and Manga Traders. While most download sites existed in harmony and maintained friendly relations, there have always been "battles" between download sites like NarutoFan and Bleach Exile, both of which charged a fee for manga downloads, and the rest of the community.
Another big change that took place in the scanlation scene in the late-2000s was the rise of online reading sites. Similar to online streaming video sites like YouTube, the existence of these online reading sites meant that users no longer had to download scanlations at all, but could instead read their favorite series online without having to worry about slow Internet connections or learning to use IRC. By 2008, some of the largest online reading sites included OneManga, Manga Fox, and MangaToshokan, while sites like MangaHelpers and MangaShare, which primarily offered downloads, began launching their own online readers as well.
These sites usually received millions of visitors a day and ran on money made from advertisements or donations. Because fans could now read scanlations online without going to a group's website or IRC channel, many established groups, especially older groups, began seeing fewer and fewer people visiting their IRC channels and forums. As a result, opportunities to recruit new staff members became rare. As older staff members moved on with their lives, many older groups found themselves struggling to stay alive. Meanwhile, small speedscan groups, which were structured in a fundamentally different way than bigger groups, found the online reading sites to be a good venue to expand their popularity and influence. This led to its own problems, as pointed out by an interview with cnet128 from MangaHelpers in early 2008:
SleepyFans and OneManga have been pet hates of mine for a long while, for variants on the same reason. SleepyFans because they have a tendency to release before anyone else even has the RAWs; I'm not too fussed because they're not terrible quality, but it still bugs me. It would bug me a lot more if they did it on a series where I actually care about people using/reading my translations. And OneManga because thanks to their practice of uploading and keeping the first scanlation that comes out of any given chapter, they basically serve as an archive of all the worst scanlations available of a series. It annoys me, is all. With Lord knows how many people going there for their manga fix, you'd think they could at least try to provide quality material.
Prior to 2007, manga fans usually had to visit IRC or many group websites in order to obtain and read scanlations. By 2007, virtually all releases were available on readers and most were easily downloaded from aggregating sites such as MangaHelpers. This shift has further changed the impetus towards rapid release for Shounen Jump manga; groups openly compete to be the first to release.
However, part of the scanlation community still resided on IRC, which remained harder to navigate and made some groups harder to track for most outsiders. The Lurk network, an IRC manga archive started by VicariousLurker around 2005, became the largest manga IRC channel ever. By 2007, Lurk hosted one of the largest databases of scanlations available for download, with the number of people in its IRC channel rivaling that of the visitors to #MangaProject and #ShoujoMagic combined. When online reading sites grew popular in the late-2000s, however, the number of visitors to Lurk fell.
Despite the community's initial resistance to online reading sites, by 2008 online readers were accepted by most as a normal facet of the scanlation community. Online reading sites like OneManga, community sites like MangaHelpers, and database sites like MangaUpdates have replaced large groups and release trackers as the center of the scanlation community.Search:

This is a very cool tip. Of course, if you're happy with viewing the logs in the Terminal, you just shell in and tail the log.
Here's a few related tips:
Put the local copy of the log in
~Library/Logs/Remote
If the log doesn't get updated frequently, you can use Console's alert features (see "Console...Preferences") - either bounce the icon in the dock or bring the window to the front when an event is logged.
Console's filter feature is good - type a word in the title bar, and only matching lines will be displayed. Unfortunately, all log updates will trigger the alerts - not just matching lines.
If you want to be alerted to specific events (like a rejection in a mail log), then use a command like this in conjunction with Console's alert features:
ssh mailserver "tail -f /var/exim/log/exim_smtp_mainlog" | grep 'rejected' >> Library/Logs/Remote/mailserver.smtp.log
Only matching lines will be put into the local copy. You can use egrep to do sophisticated pattern matching, if you like. For example:
ssh mailserver "tail -f /var/exim/log/exim_smtp_mainlog" | egrep -i 'apple|banana' >> Library/Logs/Remote/mailserver.smtp.log
will match lines containing either apple or banana, with case insensitivity.

“I wouldn’t have the money, or the food stamps. I’m already out of my food stamps already. That’s why I said, “Thank God for Manna,” because I wouldn’t have a Thanksgiving without them,” said Laurie Sanborn of Bangor.
Fundraising efforts brought in donations.
“We went out and bought the turkeys, now we’re giving them to agencies and individuals,” said Bill Rae, Executive Director of Manna Ministries.
Manna will be giving out about 6,800 turkeys this year.
Around 350 signed up to get dinners on Monday and Tuesday.
“It’s an unbelievable blessing to see the people’s faces as they walk out of here with potatoes, all the fixings that go with it, and a big turkey to take home and have dinner with it,” said Rae.
Across town at the Bangor Mall, radio personalities Mike Dow and Mike Elliot are collecting food for Manna to help get folks fed beyond the holidays.
It’s a tradition they started a very long time ago.
“It’s the 15th year that we’ve rolled this truck into the parking lot to collect food for Manna Ministries,” said Elliott.
“Yes, last year the food that came to this food drive lasted throughout the winter into the first part of spring, and we’re hoping for a repeat of that success,” said Dow.
They’ll be collecting food until Wednesday night at 6.Ex-IBM employee wins reprieve over contempt fine

Games like Crysis 3, Lost Planet 3, Halo 4 and Medal of Honor: Warfighter were shown and exclusive every person that wanted to, was capable to play these games, awesome ! Of course there are also other games like Borderlands 2 and Dirt Showdown but these were not exclusive. </b></p> <p> </p> <p><b>So let's begin with the Crysis 3 singleplayer demo:<br /></b></p> <p><b><img src="" border="0" alt="" /></b></p> <p>After waiting a long time in a queue I finally made it into the gaming room of Crysis 3, as well as on the picture the sorrounding in the game is a jungle. Actually this is a former city but with time and a so called ''crysis'' all this became covered by plants, buildings are looking filthy but also part of the jungle, this is the real concrete jungle. The graphics are looking sweet as allways and plaing on pc is a real eyecatcher. The sound is tight, you can make a difference from sound sources near you and what is far away from you, birds that are singing you can hear from far but you can also hear if danger is getting closer. </p> <p>So, you start in the middle of nowhere, in this gigantic jungle, the controls are explained to you and with a group of ''tangos'', actually CELL-soldiers, you can show if you know the manuals right away. After a long firefight you realize that the enemies are very clever. Hostiles do know when you attempt to fire at them and take cover. Even though the AI of the enemies where not done yet because this was an alpha-code version(preversion) the hostiles acted clever and logical.</p> <p> While moving forward through the jungle you notice more resistance, also using your invisibility power is not persuading the hostiles to let you pass through, they also use their ears to track you, just like in Crysis 2. As i come closer to my actual target I find more and more weapons, also 2 new weapons right away, one of them is some sort of futuristic P90, shooting with the highest firerate I've ever seen, about 70rounds/sec. Aside from that also the new key weapon, the compound bow is in your arsenal, his shot is an instant kill and by the green light at the end of the arrow you can collect your arrows in after killing a hostile. </p> <p>Arriving at my target area I am trying to take down a reactor, with the nanosuit the protagonist, who was not mentioned, is ripping the factory with his bare hands apart. Of course this made some hostiles curious and waves of enemies are heading towards you, by fleeing from them and planting c4 right at the center of the facility a cut scene kicks in, you destroyed a CELL-base, demo ends. </p> <p><b>Opinion: </b>New areas, new weapons and the good old nanosuit are keeping the game fresh but enemies like CELL, the abilities of the nanosuit shown in the demo, heading from point A to B stayed the same. For sure this game will divide the newbies from the vets of the game but the deeper meaning stayed the same because in the series there is allways a ''Crysis''. </p> <p> </p> <p><b>Halo 4 Multiplayer Demo: </b></p> <p><img src="" border="0" alt="" /></p> <p>Also Halo 4 joined the line-up and with the master chief in front of the gaming tent i felt welcome to step in, in order to join the system link party. Right away you are divided in the well known ''Red vs. Blue''. Before the match starts you can customize your loadouts and armour, from attachments for firerate and damage to the costumization of your armour you can individualize your character. In terms of gameplay not much has changed, the developers know that the controls are compact and so they just augmented the manuals by e.g. adding a sprint-button, which was so desperately wished by a lot of gamers. The graphics look like taken from Halo Reach mixed with Halo 3 but there is definately a progress. Also a well known map from Halo 3 crossed my eye, which was a glad surprise for me. </p> <p><b>Opinion: </b>Of course it is hard to judge a game by its multiplayer but still I think the developers are making a progress, moving into the right direction by keeping their traditions in terms of gameplay, maps, weapons and game modes but also trying to add something new that is creating a fresh experience everytime.</p> <p>Sadly I couldn't manage to play the Lost Planet 3 demo as well as the AC3 and Far Cry 3 demo due to queue waiting-time over 1 hour per game, propably I would have been ending up in a closed games convention sitting in until next year.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><b>Game City opinion:</b></span></p> <p>In the end the Game City 2012 was sure a great success for the hosts, also for gamers like me it was an opportunity to reach the highlight games of the present industry. Something that I am realizing from year to year is that companies are using the Game City as a place to advertise, ending up as a festivity that has more merchandise than visitors. Good thing there were also talking sessions in different areas of the facility in which people discussed the effect of videogames on kids and adults. A lot of studies were presented and arguments were exchanged, so the Game City not only became a place of gaming but also a place of consideration.</p><div style="clear:both;"></div><img src="" width="1" height="1">xXBourne07Xx up -Vienna GAME CITY 2012(12th-14th October)/blogs/members/b/xxbourne07xx_blog/archive/2012/10/10/coming-up-vienna-game-city-2012-12th-14th-october.aspx2012-10-10T09:46:56Z2012-10-10T09:46:56Z<p><img src="" border="0" alt="" /></p> <p>Finally ! The Vienna Game City 2012 is getting closer each day and with this also new information towards the video game industry and its plans. It is not sure what games will be shown but as allways at the game city previews from EA and Ubisoft are expected, e.g. a possible Assassins Creed 3 mutiplayer demo like they've shown last year with AC: Revelations.

There are Jake Muller, Chris Redfield and Leon Kennedy, each following a different story. Every character has his own style of fighting, his own style of progressing, his own fate. </p> <p>Jake Mullers' fate is propably the most interesting, as the only one of his kind he barries the antidote of the new umbrella virus in him and with this Jake is maybe the only hope to stop the Javo-virus from spreading across the world. From the demo not much is known of his heritage but he must be related to somebody important due to the fact he has the antidote. </p> <p>Chris Redfield, also known from RE5, is once againg acting in the name of BSAA. Together with his army he is trying to destroy any kind of BOW. While he is faced with fear of loosing his brothers in arms the threat of an upcoming new virus is getting bigger and Chris only has one chance saving the world. </p> <p>Leon Kennedy, in comparison to the other characters, is not trying to forfill a certain mission, he is propably the person that is set out the most danger by looking only from one hint after another until he gets to his goal.</p> <p> </p> <p><b>Story: </b>In comparison to the first made games a lot has changed relating to the story, it reminds much more of Resident Evil 5 but with the integration of Leon Kennedy the series has got a bit of its ''horror-factor'' back. There are 3 story lines of each character making through different scenarios and propably in the end they all are going to be connected.Fact is that a new virus is tested in Republic Edonia by Umbrella, the only chance to stop this is Jake Muller. People who are infected become ''Javo'o'', infected creatures who are capable of fighting, mutating into other forms and making strategic decisions. </p> <p><b>Gameplay: </b>In terms of gameplay a lot has changed, fights are much more dynamic with the new cover system, dodging and firefights. Also new weaponry is showing up as well as close quaters techniques. While Chris is handling too close enemies with his hulk-alike arms Jake is relying on muay thai knee strikes and simple submissions. Also interacting with your enviroment is necessary to climp up leaders or to help your partner getting on higher platforms for example. </p> <p><b>Ergo: </b>A lot of things have changed, to the positive actually, the atmosphere has become darker, the gameplay is much smoother and interactive and the character are outstanding. Must have for every RE fan !!!</p><div style="clear:both;"></div><img src="" width="1" height="1">xXBourne07Xx -fiction or near future ?/blogs/members/b/xxbourne07xx_blog/archive/2012/09/17/syndicate-fiction-or-near-future.aspx2012-09-17T08:22:00Z2012-09-17T08:22:00Z<p><img src="" border="0" alt="" /></p> <p><b>In the world of Syndicate economy and progressing technology are words of big meaning. Companies have united to build enforcements strong enough to make governments and any sort of democracy disappear</b>. <b>Neurotechnology is very important due to the fact that one half of the population is chipped which garantues certain advantages: entertainment, food and health care from the company you support.</b> <b>Controlling those thousands of people you're an company agent named Miles Kilo, enabled to hack into the desired target. Now the question is :,,Are there any possibilities that this could happen in the future ?''.</b></p> <p>Fact is that companies are already trying to avoid countries' laws, they allways tried. Of course there are terms like ''lobbying'' but if you want to act global, which is the most profitable strategy, you have to expand and outsource in order to avoid certain taxes and laws. A similarity is seen in the game due to ''Cayman global'' which is relating to the cayman islands, nowadays a depot for money from companies in order to cover their tax billing tracks.</p> <p>With financial crysis and countries loosing their validity there's no doubt that economy rules over policy and not in the opposite but the real persons that have to suffer from it are the citizens. People who are working hard, supporting their company but actually not getting a ''piece of the cake''. The possibility that companies will unite and build a group that has power beyond governments is only pressured by the fact that the variety of companies has to be large due to trade rivalry which is making the economy grow. So in the end economy only gets his power from trading and pocessing a certain spectrum of products and services.</p> <p>Relating to the neural implanted chips in the game companies in the real world have found better strategies to persuade people to buy their products, it's called marketing. Marketing is not just asking somebody if he would like to buy your goods, it is about involving consumers in their everyday-life, making them believe that people need your product. This happens on all kinds of areas, television, social media plattforms, internet in general and on the streets. By using certain advertisement strategies, slogans and jingles companies are working their way to your subconsciousness. Also consuming is a big issue nowadays, generations of consumers are raised up from the companies' side to support them, products that are dedicated to the younger generation is like an insurance guaranteing that consumption and with this their power is not going down. </p> <p>Another sad fact is that people like Miles Kilo do exist in real life, of course without all the neurotechnological stuff and the killings but there are persons called ''economic hitmen'' . Those persons are hired by companies to raise capital but also to manipulate the economy itself which is resulting in huge loss of money for other companies. Economic hitmen don't kill people with their own hands but they're making the rich people richer and the poor people poorer by investing and transfering money in certain companies. Not only economic hitmen but also industrial espionage is an issue that is neverending. Almost every company has a certain technology, shortened said ''know-how'' which is feeding the hostiles with greed. Those enterprises get active and begin to steal know-how by infiltrating or sometimes, without much effort, stealing important intel. </p> <p>Even though we have institutions like the IWF or the WTO companies are free to do whatever they want and if there won't be any kind of more controlling the processes inside the concerns it could be someday that companies are overruling governments by simply controlling the money of the state.</p> <p> </p><div style="clear:both;"></div><img src="" width="1" height="1">xXBourne07Xx gaming weekend (31st of August - 2nd of September 2012) this week: Sleeping Dogs Demo/blogs/members/b/xxbourne07xx_blog/archive/2012/09/01/my-gaming-weekend-31st-of-august-2nd-of-september-2012-this-week-sleeping-dogs-demo.aspx2012-09-01T18:54:21Z2012-09-01T18:54:21Z<p><img src="" border="0" alt="" /></p> <p><b>Sometimes games get cancelled, sometimes they've been forgotten butSleeping Dogs is an exception. Sleeping dogs should have never published but United Front got the rights for the game and made a great deal out of it. Now Sleeping Dogs is a title for itself and proves that the game industry is also making wrong decisions when it comes to cancelling games. </b></p> <p>You play Wei Shen, an undercover cop who is trying to infiltrate the Triads in Hong Kong. Throughout the story you have to keep the balance beetween being a cop and being a triad member, by making decisions you either support one or the other side. </p> <p> </p> <p>The demo starts right in the middle of the action, you're working for Winston and something happened that is ruining his business, you've got to find someone called Ming and make him pay. After walking around a few seconds you find Ming, a chase starts, you run after him until you reach a group of his goons. This is where the combat-system is getting in the play, by simply pressing a buttin you knock your opponents to the ground or paralyze them ( depending on which combo you activate) you can also grab your enemy and throw them to the ground or into an object ( like a rail or a dumbster). </p> <p>After successfully beating Ming you get caught by the police. Gladly your boss gets into the department and releases you ( because you're an undercover cop, right ?!), after that you go back to Winston and he's goin' insane ! He wants to kill every person who is involved in his business but Wei has a better idea, let's find those guys and make them pay(again). After fighting some bad guys you get to know a new enemy type, the graplers, resistent to wrestling moves but weak in terms of kickboxing. When you've taken them down you learn how to disarm and how to shoot. You can even take an enemy as a shield to protect yourself from bullets, at least until your hostage gets killed. When you found your target person you will use him as a shield as well and get out of the building, this is where another bunch of policemen are trying to arrest you and the complex is blowing up, the demo ends.</p> <p>To wrap it up: Sleeping Dogs has his right to excist, it is a good open world game with nice fight sequences, shooting and a complex story with compelling characters. Sometimes it of course reminds you of GTA4 but the game stands for itself. In terms of the demo I think you can check out a lot except the driving sequences which are essential too. Nevertheless Sleeping Dogs is a nice told story and in my opinion worth its money !</p><div style="clear:both;"></div><img src="" width="1" height="1">xXBourne07Xx Dawnguard review + trailer and analysis of 2. DLC Hearthfire/blogs/members/b/xxbourne07xx_blog/archive/2012/08/31/skyrim-dawnguard-review-trailer-and-analysis-of-2-dlc-hearthfire.aspx2012-08-31T01:31:00Z2012-08-31T01:31:00Z<p><img src="" border="0" alt="" /></p> <p><b>Over 2 weeks have passed since the first DLC for TES:Skyrim came out on XBOX360 (important to mention that allmost all DLCs will come out first for XBOX360 due to a special contract beetween Microsoft and Bethesda). Finally I got enough money and time to afford in order to test Dawnguard, which was promised to be an overwhelming expansion but you know what they say: Don't judge a dovahkiin by his shouts. </b></p> <p><br />Right after I downloaded the expansion for 1.600 MS on xbox live I was ready to play Dawnguard, but here's the thing: ''What side shall I play for ? The Dawnguard, which is running around with axes, crossbows and even little magical made suns, looking they're ready to make your day brighter. And there are the vampires, actually its a vampire sect, if you decide to fight for the vampires you'll be able to transform into a vampire lord, which is a really nice way to go for lunch, meaning to terrorize whiterun and instead of eating ham and eggs or pancakes the citizens' nutricious blood is your prefered meal.'' </p> <p>Anyway, there are pros and cons for each side, while creating bolts for your crossbows and even creating this new weapon itself is available if you join the dawnguard this functions becomes unavailable if you join the vampires. </p> <p>The story begins only with a hint of a guard that the mystical ''Dawnguard'' is looking for a few members, after getting to know each other you find yourself with Serana that is leading you towards the vampires that are having a fantastical plan to make the world their own. At this point you can decide yourself for each fraction. both of them have really good quests and with this no fraction has been disregarded from the developers. </p> <p> The end of the expansion is actually really satisfying and also a few surprises are sure, even if you done the main quests of the expansion there are also new side quests for you that you even get a achievement/trophy for. </p> <p>NEW FEATURES: new main questline, new sidequests, crafting of crossbows, bolts, dragonbone-weapons and new jewelry, also new armour from both fractions and the vampire lord shape. </p> <p>To wrap it up: In my opinion the DLC is definately worth purchasing it, it might not be as big as shivering isles in the game before(TES4: Oblivion) but due to the size content it is almost same. </p> <p> </p> <p><b>Now let us move on to the upcoming DLC ''Hearthfire'':</b></p> <p>A few days ago the trailer went up in the net and everyone got excited, especially the xbox360 owners as they have the first turn in this expansion. Actually Hearthfire is not a real expansion as you think, actually more like a tool-kit.</p> <p>(Please visit the site to view this media)</p> <p>Actually the trailer speeks for itself, building your own house, inviting women with mud in their face, adopting children and yelling at skeevers in your house ! As said the expansion will be out the 4th of september and watch out you don't miss my upcoming review about Hearthfire, in the meantime: learn how to fight skeevers, make up a kindergarden or become father and don't get an architect, because he would mess up your house, by the nine !</p> <p> </p><div style="clear:both;"></div><img src="" width="1" height="1">xXBourne07Xx gaming weekend (10th-12th of August 2012) this week: Battlefield: Bad Compay/blogs/members/b/xxbourne07xx_blog/archive/2012/08/12/my-gaming-weekend-10th-12th-of-august-2012-this-week-battlefield-bad-compay.aspx2012-08-12T14:59:00Z2012-08-12T14:59:00Z<p><img src="" border="0" alt="" /></p> <p><b>With this weeks' edition of MGW I am proud to present you a game that is unique in its humor and gameplay at the same time. Battlefield: Bad Company set the tone</b> <b>for shooters which don't just have weapon elements but also social relationships in the game.</b></p> <p>The four protagonists in the game are creating some sort of vibe, after playing a few levels you are really getting to know your teammates and with this also the feeling of<b> </b>companionship is spreading. </p> <p>You are playing as Preston Marlowe and you get thrown into the B-Company because of a reason you don't even know. The B-Company, also known as the ''Bad Company'' is the place where the worst soldiers in the army get commanded in. As Marlowe you are forced into a squad with Haggard, Sweetwater and your Seargant but just call him ''Sarge''. Haggard is a true master of explosives and shotguns and loves to blow up things, also army equipment, which is why he is in the b-company. Sweetwater is a technical specialist, he hacked an army computer, this is why he got in here. Sarge is the only person that hasn't done anything, he has been promised to be retired after this mission and he is a big fan of fishing by the way.</p> <p>In the beginning you don't even know who you fight until you see russian soldiers shooting at you and screaming when you hit them. With your health-injector, your electronical vehicle repair unit and your weapon you are ready for the battlefield. After a few fighting scenarios you notice that your enemies are as allmost tough as you are(talking about hard-mode), with this precise shooting is a must. But not only assault rifles and grenades are the arsenal you are capable of firing towards your enemy, also LMGs on vehicles and weapon stations with big penetrating power. </p> <p>Within the story there are a lot of twists and turns because there are not only the russians as enemies but also another fraction. Also a big secret is going to get discovered by the infernal squad which is testing their companionship.</p> <p>In the end Battlefield:Bad Company is both, an entertaining shooter with serious gunplay elements and also a game with a sense of humor and persons with outstanding characters that have never been seen before in shooter games.</p><div style="clear:both;"></div><img src="" width="1" height="1">xXBourne07Xx gaming weekend (3rd-5th of August 2012) this week: Max Payne 3 Single+Multiplayer/blogs/members/b/xxbourne07xx_blog/archive/2012/08/04/my-gaming-weekend-3rd-5th-of-august-2012-this-week-max-payne-3-single-multiplayer.aspx2012-08-04T03:40:00Z2012-08-04T03:40:00Z<p><img src="" border="0" alt="" /></p> <p><b>''Tempus fugit'' was the motto Max Payne-fans were thinking about all the the years that have passed until the third and final chapter of the Max Payne series was released.</b> <b>Now back with a load of new villians, weapons, a brilliant multiplayer and a new story location, Sao Paulo, or as Max calls it:''like Bagdad wit G-Strings'', Max Payne says goodbye with a big bang. </b></p> <p><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">SINGLEPLAYER</span></b></p> <p>As I mentioned before your main story location is Sao Paulo, this city has two faces, on the one side rich, happy and a lot of hospitality. On the other side Sao Paulo contains a lot of Favelas(Slums) where poor people live without supply , drugs are pushed, gangs are ruling and special forces are trading with criminals. Max Payne of course notices this contrariness and decides to live with it, he is working for the Branco family as a bodyguard and goes through hell during his visiting. Sometimes his living in Sao Paulo effects him so much that he has some sort of flashbacks. </p> <p><img src="" border="0" alt="" /></p> <p>The graphics are really smooth and the gameplay feels tight. Ye olde Bullet time and shootdodging are back and feel as awesome as allways also a slow motion is kicking in when you are about to kill the last guy in a firefight. Upon that the story has a lot of twists and turns, so in the end a lot of tentioning moments are for sure. Aside from that also alot of weapons are available reaching from shotguns to rocket launchers, also melee attacks are possible. New single player modes like Score Attack (in which you have to earn points for killing) and One Minute in New York (you start off with one minute, extra time for killing, if the clock hits zero you're dead) are ensuring new action. With these modes not only fun but also rewards are granted, for achieving platin medals in the two modes you get to play new characters in the multiplayer. </p> <p> </p> <p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><b>MULTIPLAYER</b></span></p> <p>Online gaming has never been such systematically structured, there are different modes, different crews, different weapons, classes and characters and even a mode for rookies. When I first played the multiplayer I was fascinated and shocked at the same time, the grace, movements and even the features were working the same way as in the singleplayer. What shocked me were the overpowered sniper rifles and dual-wielded opponents that semmed to be invincible in the beginning. But with patience and a lot of experience points I began to understand: Max Payne 3 multiplayer has his own rythm and if you decide to follow this rythm you have success.</p> <p><img src="" border="0" alt="" /></p> <p> The good thing about the multiplayer is that everyone can hit anybody, noone is untouchable, especially in the Deathmatch-mode you notice that and if someone is annoying you all the time because of weird headset-talking or killing you all the time just start a vendetta against him. Apart from that also own crews, bursts, equipment and customizable characters are making sure that individuality doesn't get lost. There are 50 ranks and after that 5 legend levels, with enough XP you are promoted to the next rank, which can set free all kinds of things for the multiplayer, like weapons, bursts or character sets. </p> <p>My conclusion is that Max Payne seemed to change at a first view, but as I told before Sao Paulo is a city with two faces and with this the appearances are deceptive. The final chapter of the series is bloody as the others, old features are still used, Max Payne's comments ironic as allways and an amazing multiplayer are making this game a festivity for all Max Payne fans.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><b>ALERT!!!CREW MEMBERS FOR OWN CREW SEARCHED!!!ALERT</b></span></p> <p><b>SINCE A FEW DAYS A FRIEND OF MINE, XBOXLIVE GAMERTAG: SpeedFire2k10 HAS DECIDED TO TEAM UP WITH ME AND BUILD A CREW ON THE SOCIALCLUB OF ROCKSTARGAMES.COM IF YOU ARE AN XBOX360 OWNER AND INTERESTED IN JOINING OUR MAX PAYNE 3 CREW JUST SEND US A MESSAGE OR REGISTER AT THE SOCIALCLUB AND SEND A CREW-REQUEST CREW NAME: Unlimited Play<br /></b></p><div style="clear:both;"></div><img src="" width="1" height="1">xXBourne07Xx gaming weekend (13.-15. of april 2012) this week: Mass Effect 3 Multiplayer /blogs/members/b/xxbourne07xx_blog/archive/2012/04/15/my-gaming-weekend-13-15-of-april-2012-this-week-mass-effect-3-multiplayer.aspx2012-04-15T16:25:00Z2012-04-15T16:25:00Z<p><img src="" border="0" alt="" /></p> <p>Hello and Welcome to another edition of MGW, this week we are looking at Mass Effect 3.

There are 5 different types of weapons, assault rifles, sniper rifles, heavy pistols, SMGs and shotguns. Also modifications can be purchased and integrated into each weapon. </p> <p><b>Generally all alien races, weapons and modifications can be purchased through the packs, the better the pack is, the better are the chances to get rare equipment. </b></p> <p>Actually there is only one mode you can play through, the enemy-wave-mode. there are 10 waves of enemies you have to survive, throughout this waves you have to accomplish objectives to move on to the next wave. with each kill, each wave and each successfull exfiltration(at the end of the 10 waves) you earn XP and Credits. With the XP you are enabled to unlock and upgrade your abilities, with credits you can buy packs. </p> <p><b>Galaxy at War feature:</b> If you are playing you will get across the Galaxy at War-graphic, it means that you are supporting the effective military strength in the single player mode by playing the multiplayer. </p> <p><b>Multiplayer match settings: </b>Fortunately there are about 10 maps you can choose from, there are three types of enemies: Cerberus, Geth and Reaper. Apart from that you can also choose the difficulty by choosing bronze, silver or gold. </p> <p><b>In result the multiplayer mode is a lot of fun, choosing your favourite race, class and weapons are enabling you to do whatever you want. Disadvantage: You can't choose a race or weapons properly, even though you'd have the amount of credits the way you get your characters are depending on luck. Apart from that I've made very often the experience on xbox 360 that you are getting kicked out of a match by your ''team mates'' easily if you have a lower level character, which is quite ironic due to the fact that you can't develop a character without playing. In my opinion even though the amount of maps, enemies, characters and weapons, as well as the shortly anounced resurgence pack, bioware can't hide the fact that there is actually only one mode: the enemy-wave-mode. With this I hope the producers just used the original mp as base to advance it.</b></p> <p><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">As well as last time also with the ME3 MP you can join me in the battle against the bad boys on xbox360, my gamertag:</span> LichtSharif <br /></b></p> <p><b><br /></b></p><div style="clear:both;"></div><img src="" width="1" height="1">xXBourne07Xx gaming weekend (6.-9. of march 2012) this week: Sniper Ghost Warrior/blogs/members/b/xxbourne07xx_blog/archive/2012/04/06/my-gaming-weekend-6-9-of-march-2012-this-week-sniper-ghost-warrior.aspx2012-04-06T17:45:00Z2012-04-06T17:45:00Z<p><img src="" border="0" alt="" /></p> <p>Hello and welcome to another edition of MGW, for this week I've chosen Sniper: Ghost Warrior. Why ? Because it was a cheap buy and it seemed to be cool. But after playing the game I noticed that it is more than that. </p> <p>Throughout the game you mostly play as Tyler Wells, codename: Razor Six-Four. He is a special trained sniper,so Tyler is able to sneak through large territories without being seen and also has great abilities in terms of sniping. The most of the story is set in the jungle in which Razor Six-Four tries to crash the regime of a local dictator. The graphics are sweet but sometimes even dozen leafs are concealing your sight. In terms of gameplay I would give this game a 8 out of 10, due to the story of a sniper you have to sneak through passages, eliminate targets and give supportive fire for alliance troops. The silenced MK22, a silenced sniper rifle, cqc knife, throwing knifes and a rope are your equipment and over the game you learn how to handle them well. Another important feature is the ''Bullet Cam'', if you aim with your rifle exactly at the head of an enemy and pull the trigger the bullet cam mostly kicks in, with this you can see your bullet flying in slow motion out of your rifle right into the head of your enemy.</p> <p><img src="" border="0" alt="" /></p> <p>Never the less City Interactive, the developer studio, could have put more effort into the story concerning to the depth of the characters, not much is known about Razor Six-Four and how he feels, he seems like every usual elite sniper and could be replaced easily. Apart from that the story's end is abrupt, which is quite a pity. </p> <p>The multiplayer of the game is well done but hasn't been promoted enough from the developers side, often empty servers are the reality and with this also the multiplayer seems to be boring sometimes. The fact that you have a camouflage and the plant covered maps you allways have to watch your back and look twice at a spot before you move on, with this also the feeling of success is shooting through your body when you kill an enemy. </p> <p><b>ERGO: </b>Sniper Ghost Warrior is a well made game with all a sniper needs. Even though the potential hasn't been pushed to the limit this game is a shining example for all sniper games and is a nice part in the Sniper series.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><b>Since I've bought Sniper Ghost Warrior I am a passioned multiplayer participant and would be very delighted I've you'd join the fight on the XBOX360, my gamertag: LichtSharif</b></span></p><div style="clear:both;"></div><img src="" width="1" height="1">xXBourne07Xx's Creed III: The Mohawk Vision/blogs/members/b/xxbourne07xx_blog/archive/2012/04/02/assassin-39-s-creed-iii-the-mohawk-vision.aspx2012-04-02T20:34:00Z2012-04-02T20:34:00Z<p><img src="" border="0" alt="" /></p> <p>A new Assassin's Creed game, a new hero, his name: Connor, also called Ratohnaketon.

Because of his convictions he thinks the assassins are the perfect unit to furfill his goal, to protect the territory of his tribe and ensure also the survival of it. </p> <p>Mohawk means roughly translated: flintstoneowners, their language is also called Mohawk and shows similarities to other local tribes. Due to this the Mohawk tribe has joined an agreement in the 16th century in which several tribes with the similar language united to a iroquois-league. The central task of this league was to make peace beetween the tribes and even until today this law of great peace is applying. </p> <p>From 1710 until the end of the American Revolution the Mohawks and the British had an alliance, their enemies were the french and then the americans. 1783 the Mohawk tribe had to flee from the state New York to Canada.

Suddenly I saw it, an evidence that could lead to the next game's location. </p> <p>In his diary Cicero writes about the dark brotherhood and the mother of the night. In one paragraph he also talks about the different locations of the dark brotherhood, one is in Cheydinal, one in Skyrim(Outpost) and one in Elsweyr. </p> <p>So Elsweyr, homeland of the Kjajiit could be the next location due to the fact that we allready had the other two locations in a game.</p><div style="clear:both;"></div><img src="" width="1" height="1">xXBourne07Xx gaming weekend (09.-11. march 2012), This week: Assassins Creed/blogs/members/b/xxbourne07xx_blog/archive/2012/03/10/my-gaming-weekend-09-11-march-2012-this-week-assassins-creed.aspx2012-03-10T09:20:00Z2012-03-10T09:20:00Z<p><img src="" border="0" alt="" /></p> <p><b>Ciao, dia duit, konnochi wa, bounjour, shalom, hallo, salam and hello to another edition of MGW, this weeks edition will be all about the mysterious ancestor of Desmond Miles, Altair Ibn al-Ahad. </b></p> <p> </p> <p>You wake up in a research facility, you have been kidnapped and connected with a machine, the animus, you are Desmond Miles.

Despite the fact that EA put more reality to the game it seems like FIFA street lost a bit of its style, the gamebreaker is no more available and the camera perspective reminds me of FIFA 12, you don't have the chance to see your tricks detailed right away, you have to go to the replay in order to see that. </p> <p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Conclusion:</span> EA has put a lot of effort into FIFA STREET, on the one hand there are high valuable features like licensed teams from top-leagues, on the other hand the vibe of FIFA street got lost with too much reality.

Celebrating with a standout performance on The Today Show on Tuesday morning (September 3) in New York City, the 20-year-old sang her hits “The Way” with Mac Miller and “Tattooed Heart.”
Her Yours Truly LP released via Republic Records already boasts two Top 40 hits.
Her breakout March single “The Way” peaked at No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and the follow-up “Baby I” debuted at No. 21.
Known to many as Cat Valentine on Nickelodeon’s hit series Victorious and current spin-off Sam & Cat, Grande recently told MTV she wants her 13-track album to enable fans to connect to the real Ariana — not her child actress character.
 says.
“And that’s very exciting to me and it’s very relatable. A lot about boys a lot about love, a lot about romance. I’m a hopeless romantic.”
Recently wrapping her first headlining tour The Listening Sessions, the songstress teamed up with her Victorious co-star Leon Thomas and veteran artist/writer Babyface to write some of her album.
Of that experience, the Scooter Braun managed artist adds:
“I feel like some of the most important years of my life have been captured in this album and some of my most important experiences like relationship-wise. So many things I’ve learned I’ll remember when I listen back to these songs. It’s just such a special thing for me. I can’t wait for my fans to hear it.”
Grande reveals one song, the retro-soul “Honeymoon Avenue” is the most personal and one she finds difficult to sing.
“I almost cried last night when I was singing it onstage, ’cause it’s about something that’s so special to me when I hear it. It strikes a personal chord,” she explains.
“‘Honeymoon Avenue’ is about knowing you are at the end of a relationship and wishing it could not be the end and go back to the beginning and start over.”
Fans of the singer may wonder if the pretty star is referring to her recently ended relationship with Australian teen comedy star Jai Brooks of The Janoskians.
Grande is now dating Nathan Sykes of The Wanted who she partnered with on the duet “Almost Is Never Enough,” featuring on the supernatural film soundtrack of The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones.
Of the many Yours Truly reviews, the New York Times calls Grande’s debut “practically Streisandian, startling in its utter rejection of the now” noting its nods to the first two Mariah Carey 90s albums as “modern pop-R&B with a sturdy vintage backbone.”
Over at Idolator, Ariana’s “whistle register and melismas for days” received high praise while some of Harmony Samuels production was seen as “snoozy.” Overall, the album verdict is summed as one that:
” […] delivers on her promise, and it’s liable to make her a star; that will be a good thing. Radio needs Ariana Grande, and if this is a strong debut, the sophomore set is likelier to be even more dazzling.”
Yours Truly is now available to buy in stores and here at IQ it’s already on repeat.
The best album of 2013 easily
so personal and lovely.Photos: Mainers battle in Mt. Washington raceMaternity benefits at a glance

May 11th, 2014 by Cynthia Shahan
Originally published on Bikocity.
A prompt return of a recently stolen GoCycle electric bike makes this a fun and somewhat full-circle story. It also explores theft in the modern-day age of communications and electric vehicles. The facts as we are aware: A GoCycle electric bike was stolen in London but came back to the owner via taxi cab, delivered back at the GoCycle warehouse. Confused? Read on….
Ben Jaconelli had left the bike securely locked on Hackney’s Kingsland Road, but returned after 20 minutes to find it was gone.
He reported the theft to the police, but resigned himself to the worst until he received an unexpected phone call.
The 30-year-old happens to own e-bike online retailerFullycharged.com and recently opened a shop on Old Street roundabout.
He’s also the authorised GoCycle dealer for the area, making him a rather obvious – if poorly-thought-out – point of contact for the person who had taken his bike once it ran out of power.
“The thief called me, unaware that it was my bike,” he said.

As you well know by now, Marc Bergevin was named the Montreal Canadiens' 17th General Manager. Kamal and I also covered the story earlier yesterday, which you can find here.
While many questions are still unanswered, Bergevin quickly made his mark, moving embattled interim head coach Randy Cunneyworth back to his post as assistant coach. He also made it clear that whoever becomes the new head coach will decide whether Cuneyworth remains.
Elsewhere, the New York Rangers and the Washington Capitals played the longest game in these playoffs, needing three overtime periods before Marian Gaborik potted the game winning goal for the Blueshirts.
Meanwhile, the Nashville Predators' gamble of sitting top-scorers Alexander Radulov and Andrei Kostitsyn paid off, as they defeated the Phoenix Coyotes 2-0.
It's never dull at this time of year, is it?

The facility will receive $3,112 for the installation of a security system for building access and internal and external detection.
"These funds will enable us to update our security system to better serve our patrons and protect the assets we house," said Marilyn Laubacher, director of the Baldwinsville Public Library. "We're pleased to receive this money. In such uncertain times, this grant enables us to stretch our tax dollars more to purchase needed items. We are grateful to the New York State Library for selecting our library as a recipient."
The local grants are among 173 construction grants awarded to public libraries and library systems throughout New York State, which are supported by $14 million in capital funds for public library construction provided in the 2009 State budget.
"The construction grants will enable these libraries to make important updates to their buildings without billing residents," said Assemblyman Will Barclay, who recently announced the Baldwinsville Library was a grant recipient. "Libraries have always been centers for resources but in recent years, have become integral to the job search process for many unemployed."
Public library construction grants help local libraries and library systems build new libraries, create additions, update electrical wiring to accommodate computer technology, meet standards of energy efficiency, renovate facilities to provide full accessibility to library users with disabilities and provide meeting rooms to accommodate community needs.
"Many of New York's public libraries are in urgent need of renovation and upgrading. Some are unable to accommodate users with disabilities, many are energy inefficient and others are simply deteriorating due to age," said Senator John DeFrancisco, who helped secure the funds. "Our libraries are a valuable resource and we should be doing all that we can to maintain them and improve upon them."

Per NCAA rules, he will sit out this season. Moody will be eligible to play for the Gators in 2008; he'll have three seasons of eligibility remaining.
The move from USC to the defending national champions was called a "business decision" by the running back. Moody told ESPN.com he chose Florida over North Carolina because, "They get their playmakers the ball.").

COMM.Later this week Visa (NYSE: V ) will announce its earnings from the last three months, and there are three things investors need to keep an eye on.
What does it think of its own stock?
As previously noted, both Visa and MasterCard have been aggressively repurchasing stock over the last few years.
And through the first six months of its 2014 fiscal year -- the year concludes for Visa on September 30 -- Visa repurchased $2.2 billion worth of its common stock at an average price of $208 per share. And during the first three months of the year its $1.1 billion in repurchases cost the company $217 a share.
With that in mind, the second three months of 2014 were tough from a stock standpoint for Visa. As shown below, Visa traded below what it paid for its stock every day during the first three months of the year:
As a matter of fact, half of those days witnessed the stock being traded for less than $208 per share.
So having said all that, it will be interesting to see exactly what Visa thought of its own shares. Did it boost its repurchases as its stock fell? Or did it lower its own valuation?
There is the possibility it simply executed the same amount regardless of the price, but it will be worthwhile to take note of what it thinks of its own stock.
What exactly is it investing in?
When discussing the first three months of the year, one of the most interesting remarks from the CEO of Visa, Charlie Scharf, came when he said Visa continues "to make substantial investments in products and services that will drive our future growth."
And just last week there was the announcement of Visa Checkout, what it describes as "a quick and easy payment service that enables consumers throughout the United States, Canada, and Australia to pay for goods online, on any device, in just a few clicks."
In short, it replaces V.Me by allowing individuals registering their credit or debit cards and their shipping information under a single username and password, and check out across a variety of sites.
Earlier this month I wondered exactly what Visa was doing with V.Me, and just a few days later we learned the answer.
Many have suggested the payment industry is poised for rapid change, and Visa Checkout appears to be one very good way to do this. But instead of saying the company is making "substantial investments," in these areas, it would be fascinating to know not only what it is doing, but how well these innovations are succeeding.
Can the growth continue?
Many people assume since Visa is such a big name, its days of massive growth are behind it. Yet as shown in the chart below, the growth of its total volume of transactions on a constant dollar basis -- excluding inflation -- has only continued to rise over the last year:
Source: Company Investor Relations.
With that in mind, it will be important to see how this growth -- and the corresponding impact to its bottom line -- is progressing. Since Visa is such a common product and a household name -- not to mention it facilitated $7.1 trillion in transactions over the last 12 months -- many have thought its days of impressive growth are well behind it.
But if its volume continues to grow faster and faster on both a dollar and percentage basis, then it could mean its future growth runway is even longer than any of us imagined.
There is a lot to like about Visa and the prospect of its future if it thinks highly of its own stock, continues to innovate, and exhibits impressive growth, and these are the three things I'll be watching when it announces earnings this week.
Your credit card may soon be completely worthless
There is one thing that could scare Visa in the future. And that's the reality the plastic in your wallet is about to go the way of the typewriter, the VCR, and the 8-track tape player..'Balls In Your Face' Prostate Cancer Awareness Project Hopes To Emulate Success Of Breast Cancer Campaign
The American Cancer Society is stepping up its campaign to raise awareness and funding for prostate cancer research with a new program that encourages Americans to "join the race against prostate cancer -- support 'Balls In Your Face'."
Drawing from a successful breast cancer awareness campaign, in which photos of ample female chests were used to remind men of the importance of boobs, promoters of the BIYF campaign say they will be posting images of "the biggest, hairiest ballsacks you ever saw" on billboards and posters everywhere.
"We are truly excited about this campaign," said Thomas Barrett of the American Cancer Society. "I can't imagine a better way to galvanize female support for prostate cancer research than by showing them pictures of huge boners and sweaty testicles."
Barrett and his team have even garnered the support of famous athlete and prostate cancer survivor Lance Armstrong, who will have his own billboard erected on highways across the nation. It features a smiling Armstrong with an enormous bulge in his spandex, along with the headline, "Have a ball! Support prostate and testicular cancer research today."
Taking another celebrity angle, a series of test ads run in the Chicago area -- sporting pictures of the shafts and balls of a number of celebrities and underscored by the text "Think Long and Hard About Supporting Prostate Cancer Research" -- have received a positive response so far.
"During a day-trip to the city, my family and I were surprised and delighted to see this amazing cancer awareness poster," said Dana Murphy of Crown Point, Indiana. "My husband and seven year-old twin daughters just had to stop and admire the eight or ten images of celebrity cocks -- whose they were, I guess we'll never know, though I bet the one on the bottom left was Johnny Depp's -- and it made me think about the urgent need for a cure for prostate cancer, so our men's love muscles don't start falling off."
Not all responses to the new campaign have been positive, however. Some men have complained that the program objectifies the male figure, while others say the images are too harsh and provocative for the public forum.
"I think these posters are beautiful, but my ten-year-old daughter here doesn't seem to agree!" joked one man standing next to a series of the posters, as his crying daughter covered her eyes in terror.
Nevertheless, it is exactly that kind of intense emotional response that the promoters of BIYF are seeking. Brett Sloman of the Specialty Advertising Company, the firm that's executing the creative vision behind the ads, says that overall, he expects most people to enthusiastically support the stimulating message: increase prostate cancer research.
"If you aren't moved by the image of a ballsack that has obviously been swinging all day between the pumping legs of a hard-working, sweaty American man, then you don't have a heart," said Sloman. "We're proud of our ads so far -- proud in a way that a particularly well-endowed man is proud of his enormous, cancer-free penis."
Sloman added that plans are in the works to combine the prostate cancer message with the existing breast cancer message, perhaps by "combining the two images in a way that makes sense and feels good."Lambo doors for the Toyota Celica 2.0 Gti, 1991

your free to do what you want but i just wanted to tell you about a friend of mine who got his done with lambo doors. He wished he didn't! because of the structure of the door frame the lambo doors need to come up and out a bit. He can no longer get out of the car in underground car parks and the doors aren't very stable in my opinion. I would suggest looking in the USA if serious about getting lambo doors as they have cheaper parts for this kind of project. Expect to pay over 1000 just for the parts for EACH door. If you pay any less than this its likely they won't last long as they probably aren't completely made of metal. Shipping should be around 300 as these things are pretty heavy to ship!

THE cauldron of rising house prices, mainly in London but pretty much everywhere, continues to bubble and the only explanation is huge quantities of money being pumped in.
When will a young British couple ever get a chance to own their own home?[GETTY]
As few Brits have got that sort of wealth any more (thank you, Gordon Brown) where is it coming from?
Well abroad of course but which abroad?
We hear the Russians are importing money in strength, but also now the Chinese and not just the Hong Kong variety.
Both have raided the fine-arts auctioneers, the Russians avid for Russian art and the Chinese for oriental antiquities.
But even more they are buying property.
Do they all want to live here? Oh no. So why are they all buying property?
Money in a deposit account earns peanuts and stocks and shares not much more.
Besides both are subject to arbitrary fluctuations but bricks-and-mortar doesn’t go anywhere, it just grows in value, even unoccupied.
But that is far from the whole story.
A house or flat which can be rented out to create an income stream and sold later at a fat profit will do nicely
Remember 13 months ago when Cyprus effectively went bankrupt? It should have quit the eurozone but Brussels would not hear of it.
So it was bailed out with a huge dollop of EU money (meaning Germany).
But there was a savage price to pay.
The banks were suddenly closed to depositors (actually to withdrawers) and deposit accounts scalped.
Everything over 185,000 euros was simply confiscated. (By the by a certain car dealer transferred 40 million euros from Nicosia to London via Greece the day before the closure. Wasn’t the president’s in-law clever?)
Maroon distress flares went up all over Club Med zone. Greeks, Italians, Spanish big-timers thought: if they can do it in Cyprus why not here in due course?
And the transfers began to flow. They are still flowing.
The British reputation for stability and integrity is triumphing once again. (And we think we have a problem with Maria Miller?)
The smart economic brains south of Calais have already read the last rites over the euro and want a safe haven.
A house or flat which can be rented out to create an income stream and sold later at a fat profit will do nicely.
It seems not just France under President Hollande but every piggy bank south of the Olive Line (that east-west line across Europe below which the olives grow) is emptying itself, with the destination being London.
Which is all very fine except for one thing: when will a young British couple ever get a chance to own their own home?Prison courtships are not new. For years it has been commonplace for women to court male prisoners, carrying on pen-pal romances and stuffing envelopes with perfumed pictures or fistfuls of cash. Some women pointed to the desire to break out of the normalcy of life by courting a bad boy. Others saw a soul to save.
Now the tables have turned. About 100,000 women are in prison in America, according to the Justice Department, and as that number grows because of drug use and the increased number of women involved in violent crimes, Web sites are offering men increased opportunities to find potential mates in prison — and increased opportunities to end up heartbroken or swindled by scams.

Some of the sites that allow prisoners to find potential love interest are:
Womenbehindbars.com, Ladiesofthepen.com, Writeaprisoner.com, Inmate-connections.com, Inmatesforyou.com and Cellpals.com
– though I can’t say that I would ever feel comfortable perusing this method of trying to find love or romance, I have always said that people do seem to find love in the strangest of places.
Would you ever consider utilizing such a site? If so, feel free to present your views.06/09/2008

As most everyone in south central Indiana already knows there was extensive damage around the state over the weekend as the result of flooding. Owen County is well under way into the county and city wide assessment of the extent of the damage. Red Cross and the Indiana National Guard have been notified and are helping Owen County EMA Director Jack White assess the current damage. With more rain expected tonight the NOAA has issued the current warnings and Flood watches for Indiana posted on the front page of this site.You can see current watches and warning on the NOAA's website. Local weather stations are calling for damaging winds, large hail and heavy rain.For those Owen County residents that have made it back to their homes. It is important to remember that before you can have your power restored your homes will have to be inspected to insure no further damage to yourself or your home occurs.If you are using water wells as your primary source of water then you may also need to have the Owen County Health Dept inspect your well. More information on both can be found below or by calling:Owen County Health Dept 812-829-5017Owen County Building Dept 812-829-5043Well Water Information for Owen County Residences:In the Owen County online parcel map there is a well layer that you can view to see if your water well does in fact lay with in the flood zones. We are asking that all residences that have wells in the flood zone please read the following paper.If you are unsure what it is that you need to do please contact the Owen County Health Dept.

Herald Times online story.SPENCER — St. Francis wept in the garden off Main Street, drops of floodwater from the White River running down his stone cheeks. The statue stood in the yard of a family who had already left the rising river waters, which crested Sunday afternoon. Owen County — used to dealing with floods after heavy rains — found itself in the midst of one of the worst it’s seen in almost a century. The White River hit 26.68 feet at 3 p.m. today, putting it two feet above major flooding stage, and just two feet under its record stage recorded in 1913. A historic marker showing how high that flood reached was bone dry, but within spitting distance of the overflow. Steady downpours over the last several days bumped the river up over its banks, seeping into the low-lying neighborhoods. “This is the worst I’ve seen,” Russell Rigsby Sr. said from his yard. “It looks like it’s been going down, but you know what they say: It goes down fast, then comes up fast!” Monroe County American Red Cross Director Maria Carrasquillo said about 25 people were being taken care of at an emergency shelter inside the Spencer Elementary School. Most escaped with the clothes on their backs, and whatever else they could wrap their hands around. Erica Cornwell helped evacuate her grandmother Saturday night and came back to check on the house the next afternoon. “We got her out yesterday and moved some important — she’s done a lot of genealogy work and things like that — things,” Cornwell said. Her boyfriend waded into the knee-deep water and came back a short time later to report that the water was in the garage. Spencer remained under a state of emergency, and Owen County Emergency Management Director Jack White was preparing paperwork to have the same declared for Gosport late Sunday afternoon. “Gosport has lost its water and sewer services, and the town of Freedom has lost water coming from the Greene-Eastern Heights utility,” White said. Officials believe — and hope — the river will begin receding, but a dam that holds some eight million gallons of water at Lake Amazon was threatening to burst. “It is a huge priority for us to get that fixed and assessed,” White said. For a county that remains largely under water, the last thing it needs is eight million more gallons of it. Emergency crews were trying to figure out how best to rescue a family that got stranded while camping earlier this weekend. “They’re stuck way, way in the middle of nowhere,” White said. “We’re talking about possibly having to bring in a Black Hawk helicopter to come in and get them.” A Coast Guard helicopter flew over assessing damage, and Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels said members of the National Guard were being dispatched to the county. Roads were flooded, portions of highways destroyed. It could be weeks before a part of Ind. 46 may be repaired, White said. But the water didn’t discriminate in its path of destruction. John Sims was using a sump pump to get the three feet of water out of his basement. His sister, Bettylou Cunningham, stood in the kitchen with her son, Buddy, and couldn’t believe the damage. “All my life I’ve lived here,” she said, “and this is the worst I’ve ever seen it.” Buddy Cunningham predicted the floodwaters could top the 27 foot mark. “This one’s gonna top the one in 1913,” he said. “We’re looking at 27, 28 feet maybe. That’s more than anyone can remember in quite some time.” National Weather Service hydrologists are predicting the waters will return to normal levels by the end of the week. While the flooding divided streets and yards, it united neighbors and friends. Past the Out-of-State Fireworks stand, where the bottle rockets were buy one get six free, past Beth’s Hair Salon, where the curlers work, but the Pepsi machine out back doesn’t, past Riverside Cemetery, where even the dead were drowning Sunday afternoon, people stood at the water’s edge, spinning tales of floods from their childhood. Surviving a flood in Spencer has become nearly a rite of passage, they said. Spirits, like the sandbags, were surprisingly high down by the river. Bill and Sharon Fairbairn waded deep into the floodwaters, until it hit their waists, to try to make it through their neighborhood. The currents were deceptively strong. “Make sure you don’t lift your feet off the ground too high,” Bill warned. Back on the concrete shore, Francis Walters was preparing to leave her home, which fortunately hadn’t taken in any water as of Sunday afternoon. “Three years ago, it wasn’t this bad,” she said. “It just got up to Clay Street, it didn’t get this far.” Her church, just down the street, was heavily flooded, Walters said. She wasn’t sure when she’d get back.

I can confirm that the cvs task does not let you specify where your
cvs.exe lies, and it must be found in the path.
By the way, I did some work with the cygwin cvs and ant and it seemed to
work for me. What I did though were activities which do not write to the

You might want to run your build in verbose mode to see exactly which

something which will help you find a solution.

A: Weleda was founded in 1921 by Dr. Rudolf Steiner and Dr. Ita Wegman, who were looking to develop an approach to health care that would use natural ingredients to work with and support the body’s own healing tendencies. It was at this time that they started to create the world’s first biodynamic garden to grow some of the ingredients they needed.
The current Weleda garden in Wetzgau, Germany, has been around for 54 years. The landscaping areas are coherently bound to each other—hedges and bushes serve to structure and protect from external influences.
We host internal trainings on a regular basis to familiarize new employees with the diverse specialty fields of the medicinal gardening process: rearing, wild collection, toxic plants, dangerous materials—sometimes, this is accompanied by documentaries. For each culture, there is a specific cultivation method, written down in our internal handbook.
Another step for sustainable plant sourcing is the start of cultivation, which has worked well with plants like rosemary, Canadian curcuma or yellow gentian. We try to adopt at least one plant a year into our cultivation—this sounds easy, but is based on systematic research. Rare medicinal plants live in very special surroundings, and the ideal conditions therefore need to be determined and mimicked. In order to do that, we work closely with universities and other research facilities.
A purification plant for plants is also part of the nursery, as well as a photovoltaics plant to generate power. In addition to all that, the garden is a huge attraction, last year we had about 15,000 visitors.
Q: What is biodynamic gardening?
A: In biodynamic gardening, plants thrive without the use of pesticides or chemicals and gardeners harvest with their hands. It’s based on the understanding that soil, plants, animals and humans need to work together as a whole. Of importance is the careful treatment of the soil—composting, fertilization and pest control are achieved using natural methods and chemicals are forbidden. We compost all plant waste leftover from our tinctures production, which we use to fertilize the fields—what’s produced by the garden really helps to nourish the land. Planting, crop rotation and harvesting follow the natural rhythms of the sun, moon and planets.
Crop rotation plays a big role in biodynamic gardening, as one-third of the garden is populated by cover crops as a means to regenerate the soil and feed beneficial insects with pollen and nectar.
Flowers and hedges serve as a source of nutrition and refuge for beneficial organisms. Generally, crop rotation plays a big role—one third of the area is populated by cover crops, as a means to regenerate the soil, as well as for feeding the beneficial insects with pollen and nectar living in it. To make the garden—which is considered an organism—complete, we have several ponds, as well as bees and five ducks to eat snails. In our green houses, we use cultured organisms to keep plant damage down. For five years, we’ve now completely composted plant waste left over from our tinctures production. With this compost, we fertilize the fields, which is how the circular flow comes into being. What’s produced by the garden, helps to nourish the garden.
Q: What are some easy biodynamic gardening practices that readers can apply to their own gardens?
A: Composting, green manuring, crop rotation and natural methods for fertilization, weed and pest control.

Creutzfeldt-jakob disease
(Science: infectious disease) a very rare form of encephalopathy thought to be caused by a virus (slow-virus), termed a prion. There is little known about the mode of transmission. Human to human transmission has occurred through the use of contaminated brain electrodes and transplantation of infected tissues. The agent can be recovered in the csf of infected individuals. Standard disinfectants such as formalin, heat, exposure to ultraviolet light or x-rays is ineffective to inactivate the virus. Autoclaving to at least 132 degrees c. Or immersion in 4% sodium hydroxide or 10% sodium hypochlorite solution for 1 hour is recommended for sterilisation. The disease occurs primarily in adults, with peak incidence in the late 50's. Infection results in dementia, myoclonus, ataxia and other neurologic symptoms. The disease progresses rapidly to coma and death after a 3 to 12 month illness. There is no known cure.

Clearly something has changed, but what? This does not seem to be a personnel issue. Five games ago Mike Pollak regained his starting right guard spot. He had been replaced by Jeff Linkenbach (who is listed as a tackle) for a large part of the season. This was reportedly to help improve the running game. It certainly did not improve the running game and Linkenbach proved to be a clear and present danger to the heath and safety of Peyton Manning.
In re-watching the last three games, nothing really jumps out at you. About the only thing that seems to be a trend is that the Colts have changed the kind of run plays they call. Mostly you see two types of plays now: "quick hitters" and draw plays.
On a quick hitter play, the quarterback will quickly pivot once he receives the snap and hand it to a running back who is already on his way to a predetermined hole that the offensive line is supposed to be creating. The idea is that by quickly creating a hole in the defensive line and getting your back into it immediately, that it will be difficult for the linebackers to get to that hole in time to stop the run.
The advantage to this kind of play is that the offensive line only has to hold their blocks for a short time and it is less imperative that the offensive lineman away from the point of attack run block effectively since their defenders will not have time to get to the play.
When they run draw plays, they also have started to run quicker hitting ones. Usually a draw play is a slow developing play where the quarterback takes a shotgun snap and appears to look downfield - then hands the ball to a running back who has lingered in the backfield.
Now what they are running as draw plays are more like a inside hand-off from the shotgun formation.
The pass blocking has also improved, but the reasons are also not obvious. Generally it is easier to pass block if the defense has to be worried about the possibility of a successful running play, so that might be why.
Going into this Jets game, it will be more important than ever to run the ball. Breaking a few long runs against the Jets blitz will slow them down and give us more time to throw.

Princeton University was listed as the top US national university, beating Harvard as it did last year. Williams College in Massachusetts was rated the country’s best liberal arts college for the fourth straight year.
Graduate school rankings will be issued in March next year.
The ranking has again come under attack. On one side are academic administrators critical of such rankings in principle. On the other are an expanding number of rival surveys who question the US News & World Report methodology.
Sixty-three US college and university presidents issued a letter on May 10 urging their fellow academicians to boycott filling out the "reputation survey" that determines a quarter of the points awarded to a university. Among other complaints they said such rankings "obscure important differences in educational mission in aligning institutions on a single scale."
Economist Robert Samuelson was among the unimpressed. While rankings aren’t perfect, he wrote, they "expose users to masses of objective, comparative information." He accused the colleges of "soft censorship". Notably, most of the colleges that complained fared poorly in the ratings. The highest-ranked liberal arts college to sign the boycott letter was Ohio’s Kenyon College (#32).
The questions raised about the methodology were more complex.
US News & World Report has a five-stage evaluation process that includes surveys, objective data about scores and finances, and a proprietarial "scientific formula." The rival Princeton Review bases itself largely on interviews with 120,000 students. The Fiske Guide to Colleges uses student interviews and a dataset that changes with each year to catch shifting trends.
The Report, which began academic rankings in 1983, evaluates nearly 1,900 academic institutions in the US. It is treated as so authoritative that some colleges award their administrators bonuses if they can increase the institution’s ranking.
The listings have helped create a larger public awareness about the strengths and weaknesses of colleges and their admissions policies. It is often said the most fervent readers are not students but "status-conscious" parents.
The proliferating number of rankings is testimony to US News & World Report’s success. The focus is no longer on academic standards as more students look for "a good fit" rather than a trophy name. The Princeton Review, for example, has a college index for "gay acceptancy".It's no secret that the Minnesota Vikings are having an abysmal year. Much of that, of course, is due to a coaching staff that looks increasingly likely to leave as the season ends, but some of it is due to team quality.
The Vikings are a much more talented team than their record implies, particularly given the fact that the Vikings would be 9-5 if NFL games were cut off at the 59-minute mark.
But that doesn't mean there are significant albatrosses on the roster that the Vikings need to shed if they want to move forward. Some of these issues are talent-related, while others could best be characterized as "cap casualties."
Regardless, Minnesota is moving forward with a young roster and they may need to get younger in order to get better. That means getting rid of established veterans and taking some chances, which can be a painful process.
On the other hand, the team doesn't have much to lose from a shakeup, either.Fashion and function come together in Namaste multi-function handbags.

Shi-ka-she was a tall man, six feet,
with broad shoulders and a commanding appearance. He never met a man his
equal with a lance, and, like Crazy Horse, was never photographed. However
a California gallery owner named Charles Parker recently uncovered a painting,
identified as "Cochise, 1872", that Apache authority Edwin R. Sweeney
says "appears to be the real thing". Both Cochise and Crazy Horse
were buried in secret locations on their homeland.
In 1861, Cochise, Chief of the Chokonen band
of the Chiricahua Apache tribe, was wrongfully suspected of abducting the
children of a rancher, and stealing his cattle. Lieutenant George Bascom,
who led the investigation, lured Cochise to a meeting. Bascom wasted no time
in accusing the Indian of the raid, although the Chief claimed innocence.
When Bascom tried to arrest him, Cochise slashed through the tent with his
knife and escaped, suffering three bullets wounds in the
process.
After several weeks of fighting, two dragoon
companies out of Fort Breckinridge finally drove the rampaging Apaches into
Mexico. But before leaving, they killed their hostages. In retaliation, Bascom
hanged all his male hostages including Cochise's. Lt. Bascom was later killed during
battle by a cannonball from the Southern side.
On the morning of April 30, 1871, 150 Anglos, Mexicans, and Papago
Indian mercenaries attacked a sleeping Indian camp, massacred from 86 to
150 of the innocents, mostly women and children. Of the survivors, women
were raped and children carried into slavery. The American President Ulysses
S. Grant, who had devised his post-Civil War Peace Policy to avoid such
massacres, was outraged and sent a peace commission to Arizona, led by General
Oliver Howard and Vincent Coyler. Howard also finally arranged a meeting
with Cochise of the Chiricahuas that autumn, through the intercession of
the frontiersman Thomas Jeffords.
Cochise was bitter, but he also realized that he fought a battle
he could not win. He expressed his resignation in the following way: "My
people have killed Americans and Mexicans and taken their property. Their
losses have been greater than mine. I have killed ten white men for every
Indian slain, but I know that the whites are many and the Indians are few.
Apaches are growing less every day". Still the great Chief did not want
to get locked up in a Reservation: "Nobody wants peace more than I do.
Why shut me up on a reservation? We will make peace; we will keep it faithfully.
But let us go around free as Americans do. Let us go wherever we
please".
After 11 days of negotiations, the general granted Cochise's request
for a reservation in the Chiricahua homeland, the Apache Pass, with Jeffords
as the agent. Cochise, who promised Howard to keep order along the pass,
proved good as his word, his people lived peaceful until his death in
1874. in 1876 moved the Chiricahua from the ancient
mountain homeland to the hot, flat, dry, Arizona desert. Cochise's youngest
son Naiche and Geronimo led a group of Chiricahua Apaches that fled into
the mountains, and over the border to Mexico eluding the troops for over
a decade, refusing to surrender until 1886.

Dahteste is described as a very beautiful woman who took great pride
in her appearance and, even though she married and had children, she chose
the life of the warrior. No one challenged Dahteste lightly for it was widely
known that she could out-ride, out-shoot, out-hunt, out-run, and out-fight
her peers, male and female, and she did so with grace. She was credited as
being courageous, daring and skillful, and she took part.

Geronimo was the most legendary and feared of all the Apache warriors.
He was known as a chief, which he wasn't. To his people he was a very powerful
medicine man and shaman that could foretell the future. He became a war leader
for a small group of the Bedonkohe band of the Chiricahua Apache Indians
in Southeastern Arizona during the 1850's through 1880's. He was born in
present-day Clifton, Arizona with the name Goyahkla, which means "one who
yawns." However some Ft. Sill Apaches gave the meaning as "intelligent, shred
and clever." He was given his name Geronimo from the fear he produced in
his Mexican enemies. As he would attack they would yell out the name of their
patron saint Jerome. This translated into Geronimo, so he took this
as his nickname.
One of the first spirit communications he received was shortly after
the death of his family in Kaskiyeh. He went to a top of a mountain and heard
a voice call his name four times. The voice told him "No gun can ever kill
you. I will take the bullets from the guns of the Mexicans, so they will
have nothing but powder and I will guide your arrows." After his wife, children,
and mother were killed by Mexicans in 1858, he participated in a number of
raids against Mexican and American settlers, but eventually settled on a
reservation.
After the death of the Great Apache Chief Cochise in 1874, the Americans
wanted to move the Chiricahuas to the Arizona desert. Geronimo and hundreds
of the Apaches bolted and started a war against the Whites. He surrendered
in January 1884 and returned to reservation in San Carlos, but the sudden
arrest and imprisonment of the Apache warrior Kayatennae, together with rumors
of impending trials and hangings, prompted Geronimo to flee on May 17, 1885,
with 35 warriors, 8 boys and 101 women. In January 1886, Apache scouts penetrated
Chief Juh's seemingly impregnable hideout. This action induced Geronimo to
surrender.
Geronimo's final surrender on September 4th 1886 was the last
significant Indian guerrilla action in the United States. At the end, his
group consisted of only 16 warriors, 12 women, and 6 children. Because he
fought against such daunting odds and held out the longest, he became the
most famous Apache of all.
Later in life he adopted Christianity and took part in the inaugural
procession of President Theodore Roosevelt in 1905.
Geronimo was wounded many times but never killed by a bullet. After
the surrender he and many of the Apache warriors were transported to Florida
and never returned to Arizona. Geronimo's last wish was to see his homeland
once more. This he was never allowed to do, but died as a prisoner of
war on February 17, 1909 in Ft. Sill, OK.

Lozen was the younger sister of the mighty Apache war leader Victorio,
and the most famous of the Apache War Women. Lozen was born in a section
of New Mexico / Arizona / Northern Mexico known at that time as Apacheria,
somewhere in the late 1840s. She was born within sight of the Sacred Mountain
near Ojo Caliente where the People began.
She let it be known at a very early age that she had no interest
in learning the women's duties of the tribe, and set out on the warrior's
path - taught by her famous brother. She learned to ride
a horse at age seven and soon became one of the best riders in the band.
She loved the rough games of the boys. All of the girls of the band started
hard physical training at the age of 8. Their physical endurance would be
necessary to survive the harsh way of life they lived. A few women went on
raids or with hunting parties to take care of chores and of their husbands,
but Lozen took part in the warrior training and never married.
When Lozen was born, the leader of the People was a tough, grizzled,
canny warrior named Juan Jose Compa. The Chihenne lived then mostly in the
Animas Mountains. Some Mexicans came into the area and made friends with
them and brought with them slave Indians from other bands and drove those
slaves ceaselessly to work in the caves of the earth.
Mangas Coloradas liked the golden metal the Mexicans were digging
for and also like the mescal that the Mexicans taught them to use, so he
made peace with the Mexicans. The warriors profited by trading horses and
cattle and other things with the Mexicans.
The Mexicans also brought a white man into the area whose name was
John James Johnson. Juan Jose led the People to an area to Santa Rita where
the Mexicans had barrels of mescal and piles of presents. They watched warily
the other white eyes who had bristled hair on their faces. But the
whole fiesta scene was a trap and John Johnson shot many of the Indians dead
on the spot. They shot even the women and children. Johnson and the other
white eyes and Mexicans seized the hair off the heads of the Indians to sell
back in Mexico. The People feared the dead and the 'chindi' spirits that
lingered after a death.
Mangas Coloradas took charge of the survivors and determined to take
revenge on the white eyes and Mexicans and Santa Rita. The People believed
in revenge. Over 100 warriors took part in the raids that followed and they
killed as many of the white eyes and Mexicans who had taken part in the murder
of the People. When the Mexicans and white eyes were captured and brought
to camp, the wives, mothers and daughters of the murdered Indians killed
the men in revenge. The crushed them under horses hooves, beat them to death
with clubs and even hacked them to pieces with knives. This is what Lozen
learned as a child.
Lozen was quite unlike her counterpart, Dahteste. Lozen had no
concern for her appearance and, even though she is in several famous photos
of Geronimo with his warriors, there is nothing to indicate that she is a
woman. She was manly in her appearance, dressed like a man, lived and fought
like a man. She devoted her life to the service of her people.
Victorio is quoted as saying, "Lozen is my right hand . . . strong
as a man , braver than most, and cunning in strategy, Lozen is a shield to
her people."
Legend has it that Lozen was able to use her supernatural powers
in battle to learn the movements of the enemy and that she helped each band
that she accompanied to successfully avoid capture. She also had the ability
to use song and herbs to help heal people and was considered a Shaman. at the
approximate age of 50.

Lozen.
(1793?-1863)
The exact time of Mangas Coloradas' birth is unknown, he was said
to have been seventy in the year 1863. At first he was called
Don-Ha. After he married Lost Pony's sister Placid (One
without cares in the world), and later Firefly, because Placid wanted
her as her second, it i said that he brought shame on his family by taking
a Mexican girl from Santa Rita to his teepee. Because of that he had to fight
one of Placid's brothers, and one of Firefly's brothers, killing them both
in battle. From that day forward he was known as "Red Sleeve" or Mangas Coloradas
(the Spanish translation), earning his name in the battle. Mangas emerged
as a prime leader of the Warm Springs (Mimbreño) Apaches in southwestern
New Mexico after the Mexican-instigated massacre of many Mimbreños
in 1837.
After the Americans started to occupy the region, searching for
gold, Mangas tried several peaceful ways to get the Whites out of his land.
On one occasion he tried to lure gold-miners away from the land, by telling
them about better areas for mining further south. The miners tied him to
a tree and lashed him nearly to death, before releasing him. For Mangas this
was the biggest humiliation of them all, and upon recovering he gathered
his forces and drove the miners out.
In 1861, Mangas joined forces with Chiricahua and White Mountain
Apaches and went to war against the Americans. They focused their attacks
on stagecoaches on the trail near Apache Pass. Mangas tried to make peace
with the Americans on several occasions, and on January 17th 1863 the old
Chief decided to take up a truce offer from Captain Edmond Shirland's camp
of the California Volunteers. Arriving at the camp soldiers jumped from some
nearby underbrush and took him prisoner. The Volunteers took him to Fort
McLean where General Joseph West's orders were: "I want him dead or alive
tomorrow morning, do you understand, I want him dead." A miner who'd
been travelling with the Volunteers, one Daniel Conner, later said that the
soldiers assigned to guard Mangas were tormenting him by heating their bayonets
in a nearby fire, and touching them to Mangas's feet and legs. When Mangas
jumped to his feet in pain, the soldiers drew muskets and shot him. One soldier
took his scalp: another boiled the flesh from his head, and sold the skull
to a phrenologist in the East. Mangas's body was dumped in a ditch.
Mangas Coloradas son Mangus continued the fight against the Whites
alongside Victorio, Nana and Geronimo. Upon surrendering in 1886 the group
was nearly eliminated, counting only a handful of warriors and a few women
and children.
More information about Chief Mangas Coloradas.
(1810-?)
Nana was married to Geronimo's sister. To his people he as a wise
kind grandfather type figure, but as far as the whites were concerned he
was uncompromising. Nana was a Warm Springs Apache under Victorio but was
always close to the Bendonkohe tribe. After Victorio's death at the Tres
Castillos massacre in 1880, it was Nana who guided the remains of the tribe
into safety. For more than two months Nana eluded 1400 troops in a thousand-mile
campaign with only 40 warriors. He later joined forces with Geronimo and
Juh, but they never managed to make a common stand against the whites, and
thus the forces became to small and outnumbered to make an impact in the
struggle.
Nana was a wise man and wherever he went he carried his good fortune
with him and his followers. He had the strength to find hidden treasures
in the shape of ammunition, food and cloths on the Apache trail. No Apache
cache was hidden from Nana, and his powers were highly rated by the other
Chiefs and Braves. After Victorio's death Nana followed the women and children
back to the reservation, but himself fled with Geronimo for their last
escapes.
Even at old age and almost with a crippled leg, Nana could out-ride
and out-last any warrior in the saddle. He showed no signs of weakness, and
challenged any white man that stood in his way. It is said that to revenge
of Victorio's death Nana was responsible for killing more white men than
Victorio had done in his lifetime. Because of his powers he was never caught
unguarded, and with Victorio's sister Lozen he formed a lethal pair of support
for Geronimo in their final battle for freedom. During the surrender by Geronimo
to Crook in 1886, Nana was given to the Cavalry as a good faith token that
they were ready to surrender.
Nana died of old age, and lived his last years in reservation. He
remembered his final days of freedom as something he should never have let
go of. In many ways he envied Victorio his fate. To die in combat for his
people would have been the ultimate satisfaction for Nana.
(1825?-1880) attempts realized that escape was not possible they decided
to take their own life. After Victorio's death his uncle, the 80 year old
Nana, took charge of the group.

BACK TO APACHE INDEXCity Plans '[re]Manufacture' for Landfill
City hopes to create jobs while moving Austin closer to its zero-waste goals
By Robyn Ross, Fri., Aug. 8, 2014
One person's trash is another's treasure. With its new "eco-industrial park" south of the airport, Austin plans to apply that adage on a very large scale.
The businesses it plans to locate on 107 acres adjacent to the closed municipal landfill will turn recyclable materials into new products and bring manufacturing jobs to a disadvantaged area. At today's City Council meeting (Aug. 7), the city is expected to formally accept a $1 million grant for the project from the U.S. Economic Development Administration.
Right now, says Austin Resource Recovery Director Bob Gedert, most recyclable materials collected in Austin are sent overseas for "remanufacture." City trucks haul the contents of the blue curbside bins to two local companies that sort paper from plastic, and then those companies bale the materials and ship them to manufacturers that turn them into new products (a park bench made from water bottles, for example). Gedert says changes to international shipping regulations in the late Eighties made it more cost effective to send materials overseas, but the result was the evaporation of domestic markets.
The eco-industrial park, to be called the Austin [re]Manufacturing Hub, is an attempt to reverse that trend. The businesses sited on its roughly 12 lots could be involved in recycling (of paper and wood fibers), reuse (such as electronics repair), or upcycling (most commonly associated with art). With these companies located in Austin, Gedert says, the city would reduce the carbon footprint of recycling and divert more material from landfills. The latter accomplishment would create jobs while moving Austin closer to its zero-waste goals. Gedert's example of a company that would support that triple bottom line is a manufacturer turning recyclables into reusable grocery bags.
The land designated for the Hub lies along FM 812, midway between McKinney Falls State Park and the Circuit of the Americas. It abuts the city's landfill and was originally destined to become part of it, but FAA regulations required the eventual closure of the landfill, beginning in 1999, when the airport moved to its current location at the former Bergstrom Air Force Base. Landfills attract scavenging birds, a hazard for airplanes. (The city's residential trash is now taken to a private landfill operated by Texas Disposal Systems, located near the southern tip of Travis County.)
The designated land, currently in Austin's extra-territorial jurisdiction, will be considered for annexation in December. The city will begin vetting prospective tenants later this year, and plans to start construction on infrastructure, like water and wastewater lines, in early 2015. Companies will break ground next fall.
In addition to the federal grant, the city will invest between $8.5 million and $10 million in infrastructure development. While the details are still being worked out, planners expect to recoup the investment via income from leases in a couple of decades. The park will support up to 1,250 jobs, says Recycling Economic Development Liaison Natalie Betts, who works for both the Economic Development Department and Resource Recovery. Most will be in manufacturing – a good fit, Betts says, for the segment of Austin's population without advanced degrees or with barriers to employment like previous incarceration. "Our statistics on income inequality are not good in Austin," she said. "We think this could be a real catalyst and provide an employment center for this part of town."Dallas was chosen as one of the best cities for newlyweds by Rent.com. They come out with a new list every year and this year we were included.
What were the factors they considered?
Several elements were part of the data used. The factors taken into account were the number of married couples and children under the age of six. They also looked at cost of living and annual income, as well as availability of rental properties.
The cost of living in Dallas is low overall, which boosts this factor, but like many cities, it depends where you want to live. The most popular areas for twenty and thirty-somethings like Uptown, Addison, and Lakewood are all among the priciest in the area.
What other factors make Dallas a great place for newlyweds?
Rent.com noted our theme parks, which is pretty much just Six Flags and its water park counterpart, Hurricane Harbor.
Our sports teams were also mentioned. We do have our share of professional games to attend in the Metroplex. Between the Mavs and Stars in Dallas to the Rangers and Cowboys in Arlington, you could stay very busy attending sporting events. Not to mention FC Dallas and the Fort Worth Cats, Rough Riders, Grand Prairie Air Hogs, and Allen Americans.
Another highlight not mentioned in the survey were perks like the abundant shopping and restaurant culture. The large number of chef-owned restaurants raises the standards, and the high competition means a lot of turnover. These factors give us residents plenty of delicious food to try.
Do you agree with Rent.com? Is Dallas one of the best cities for newlyweds?- .

An excerpt:
But there was one downside: the reactivation of one of the most enduring memes and myths about the presidency, and especially the Obama presidency. Like Rasputin (or Whac-A-Mole,) it keeps coming back even after it has been bludgeoned and obliterated by facts and logic. I feel compelled to whack this mole once more.
The meme is what Matthew Yglesias, writing in 2006, referred to as “the Green Lantern Theory of Geopolitics,” and has been refined by Greg Sargent and Brendan Nyhan into the Green Lantern Theory of the presidency. In a nutshell, it attributes heroic powers to a president—if only he would use them. And the holders of this theory have turned it into the meme that if only Obama used his power of persuasion, he could have the kind of success that LBJ enjoyed with the Great Society, that Bill Clinton enjoyed in his alliance with Newt Gingrich that gave us welfare reform and fiscal success, that Ronald Reagan had with Dan Rostenkowski and Bill Bradley to get tax reform, and so on..
If only the proponents of this theory would step back and look at the realities of all these presidencies (or would read or reread the Richard Neustadt classic, Presidential Power.). I do not want to denigrate LBJ or downplay his remarkable accomplishments and the courage he displayed in taking on his own base, Southern Democrats, to enact landmark civil-rights and voting-rights laws that have done more to transform America in a positive way than almost anything else in our lifetimes. And it is a fact that the 89th Congress, that of the Great Society, can make the case for having more sweeping accomplishments, from voting rights to Medicare to elementary and secondary education reform, than any other.
LBJ had a lot to do with the agenda, and the accomplishments. But. While Johnson needed, and got, substantial Republican support on civil rights and voting rights to overcome Southern Democrats’ opposition, he did not get a lot of Republicans supporting the rest of his domestic agenda. He had enough Democrats supporting those policies to ensure passage, and he got enough GOP votes on final passage of key bills to ensure the legitimacy of the actions.
Johnson deserves credit for horse-trading (for example, finding concessions to give to Democrat Wilbur Mills, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, to get his support for Medicare), but it was the numbers that made the difference. Consider what happened in the next two years, after the 1966 midterm elections depleted Democratic ranks and enlarged Republican ones. LBJ was still the great master of Congress—but without the votes, the record was anything but robust. All the cajoling and persuading and horse-trading in the world did not matter.
Now briefly consider other presidents.. LBJ and Reagan had willing partners from the opposite party; Obama has had none. Nothing that he could have done would have changed the clear, deliberate policy of Republicans uniting to oppose and obstruct his agenda, that altered long-standing Senate norms to use the filibuster in ways it had never been employed before, including in the LBJ, Reagan, and Clinton eras, that drew sharp lines of total opposition on policies like health reform and raising taxes as part of a broad budget deal.
Could Obama have done more to bond with lawmakers? Sure, especially with members of his own party, which would help more now, when he is in the throes of second-term blues, than it would have when he achieved remarkable party unity in his first two years. But the brutal reality, in today’s politics, is that LBJ, if he were here now, could not be the LBJ of the Great Society years in this environment. Nobody can, and to demand otherwise is both futile and foolish.”

ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- Princess Cruise Lines was sentenced for failing to operate one of its ships in a slow, safe manner near Glacier Bay National Park where a humpback whale was found dead of massive skull fractures.
The body of the 45-foot (13.5-meter),.
While not agreeing Monday that one of its ships hit the whale, Princess Cruise Lines paid a maximum $200,000 (euro154,787) fine, plus $550,000 (euro425,664) Dawn Princess."
The company pleaded guilty to knowingly failing to operate the cruise ship at a slow, safe speed while near two whales on July 12, 2001. The federal regulation on speed was implemented in 2001. after the encounter with the whale it implemented guidelines for how its ships should operate when whales are near. It also instituted procedures and speed restrictions for the Icy Strait area with ships not to exceed 11.5 mph (18.5 kph) when in the strait south of the national park.
The dead whale was found July 16, 2001, near the area where the Dawn Princess had earlier been traveling.
There are approximately 20,000 humpback whales worldwide. Of those, about 6,000 humpbacks make up the North Pacific population, most of which feed in Alaska during the summer. They migrate to Hawaii in the fall where they give birth.

With the market set to open for free agents, Sports Illustrated has published their Top 50 available free agents for the 2011-2012 off-season. Each name on the list comes complete with a brief bio and SI's recommendation for that particular player's "best fit." Four Phillies—Rollins, Madson, Oswalt and Ibanez—made the list.
So where does SI project them to land?
Rollins weighs in as the highest Phillie on the list at No. 10, and the second shortstop behind only Jose Reyes. Those of you who might like to see Jimmy finish, or at least continue, his career in a Phillies uniform will be dismayed—but doubtfully surprised given Rollins' Bay-Area ties and this team's need for a SS—that SI projects his "best fit" to be with the San Francisco Giants.
Two spots below at No. 12, Ryan Madson finds himself behind both Jonathan Papelbon and Heath Bell as SI' third-most coveted closer. Fortunately for the one guy who actually owns and wears a Ryan Madson t-shirt—Me—the list still projects his "best fit" as in the Citizens Bank Park bullpen. Though, if we're being honest, Papelbon's ranking is unquestionably inflated—probably because he's spent time in Boston—and Madson's age might be more attractive to some teams than the three-years-his-elder Bell.
Basically, we're telling you Ryan Madson is undervalued. Then again, this guy and I rarely miss an opportunity to share that opinion.
Roy Oswalt and Raul Ibanez round out the Phillies on the list as Nos. 22 and 35, with the Texas Rangers and Seattle Mariners listed as their best fits, respectively.
Should guys be higher? Lower? Wanna argue about it? See you in the comments.
Update: Yeah, yeah, we forgot Lidgey at #44. Our bad, Brad. Anyway, you're projected to fit best with the Mets. Congratulations and I'm sorry. Can we talk about less money? Let's talk about less money.
[h/t allan for the link]>>The Reiter 50: Ranking the Top Free Agents [SI]By Michael Kuchwara, Associated Press | July 13, 2004
NEW YORK -- Broadway lights will continue to shine.
Two weeks after its contract expired, the union representing stage actors reached a tentative agreement yesterday with theater producers, ending a period of uncertainty as the two sides wrangled over issues of health care costs, actor safety, and, most importantly, nonunion tours of Broadway shows.
"Actors' Equity Association and the League of American Theatres and Producers announced they have reached a tentative agreement on a new four-year Production Contract," both sides said in a joint statement.
"The leadership for both sides will meet today to hammer out the language," said League spokeswoman Kelly Sullivan, adding it might even be tomorrow before all the details are known.
Tensions had risen over the weekend after producers of "The Boy From Oz," the hit musical starring Hugh Jackman as Australian entertainer Peter Allen, agreed to a temporary contract with the union, breaking ranks with other League members.
The Kennedy Center's production of "The Glass Menagerie," starring Sally Field, also signed an agreement, Maria Somma, an Equity spokeswoman, said. The revival of the Tennessee Williams classic, now in rehearsal, begins performances in Washington, D.C., Saturday for a run through Aug. 8.
The Kennedy Center was placed in an odd situation with "Menagerie," which is part of the Center's summer Williams festival. Even though the engagement was for a limited run, one-theater-only production, the Center agreed to terms usually reserved for Broadway or major touring productions.
Among options union leaders could have considered after its contract expired was a strike, which would have shut down most Broadway plays and musicals as well as major productions on the road. Shows have continued to run throughout the negotiations. The union's contract with the League of Broadway Producers expired June 27, and the two sides have met since to resolve not only the issue of nonunion tours but also questions about soaring health care costs and worker safety..

They said President Barack Obama’s re-election increases prospects for continued monetary stimulus in the U.S. Further, the status quo, with Democrats controlling the White House and Senate but Republicans controlling the House of Representatives, is likely to mean more stand-offs over fiscal issues such as in 2011 when gold hit its record highs.
Nevertheless, just before 1 p.m. EST, gold for December delivery was down $4 to $1,711 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. This was more than $20 lower than the overnight peak of $1,733.
Analysts blamed the retreat on spillover from a weaker equity market and euro. And they blamed this on continuing worries about Europe’s debt saga and economy, as well as a shift in market focus to the so-called U.S. fiscal cliff.
Further, some observers suggested that the market already factored in an Obama win on Tuesday when prices surged strongly, meaning potential for profit-taking Wednesday on a buy-the-rumor, sell-the-fact move.
“I don’t think today is fairly indicative of what the election could mean for precious metals, particularly gold,” said Jeffrey Wright, managing director and senior research analyst with Global Hunter Securities, in reference to weakness he pinned largely on worries about Europe. Wright said he looks for gold to top $2,000 sometime in the early part of 2013.
“The underlying fundamentals are very supportive of gold going forward,” he said, although adding that the metal may face increased price volatility.
The re-election of President Obama means a greater likelihood of continuity in U.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy, including a continuation of the bond-buying program known as quantitative easing, said Anne-Laure Tremblay, precious-metals strategist at BNP Paribas. “The expansion of their balance sheet will be supportive for gold,” she said.
Sean Lusk, precious-metals analyst with Ironbeam, said he looks for investors to continue buying gold on price dips. He pointed out that gold has already nearly doubled since Obama first took office. He cited the numerous fiscal and monetary stimulus measures since, not only in the U.S. but elsewhere.
“Overall, I think there is a floor under the market for gold,” said Kevin Grady, president of Phoenix Futures and Options, on the Comex floor. “I think the policies of easing are not going to be going away.”
The Federal Reserve sets monetary policy, not the president or lawmakers. Nevertheless, Obama was seen as most likely to either nominate Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke for another term when his current one expires or else name somebody else who would be accommodative.
U.S. Fiscal Cliff To Be Among Next Key Issues For Market
“This fiscal cliff that everybody is talking about is going to be the next big topic,” Grady said. This is the combination of automatic spending cuts and tax hikes scheduled to kick in at the start of the year in the absence of any changes by Congress. There are market worries this could tilt the economy back into recession.
“That will bring some uncertainty to the markets before the end of the year,” Tremblay said.
The precise impact on gold is tough to call and may hinge on how events play out, Tremblay and Grady continued.
Tremblay listed two possible scenarios. If the broader markets sell off in a panic and all asset classes move down, gold may also fall, although less than other asset classes. “That’s an extreme case if no compromise is found,” she said.
However, she suspects a compromise will be reached although it could come at the last minute. If so, this could support the precious metal.
“Gold tends to be supported by mild risk aversion or mild uncertainty,” she said. “If it looks like we’re going to get a last-minute deal…by the end of the year, you could see mild support, using gold as a safe haven because they’re worried about the effect on the dollar but not panicking and thinking no deal will be reached and there will be fiscal tightening next year.”
BNP Paribas has a “positive view” on gold for the next three months, Tremblay said. “We think the next step will be for gold to re-test the $1,800 resistance level.”
Wright, meanwhile, listed the combination of a Democratic president and Republican-controlled House as likely supportive for gold if Washington is headed to a showdown over the fiscal cliff. In fact, other analysts have pointed out that gold hit its all-time high back in 2011 around the time such political gridlock was occurring., Director of Data Science, George Davis, discusses the challenges of representing the learning process and the 5 types of educational data that matter.

We will test 5 common vinegar theories and put them to the test.
Step 1: Theory 1: Polishing Chrome
RESULT: It works, it cleans it up nicely and doesn't leave a streak, HURRAY!
Step 2: Theory 2: Cutting Grease
RESULTS: The grease after being soaked in vinegar came right off. I tried a bit of vinegar with some oil dropped right in and it, and the oil broke down pretty well.
Step 3: Theory 3: Disinfecting Cutting Boards
RESULT: Inconclusive because i can't see bacteria, but it cleaned off the stains on the board and left it looking cleaner.
Step 4: Theory 4: Killing Weeds
RESULT: Adding a strong acid to a plant should kill it, but i won't know for a few days if it worked as well as i hoped.
Step 5: Theory 5: Drinking Vinegar for Health
RESULT: Vinegar tastes horrible, see picture #2

At the outset of his article, Peoples says The data should create the narrative, not the other way around. I argue he's doing exactly what he accuses other journalists of doing, but just to make his favored point. I'm one of the guys who, according to Peoples, misinterpreted what's happening with music consumption. I recently wrote an article citing a Rolling Stone blurb that didn't contain the context Peoples was looking for.
Fair enough. We could argue over what happened in the past and what's happening in the present all day and go absolutely nowhere. That's the unfortunate by-product of a multi-faceted argument dominated by a bunch of people with special interests or an insatiable desire to prove they're right.
Even if digital sales are doing well in the face of streaming's continued growth, the music industry should act like they're not. Haven't label executives and others who make up the music industrial complex studied their own history? Haven't they come to the realization that how things were last week, are today or will be five days from now means very little? It's the long-term that matters. You know, the Amazon.com
Consider my favorite Jeff Bezos quote that comes after a reporter's question:.
That exchange, by the way, took place in freaking 1999. About 427% ago. For the record, AMZN stock is up 427.3% since June 1, 1999 and a whopping 20,061% since going public.
Crappy strategy, I know.
Anyhow, as Bezos indicated more than 14 years ago, the Amazon strategy cannot work nor is it appropriate for every company. It works for Amazon because Bezos isn't fooling himself, his co-workers, his investors or the general public when he speaks of the long-term opportunity Amazon has. Contrast this to Reed Hastings who takes a similar perpetual startup approach at Netflix
That said, the music industry -- thanks in large part to Internet radio -- has massive long-term growth and diversification prospects. They're real. They're spectacular. And they're on par with Amazon's. So why waste your time clinging to the way things are today?
Most Commented(NEWARK, N.J., Nov. 12, 2007) New Jersey registered nurses are teetering on the brink of exhaustion due to heavier work loads, feeling that they are not able to provide proper patient care and receiving little support from management, according to a survey conducted by Rutgers College of Nursing faculty member Linda Flynn.
The 11-page survey, funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, was mailed to the homes of 44,343 New Jersey registered nurses and more than 21,000 nurses responded to the survey. It was the largest and most comprehensive surveys of New Jersey nurses ever conducted.
Findings from the survey, The State of the Nursing Workforce in New Jersey: Findings from a Statewide Survey of Registered Nurses,.
The survey also reports that New Jersey will need to replace a third of its nursing workforce over the next 10 years just to maintain the current nurse supply and does not reflect the additional number of nurses needed to meet the demand of an increasing aging population.
This is going to be a huge loss of nurses. But the workforce will not only be decimated by retirement but also by the number of dissatisfied nurses who may move to non-nursing positions, said Flynn, assistant professor at The College of Nursing at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey. To make matters worse, qualified students are turned away from New Jersey schools of nursing due to the nursing faculty shortage. We have to do something to increase our educational capacity and hiring more nursing faculty to meet this demand.

Immediately, my mind went to the worst possible place it could go. She has bad news, I thought. Who died? What awful tragedy has come upon her? And then I thought, Why does it have to be bad news?

Hi everyone! I’m Mique from 30days and I was flattered when Jamielyn asked me to blog swap with her here on I♥naptime. I spend my time chasing 3 kids around and in my spare time I share ideas on 30days. I also host giveaways and product reviews. I absolutely love all things craft related.
Today I’m here to share a felt flower that can brighten up your outfit, your purse, your hair. I know there are several different felt floral tutorials out there but this one is a tad different. Enjoy!
Supplies needed:
scissors, glue gun, 1/2 yd felt (whatever color you want)
scrap of coordinating fabric, button (I used size 30) & button kit,
needle, coordinating embroidery floss & an alligator clip
First, you’ll cut 5 circles. My circles are approx 2″.
I’ve used all different things in the past to create a template
but I usually use a cup or bowl.
Here are my 2″ circles all cut out.
These will be our petals.
Next fold one circle in half.
And then into quarters. It should look like this.
Pinch it at the bottom.
Thread your needle with embroidery floss.
Quick tip- instead of licking the end of your embroidery floss and trying to thread it, lick the eye of the needle- works like a charm.
Stick the needle through the layers.
Create a stitch by going up and then back down.
And then up and back down, creating an X.
After sewing an x, tie it off with a knot in the back.
Do that with 4 of the circles.
At this point, you should have 4 “circles” that look like this.
Next take two circles and hold them together.
Then stitch them together. I just went back and forth a few times.
Then take another circle and stitch it together in the same way.
And finally the last one.
They should look like this.
Set it aside for a minute.
Using the last circle, cut two parallel slits.
This will be where the alligator clip goes.
Using your coordinating fabric scrap
and button kit, make your button.
Take off the shank on the back of the button-
I use pliers for this.
Using your glue gun, load up the back of the
button with glue and place in the middle of the
flowers quickly, covering where you stitched.
Flip the flower over and use a lot of glue from your glue gun.
Lay the remaining circle w/ the alligator clip on the glue.
Make sure all the flower petals are glued to the backing.And that’s that!
Lay the remaining circle w/ the alligator clip on the glue.
Make sure all the flower petals are glued to the backing.And that’s that!
|I’d love for you to stop by 30days and say hi!

ReplySheldon Teitelbaum
I was sad for Xavier Becerra, and for the entire Jewish community, because of some of the obnoxious, arrogant and inaccurate things Sheldon Teitelbaum said during his interview with the mayoral candidate ("One on One With Xavier Becerra," March 30). When Becerra talked of adding 300 teachers to LAUSD, Teitelbaum said sarcastically, "How many kids on the Westside attend public schools?" Well, I know that my son and many other Jewish kids attend an excellent LAUSD school on the Westside that has remarkable teachers and an amazing principal. When Becerra talked of hiring more police, Teitelbaum cracked, "Since when was law enforcement a problem for the Westside, give or take a freeway chase or two?"
Without intending to, Teitelbaum made us, as Jews, look like elitist and isolated folks, when in fact there are hundreds of thousands of Jews in Los Angeles who do care about public education, crime prevention, and mutual respect between classes and races. I happen to be voting for Antonio Villaraigosa, so my concern is not that Teitelbaum's remarks are going to cost Becerra some votes. My concern is that Teitelbaum seems deeply out of touch with the realities of how Jews participate in our multiracial city and that he's portraying a level of disrespect and indifference that most Jews do not share.

President Bush
The Passover offering from Progressive Jewish Alliance's Douglas Mirell and Daniel Sokatch was a 15-point partisan attack on President George Bush and his "fanatic ideological conservatives" ("Where's the Outrage?" April 6). We "fanatics" really objected to the one item in their diatribe which actually deals with Israel. Mirell and Sokatch castigate the president for the "abandonment of a meaningful role ... in helping to resolve the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
The president, in office less than 90 days, has been very meaningfully involved in resolving the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. He welcomed Prime Minister Ariel Sharon with open arms. The president correctly blamed Yasser Arafat for the violence, told him to stop attacks on Israel and has refused to meet with him. Bush instructed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak that he needed to play a constructive role in the region and expressed concern about anti-Jewish hate speech in official Egyptian newspapers. The president had the State Department rap Syrian President Bashir Assad for comparing Israeli voters to Nazis. Finally, Bush vetoed an anti-Israel United Nations resolution.
While members of our community may or may not have voted for Bush, we expect that in this time of crisis, all members of our community will unite behind Israel and those who support her. While the Progressive Jewish Alliance may have 14 other reasons to disagree with Bush, on Israel the president has exceeded all expectations.

Israeli Arabs
I applaud the articles by Gerald Bubis ("Jewish Ethics and Israeli Arabs," March 30) and Gary Wexler ("Defining Arab Issues in Israel," March 30). The New Israel Fund (NIF) has worked for over 20 years to promote equality, fairness and justice for all of Israel's citizens, especially those populations that have traditionally been at a disadvantage -- women, children, Arab citizens, Mizrahim, new immigrants and non-Orthodox Jews. Please note that the correct phone number of NIF's Los Angeles office is (310) 282-0300.
David Moses, Regional Director, New Israel Fund, Los Angeles
I appreciate and cherish the history of Jewish ethics and values, yet I take exception to Gerald Bubis citing ethics during this latest Muslim war. I suggest Bubis concern himself with finding Muslims with an ethical approach to Jewish survival amongst our enemies.
Lou Averbach, Santa Monica
Referring to the 25 percent who did not agree with his premise of how to treat the Israeli Arabs, Gerald Bubis wrote: "A small minority, led by one vocal person, maintained that the only solution was to deport Israeli Arabs to one or more of the existing 22 Arab countries." That one vocal person he was referring to is me.
The event Bubis was a participant in was University of Judaism's Day of Learning on March 18. This event began with a dialogue among three rabbis of the Reform, Conservative and Orthodox movements, very ably moderated by Dr. Robert Wexler. The panelists were respectful of each other, although their views differed.
Bubis was not fair during the question-and-answer portion when he cut me off immediately after I said a few words and he realized where I was going with my position. At a time when it is so critical for Israel's security, all options should be considered.
The issue of Israel's relationship with the Arabs deserves a much more open discussion. I therefore challenge Bubis to a debate with his views and mine. I have confidence in an American Jewish audience to hear both sides and decide for themselves.

Rabbi Ed Feinstein
A very grateful thank you to Rabbi Ed Feinstein for the profound yet disarmingly simple thoughts that he expressed in his Torah Portion ("Learning to Listen," March 30). His words rang true in my innermost core. I smiled with recognition as I read the piece. I know of what he speaks. Though our circumstances are different, I know about being thrilled to be here, even though the going can get very rough. There is just too much to be amazed at. Yishar koach to you, Rabbi Feinstein.

Mike Tyson
Before Rabbi Harold Schulweis swoons to a dead faint over Mike Tyson's act of kindness ("Recognizing Goodness," March 23), we have to ask: Is this the same foul-mouthed Mike Tyson who went to prison convicted of raping a women in his hotel room and who chewed off the ear of his opponent in the boxing ring?

Kosher Coke
The article about kosher-for-Passover Coca-Cola says that seven out of ten staffers in your informal test preferred the taste of Kosher Coke to that of regular Coke ("Return of the Real Thing," March 30). The article implies that your result is meaningful (at least you say nothing to disabuse a reader of this conclusion).
Actually, if there were no difference and your comparisons are "blind," the probability is 17.2 percent that seven or more people out of 10 will say they prefer kosher-for-Passover Coke. There is another 17.2 percent probability that seven or more will say they prefer the corn syrup version. So there is no statistically significant evidence in your test for any difference between the two kinds of Coke.

In addition to touchscreen controls and the sexed-up pics seen in this post, the game now has network features, downloadable content and a synthesis system which rewards social cooperation.
From Siliconera:
Players can vote for what items they want to create and adding more people shortens the wait time. This feature is optional since you can synthesize items on your own, it just takes a really long time.
There's also been some medical schooling in King Corobo's domain, as NLKS will contain hospitals to heal your wounded warriors. This is a departure from the first game, an otherwise fun Wii title that saw your troops die on the battlefield, never to be seen again.
Here are a few more screens, along with a brief opening movie.
New Little King's Story hits the Japanese marketplace this week. It's also headed to Europe, though no release date is yet available. There's also no word on whether NLKS will make it to North America.

Lenses are sharp, not the cameras. If a lens seems to work "sharper" on one camera compared to another, it's just the camera body is in better focus calibration than the other camera.
I didn't think that there would be that big of a difference.... boy was I wrong. You don't even have to pixel peep to see the difference with the D7100, even at screen size, the difference in the quality of contrast is very apparent.

‘Ram Leela’ Movie, Songs, Trailer YouTube VIDEO: Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh Hot New Scene Revealed in Bed
>” and new photos including a hot scene with Ranveer Singh.
Aside from the rumors about Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone’s off-screen romantic relationship, it is no secret that the two will share a steamy love scene in “Ram Leela.”
Bollywood Life reported that Padukone looks gorgeous in her desi clothes while Singh shows off his sexual charm and hot body in Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s film. Although the actors refuse to talk about their off-screen and on-screen relationship, we get to see a glimpse of the romance in the trailer as well as some new photos.
Singh is seen without a shirt on as he plants a quick kiss on Padukone’s lips, who wears a white crop top with a long lengha skirt.
Not only will fans get to see the couple’s on-screen relationship, but some hot new dance moves in Padukone’s dance number, “Nagada Sang Dhol.” Padukone shows off singing and dancing in the garba influenced video as she is.
A new song called “Lahu Munh Lag Gaya” recently launched on Tuesday, revealing a new look for Padukone.

Schools will be "graded" on the test scores. A-level schools, and schools that improve a letter grade, will receive financial rewards. Students at schools that score F's twice within four years will be eligible for private-school vouchers or to transfer to a better-performing public school.
Earlier this year, state education officials estimate that of 3,271 schools statewide, as many as 169 schools, housing 152,000 students, could make the failing list within two years. But the latest FCAT scores, released last week, indicate that number could be higher. If the Bush grading scale were applied today, no Broward or Palm Beach schools would receive an "A." Proponents of the Bush reform plan say it's impossible to teach precisely what material will be on the FCAT, particularly since it emphasizes critical thinking rather than rote memory.
On parts of the test, students are asked to show their work and explain how they got their answers.
Florida Writes! has similar components. On this year's test, for example, eighth-graders explained who their hero is, and were asked to write persuasive pieces to convince a local television station to hire them as student reporters.
Backers say their plan is geared toward improving student achievement and that the tests will prove whether schools are meeting that goal. Provided teachers keep that goal in mind, backers of the Bush plan say it's not unreasonable for teachers to spend time preparing students for tests.
"It's not entirely bad to teach children how to take standardized tests," said state Rep. Alex Diaz de la Portilla, a Miami Republican and a key backer of the Bush plan in the House this spring. "And I don't believe that's where teachers will spend all of their time."From Cameroon to northern Italy and from Montreal to the Vatican, statements expressing "great joy" accompanied the news that a Canadian sister of Notre-Dame and two Italian missionary priests. Allegri joined him at the mission in 2013.
The three were kidnapped April 5 in Tchere, about 20 miles from Cameroon's border with Nigeria. Members of the Boko Haram terrorist group, active in Nigeria, were suspected of taking the three from their parish in Tchere.
Cardinal Fernando Filoni, prefect of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, happened to be visiting Cameroon when the three missionaries were released the night of May 31-June 1. He was able to meet them in Yaounde, Cameroon's capital, before flying back to Rome.
"We thank God for this moment of joy," the cardinal told Fides, the congregation's news agency. The three "were excited and happy and, I must say, in good physical and psychological condition. Certainly the fact that they were always together helped them to support each other."
He called their release "a welcome surprise and, above all, a grace."
Asked about the kidnappers' identity, Filoni told Fides, "the investigation is in the hands of the civil authorities."
Jesuit Fr. Federico Lombardi, Vatican spokesman, told Vatican Radio that Pope Francis had been following the case from the beginning. "We thank the Lord that it ended positively, but at the same time we continue to pray and work for an end to every form of violence, hatred and conflict throughout Africa and around the world."
A brief statement from the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops June 2 echoed the Vatican's satisfaction that the three church workers were safe and in good health.
In addition, Archbishop Paul-Andre Durocher of Gatineau, Quebec, conference president, asked for prayers for others who remain victims of abduction, violence and hatred in conflict zones in Africa and.Metro Delays

Cape Town - A locally produced shark exclusion net tested at Fish Hoek beach has been “successful beyond all initial expectations”, says the City of Cape Town.
And there are plans to make the nets, which are deployed and removed daily, a permanent feature on Fish Hoek beach from this month to May.
The project, a global first, is also a finalist in the Eco-Innovation Awards, hosted by Enviropaedia.
Amy Davison, the city’s environment and planning directorate, told the portfolio committee on Wednesday that the net has proved to be highly effective.
Great white sharks, bronze whalers, hammerheads and rays were excluded from the area enclosed by the net.
There have been two fatal shark attacks at Fish Hoek since 2006 and a third attack in 2011 where the victim lost a foot.
Davison said the attacks affected perceptions of Fish Hoek beach’s safety.
The lifesaving club lost the rights to host the SA Lifesaving Championships as other clubs were concerned about their members’ safety.
During the shark net trial period from March last year to May this year, Shark Spotters recorded 39 great white sightings on 22 different days. However, none entered the exclusion zone when the net was deployed.
Furthermore, the design of the net meant it was able to withstand weather and sea conditions, and there was hardly any entanglement of birds or other fish. It was deployed 140 times during the trial, at R1 200 per use.
Davison said the project had also created nine job opportunities.
“Overall, the results of the trial indicate that the exclusion net is a cost-effective, non-lethal shark safety measure with minimal impact on marine life.”

Skipper Peter Geddes (62) led the way in Vale’s total of 250-4 from 50 overs after winning the toss and electing to bat.
Ryan Newhook (53 not out), Ryan Hill (39no), Mark Whitney (35) and Sam Arthurs (26) weighed in with runs after opener Jack Galpin (8) was dismissed cheaply.
Woodmancote finished agonisingly close in reply but were restricted to 248-9 as Vale claimed a vital win to move up to third-from-bottom in the table above Corse and Staunton and Stroud.
The wickets were shared between Newhook (2-36), John Dolan (2-34), Hill (2-23) and Arthurs (2-63) as Chris Oliver’s 80 was not enough.

National Public Radio had this to say about "The Wierd Poetry of the Olympic Twitter Tracker"
The best part is that every box has the most-mentioned terms on that topic inside it. Right this second as I type this — ask in 60 seconds and it will have changed — there is a box that says, in words of decreasing size, "Curling pants Norwegian Olympic Olympics team." We're not the only ones who are fascinated by those pants, to say the least.
Another box — much smaller — has room only for "Johnny tonight."
You wait a minute, and it changes again. "Shaun White Olympics gold night last mctwist double amazing."
It's accidental poetry of a sort, where unrelated words bump into each other in unintended ways — "double amazing" — and all of a sudden, it's just, "Why, yes. It was double amazing. Thank you, unwieldy hive mind!"
Now the curling box has changed again, and it says, among other things, "Olympic pants team." Now that is a sport. (I imagine this: "I'm Bob Costas, reporting on the progress of the U.S. Olympic pants team, where the always powerful Russians are the biggest threat to hopes for the nation's first gold in the pants event in more than 30 years.")By Judy McKinnon

In some important ways, human history has been a site for repeated assertion of egalitarian urges, manifest in religious, as well as secular ideologies. On the other hand, individual acquisitiveness in the context of socialised production has resulted in encompassing inequalities, yet this has been the driving force for change. Karl Marx envisaged an alternative in the abolition of private property and complete socialisation of production and distribution of wealth, he also visualised technology increasingly displacing human labour in the process of economic production. While his latter vision is coming true in some measure, the substitution of the denial of the self for society as motor for production has proved a disaster. Does the experience, however, terminate the search for an alternative to personal acquisition as the guide for economic and social.Astros (32-47) at Pirates (42-36)
7:05 PM EST–PNC Park, Pittsburgh
Here is the MLB.com Gameday
TV: ROOT Sports
After completing a 4-3 road trip that looked to be pretty difficult, the Pirates come home this week to face the lowly Houston Astros for a four game set. Nothing is a given in this league – especially with the Pirates – but this is a great opportunity for them to gain some ground.
About the Astros:
When we last saw the Astros, they were overachieving a bit and hanging around despite being projected to have a horrendous year. That hasn’t lasted though, and now they’ve the bad team that everyone anticipated. The Astros have the 4th worst record in baseball and are coming off a sweep at the hands of the lowly Cubs. They’re also going through a strange situation with 1B Carlos Lee. Houston is attempting to get rid of him and his giant contract, and had a deal in place with the Dodgers to do so this weekend…but Lee wouldn’t waive his no-trade clause, so the Astros are still stuck with him. Awkward!
Also, when mentioning Carlos Lee, I feel obligated to link this.
Tonight’s starters…
Jordan Lyles (2-4, 4.59) vs. James McDonald (7-3, 2.44)
The 21-year-old Lyles has not been having a very good year at all. His ERA and WHIP are high, and he has 30 K’s and 20 walks in 51 innings (not a good ratio). The youngster could turn out to be useful for the Astros in the future, but probably not in the near future. He pitched pretty well in his previous two starts, but those were against the Royals and Padres.
McDonald, fresh off his All-Star snub, will be looking for another dominant outing. It would be fantastic if JMac and A.J. Burnett can deliver strong starts to really put the Bucs in control of this series in the first two games.

PreviewsFive students (three from the US, two from Brazil) were arrested last month while doing paleoclimate research in Brazil. They were collecting sediment cores from lakes and wetlands, in order to understand past climate change in western Brazil. The charges were based on Brazilian laws dealing with unauthorized extraction of mineral resources. (The group had research permits which they believed to be valid, but apparently they did not cover all members of the group.) The students have been released on bail, but the American students have to stay in Brazil until the legal process is complete – which could take months or years.
Arizona Geology has a full explanation from Dr. Andrew Cohen, co-director of the project. He has drafted a letter to Brazilian authorities, explaining the nature of the work and urging the authorities to allow the students to return to the US. He is looking for people who are willing to co-sign the letter. If you want to co-sign it, send an e-mail to Dr. Cohen. If you know people who would be willing to co-sign (especially people with prestigious affiliations and officers of scientific societies), please pass on the information.
(And if you’re a blogger in the climate science community, could you help make sure that the news is spread to climate scientists as well?)Scientists May Have Finally Found a Practical Test for String Theory 3Jamie Condliffe and 60 othersEditDelete InviteInvite manuallyPromoteXDismissXUndismissBlock for gizmodoHide String theory a beautiful, elegant piece of science which claims to unify all the forces in the Universe by representing tiny point-like particles as one-dimensional vibrating strings.

Ruth Rendell is my favorite author and I've read everything she's written; I prefer her psychological thrillers to her Wexfords. I got to meet her in person at three different book signings when she was in New York; one was a reading of THE CROCODILE BIRD and one was a couple of years earlier when she was in town to coincide with the annual Fifth Avenue Book Fair which takes place on a Sunday late in September. Most recently I saw her at the 86th Street Barnes & Noble where she read the opening chapter to THE VAULT, her Wexford sequel to A SIGHT FOR SORE EYES.
I have seen some of the dramatizations of her work, and the only ones which really did justice were DEAD LUCKY which was a dramatization of THE LAKE OF DARKNESS; and AN AFFAIR IN MIND (1988), which was a dramatization of THE FACE OF TRESPASS. I did not like the film versions of GALLOWGLASS, A DEMON IN MY VIEW, A DARK ADAPTED EYE, TREE OF HANDS (which shows up on late night TV under the title INNOCENT VICTIM and stars Helen Shaver and Lauren Bacall and was recently made as a French film entitled BETTY FISHER AND OTHER STORIES), HEARTSTONES or MASTER OF THE MOOR. Other novels of Rendell which I have seen (and which were fine, but never as good as the books) include A FATAL INVERSION, THE BRIDESMAID, GOING WRONG, NO NIGHT IS TOO LONG, ROAD RAGE and TALKING TO STRANGE MEN (another favorite of mine).
I have seen and not liked two versions of A JUDGMENT IN STONE which have been made into films. One was called THE HOUSEKEEPER (starring Rita Tushingham) and one was called LA CEREMONIE (starring Isabel Huppert). I found both of these dramatizations not faithful to the book and more violent than the book. Although they do contain many incidents from the book, and the two filmed versions are very similar to each other, they both completely miss the point (in my opinion) which is that this is a crime that would not have happened if the murderer were not illiterate. This is only peripheral to the films, but integral to the book and brilliantly presented.
LIVE FLESH was made into a particularly unfaithful version, which retained only the central idea of a cop being shot and the criminal engaging in a love triangle with the cop's wife after the criminal gets out of prison. The locale was changed to Madrid, losing the very Britishness that is so much an enjoyable part of Rendell's works, and the social phobia which afflicted the central character, so important in the book, was omitted in the film.
I recently (2012) discovered that ONE ACROSS, TWO DOWN was made into a 1976 film called DIARY OF THE DEAD starring Hector Elizondo, Austin Pendleton and Geraldine Fitzgerald, but I have not been able to track it down.
What appeals to me about Rendell's writing is the way she is able to convey sympathy and identification with her criminals by making you see the world through their eyes. She does this with an accretion of detail which, at the beginning of some of the books, is sometimes tedious, but which eventually is very suspenseful, because you know something is going to happen, but you don't necessarily know when or (sometimes) to whom. And it all unfolds before you and there is nothing you can do to warn the eventual victim.
I think the reason I prefer her psychological thrillers to her Wexfords is that, at its heart, her writing is not about detection, and so her continuing detective characters, Wexford and Burden, are a lot less interesting than her other characters which show up for only a single book. The Wexfords are not really "police procedural" in the way that, for example, Ed McBain's 87th PRECINCTs are. Instead her writing is about the events that push people over the edge to commit crimes, and which show that there but for the grace of God, go you or I.
Despite my enjoyment of her books, it is a surprise to me so many of them have been dramatized because her plots generally occur over a long time and her novels consist of conversations and interior dialogues which would be difficult if not impossible to convey visually; they would require narration, which is often awkward. The miniseries version of GALLOWGLASS has quite a bit of narration and is not particularly enthralling compared to the book.
In addition, unlike most mystery novels, there are generally not a series of murders in Rendell's plots; and the thrust of the writing is almost never to figure out who the murderer is. It is more about the inevitability of a tragedy occurring which is often set off by something very minor but which builds and builds until the "straw which breaks the camel's back".
My very favorite of her books is A SIGHT FOR SORE EYES, which unlike her previous ones seems to have great cinematic potential and cries out for a Hitchcockian director. I also found NO NIGHT IS TOO LONG to be an absolute page turner. SIGHT was made into a film in France in 2003, but I have not seen it.
Rendell's books are not easily synopsized and are challenging to read. I am contacted from time to time by people who are doing reports on her for their homework, and who, basically, want me to falsify their homework for them, and I don't, so if you are such a student, please do not contact me. I also have no biographical information about her; so try the library.
However, I will give you an idea to develop. It seems to me in all Rendell's fiction, a common element is how lives are changed by very casual things, a decision, a coincidence, a chance meeting. I believe all of Rendell's works are cautionary tales of how easy it is to ruin lives by doing something, or failing to do something, that in and of itself is of no great moment, but which sets you down a road from which there is no return.
If you are new to Ruth Rendell and want a suggestion of a book to start, my choice is LAKE OF DARKNESS. Unlike many of her books which jump backwards and forwards in time, this was written in an almost completely linear fashion. As with most of her novels, it cuts between two sets of characters who pass each other in the course of the book but don't actually meet up until the very last couple of pages when a death occurs. It is atypical of Rendell in that there is more than one murder (although most of the murders are not important to the plot, but are to flesh out the character of the murderer), and one of the characters actually explains to another quite late in the book everything that has occurred so far - something which I don't think you'll find in any other of her books. It's also a fast book to read compared to some of the others that seem to take longer to get rolling.
Works of Ruth Rendell which have been made into British TV movies or miniseries which I have not seen include:
I have seen two Wexfords, but so long ago, I can't
remember much about them:
HAKE HANDS FOREVER (1988) and
NO CRYING HE MAKES (1988)
plus a few novels/short stories which have shown up on
American TV under the umbrella title RUTH
RENDELL
MYSTERIES:
BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION (1997)
A CASE OF COINCIDENCE (1996)
SECRET HOUSE OF DEATH (1996)
In an interview in PUBLISHERS WEEKLY (January 28, 2002), Ruth talks about ANNA'S BOOK: It's called ASTA'S BOOK in England . . . I called her Asta, but my publisher at Harmony, an imprint of Random House, told me there were various things that disquieted him about the name because it was around the time Barbara Bush wrote that book about a dog . . . [MILLIE'S BOOK] And Asta was the dog in the old THIN MAN series. So I thought, oh, God, if everyone thinks this is a dog's diary, that's horrible! So that's why I changed the title. The couple in that book is not really my grandparents, but the stories and lifestyle are authentic family details.
When asked about whether she has seen and enjoyed the TV adaptations based on her work, Ruth said that the Pedro Almodovar version of LIVE FLESH is very loosely based, but rather a good film. The best one that the BBC did was A FATAL INVERSION. The BBC is now doing NO NIGHT IS TOO LONG, and I have high hopes for it.
In an interview with Marianne MacDonald filed April 11, 2005, to publicize her latest Barbara Vine THE MINOTAUR, MacDonald writes : Ruth Rendell had a terrible childhood and her adulthood has been tempestuous. But does this help to explain her twin obsessions, psychopaths and punctuality?
Rendell is 75, fit and upright, incredibly young-looking for her age, with a humor dry as a French chablis. Her hair is dyed ashy blonde; her eyes are unusually blue.
She says: I do empathize with people who are driven by dreadful impulses. I think to be driven to want to kill must be such a terrible burden. I try, and I think I succeed, in making my readers feel pity for my psychopaths, because I do.
When she was asked nine years ago if she was writing from experience about psychopaths, a long pause ensued. I could hardly have reached my age and not suffered terrible unhappiness, distress and breakdown,' Rendell replied. We all go through it, unless we are extremely dull or insensitive. I didn't have the sort of breakdown that caused one to be hospitalized, but perhaps today it would.
We are in the downstairs living-room. The drawing-room window overlooks shark-like black houseboats on the canal; but the living-room backs on to the garden, where Rendell's ginger tom, Archie, is forced to endure a pitched battle with the tigerish bengal tom from next door. Black bookcases frame hundreds of volumes. The open-plan kitchen is cream, the coffee-table covered in books - volume three of Proust's In Search of Lost Time (the new translation), Philip Roth, Suetonius.
Rendell's phobias seems to be the legacy of her Swedish mother, Ebba, who fell ill with multiple sclerosis that went undiagnosed for years. She and Rendell's father, Arthur Grasemann (they were both school teachers based in east London), had a terrible marriage, continually shrieking at each other, giving each other the silent treatment and threatening to leave. A sensitive only child, Rendell seems to have found the atmosphere terrifying. In self-defense she created an inner voice that described what was going on as if it was a story, and so her writing began. But the fear remained, streaming out in her terror of being late, her need to keep busy, and her obsession with routine. She often says that she doesn't think any families are ever happy and that the world is an amoral place.
Ruth Rendell published her first novel, FROM DOON WITH DEATH, when she was 34. She had started writing after getting married at 20 and having a baby. She had been fired from her first job on the South Woodford local newspaper for writing up the tennis club's annual jamboree without mentioning that the chairman dropped dead while making his speech. The man she married was Don Rendell, her boss on the paper. They stayed together until he died of prostate cancer six years ago, bar a tumultuous period in her mid-forties where she left him, plunged into an affair and then went back and remarried him.
She gets up at 6am, lets the cats out, works out on her exercise machines, and writes from 8.30am to noon. Plots never dry up.
Something happens. I read something or somebody tells me something and the idea is started. I got the idea for THE MINOTAUR, for instance, from, thinking, "How would it be for a family who had one member with an illness they completely misdiagnosed and they blamed this person, and eventually it was discovered what it was? And then what happens, in what is fashionably called the dysfunctional family?
On October 5, 2005, Dinita Smith wrote in the NEW YORK TIMES: In 1997 Rendell became Baroness Rendell of Babergh. She writes in the mornings, then attends the House of Lords when it is in session. She shows her work to only one person before sending it to her publisher, she said, a fellow Peer whom she will not name. Her average is three books every two years.

a map, which claims that the setting was based on the West
Sussex town of Midhurst, although Romsey in Hampshire was the
site for the TV adaptations with George Baker.

May 2015.Frequently Asked Questions
QUESTION:
Is parchment paper and wax paper the same?
In the past they lined pans with wax paper for baking cookies, etc., is parchment paper and wax paper the same only a name change?
ANSWER:
No, waxed paper and parchment paper are not the same.
Waxed paper is tissue paper coated on both sides with a paraffin wax which helps the paper resist moisture and grease but will melt or burn if it comes in direct contact with the heat source.
Parchment paper is paper that is coated with silicone, making it moisture and grease resistant. Unlike waxed paper, it can withstand exposure to temperatures up to 420°F (215°C) in the oven. Parchment paper will brown when exposed to oven heat, but won't burn. It should not be used in ovens heated above 420°F (215°C) or under the broiler.
Parchment paper is more expensive of the two, but works far better for lining pans for baked foods. Fact is, I would not recommend baking cookies on a waxed paper-lined pan because the paper can get hot enough to smoke.

The press will attempt to portray liberal Democrat Michelle Nunn as a “moderate” U.S. Senate candidate but she has been endorsed by Jane Fonda, who also donated money to her campaign. Now she has two former Hillary Clinton campaign aides working on her campaign. Guaranteed: Anyone who works for Hillary Clinton is a true left-winger. Michelle Nunn is not a moderate. I still remember Sam Nunn voting for the Panama Canal giveaway and against the Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination. He was always there whenever the liberals needed him. Another donor to the Nunn Senate campaign is RINO former Indiana Senator Richard Lugar, who kicked in $5,000. Good riddance to him. Political “experts” claimed a few years ago that Lugar was unbeatable, but he lost the Republican Primary last year. Lugar would’ve fit in as a Democrat.

RadioLan has a 10 Mb/s at 5 GHz product, rather very short range and no Linux drivers. This product has been discontinued.
WebGear Aviator 900 MHz : connect to the parallel port and offer cable replacement solution. No functional Linux driver. This product has been discontinued.
The IBM Wireless LAN Entry is a discontinued product that may be sometime found for a very very low price. Unfortunately, there is no working driver for those and information on the device is impossible to find. This product has been discontinued.
Both TI and Broadcom are very unfriendly toward Linux. They don't release Linux drivers or any information to help build Linux drivers for their cards despite using Linux drivers internally and in some products. Open Source drivers for those cards exist, based on reverse engineering, but because those drivers probably will never support all features/models of those cards and because of the overall attitude of those companies, you may want to avoid those cards.
Conexant (formerly Intersil) seems to have reverted their
previously pro-Linux approach to ignoring the Linux community (which
did help them so much).
5.2 Win32 drivers
Two packages enable the use of Win32 wireless LAN drivers under
Linux :
Some people have strong objections to using Win32 drivers under Linux. Obviously, such a solution is restricted to the i386 architecture, and make use of a lot of binary code. Also, some less used Wireless Extensions features are not available in the NDIS specification (such as link quality, noise level, iwspy, master and monitor mode).
Most drivers are GPL, which prevent their use with non-GPL kernels (so commercial operating systems can't reuse the code) and prevent to use portions of the source in non-GPL drivers, except with the explicit authorisation from the author.
Some other drivers come with a binary library, which restrict its potential use (the driver can't be ported to other architectures).
This may be restrict what you can do with those drivers, but those people have spend long nights and week ends convincing the hardware manufacturer to release information, writing and debugging the code, so please respect their copyrights and decisions.
They are many more products available than the ones that I've listed (which are the most common). If your favourite wireless LAN is not listed above, either there is no driver under Linux that I know of, or it is an OEM version of one of these (same hardware under a new brand).
To have a good picture of all the devices available and their characteristics, you should redirect your favourite browser to :
5.5 Other Wireless technologies
These devices are a totally independent box (like other bridges, routers or gateways) and not a card to plug in your PC, so have no interactions with Linux.
More information on IrDA for Linux is available at :
There is also some real Wireless LANs using diffuse infrared (no more peer to peer), but I don't have much information on these.
More information on BlueTooth for Linux is available at :
Digital mobile phones (GSM, TDMA, CDMA, PHS) very often allow data connections (slow and expensive). Most of them offer a standard serial interface with an extended AT command set, so can be configured like a normal modem : PPP over the serial port.
Some Nokia GSM phones use a kind of half winmodem interface where the upper layer handling is done by the host. For these phones you need gnokii (). This package also provide tools to play with various extra features of the phone (SMS, address book...).
Of course, the ultimate geek challenge is to use IrDA (see section 5.5.3) to connect your mobile phone to your laptop. That's done with PPP over IrComm or gnokii.
In most cases, Wireless WANs such as CDPD cards, the Metricom Ricochet and ARDIS should use modem interface as well.Cramer recounts the story in his "Care with the Cure of Souls" blog and as part of a locally produced book.
"A parishioner of mine, David Theune, has been working on a project for a while," Cramer explains in his blog. "He, along with over 200 people in the Spring Lake community, read the book, 'Sticks and Stones: Defeating the Culture of Bullying and Rediscovering the Power of Character and Empathy' by Emily Bazelon. Several community initiatives came out of the project, one of the most interesting of which was the idea to put together a book with stories of empathy shared by people in our community."
Cramer tells of his struggle with coming across people begging on city streets and how he would pass them by. That was, until one evening as he and his wife were celebrating their fifth wedding anniversary.

"It's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than it is for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven" as Jesus says in the book of Matthew. Another memorable bit of advice brought to us by that same wise Jewish carpenter is "If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven." I'm not a religious man personally but there's no shortage of good stuff in the Bible as well as the holy books of most religions. In some of the Nordic countries the religious parties and the economically left-wing factions in parliament are completely on the same page policy-wise in terms of advocating a strong social safety net supported by relatively high taxes. The "social justice" aspects of Christianity seem to be in the midst of a resurgence, and Pope Francis focusing on poverty probably has a lot to do with that.
Once in Chicago as I was heading into a Dunkin Donuts, an apparently homeless guy asked me for spare change so that he could buy some food. I invited him to come in with me instead, where I bought him a coffee and a muffin. We ate and had an interesting chat, although I had to talk the manager out of kicking us out.
The guy seemed very intelligent. Assuming he was telling the truth, he'd had all kinds of adventures in the army and just never managed to transition back to civilian life, but he said he lived on the streets partially by choice as well because of the freedom. He had a really deep knowledge of literature essentially just from hanging out in the library so much during the day as many homeless folks do, and it was completely surreal to get recommendations of some good 1000+ page Russian novels from a guy dressed in rags who'd been asking me for change a few minutes earlier. Another guy in Chicago got a couple bucks out of me as well as a laugh with his refreshingly honest sign reading, "Need spare change to buy a blunt and 40 oz King Cobra."

>.One of the true innovators was Richard "Grass" Green! Below Janice Green (Grass' widow), sums it most poiently.
I would like to say that we were a very special couple. My husband was very dear to me. He was truly sent to me by God. I enjoyed the time we had together.
However, there were times I would ask myself why did I marry this guy, especially after attending my first comic convention in Rosemont, Illinois. I was in a world I had never heard of nor seen and did not want to do either of them again. As I watched Richard move about the crowd I could see that this was definitely his world. When people came into his presence there was an awe and respect for him that I could not understand.
I came to realize that this man, my husband was a giant and a pioneer for all African Americans that were about to enter this world of comic book writing. He was a man who was never given much credit for all that he had done by paving the way for African Americans.
During our 14 years of marriage I was blessed to have a man who not only was a very talented comic book artist but he was also a great piano player and singer. We spent weekends together while he played and sang at some night club, American Legion or AM Vets Club. He was as well loved at these places as he was in the comic world.
Richard was not only loved and respected outside of our home, he was truly loved and respected in our home. He was a devoted Christian, a loving husband, my best friend and a loving dad.
September 11, 2001 was a very sad one. I will always remember this day not only because I had just seen one of our country�s worst disasters, but I was confronted with some of the worst news a wife could hear. Your husband has a year at the most to live. Richard was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. He was given 6 months to a year to live. We had just started making plans to fulfill our dreams of hitting the road as we both were getting ready to retire. This dream never came true.
However, Richard and I spent as much time together as possible. These were some very hard days for us, but we knew God had never made a mistake and we were sure He was not about to start now. Richard had a life long dream and that was to publish one of his many characters X-Klor. And that dream was made possible by the hard work of Bill Schelly, Alter Ego and TwoMorrows Publishing. I owe them so much for making Grass�s dream a reality.
Richard died at home on August 5, 2002, and my life has not been the same. Even though I have had to face a very difficult time, making adjustments to my life without Richard, I am grateful to God that He allowed Richard to become a very important factor in my life. I will always love Richard. I have said good-bye to the physical Richard, but I will never say good-bye to his spirit.
Thanks again for allowing me to pay tribute to a very special man.

The biggest plus is the internet and how we now communicate with other cultures in other countries instead of reading about them in a printed book. This gives us power over the greedy idiots who fill our heads with propoganda. When we connect with others we have another source for information that the higher ups wish we never had access to. Gives them less control. Social order by mutual respect instead of fear and killing. Overall a good thing. Racism, bigotry, suspicions will be put in their graves. But communication is becoming less oral and we may evolve into mutes.
Ask yourself next time you need a bypass
If it isn't you're doing it wrong. You don't HAVE to use it just because they make it.
In one way yes, but in another no.
Well if the idea of never learning anything other then what your father did for a living, getting married at around 12 and dying at the oldest possible age being 40 or less sounds good then no technology is not helping that at all... We are living longer with more access to information the ability to choose and decide what we want to do and who we want to be with.<br />
<br />
Sure technology has its misuse but nothing so good comes with only a positive. Even with all the negatives more positives are coming out as time progresses. If your talking about issues that are appearing today because of technology its simply that they where not as well known prior to it. <br />
<br />
Things happened less a few hundreds years ago for many reasons.<br />
1.) News didn't travel far nor did it travel fast<br />
2.) There were simply less people for things to happen to<br />
3.) Most things remained intentionally isolated because it was impossible to spread information<br />
<br />
Nothing really new is happening because of technology in terms of social and psychological events people want to claim are caused by some form of technology. Its just that we hear about it more that it can be spread around easier we know whats going on and there are more people to listen or do it.
You're asking this . . . on the internet? <br />
<br />
YES! Of course it's made things better. There's downsides to everything of course, but no sane person would want to live in a less advanced age with all the dirt, disease, health problems, manual labour, poor choice of food, etc, etc, that would go with it.
for some things, yes. but i think that the more advanced technology gets, the less we will have to do ourselves. in the long run we could end up like the humans in the movie wall-e.
Yes and no. Yes it makes life in many ways -- life is much easier physically. But I am afraid that our modern technological inventions, once we are thru with them and we toss them in the trash are polluting our land, water, air and ultimately ourselves. Today's garbage is toxic as compared to the garbage of one thousand years ago -- actually it was beneficial to the environment. I wished they could come up with a system of burning our garbage to produce electricity instead of burying it in landfills. I think that would be a great invention.
yes it has helped when used in a positive way but than you always have the bad guys that will find a way to breach someone's security so in that way it makes us all open to hackers. Did I say I was afraid of this already? I also think personal service in terms of companies is essential. No one hates a computer voice more than I. sigh.. there is always a trade off with everything.
No, not really. It has removed much of the down time we used to use for relaxing and not worrying about deadlines. Do we really need to check our e-mails 5 times a day? Tracking times of job cards at work is insanely picky and we are expected to account for almost every second of the day. I firmly believe that we are far too 'time is money' focussed and try my best to 'just breathe'.
In many ways yes, but when used improperly or in excess it can have bad effects.

PSALM 89:15
DISCRIMINATION. -- Father still managed a faint smile in this June 10, 1950 photo, assisting New York Auxiliary Bishop Stephen Donohue, in spite of learning the hard way, as "an outsider," what "ethnic discrimination" meant in the Irish (St. Stephen, Manhattan) and Italian (St. Clare, Bronx) parishes of the New York Archdiocese of the 1950s.The second went 1-2-3 for both sides. LA got its first baserunner in the third with two outs in the third when Kershaw walked, but he was left at first. The Bucs got a one out walk to Mercer and a two out knock by Gaby to put Pirates on the corners, but Martin flew out to end the fun.
Yasiel Puig opened the fourth with a knock; an out later he was forced at second on a great play by Pedro. It helped; Andre Ethier followed with a single, but Mercer gloved a hard bouncer to end the frame. The Bucs went down in order.
LA lit the board in the fifth. AJ Ellis singled with an out and was bunted to second, and Skip Schumaker lined a single to right with two down. There was a play at the plate, but Brandon Inge's throw was weak and it was a tied game; the game's two runs have been thanks to fielders more than pitchers so far. The Bucs again went down without a peep.
Adrian Gonzalez opened the sixth by smacking a ground rule double to left center. That was followed by a Ramirez roller up the middle to put Blue on the corners with no outs. Andre Ethier banged one through the left side to give LA the lead, and Presley booted the ball, putting runners at second and third. That was it for Cumpton; the second time through the order took its toll. He went five, giving up three runs on seven hits and a walk with five K after 76 pitches, and Bryan Morris took the ball. Mark Ellis lifted a sac fly to make it 3-1, and Juan Uribe drew a five pitch walk. With two outs, Morris lost Kershaw on four pitches, but got Schumaker on a soft roller to Walker.
The Bucs tried to answer. Cutch singled and Gaby reached when he swung and missed at a 3-2 pitch, but was awarded first when his bat ticked Ellis' mitt. Martin then almost gave the Bucs the lead, but Schumaker's leap at the wall in left brought back what would have been a three-run dinger, taking it away from
fans who didn't put up much of a fight. Given that reprieve, Kershaw tucked The Kid and Pedro away.
Pedro robbed Puig to open the seventh with his second nice stop at the hot corner. and Morris retired Gonzalez and Ramirez routinely on a grounder and whiff. Kershaw finished the inning at 113 pitches, but doesn't look too gassed - he struck out the side. Justin Wilson retired LA in order in the eighth, and the Bucs made a game of it.
Chris Withrow climbed the hill; a Mercer single and Cutch walk put him in a quick hole. But he got Gaby and Martin looking, both on hooks. Sanchez's was particularly frustrating, as it was hung curve up around the letters, but froze him. Don Mattingly brought in LHP Paco Rodriguez. He turned around Walker, but The Kid lined a single to left to make it 3-2. Paco got Pedro on a roller, but at least the Bucs cashed in for a run.
Tony Watson came on for the ninth and put the Dodgers down without a sweat. The Bucs stayed alive, though, when Travis Snider banged a heater into the tenth row in right center off of Kenley Jansen to knot the score. Mark Melancon put the Dodgers down in the tenth on a half dozen pitches.
The Pirates came this close to taking it in their half. Peter Moylan was on the hill, and is tough on righties. After getting a pair of outs, he walked Martin and Walker, batting lefty, drilled a ball into the corner. Martin would have scored easily with a crystal ball; but was held, correctly, by Nick Leyva when the ball was run down quickly by Puig, who has a rifle, and on its way in before before Martin was at the sack. The throw, however, missed the cutoff and went halfway up the line. Pedro was walked intentionally, and Mike McKenry, pinch hitting, popped out on the first pitch. The key play of the inning may have been early on, when Uribe sprawled to take away a hit from Sanchez for the second out.
Vin Mazzaro took the ball and gave up a lead off double to Ethier in the eleventh. He was bunted to second, and with the infield in, Uribe chopped one over Pedro to score the run. He went to second on a wild pitch and scored on a two-out double by pinch hitter Nick Punto, taking a ball the opposite way into The Notch.
The Pirates gave it a run against Brandon League. Snider started with an infield single, diving headfirst into the sack and maybe getting a call. After a Presley force out, Mercer singled off Uribe's glove, and the Bucs were in business with Cutch up. A wild pitch moved the runners to second and third, but Cutch bounced out to third. That left it up to Gaby, who got good wood on a liner to left, but it hung up for Schumaker and the Pirates went down 5-3.
The Bucs were 1-for-13 with RISP and left five runners on in the two extra frames; the Dodgers were 5-for-11 and stranded one guy in overtime; that pretty well determined the results. The lineup against lefties is kinda shy, though, with Starling Marte and JT both on ice.
Zach Greinke takes on Gerrit Cole tomorrow.
- Today's attendance was 36,941.

- JP Howell dropped his appeal and will start serving his two game suspension for his part in a brawl a few days ago. The LA lefty worked two innings yesterday, so he'd probably be off today anyhow.
- Cory Giger of the Altoona Mirror tweets that RHP Stolmy Pimentel was promoted to AAA Indy and RHP Nick Kingham was called up to the Curve from Bradenton.
- Jim Callis of Baseball America reports that fifth round SS Trae Arbet signed for a $425K bonus. The prep player was expected to require an overslot deal; his draft spot has a $321,400 value.Stateside for Wednesday, January 15th, 2014

We learned this week that young people account for less than 25% of people who have enrolled in the health care exchanges. Their participation is considered crucial for the success of the Affordable Care Act.
We’ll find out what it will take to get young Americans to sign up. And then, can the Affordable Care Act improve access to mental health care? We'll talk about what the ACA means for treating mental illness that story later in the hour.
But first, Governor Snyder delivers his fourth State of the State address tomorrow night. Zoe Clark and Rick Pluta co-hosts of Michigan Radio’s It’s Just Politics join me now.

A Maryland county’s board of education has proposed a policy that would to copyright work created by its staff and students for school–which would mean that even something like a first-grader’s drawing would belong to the school system.
“The way this policy is written, it essentially says if a student writes a paper, goes home and polishes it up and expands it, the school district can knock on the door and say, ‘We want a piece of that,’ ” David Rein, a lawyer and adjunct at the University of Missouri in Kansas City School of Law told the Washington Post. “I can’t imagine that.”
The policy was recommended largely to clarify who owns curricula created by teachers while using apps on iPads that are school property, Prince George’s County Board of Education chair Verjeana M. Jacobs told the Post.
Jacobs said the district never intended to declare ownership of students’ work, and that the language of the proposal needs to be restructured. “We want the district to get the recognition…not take [students’] work,” she told the Post.
American University law professor Peter Jaszi called the policy “sufficiently extreme” and wonders if it would actually be legal as written. For it to be legal, Jaszi said, there would have to be an agreement between a student and the board to allow his or her work to be copyrighted.
Kevin Welner, the director of the National Education Policy Center at the University of Colorado, told the Post that he thinks the proposal is revenue-driven. There is a significant secondary online market for teachers’ lesson plans, he said.
“I think it’s just the district saying, ‘If there is some brilliant idea that one of our teachers comes up with, we want be in on that,” Welner said. “Not only be in on that, but to have it all.’ ”

Aashima Khosla
Aashima Khosla is a doctoral candidate in Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics. She received her bachelor's degree in biochemistry from Delhi University and her master's degree in biotechnology from M.S. University of Baroda, India. Her doctoral research focuses on the plant specific class, IV HD-Zip transcription factors, that contains START, which is a special binding domain. HD-ZIP IV TFs are involved in differentiation of the epidermis, the outermost cellular layer that plays a critical role in plant defense against pathogens and in protection from environmental stresses. The START domain from plants is functionally similar to mammalian counterparts, and that they can modulate transcription factor activity through potential ligands and via protein-protein interactions. In humans, START domains occur in cholesterol transporters, and misexpression of several members is observed in tumor cells. Gaining a fundamental understanding of START domain function in transcription factors may enable scientists to improve plant traits such as stress resistance, as well as understand more about cancer progression. Her major professor is Kathrin Schrick, assistant professor of biology.
Khosla plans to use the funds to attend the 2015 Plant Metabolic Engineering Gordon Research Conference in New Hampshire where she plans to present her work on the functional characterization of the START lipid/sterol binding domain in homeodomain transcription factors from plants. Khosla will discuss her results on putative protein-metabolite interactors of the START domain. This conference will help Khosla learn from, exchange ideas with and build an academic network of top scholars in the plant community.
Courtney Passow
Courtney Passow is a doctoral candidate in Biology. She received her bachelor's degree in biology from Texas A&M University. Her doctoral research focuses on determining the underlying genetic and physiological mechanisms of adaptation to natural stressor by using an extremophile fish that lives in the presence of naturally occurring toxic hydrogen sulfide. Adaptation can allow populations to persist in novel environments characterized by harsh conditions. This process typically involves changes in structural, behavioral, or physiological traits leading to an increase in organismal survival under specific environments. Structural traits and corresponding genetic differences along environmental gradients have frequently been used to infer adaptation in natural systems, but identifying the genes underlying adaptation remains a challenge. Most studies attempting to identify the genetic basis of adaptation have focused on structural adaptations, yet the underlying genetic changes of physiological adaptations are less understood. Passow's research is geared towards making significant contributions to the understanding of mechanisms mediating adaptation to extreme environments. Her major professor is Michael Tobler, assistant professor of biology.
Passow plans to use the funds to attend the Ecological and Evolutionary Genomics Gordon Research Conference in Biddeford, ME where she plans to present her research. This conference focuses on how genome-enabled approaches are helping to rapidly advance the understanding of the complicated relationships between genotypes, phenotypes and the environment. Attending this conference will help Passow gain further knowledge in her field of study and develop contacts for future long-term collaborations.

Appeal from the United States District Court for the District of Oregon.
Before ALARCON, REINHARDT and THOMPSON, Circuit Judges.
DAVID R. THOMPSON, Circuit Judge:
The Jeanery, Inc., which is affiliated by common ownership with Rock Bottom Jean Co. (collectively referred to as "The Jeanery"), won a jury verdict in its antitrust suit against James Jeans, Inc., a clothing manufacturer. The Jeanery had alleged, and the jury found, that James Jeans conspired with other of its dealers to fix the resale price for James Jeans' products in violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1, and that James Jeans terminated The Jeanery as one of its distributors because The Jeanery refused to sell its goods at the desired resale price. The jury awarded The Jeanery damages in the amount of $80,556.50, which the magistrate, sitting as a district court judge, see 28 U.S.C. Sec. 636(c)(1), automatically trebled under section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 15.
James Jeans then moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict ("JNOV") or in the alternative for a new trial. Upon reflection, the court concluded that there was insufficient evidence of a price-fixing conspiracy to submit to the jury and, accordingly, granted the motion for JNOV. The Jeanery appeals from this judgment, arguing that there was substantial evidence supporting the existence of a conspiracy to set resale prices in violation of the Sherman Act. The Jeanery also contends that it adequately proved it was injured by the alleged conspiracy, that the amount of damages it claimed was properly proven, and that the trial court erred by suggesting a dealer must show it made a firm offer to purchase goods, which the seller refused to accept, in order to establish termination.
We have jurisdiction of this appeal under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 636(c)(3), and we affirm. Because we agree with the trial court's conclusion that there was insufficient evidence of conspiracy to submit the case to the jury, we do not reach The Jeanery's arguments regarding injury and damages. And for purposes of this appeal we accept The Jeanery's contention that James Jeans terminated it as a distributor.
* FACTS
James Jeans manufactures, markets and distributes jeans and other casual pants under various trade names, including "James Jeans." From 1981 until early 1983, James Jeans' goods were a popular item in the Pacific Northwest, the region in which James Jeans conducted the majority of its business. Through employee sales representatives, James Jeans' merchandise was sold to retail outlets. Retail merchants purchased the goods through sales representatives who periodically visited their stores, or at semiannual trade shows where James Jeans displayed its wares. In the period relevant to this appeal, it was James Jeans' practice, which was consistent with industry practice as a whole, to suggest to retail merchants that the retail price should be an amount twice that paid by the retailer to buy the goods. This suggested resale price was known in the industry as the "keystone" markup. James Jeans made clear to retailers who purchased its goods that it wanted them to charge the full keystone price when the goods were resold to consumers, and that any retailer who sold below the suggested resale price would either be terminated as a distributor of James Jeans, or would not receive as favorable treatment from the manufacturer as would complying retailers. It is undisputed that James Jeans consistently explained this policy to all distributors who purchased its goods.
Tom and Chris Ballantyne own The Jeanery and Rock Bottom Jean Co. In September 1980, The Jeanery opened an account with James Jeans and began purchasing its merchandise. In May 1981, the Ballantynes began buying James Jeans' goods for sale at their Rock Bottom stores, which specialized in off-priced goods and factory seconds. The Ballantynes testified that the James Jeans' line was so popular during the 1981-1983 period that many of The Jeanery's customers would rather go to another store than purchase jeans other than James Jeans. Consequently, it was important to The Jeanery that it receive a steady supply of James Jeans' merchandise.
The Ballantynes also testified that it was their practice to sell James Jeans at a price less than keystone markup. The Ballantynes were well aware that James Jeans discouraged distributors from discounting its goods in this manner. Indeed, on several occasions sales representatives of James Jeans either visited The Jeanery outlets or met with the Ballantynes at industry trade shows and told them that James Jeans was aware of The Jeanery's discounting practices and desired The Jeanery to price at keystone. The Jeanery, however, continued to price the goods it bought from James Jeans below the desired retail price.
Not surprisingly, other distributors of James Jeans who complied with the suggested retail price began to complain to James Jeans about The Jeanery's discounting. One of these complaints came from JJ's, one of James Jeans' best customers. Jim Lampus, the owner of JJ's, spoke with Hans Handwerk, a James Jeans representative, in April 1982, and expressed great dissatisfaction with The Jeanery's price cutting. Mr. Lampus threatened not to purchase any more goods from James Jeans unless James Jeans stopped selling to The Jeanery. Handwerk said that he would "take care of things." Several months later, in August 1982, Kris Nordstrom, another James Jeans representative, told the Ballantynes at the Seattle trade show that James Jeans would not accept any more orders from The Jeanery until Tom Ballantyne spoke with Handwerk about The Jeanery's pricing practices.
Rather than contact Handwerk, the Ballantynes contacted their attorney. When The Jeanery did not receive the jeans it had ordered from James Jeans for delivery in August 1982, the Ballantynes filed the present lawsuit against James Jeans alleging an illegal conspiracy among James Jeans and its other distributors to fix resale prices in violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1. The Jeanery contended that James Jeans terminated it as a distributor because of its failure to adhere to the illegal price-fixing agreement, and that it suffered damages as a result. This appeal followed the trial court's judgment in favor of James Jeans notwithstanding the jury's verdict in favor of The Jeanery.

STANDARD OF REVIEW
We review a district court's grant of judgment notwithstanding the verdict by applying the same standard used by the district court. Wilcox v. First Interstate Bank, 815 F.2d 522, 524 (9th Cir.1987).. at 525 (citation omitted). Neither the trial judge nor this court is permitted to weigh the evidence or substitute its judgment for that of the jury, provided the jury verdict is supported by substantial evidence. Id.
The decision to grant a directed verdict or JNOV, for the standard in either context is identical, compare Peterson v. Kennedy, 771 F.2d 1244, 1252 (9th Cir.1985) (standard of review for JNOV), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1122, 106 S.Ct. 1642, 90 L.Ed.2d 187 (1986), with id. at 1256 (standard of review for directed verdict), requires the trial court to engage in a careful reasoning process. In an antitrust case, if the evidence is entirely circumstantial, the court must decide whether a reasonable jury "could reach the suggested conclusion on the basis of the hard evidence without resorting to guesswork or conjecture." Edward J. Sweeney & Sons, Inc. v. Texaco, Inc., 637 F.2d 105, 116 (3d Cir.1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 911, 101 S.Ct. 1981, 68 L.Ed.2d 300 (1981); cf. Barnes v. Arden Mayfair, Inc., 759 F.2d 676, 681 (9th Cir.1985) (in antitrust case, when defendant moves for summary judgment, court must evaluate evidence in light most favorable to plaintiff and decide if jury could reach guilty verdict without relying on "mere speculation, conjecture, or fantasy"). At the same time, the trial court must not encroach on the role of the jury in dispute resolution. See Filco v. Amana Refrigeration, Inc., 709 F.2d 1257, 1265 (9th Cir.), cert. dismissed, 464 U.S. 956, 104 S.Ct. 385, 78 L.Ed.2d 331 (1983); Sweeney, 637 F.2d at 115-16.
In the antitrust context, determining what amount of evidence will support a jury verdict and assessing the quality of the evidence from which an inference of illegal action may be drawn takes on a special importance. For a number of reasons, "antitrust law limits the range of permissible inferences from ambiguous evidence in a Sec. 1 case." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 588, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 1357, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). Consequently, the court must closely scrutinize the evidence in a given case to avoid the danger of improper antitrust condemnations. See, e.g., id. at 594, 106 S.Ct. at 1360 ("[M]istaken inferences in cases such as this one are especially costly, because they chill the very conduct the antitrust laws are designed to protect."); see Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Serv. Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 763, 104 S.Ct. 1464, 1470, 79 L.Ed.2d 775 (1984).
III
ANALYSIS
Section 1 of the Sherman Act declares illegal "[e]very contract, combination ..., or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States." 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1. The phrase "contract, combination, or conspiracy" has been interpreted to require concerted action of more than a single entity. Filco v. Amana Refrigeration, Inc., 709 F.2d 1257, 1261 (9th Cir.) (citing L. Sullivan, Handbook of the Law of Antitrust Sec. 109 (1977)), cert. dismissed, 464 U.S. 956, 104 S.Ct. 385, 78 L.Ed.2d 331 (1983). Unilateral conduct by a single firm, even if it "appears to 'restrain trade' unreasonably," is not unlawful under section 1 of the Sherman Act. Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 767, 104 S.Ct. 2731, 2739, 81 L.Ed.2d 628 (1984).1 The reason for distinguishing between concerted and independent action is primarily one of economics. A single, "efficient firm may capture unsatisfied customers from an inefficient rival.... This is the rule of the marketplace and is precisely the sort of competition that promotes the consumer interests that the Sherman Act aims to foster." Id. (footnote omitted).
In two recent opinions, the Supreme Court has considered the distinction between concerted and unilateral action. In Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 104 S.Ct. 2731, 81 L.Ed.2d 628 (1984), the Court held that a parent corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary are not capable of conspiring with one another in violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act. Id. at 777, 104 S.Ct. at 2744. In reaching this conclusion, the Court discussed the unilateral behavior and concerted action distinction and observed that the Sherman Act treats concerted action more harshly than unilateral behavior for two reasons. First, "it is sometimes difficult to distinguish robust competition [by a single company] from conduct with long-run anticompetitive effects." Id. at 767-68, 104 S.Ct. at 2740. Accordingly, a single firm's conduct, absent the danger of monopolization, is not the object of intense antitrust scrutiny because to treat it with such scrutiny would heighten "the risk that the antitrust laws will dampen the competitive zeal of a single aggressive entrepreneur." Id. at 768, 104 S.Ct. at 2740.
Second, concerted action poses a substantially greater risk of anticompetitive harm than does independent behavior. See id. at 768-69, 104 S.Ct. at 2740. "[Concerted action] deprives the marketplace of the independent centers of decisionmaking that competition assumes and demands." Id. at 769, 104 S.Ct at 2740. Notwithstanding the efficiencies and potential benefits to consumers that may result from joint activities, "their anticompetitive potential is sufficient to warrant scrutiny even in the absence of incipient monopoly." Id. The Court reasoned, however, that a parent and a wholly owned subsidiary cannot conspire together in violation of section 1 because they have "a complete unity of interest." Id. at 771, 104 S.Ct. at 2741. Coordination of their activities is necessary to efficient competition and promotes consumer welfare. Id. at 772, 104 S.Ct. at 2742.
In Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 104 S.Ct. 1464, 79 L.Ed.2d 775 (1984), the Supreme Court considered the distinction between unilateral and concerted behavior in the context of a dealer termination case. Monsanto, a manufacturer of herbicides, terminated Spray-Rite as one of its dealers. Spray-Rite sued Monsanto alleging that Monsanto conspired with other of its dealers to fix resale prices and terminated Spray-Rite because it sold below the minimum resale price. Id. at 757, 104 S.Ct. at 1467. A jury found for Spray-Rite and awarded damages of $3.5 million, which was trebled to $10.5 million. Monsanto appealed, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict. The Seventh Circuit affirmed, holding that proof of termination following or in response to competitor complaints is sufficient to support an inference of concerted action. Spray-Rite Service Corp. v. Monsanto Co., 684 F.2d 1226, 1238-39 (7th Cir.1982). The Supreme Court rejected the Seventh Circuit's view of the standard of proof, but affirmed the judgment under the Court's test for sufficiency of the evidence. 465 U.S. at 759, 104 S.Ct. at 1468. The Supreme Court considered what amount of evidence will support a jury finding of a vertical price-fixing conspiracy in violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act. Id. at 755, 104 S.Ct. at 1466.2 To answer this question, the court reexamined its earlier decisions involving dealer terminations and vertical price-fixing conspiracies.
Two important distinctions emerge from these earlier cases. The first is that between concerted conduct and independent action, only the former is barred by section 1 of the Sherman Act. Id. at 761, 104 S.Ct. at 1469. Thus, under the Colgate doctrine, a manufacturer is free to announce resale prices and refuse to deal with dealers who sell below the announced price. Id. (discussing United States v. Colgate & Co., 250 U.S. 300, 39 S.Ct. 465, 63 L.Ed. 992 (1919)). The second important distinction is between concerted conduct to set prices and concerted conduct as to nonprice restraints. Id. Concerted vertical price restraints have been held per se illegal since the decision in Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park & Sons Co., 220 U.S. 373, 31 S.Ct. 376, 55 L.Ed. 502 (1911).3 In contrast, concerted vertical nonprice restraints are scrutinized for illegality under antitrust's rule of reason. See Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 761, 104 S.Ct. at 1469 (discussing Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 97 S.Ct. 2549, 53 L.Ed.2d 568 (1977)).
Monsanto and Copperweld set forth significant antitrust concepts. First, the rule of Colgate that a manufacturer can declare a resale price policy and refuse to deal with pricecutters is firmly entrenched in antitrust jurisprudence. See Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 761, 763, 104 S.Ct. at 1469, 1470. Second, because "a distributor is free to acquiesce in the manufacturer's demand in order to avoid termination," id. at 761, 104 S.Ct. at 1469, proof of an agreement must "include[ ] more than a showing that the distributor conformed to the suggested price." Id. at 764 n. 9, 104 S.Ct. at 1471 n. 9. Third, an agreement to maintain prices may not be inferred from the fact alone that "a manufacturer and its distributors are in constant communication about prices and marketing strategy." Id. at 762, 104 S.Ct. at 1470. Finally, Monsanto cautions against permitting a jury to infer a concerted price-fixing agreement from highly ambiguous evidence. Id. at 763, 104 S.Ct. at 1470. Inferences drawn from weak evidence pose the danger of eroding the scope of conduct permitted by the Colgate doctrine or with respect to nonprice vertical restraints. Id.; cf. Copperweld, 467 U.S. at 768, 104 S.Ct. at 2740 (explaining that courts must carefully scrutinize allegations of concerted conduct to ensure that aggressive, procompetitive conduct of a single firm is not curtailed improperly).
A plaintiff does not establish an illegal price-fixing agreement solely by proof of complaints by competitors of the terminated dealer, or that the dealer's termination followed or was "in response to" these complaints, Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 763, 104 S.Ct. at 1470, or that the termination of a price-cutter was pursuant to an agreement with the complaining dealer. Business Elec. Corp. v. Sharp Elec. Corp., --- U.S. ----, ----, 108 S.Ct. 1515, 1519, 99 L.Ed.2d 808 (1988).4 Complaints about discounters "are natural--and from the manufacturer's perspective, unavoidable--reactions by distributors to the activities of their rivals." Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 763, 104 S.Ct. at 1470. Price complaints provide a manufacturer with important information necessary "to assure an efficient distribution system." Id. Thus, to prohibit a manufacturer from acting on price complaints "would create an irrational dislocation in the market." Id. at 764, 104 S.Ct. at 1470. Furthermore, imposing liability on a manufacturer who terminates a price-cutter after receiving price complaints " 'would both inhibit management's exercise of its independent business judgment and emasculate the terms of the statute.' " Id. (quoting Edward J. Sweeney & Sons, Inc. v. Texaco, Inc., 637 F.2d 105, 111 n. 2 (3d Cir.1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 911, 101 S.Ct. 1981, 68 L.Ed.2d 300 (1981)).
Complaints by competitors are not entirely without probative value, however, in showing concerted action. Id. at 764 n. 8, 104 S.Ct. at 1471 n. 8. But a plaintiff must introduce "something more" than evidence of complaints and termination alone. Id. at 764 & n. 8, 104 S.Ct. at 1471 & n. 8. The plaintiff must produce "evidence that tends to exclude the possibility that the manufacturer and nonterminated distributors were acting independently." Id. at 764, 104 S.Ct. at 1471.5 Moreover, more must be shown than simply an agreement between the manufacturer and a complaining distributor to terminate a price-cutter. See Business Elec., --- U.S. at ----, 108 S.Ct. at 1521. There must be "direct or circumstantial evidence that reasonably tends to prove that the manufacturer and others 'had a conscious commitment to a common scheme designed to achieve an unlawful objective.' " Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 764, 104 S.Ct. at 1471 (quoting Sweeney, 637 F.2d at 111). The "common scheme" or "meeting of minds," id. (quoting American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U.S. 781, 810, 66 S.Ct. 1125, 1139, 90 L.Ed. 1575 (1946)), prerequisite to section 1 liability is not shown merely by a distributor's conformity to the suggested resale price. Id. at 764 n. 9, 104 S.Ct. at 1471 n. 9. "It means as well that evidence must be presented both that the distributor communicated its acquiescence or agreement, and that this was sought by the manufacturer." Id. And, as the Supreme Court recently has emphasized, there must be evidence of an "agreement on the price or price levels to be charged...." Business Elec., --- U.S. at ----, 108 S.Ct. at 1521.
In Monsanto, the Court discussed the direct evidence that established the two elements of (a) a manufacturer seeking a resale price agreement and (b) a dealer communicating its acquiescence to the proposed agreement. The Court observed that after Monsanto terminated Spray-Rite, Monsanto threatened not to supply its new herbicide to price-cutting distributors who did not adhere to the announced resale price. Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 765, 104 S.Ct. at 1471. When one discounter refused to follow the resale price policy, Monsanto complained to the distributor's parent company. The parent company in turn put pressure on the discounter to comply, and the discounter subsequently informed Monsanto that it would sell Monsanto's goods at the suggested price. Id. Through these events, the Court concluded a jury could find that Monsanto had sought a price-fixing agreement and had received the distributor's communicated acquiescence. See id. The section 1 violation of the Sherman Act was complete. See id. at 764 & n. 9, 104 S.Ct. at 1471 n. 9.
In the present case, although the plaintiff distributor, The Jeanery, does not explain who joined with James Jeans in the alleged illegal conspiracy, it seems reasonably clear that the claimed conspirators are James Jeans and some of its other distributors.6 The content of the conspiracy is alleged to be one to illegally fix resale prices. There is evidence that in response to a price complaint by JJ's, one of James Jeans' best customers, James Jeans stopped supplying its product to The Jeanery. We have previously stated "that if a manufacturer deliberately withdraws its product from a price-cutting distributor at the request of a competing distributor as part of a conspiracy to protect the requesting distributor from price competition, the manufacturer has committed a per se violation of the antitrust laws." Zidell Explorations, Inc. v. Conval Int'l, Ltd., 719 F.2d 1465, 1469 (9th Cir.1983) (discussing Cernuto, Inc. v. United Cabinet Corp., 595 F.2d 164 (3d Cir.1979)); see also O.S.C. Corp. v. Apple Computer, Inc., 792 F.2d 1464, 1467 (9th Cir.1986) (following Zidell but finding insufficient evidence of conspiracy); JBL Enterprises, Inc. v. Jhirmack Enterprises, Inc., 698 F.2d 1011, 1015 (9th Cir.) (following Cernuto but finding insufficient evidence of conspiracy), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 829, 104 S.Ct. 106, 78 L.Ed.2d 109 (1983). We have also explained that when a manufacturer terminates a price-cutter "in response to a competing distributor's complaint and with intent to restrain price competition," a section 1 Sherman Act violation has been stated. Zidell, 719 F.2d at 1470.
Monsanto and Business Electronics draw into question our decision in Zidell. In Monsanto, the Court clearly stated that dealer complaints and a responsive termination by a manufacturer are not sufficient, standing alone, to raise an inference of conspiracy. Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 763-64, 104 S.Ct. 1464, 1470, 79 L.Ed.2d 775 (1984). The Third Circuit in Cernuto, which we applied in Zidell, condemned responsive dealer terminations because they reflect a "restraint ... primarily horizontal in nature in that one customer is seeking to suppress its competition by utilizing the power of a common supplier." Cernuto, 595 F.2d at 168. Although this may be the motive behind the price complaint, Monsanto makes clear that so long as the manufacturer makes an independent business decision to terminate a price cutter, the fact that a complaint preceded or precipitated the termination is of no moment. See Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 763-64, 104 S.Ct. at 1470.7 To hold otherwise and impose antitrust liability on a manufacturer who acts after a price complaint would create the type of irrational dislocation in the market that Monsanto sought to prevent. See id. at 764, 104 S.Ct. at 1470. Moreover, the recent Business Electronics decision emphasizes that a manufacturer does not commit a per se violation of the antitrust laws by entering into an agreement with a requesting distributor to terminate a price-cutter, "unless [the agreement] includes some agreement on price or price levels." Business Elec., --- U.S. at ----, 108 S.Ct. at 1525.8
In analyzing The Jeanery's evidence, we must be mindful of the Supreme Court's warning that the plaintiff must), quoted in Wilcox v. First Interstate Bank, 815 F.2d 522, 526 (9th Cir.1987). But in scrutinizing the evidence, we also must make certain that only reasonable inferences from sufficient evidence are drawn by the factfinder. Although a trial court should proceed cautiously in granting a motion for JNOV, see Peterson v. Kennedy, 771 F.2d 1244, 1252 (9th Cir.1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1122, 106 S.Ct. 1642, 90 L.Ed.2d 187 (1986), the court cannot forget that antitrust law places limits on the inferences that may be drawn from circumstantial evidence. Wilcox, 815 F.2d at 525 (citing Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 588, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 1357, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986)).
The Jeanery's evidence consists of (1) competitor complaints about The Jeanery's persistent price cutting; (2) a strongly phrased complaint by JJ's, a major customer of James Jeans, coupled with James Jeans' statement that it would "take care of things"; (3) allegedly coercive tactics used by James Jeans to enforce adherence to its pricing policy; and (4) the alleged absence of a plausible business justification for James Jeans' decision to terminate The Jeanery. Taken as a whole, this evidence is insufficiently probative of a conspiracy to permit the case to go to a jury.9
A. Competitor Complaints
There is evidence in the record that James Jeans received, at most, four complaints about the plaintiff's refusal to retail at "keystone." Complaints by competitors, standing alone, are not sufficient to show a conspiracy. Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Serv. Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 763, 104 S.Ct. 1464, 1470, 79 L.Ed.2d 775 (1984). Neither is it probative of a price-fixing conspiracy that The Jeanery was terminated after, or in response to, the complaints. Id. Furthermore, the volume and frequency of competitor complaints does not affect this analysis; "something more" still must be shown by the plaintiff. See id. at 764 & n. 8, 104 S.Ct. at 1471 & n. 8.
B. Major Customer's Complaint Coupled with James Jeans' Response
Deposition testimony introduced at the trial reveals the following exchange between Jim Lampus, the owner of JJ's, and the witness, Hans Handwerk, a sales representative employed by James Jeans.
Question to Hans Handwerk, the James Jeans representative: OK, And what did Mr. Lampus [JJ's owner] tell you about the Jeanery?
Answer: "Hans, we've got a guy right across from me that's selling your product for $5.00 off all the time."
Question: "Okay, and what was your response to Mr. Lampus?
Answer: "Okay, do I--who is it?"
Question: And what did he say?
Answer: I don't specifically recall saying who it was, I found out who it was at that time but I don't recall specific words that he said.
Question: Okay. Did Mr. Lampus ask you to do something about it?
Answer: Yes.
Question: And what did he ask you to do?
Answer: "Make a decision."
Question: What did you understand that to mean?
Answer: Well he then asked me, he said, "make a decision," and he said, "if you sell him, I'm not going to buy the product."
Question: And what did you tell him?
Answer: I said, "Jim, don't worry about it, I'll take care of things."
Further evidence revealed that Handwerk reported this conversation to Mr. Krause, the owner of James Jeans, who told Handwerk to "take care of it."
Taken in context with the other price complaints, Handwerk's statement to JJ's owner that he would "take care of things" reflects nothing more than an effort by a manufacturer to calm an angry customer. Moreover, the vague statement by Handwerk that he would "take care of things" falls far short of establishing an agreement to fix prices between the manufacturer and the complaining retailer. Neither does it tend to prove an agreement to terminate a retailer who has failed to follow the alleged resale price maintenance scheme. James Jeans' owner's instruction to Handwerk to "take care of" JJ's complaint also does not establish any agreement. James Jeans, in response to the complaint, could have simply terminated The Jeanery as a distributor. Instead, James Jeans tried to "take care of things" by resolving the problem with The Jeanery, and when that failed The Jeanery was terminated, almost five months after JJ's price complaint. Finally, even if this evidence were sufficient to support the finding of an agreement between James Jeans and JJ's to terminate The Jeanery, it is insufficient to establish "some agreement on price or price levels," without which "a vertical restraint is not illegal per se." See Business Elec., --- U.S. at ----, 108 S.Ct. at 1525.
C. Coercive Tactics to Enforce Price Policy Adherence
The Jeanery argues that it presented evidence of "coercive" conduct by James Jeans. This argument seems to be constructed on the statement in our Filco case that evidence of "overt coercion attempting to ensure compliance through threats or demands" is "something more" than merely complaints and termination and allows an inference of concerted action. Filco v. Amana Refrigeration, Inc., 709 F.2d 1257, 1263 (9th Cir.), cert. dismissed, 464 U.S. 956, 104 S.Ct. 385, 78 L.Ed.2d 331 (1983). But in Filco, we also explained that demands or threats are to "be distinguished from mere 'exposition, persuasion, argument, or pressure.' " Id. (quoting Yentsch v. Texaco, Inc., 630 F.2d 46, 53 (2d Cir.1980)). In deciding how to categorize statements made by James Jeans, we look to the context in which they were made. Id.
One retailer, Scott Wilson, testified that James Jeans told him that James Jeans would like to have its goods sold at keystone. At trial, Wilson testified:
Question: Was there any indication to you what would happen if you did not keystone?
Answer: They intimated the fact that they would be--we'd have difficulty getting them in the future.
Question: All right. Did you in fact sell at a discount price the James Jeans?
Answer: We have always done that, yes.
....
Question: And did you have any difficulty getting merchandise from James Jeans?
Answer: Extreme.
Given that the manufacturer has every right to set the price at which it wants its goods resold and to terminate a dealer who undercuts that price, it is not surprising that a manufacturer would let a dealer know this policy. The greatest "difficulty" a dealer could experience in getting a product would be to suffer a termination. Certainly, then, a manufacturer may advise a dealer that its policy is to terminate a dealer who does not sell at keystone, or to favor filling orders placed by complying dealers. This is legitimate pressure to get a dealer to sell at keystone. No inference of antitrust conspiracy can be drawn from such evidence. It is ambiguous at best. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 588, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 1357, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986) ("[A]ntitrust law limits the range of permissible inferences from ambiguous evidence in a Sec. 1 case. Thus, in Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite].").
Testimony by other retailers of James Jeans is equally equivocal. Judith Grant, the owner of Jeans & Things, testified to the following exchange with Kris Nordstrom, one of James Jeans' sales representatives.
Question: And could you describe those conversations please?
....
Answer: Well, when I asked them about the other stores in Yakima that did discount, they said that technically they could not refuse to sell to anybody they had already opened an account for. But they could--they did have ways of stopping anybody else from discounting them.
....
Question: Did Mr. Nordstrom ever tell you, describe to you any of the ways that they had to deal with this problem of discounting?
Answer: Well, what was said to me was, "Orders could be lost, could be shipped to the wrong destination, or just never processed."
This again reveals nothing more than James Jeans putting pressure on a retailer to adhere to its resale price policy. It is consistent with the privilege of independent action permitted a manufacturer under Colgate.
D. Plausible Business Justification to Terminate The Jeanery
The Jeanery argues there was no evidence of any business justification for James Jeans to terminate it as one of James Jeans' distributors. The Jeanery contends this lack of business justification, coupled with its termination in response to JJ's complaint, is sufficient circumstantial evidence of a price-fixing conspiracy to permit the case to go to the jury. We disagree. A manufacturer may terminate a dealer who violates the manufacturer's retail price policy. If any business justification is needed for such a termination, it is supplied by the manufacturer's business judgment that it is important to its marketing strategy and the maintenance of its dealer network not to have its goods sold at less than the suggested retail price. "[A] manufacturer's strongly felt concern about resale prices does not necessarily mean that it has done more than the Colgate doctrine allows." Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 763, 104 S.Ct. at 1470. Business Electronics teaches that a manufacturer can agree to terminate a price-cutting distributor in response to a complaint from another dealer. It is uncontroverted in the present case that The Jeanery's price-cutting practices created problems between James Jeans and some of its other distributors. One of these distributors was JJ's, one of James Jeans' best customers. Faced with this situation, James Jeans exercised its business judgment and terminated The Jeanery. We see no absence of business justification in this course of action. Indeed, in Business Electronics there also was lacking any evidence of a plausible business justification for the termination, other than the manufacturer's desire to retain the business of an important customer. See Business Elec., --- U.S. at ----, 108 S.Ct. at 1527 (Stevens, J., dissenting).
IV
LACK OF COMMUNICATED ACQUIESCENCE
If we were to treat James Jeans' statements to its retailers as requests for an agreement to sell at keystone; or if we were to treat as coercive threats its statements to its retailers that James Jeans products could be lost, delayed or mis-shipped if a retailer did not agree to sell at keystone, the record still does not support the finding of any agreement. Regardless of James Jeans' conduct, to establish an agreement it takes two to tango.
In Monsanto, the Court indicated that the threat to cut off supplies was "circumstantial evidence that Monsanto sought agreement from the distributor to conform to the resale price." 465 U.S. at 765 n. 10, 104 S.Ct. at 1471 n. 10. From this circumstantial evidence of threats, "[t]he jury could have concluded that Monsanto sought this agreement at a time when it was able to use supply as a lever to force compliance." Id. The Court further found an illegal agreement based upon "substantial direct evidence" of Monsanto's unsuccessful efforts to force distributor compliance by threats of short supplies during a peak shipping season followed by Monsanto's appeal to the distributor's parent company, which resulted in the distributor reluctantly "inform[ing] Monsanto that it would charge the suggested price." Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Serv. Co., 465 U.S. 752, 765, 104 S.Ct. 1464, 1471, 79 L.Ed.2d 775 (1984) (emphasis in original).
A plaintiff does not establish concerted action, however, merely by proving that the defendant sought agreement. More is required. "The concept of 'a meeting of the minds' ... means as well that evidence must be presented both that the distributor communicated its acquiescence or agreement, and that this was sought by the manufacturer." Id. at 764 n. 9, 104 S.Ct. at 1471 n. 9. In Monsanto, there was evidence of communicated acquiescence by the distributor. See id. at 765, 104 S.Ct. at 1471 n. 9. Here, there isn't. There is no evidence that the retailers James Jeans requested, or pressured, to sell its product at keystone communicated acquiescence to such an agreement. Some dealers sold at keystone; some did not. The Jeanery did not, and it was terminated as a dealer. This termination was pursuant to James Jeans' announced policy as reiterated in its conversations with its dealers. But there is no evidence that this termination was pursuant to any agreement.10 It was unilateral, independent action taken by James Jeans to maintain the resale price of its goods. And it did not violate section 1 of the Sherman Act.
V
CONCLUSION
The Supreme Court has cautioned against letting unsupported allegations in an antitrust case reach a jury. See Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 593, 106 S.Ct. at 1360; Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 763, 104 S.Ct. at 1360. The present case rests on circumstantial evidence that does not support a reasonable inference of concerted behavior. Evaluating the evidence in the light most favorable to The Jeanery, we conclude that a jury could find a violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act only by relying on speculation or conjecture. See Barnes v. Arden Mayfair, Inc., 759 F.2d 676, 681 (9th Cir.1985); Edward J. Sweeney & Sons, Inc. v. Texaco, Inc., 637 F.2d 105, 116 (3d Cir.1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 911, 101 S.Ct. 1981, 68 L.Ed.2d 300 (1981). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court in favor of James Jeans on its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.
AFFIRMED.
REINHARDT, Circuit Judge, dissenting:
A jury found that James Jeans, Inc., had violated the antitrust laws by unlawfully terminating one of its dealers, The Jeanery, Inc., and awarded damages. The trial court, relying primarily on Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 104 S.Ct. 1464, 79 L.Ed.2d 775 (1984), granted a judgment non obstante veredicto in favor of James Jeans. The majority issued an opinion affirming the district court, in which it concluded, on the basis of Monsanto, that The Jeanery did not offer sufficient evidence for a jury to find that an antitrust violation had occurred--specifically, that there was insufficient evidence of an agreement to terminate its franchise. Because I disagreed with the majority's interpretation and application of Monsanto, and its failure to follow an earlier Supreme Court opinion, United States v. Parke, Davis, I filed a dissent. After the majority and dissenting opinions were issued, the Supreme Court decided Business Electronics Corp. v. Sharp Electronics Corp., --- U.S. ----, 108 S.Ct. 1515, 99 L.Ed.2d 808 (1988). The majority then prepared an amended opinion, adding an additional ground for its conclusion--namely, that there was insufficient evidence of a price-specific agreement. I still dissent, and will discuss the two bases for my disagreement separately.
MONSANTO AND THE AGREEMENT TO TERMINATE
Monsanto reaffirmed and elaborated the holding of United States v. Colgate, 250 U.S. 300, 39 S.Ct. 465, 63 L.Ed. 992 (1919). The point of Colgate was that manufacturers have a qualified privilege to choose the firms with which they will deal. A manufacturer may state in advance that it will not sell to a price-cutting dealer, and then follow through with that resolution. Colgate, 250 U.S. at 307, 39 S.Ct. at 468. Monsanto stated that it followed from the holding in Colgate that a manufacturer's termination of a price-cutting firm after complaints from the firm's competitors might still be a legal unilateral action. Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 763-64, 104 S.Ct. at 1470. As Monsanto stated, the competing firms' complaints might simply have provided the manufacturer with information which formed a basis for its decision to enforce its earlier resolution regarding which firms it would deal with. Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 763-64, 104 S.Ct. at 1470. Under Monsanto, "something more" is needed beyond evidence of a complaint and a termination to show that the manufacturer's action was illegal (part of a combination) rather than legal (unilateral action). Id. at 764, 104 S.Ct. at 1470. Monsanto discussed this "something more" as including direct or circumstantial evidence that "tends to exclude the possibility" that the alleged conspirators acted independently, or, put alternatively, that reasonably tends to prove "a conscious commitment to a common scheme designed to achieve an unlawful objective." Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 764, 104 S.Ct. at 1471.1 In other words, there must be additional evidence that tends either to prove concerted action or to disprove unilateral action.
While Monsanto gave some indication of what this "something more" could be, more guidance on this question can be found in other Supreme Court cases, in particular, from one leading case which the majority, remarkably, does not even mention except in a footnote. In United States v. Parke, Davis & Co., 362 U.S. 29, 43-44, 80 S.Ct. 503, 4 L.Ed.2d 505 (1960), the manufacturer had an announced policy of ceasing to do business with wholesalers who failed to comply with its specified retail price.2 The Court, in finding an antitrust violation, explicitly reaffirmed Colgate. Parke, Davis, 362 U.S. at 44, 80 S.Ct. at 512. However, the Court stated,
When the manufacturer's actions ... go beyond mere announcement of his policy and the simple refusal to deal, and he employs other means which effect adherence to his resale prices, this countervailing consideration [the qualified privilege to choose trading partners, protected by Colgate ] is not present and therefore he has put together a combination in violation of the Sherman Act.
Id. It is in the majority's refusal to apply Parke, Davis that I most strongly part company with its legal analysis.
The Supreme Court has never given much guidance on how courts determine whether an unlawful combination exists for the purpose of Section 1. Possible theories that have received some support in the case law vary from the weaker requirements of an "implied acceptance theory" or a "coerced compliance theory" to the more rigid requirement of an express agreement. See 7 P. Areeda, Antitrust Law 8-180 (1986). The majority seriously overstates the extent to which the Court's decision in Monsanto has clarified--or narrowed--the criteria for determining whether there was an unlawful combination, by suggesting that an express agreement is necessary.3 I think the more accurate reading of the relevant cases is that offered by Professor Areeda. He reads Monsanto as merely maintaining a distinction between simple and complex refusals to deal. A mere announcement and termination is a legal, unilateral action. However, when firms use individualized negotiations with dealers, meetings, repeated exhortations, and intermediate pressures, such actions indicate illegal, concerted action.4 7 P. Areeda, Antitrust Law 82-180 (1986). All of these factors were present in this case. It is important to note also that this case involves not merely a manufacturer's coercion of its dealers to control the dealers' prices. Here, a competing dealer (JJ's) had also threatened the manufacturer, trying (apparently successfully) to force the manufacturer to enforce the resale price levels. As Professor Areeda has argued, as a matter of antitrust policy, courts should be less tolerant of the efforts of dealers to control their competitors through the manufacturer than they are of manufacturer efforts to control dealer prices. 7 P. Areeda, Antitrust Law 175 (1986).
Here, as in Monsanto, there was more than merely a customer complaint followed by a dealer termination. The record before us contains more than enough additional evidence for a jury to have concluded that (1) there was an unlawful combination to maintain the resale price of James Jeans' jeans and (2) The Jeanery was terminated as a result. There is ample evidence that in its dealings with retailers in general James Jeans went well beyond announcing a policy of refusing to deal with price-cutting merchants and terminating those who sold at discount. There is also ample evidence that in the particular act of terminating the Jeanery James Jeans did not, as permitted by Monsanto, simply enforce a preexisting policy in response to information it gained through a customer's complaint.
The record before us reveals direct evidence of an agreement in restraint of trade--an express oral agreement between James Jeans and JJ's, one of its major accounts. According to the testimony of Handwerk, a James Jeans sales representative, the owner of JJ's told Handwerk that he must stop selling to The Jeanery or he would lose JJ's business; Handwerk immediately assured JJ's owner that he would "take care of things"; when Handwerk reported to the president of James Jeans, he was told to do just that; Handwerk filled in another sales representative, Nordstrom. It was Nordstrom who then cut off The Jeanery, as JJ's had demanded. Handwerk's testimony is direct and substantial evidence from which a jury could reasonably conclude that there was an agreement between JJ's and James Jeans to terminate a price-cutting dealer. Certainly a jury could find that Handwerk's response constituted an assent, or at least a communicated acquiescence in JJ's demand.5 See Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 764 n. 9, 104 S.Ct. at 1471 n. 9.
The majority reads Monsanto and Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio, 475 U.S. 574, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986), in such a way as to create, in effect, a "beyond all reasonable doubt" standard for finding a Section 1 agreement. The majority's argument, reduced to its simplest form, is that there is a plausible reading of the evidence that would be consistent with legal, independent behavior, and therefore plaintiff's case must fail.6 See maj. at 1157-59. I think this approach to evaluating evidence reads the relevant Supreme Court cases far too narrowly. What the Supreme Court stated was that an antitrust plaintiff "must show that the inference of conspiracy is reasonable in light of the competing inferences of independent action or collusive action that could have harmed respondents." Matsushita, 106 S.Ct. at 1357. It is clear that The Jeanery has met this standard. Any stricter reading of the Supreme Court cases interferes with the jury's fact-finding function. That evidence may not entirely preclude an interpretation of independent action does not warrant taking the case from the jury.
The evidence here, unlike the type of evidence that Monsanto said would be insufficient, is direct in character. Handwerk's testimony relates to the agreement itself, not to other facts from which an agreement might be inferred. While conceivably one could argue that Handwerk's response meant something different than acquiescence, the meaning of the statement was clearly a matter for the jury to decide.7 In Monsanto, the plaintiffs sought to have the jury infer an agreement from the circumstantial fact that a dealer was terminated following another dealer's complaint. Here the plaintiff asked only that the jury find that the exchange of statements itself constituted an agreement or, at the least, resulted in a communicated acquiescence. This the majority refuses to permit the jury to do solely because it would read the verbal exchange differently.
Even were only circumstantial evidence involved, the concerns raised in Monsanto, that drawing "an inference ... from highly ambiguous evidence" will erode the Colgate doctrine and eliminate distributors as an important source of information for manufacturers, Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 763, 104 S.Ct. at 1470, are not present in this case. The circumstances here do not suggest the likelihood that the manufacturer was simply responding to newly received information by implementing a preexisting policy. First, there was no evidence that James Jeans had a pre-existing policy of terminating price-cutting dealers; in fact one of its own sales representatives testified that he believed it was illegal to terminate a price-cutter. There was also evidence that James Jeans normally dealt with price-cutters in other ways. Second, there was considerable evidence that at the time of Handwerk's discussion with JJ's owner James Jeans was already well aware of The Jeanery's price-cutting policies; thus the dealer's complaint was not particularly informative. Third, the message conveyed by the retailer here--a threat to cease doing business unless a competitor is terminated--cannot be classified as simply informational in nature. The existence of an agreement between James Jeans and JJ's to terminate The Jeanery is at least compelling circumstantial evidence of the existence of an underlying arrangement to maintain resale prices--an arrangement of which James Jeans and JJ's were a part.
There was considerable further evidence of the "something more" referred to in Monsanto, or the "other means which effect adherence to [the manufacturer's] resale prices" referred to in Parke, Davis, 362 U.S. at 49, 80 S.Ct. at 514. There was, for example, substantial evidence that James Jeans' tactics were far more sophisticated and disruptive than those permitted under Monsanto. James Jeans did not simply terminate dealers upon discovering that they did not sell at keystone. With respect to The Jeanery, James Jeans tried both rewards and punishments. Mr. Ballantyne testified that a James Jeans representative offered to supply The Jeanery with factory seconds and off-price merchandise in return for selling the popular new line of "Streets" jeans at full price. He also testified that the same representative repeatedly tried to "intimidate" him into selling at keystone.
In addition, other retail clothing dealers offered testimony as to the varying tactics that James Jeans used in trying to obtain their adherence to the keystone pricing policy. One dealer testified that he maintained James Jeans' resale prices because Nordstrom told him that his company had "ways of stopping anybody else from discounting," and that "[o]rders could be lost, could be shipped to the wrong destination, or just never processed."8 Another retailer testified that in "[m]any different conversations" with James Jeans sales representatives, he was told that James Jeans had received complaints from other dealers about his discount prices, that it wanted him to sell at keystone, and that he would have difficulty getting his supplies in the future if he did not comply. When this dealer refused to comply, James Jeans "lost" a $30,000 order from him.
The majority claims that James Jeans' various coercive tactics are "consistent with the privilege of independent action permitted a manufacturer under Colgate." Maj. at 1159. The majority gives no authority--and certainly none can be found in Colgate or Monsanto--for the position that a manufacturer may not only unilaterally terminate a dealer, but it may also use a variety of intermediate coercive tactics designed to disrupt the dealer's business operations, without fear of running afoul of the antitrust laws. The majority's view is contrary to the clear holding of Parke, Davis; the majority offers neither case law nor policy arguments for its extraordinary extension of the limited Colgate privilege.
James Jeans' conduct in attempting to conceal the fact that it had cut off future sales to The Jeanery also qualifies as "something more", as does its fabrication of a false reason for its failure to ship an order it had previously accepted. Attempting to conceal the fact of termination and contriving false reasons for not filling an order are probative of guilty knowledge and wrongful conduct. Here, these acts constitute further evidence that the termination of the Jeanery was undertaken as part of an unlawful resale price maintenance plan.
Finally, there was direct evidence of an agreement between James Jeans and The Jeanery to maintain the keystone price on the Street model. Mr. Ballantyne testified that he ultimately acquiesced in Nordstrom's demands regarding that line and advised him he would comply. The existence of this agreement may serve as some evidence of a general pattern of agreements between James Jeans and its dealers.
In sum, the above evidence constitutes substantial direct as well as circumstantial proof that James Jeans was a participant in a combination or conspiracy to maintain the retail price of its merchandise. Cf. Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 765, 104 S.Ct. at 1471. Thus, there was more than sufficient evidence before the jury to permit it to find a violation of Section One of the Sherman Act. Accordingly, in my opinion, the judgment notwithstanding the verdict cannot stand.
BUSINESS ELECTRONICS AND THE PRICE-RELATED AGREEMENT
As noted at the outset, the original majority opinion relied exclusively on the argument that the Jeanery had not shown sufficient evidence of an agreement between James Jeans and JJ's to terminate The Jeanery's franchise. After the Supreme Court handed down Business Electronics Corp. v. Sharp Electronics Corp., --- U.S. ----, 108 S.Ct. 1515, 99 L.Ed.2d 808 (1988),the majority revised its opinion to add a second ground for its conclusion: insufficient evidence of a price-specific agreement between James Jeans and JJ. This second issue is not properly before us: it was not considered by the district court in its JNOV, and it was not raised by either party either before the district court or on appeal. Cf. maj. op. at 155-56 n. 6. Moreover, even if the new ground could be raised for the first time now, on the theory that there has been a change in the law, the majority could not affirm on that basis. Rather, it would be required to remand in order to give the district court the initial opportunity to determine whether The Jeanery's evidence regarding a price-specific agreement was in fact insufficient. If upon remand, the district court were to decide that the evidence adduced at the original trial failed to meet the Business Electronics standard, JNOV would still not be proper; because the change in the law occurred after trial, The Jeanery would be entitled to a new trial at which it could present additional evidence. Thus, I do not believe Business Electronics can serve as a basis for affirming the district court's judgment. In my view, the majority's decision to uphold the JNOV must stand or fall on the basis of its original opinion.
I respectfully dissent.
Unilateral conduct may be unlawful under section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 2, if the conduct threatens monopolization. Copperweld, 467 U.S. at 767, 104 S.Ct. at 2739
By making a conspiracy to monopolize unlawful, Sec. 2 does reach both concerted and unilateral behavior. The point remains, however, that purely unilateral conduct is illegal only under Sec. 2 and not under Sec. 1. Monopolization without conspiracy is unlawful under Sec. 2, but restraint of trade without a conspiracy or combination is not unlawful under Sec. 1.
Id. at 767 n. 13, 104 S.Ct. at 2739 n. 13.
By "vertical," we refer to the situation in which a manufacturer imposes conditions on the sale of its goods by dealers or other parties in the distribution chain. See R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox: A Policy at War with Itself 288 (1978). If a manufacturer also sells its own goods as a retailer, there is a horizontal element to the conduct. In our case, the manufacturer, James Jeans, sells its product solely to independent retailers who in turn resell the goods to the consuming public
The per se rule of illegality is applied to those ). Whether vertical price fixing should be per se illegal has been the subject of considerable judicial and scholarly debate. An abbreviated bibliography of this debate includes: Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Serv. Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 761 n. 7, 104 S.Ct. 1464, 1469 n. 7, 79 L.Ed.2d 775 (1984) (collecting sources supporting proposition that "the economic effect of resale price maintenance is little different from agreements on nonprice restrictions"); Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 69 & n. 10, 97 S.Ct. 2549, 2567 n. 10, 53 L.Ed.2d 568 (1977) (White, J., concurring); Albrecht v. Herald Co., 390 U.S. 145, 151 n. 7, 88 S.Ct. 869, 872 n. 7, 19 L.Ed.2d 998 (1968); Business Elec. Corp. v. Sharp Elec. Corp., 780 F.2d 1212, 1221-22 (5th Cir.1986) (Jones, J., concurring), aff'd, --- U.S. ----, 108 S.Ct. 1515, 99 L.Ed.2d 808 (1988); R.

Monsanto and Business Electronics call into doubt at least one of our earlier cases. In Filco v. Amana Refrigeration, Inc., 709 F.2d 1257 (9th Cir.), cert. dismissed, 464 U.S. 956, 104 S.Ct. 385, 78 L.Ed.2d 331 (1983), we considered the quantum of proof necessary to establish an illegal price-fixing conspiracy. Id. at 1261. Although Judge Wallace, who authored the opinion, presciently stated that "[s]omething more than complaints and termination must be shown [to prove an illegal conspiracy to set prices]," id. at 1263, we concluded that this "something more" could be supplied by the plaintiff showing "a causal nexus between complaints and termination." Id. (emphasis added). We criticized the Third Circuit for its statement in Edward J. Sweeney & Sons, Inc. v. Texaco, Inc., 637 F.2d 105, 110 (3d Cir.1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 911, 101 S.Ct. 1981, 68 L.Ed.2d 300 (1981), that a supplier's termination of a discounting retailer in response to complaints by other retailers was insufficient, standing alone, to show concerted action. Filco, 709 F.2d at 1265 n. 2. In Monsanto, however, the Supreme Court embraced the analysis in Sweeney. See Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 763-64, 104 S.Ct. at 1470. In Business Electronics, the Court held that an agreement between a manufacturer and a dealer to terminate another dealer for selling the manufacturer's goods at less than the manufacturer's suggested minimum resale price is not per se illegal without a showing of "a further agreement on the price or price levels to be charged by the remaining dealer." Business Elec., --- U.S. at ----, 108 S.Ct. at 1521. To the extent that Filco conflicts with Monsanto and Business Electronics, we are bound to follow the decisions of the Supreme Court
Filco also concluded that a conspiracy can be shown by evidence of direct coercion by the manufacturer to ensure adherence to its resale price strategy. 709 F.2d at 1263. Whether this portion of Filco survives Monsanto and Business Electronics is explored infra.
As the Eleventh Circuit has put it, "[t]his evidence need not be such that only an inference of conspiracy may be derived from it. It must, however, go beyond equivocal complaints and tend to exclude the inference of independent action." Helicopter Support Sys., Inc. v. Hughes Helicopter, Inc., 818 F.2d 1530, 1534 n. 4 (11th Cir.1987) (emphasis in original)
There is evidence in the record that on several occasions, an employee of James Jeans met or sought to meet with the owners of The Jeanery to discuss The Jeanery's persistent price cutting. At one of these meetings, Kris Nordstrom, a James Jeans sales representative, offered to provide The Jeanery with off-priced goods and factory seconds for its discount outlets if The Jeanery would agree to sell a new line of James Jeans' goods at the desired retail price. There is evidence that The Jeanery accepted this offer. Although The Jeanery argued at trial that this evidence established an agreement to set prices, and requested a jury instruction to this effect, the requested instruction was refused by the trial court. The Jeanery does not argue on appeal that the trial court erred in refusing to give the requested instruction. Indeed, its position on appeal is one in support of the jury's verdict. The jury returned a general verdict. Because the jury was not instructed that liability might be imposed if it found an agreement between James Jeans and The Jeanery to fix the resale price, we must assume that its general verdict does not include such a finding. Cf. Husky Refining Co. v. Barnes, 119 F.2d 715, 717 (9th Cir.1941) (explaining that "it is to be assumed in the absence of a showing to the contrary that the direction of the court was followed")
The Jeanery did not argue, in opposition to the motion for JNOV, that the jury's verdict could have been based on finding the existence of an agreement between it and James Jeans. Nor does The Jeanery present this argument in any fashion in this appeal. Consequently, it is not necessary to decide whether the plaintiff has proved an Albercht -type of conspiracy. See Albrecht v. Herald Co., 390 U.S. 145, 150 n. 6, 88 S.Ct. 869, 872 n. 6, 19 L.Ed.2d 998 (1968) (suggesting that retailer acquiescence in a manufacturer's demand makes it the second party to a conspiracy). Nor is it necessary to decide if this portion of Albrecht survives the teaching of Monsanto that "a distributor is free to acquiesce in the manufacturer's demand in order to avoid termination." Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Serv. Co., 465 U.S. 752, 761, 104 S.Ct. 1464, 1469, 79 L.Ed.2d 775 (1984). Like the Court in Monsanto, "[w]e ... decline to reach the[se] question[s], and we decide the case in the context in which it was decided below and argued here." Id. at 762 n. 7, 104 S.Ct. at 1470 n. 7.
We have suggested in other cases that antitrust liability may depend on whether a manufacturer's primary motive in terminating a dealer was anticompetitive. See, e.g., O.S.C. Corp. v. Apple Computer, Inc., 792 F.2d 1464, 1467 (9th Cir.1986) (citing with approval Zidell Explorations, Inc. v. Conval Int'l, Ltd., 719 F.2d 1465, 1469 (9th Cir.1983)). The validity of this approach to antitrust liability is placed in doubt by the Supreme Court's Monsanto, Copperweld, Matsushita and Business Electronics decisions. These decisions reflect a more sophisticated use of economic analysis in antitrust cases than has previously been seen. Easterbrook, supra note 3, at 170-71. In line with this economic awareness, a court should be less concerned with subjective notions of motive and more concerned with the economic effect of challenged conduct. Cf. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 588-95, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 1357-60, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986) (analyzing the economic arguments against a predatory pricing conspiracy and concluding that "economic realities tend to make predatory pricing conspiracies self deterring"); Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 762, 104 S.Ct. at 1470 (observing that "the economic effect of ... unilateral and concerted vertical price setting, agreements on price and nonprice restrictions ... is in many, but not all, cases similar or identical")
In Business Electronics, the Court noted that our decision in Zidell conflicted with the holding of the Fifth Circuit which it affirmed. Business Elec., --- U.S. at ----, n. 1, 108 S.Ct. at 1517, n. 1
The dissent argues that this conclusion is at odds with United States v. Parke, Davis & Co., 362 U.S. 29, 80 S.Ct. 503, 4 L.Ed.2d 505 (1960). We do not agree. As the Court stated in Business Electronics:
In Parke, Davis, a manufacturer combined first with wholesalers and then with retailers in order to gain "the retailers' adherence to its suggested minimum retail prices." 362 U.S., at 45-46, and n. 6, 80 S.Ct. at 512, 512-13.
Business Elec., --- U.S. at ----, 108 S.Ct. at 1525 (emphasis in original).
Even if the evidence were sufficient to establish an agreement between James Jeans and JJ's to terminate The Jeanery, there is no evidence this alleged agreement included "some agreement on price or prive levels." Business Elec., --- U.S. at ----, 108 S.Ct. at 1525
The Court in Monsanto, after reviewing the additional evidence present in that case, found "something more" and accordingly, affirmed the Court of Appeals, 465 U.S. at 764-68, 104 S.Ct. at 1470-72. The key evidence was a statement to Monsanto by a distributor that it would maintain the retail price. There was also a rather ambiguous newsletter from another distributor to his dealer-customers. In Monsanto, the "something more" was in actuality not very much. See Easterbrook, "Vertical Arrangements and the Rule of Reason", 53 Antitrust L.J. 131, 171-72 (1984)
I note that Monsanto does not in any way signal a retreat from Parke, Davis. In fact, in its opinion, the Monsanto court cited Parke, Davis at two separate points. See Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 761, 762, 104 S.Ct. at 1469, 1470
One commentator has stated: "Monsanto clearly does not adopt the implied acceptance or the coercion theory of agreement, but it may not entirely reject them either. Taking Colgate as given, the Court did not pursue agreement concepts." 7 P. Areeda, Antitrust Law 83 (1986)
Professor Areeda stated:
I do not mean to imply that suggestions or persuasion standing alone can be treated as agreements. Rather we are focusing on persuasion and exhortations (etc.) in the context of threatened termination. In this context, I would treat these additional steps as "complex." As Parke Davis pointed out, such a manufacturer is not merely choosing congenial dealers in the sense of those who prefer to comply in order to get the goods--he is trying to get compliance without bearing the burden of termination. Such steps approach a seeking of dealer assent to a much greater degree than simple announcement of conditions and termination of non-conformists.
The majority characterizes this same exchange as "reflect[ing] nothing more than an effort by a manufacturer to calm an angry customer." Maj. at 1158. Though this may be a plausible interpretation of the exchange, interpreting the exchange as evidence of an agreement seems far more probable. In any event, the majority oversteps its role when it announces that the exchange "falls [so] far short of establishing an agreement" that the question should not even go to the jury. Maj. op. at ---- 1158. In effect, the district court, and the majority, simply arrogated unto themselves the fact-finding function of the jury
The majority's analysis seems to proceed from precisely the opposite premise set forth so persuasively by the Third Circuit when discussing antitrust conspiracies over forty years ago: ). Nowadays, because price-fixing agreements are per se illegal, antitrust conspirators tend to be perceptive enough to avoid express written agreements and to deny the existence of any combination or conspiracy; they also tend to avoid leaving incriminating evidence lying about
In Monsanto, the Court upheld the jury's finding of a conspiracy based on "direct evidence of agreements to maintain prices," even though that evidence was subject to lawful as well as unlawful interpretations. Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 765, 104 S.Ct. at 1471.

One is to elucidate schizophrenia on a continuum from process to reactive, with the process schizophrenics as the most pathologic and the reactive as the most nearly integrated. The other is to interpret this mental disorder within the context of existentialist theory. They conducted research in which the population sample consisted of 238 "Caucasian" patients in a Veteran's Administration hospital. On their etiological assumption that failure to progress developmentally reflects itself in schizophrenia, and that the schizophrenic continuum breaks down into five stages of severity, their "experiment proposes to distribute the schizophrenics along the five step continuum of social maturity."
For their method of study they used the Rorschach inkblots and a health-sickness scale, on which each patient's position was judged from his case history. Two clinically experienced persons did the judging in each case; psychiatric diagnoses were.This is Why Alabama Can’t Have Nice Things

Who’d they beat, Dartmouth?
CCNY, I think.
They beat those assholes from Ohio State, 46-33
And they beat Texas and Oklahoma to get to the finals. Given my predilections in football, I would love to see Oregon march through a playoff beating these three schools.
That should really be their official team name.
Those Assholes from THE! Ohio State.

Nah, back then they were an Ohio State.
Then let me say: Go Ducks!

I wonder how many alumni from there are falling to their knees tonight and praying to God that this isn’t some sort of sign of the coming apocalypse.

I like that it’s not the same as the plaque every NCAA winner gets; those are all identical.
But it was only a matter of time before someone dropped a detachable glass football.
That’s because it’s not an NCAA sanctioned chapionship.

Picture: Matthew Smithwick
MURRAY Goulburn has axed 13 jobs at its Tangambalanga factory as part of a statewide purge of more than 50 positions.
The company informed staff of the decision this week, with those departing receiving full entitlements and access to counselling and career transitioning services.
The hardest hit factory was at Leongatha with 23 positions followed by the 13 at Tangambalanga.
Eleven jobs will go at Maffra, four at Cobram and three at Rochester.
The company issued a statement on its website which said its primary goal was to increase the farmgate milk price it offers to suppliers and improve efficiencies.
“The removal of roles is never a decision taken lightly,” it said.
“Where possible the company has sought to minimise the impact on our people by looking first to contract and casual positions and then voluntary redundancies for permanent roles.
“We continually review our operations to improve efficiency, productivity and cost competitiveness, including investing in new technologies, redesigning workflow and work patterns, improving line efficiencies and cross-skilling.
“We continue to employ more than 2000 people at Murray Goulburn, mainly in rural and regional Australia, and contribute an estimated $6 billion to the Australian economy.
“These difficult changes are necessary.
“It is in the best interest of all our suppliers and shareholders, staff, communities, customers and consumers that we are a strong, viable business, able to deliver higher farmgate prices.”
In August last year Murray Goulburn shed eight jobs at the Tangambalanga factory.I brought a new touring bike last December. Because of the bad weather and the fact that I have other bikes I did not ride it until recently. Well, I have a major problem with sliding seat. It is really uncomfortable and it is embrassing because I have a little weight to my hips. I took the bike back to REI (they are nice people and the service is great.) Anyway, I explained to the service person my problem and told him that I am not happy. Has anyone else had a problem with sliding seat and what have they done about it.? Unfortunately, this is not the first time i had a proble with a sliding seat. My regular LBS corrected the problem and he was very apolibetic about it. Still,t hurts to have this problem.Topics

Physical Activity
Physical activity is a very important part of a healthy lifestyle. Many people think of physical activity as just exercise. Exercise is one type of physical activity. But physical activity also includes other activities that involve moving your body and are done as part of recreational activities, playing, working, house chores, and active transportation (e.g. biking to work or school). Being physically active on a regular basis will help reduce your risk of many diseases and health conditions such as, stroke, certain types of cancers, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, and obesity. Even if you already have one or more of these diseases or conditions, regular physical activity can help you to better manage them.
Getting regular and adequate levels of physical activity has many benefits which include:
- making you feel more energetic
- improving bone and functional health
- helping you lose weight and control your appetite
- helping you sleep better
- reducing stress
- toning your muscles
The key to starting and maintaining a physically active lifestyle is to start low and go slow! There are many fun things that you can do to be active—by yourself or with family or friends. The good news is that you don’t need to purchase a gym membership, or spend a fortune on exercise equipment to reap the benefits of increased activity. Finding simple, enjoyable activities that get your body moving is a great start to improving your health. You can build your strength and activity level by taking the stairs, parking a bit further away, dancing to music in your house, or even cleaning the house. No matter your age, health limitations, or fitness level, there are fun ways to use physical activity to make you feel better every day.

Uncle Mo Back For More In Kelso Handicap
Uncle Mo Back For More In Kelso Handicap
09/30/2011
By New York Racing Association
ELMONT, N.Y. – In the 51 weeks since his victory in last year’s Grade 1 Champagne, Uncle Mo won the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile and the Eclipse Award as the nation’s top 2-year-old male, established himself as the early favorite for the Kentucky Derby, suffered his first defeat when third in the Grade 1 Resorts World New York Casino Wood Memorial, was knocked out of the Triple Crown and sidelined for 4 ½ months with a liver disorder, and returned to run a rousing second in the Grade 1 Foxwoods King’s Bishop at Saratoga Race Course.
On “Super Saturday,” Uncle Mo returns to the scene of his first career stakes victory as he continues on the comeback trail in the Grade 2, $200,000 Kelso Handicap at Belmont Park. The one-mile Kelso, one of six graded stakes on the card, will be broadcast live on ESPN Classic and ESPN3.com from 4:30-6 p.m. EDT.
Although the Kelso is a “Win and You’re In” race for the Breeders’ Cup Dirt Mile, Uncle Mo’s connections are hopeful the 3-year-old Indian Charlie colt will wrap up 2011 in the $5 million Breeders’ Cup Classic. But first, he has to perform against a field of older horses that includes Grade 1 winners Jackson Bend and Jersey Town.
“He’s certainly training awfully well,” said Todd Pletcher, who trains Uncle Mo for Mike Repole. “I thought he trained really well before the King’s Bishop. I thought he ran a very good race off the bench and his three subsequent breezes since the King’s Bishop have been even more impressive than the ones leading into it, which were very good in their own right.
“We’re coming back to Belmont where he won the Champagne at a one-turn mile last year and he’s certainly training like a horse that’s getting ready to run his ‘A’ race,” added Pletcher. “We’re going up against older horses for the first time, but like always, I would expect him to go over there and run extremely well.”
With John Velazquez in the irons, Uncle Mo drew post position 3 and was listed at 4-5 on the morning line.
Drawing just inside Uncle Mo and listed as the 5-2 second choice on the morning line is Jackson Bend. After shortening up to seven furlongs and taking the James Marvin at opening day at Saratoga, Jackson Bend scored his first graded stakes win when he came from far back to win the Forego at the Spa on September 3.
The 4-year-old Hear No Evil colt will carry high weight of 121 pounds for the Kelso as he makes only his second start at Belmont, having finished sixth in the Star of Cozzene last October.
Hall of Fame trainer Nick Zito will give a leg up to Corey Nakatani, who was aboard for the James Marvin and the Forego.
Jersey Town became a Grade 1 winner last November at Aqueduct Race Course when he came from just off the pace to take the Cigar Mile Handicap. Sidelined over the winter to remove chips from his ankles, the 5-year-old son of Speightstown finished second in his comeback race, the Teddy Drone at Monmouth Park on July 31, and was next runner-up to Jackson Bend in the Forego.
“He just keeps getting better and better,” said Barclay Tagg, who trains Jersey Town for Charles Fipke. “We freshened him up, he came back well and now he’s doing really, really well. Cornelio [Velasquez] knows him and will just let him run his race. I hope there’s enough speed to go after Uncle Mo so we don’t have to.”
Jersey Town, under 119 pounds, drew the rail at 9-2 on the morning line.
The Kelso also drew Godolphin Racing’s Sangaree, who returned to the United States this summer after a brief campaign in Dubai. The 6-year-old son of Awesome Again, who began his career in California, was sixth in the Rob N Gin overnight stakes on the turf at Belmont in July and most recently second to Rule in the Birdstone at Saratoga.
Rajiv Maragh rides Sangaree, 6-1 on the morning line, from post position 5.
Completing the field for the Kelso is Golddigger’s Boy, whose five-race winning streak in Pennsylvania was snapped when he finished fifth in the Forego.Answer the following 3 simple questions:
1) How long have you been driving a car?
2) How many times have you had an accident (fault or no fault) since you got your driver’s license?
3) How much car insurance premium do you pay on average annually?
Keep your answers to yourself then read with open mind my blog, My Crusade, at.
Understand that this has nothing to do with the Social Security System. It has everything to do with you – your driving record, claims history, ability to stay safe and accident free which means that you have preserved most of your insurance premiums and that’s what’s coming back to you when you no longer drive a car and therefore cancel your membership.

In Uganda they have started an interesting policy to fight corruption. People were buying houses with their corrupt money as an investment and as a way of hiding money. The new policy is that anyone who buys a house worth over $20,000 gets an automatic audit from the tax revenue authority. If they can't explain where they got the money or if they evaded taxes they are arrested.
It has really killed the housing market. :P You hope to sell to a Sudanese or an expat who isn't subject to the new rules. (It's hard to audit money from out of the country).
