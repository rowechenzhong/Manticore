River wants and needs me to finish this semester as soon as possible and with the desire that it be with the title of the Professional League under his arm. El Millonario continues to suffer injuries in the squad that force the coach to modify on the fly and after a chaotic second half of the year, the desire of all Nuñez is to crown this Thursday against Racing in the Monumental, before the partial defeat of Talleres. Facing the decisive match, Marcelo Gallardo decided to concentrate 20 players.
Logically, Enzo Pérez is not on the payroll after having dislocated his left elbow (he will not require an operation) nor did Milton Casco and Bruno Zuculini, both suspended for accumulation of yellow cards. On the other hand, the surprise (and worse) are also the absences of Benjamin Rollheiser and Fabrizio Angileri. Both the forward and the full-back expected to receive medical discharge this Tuesday but that did not happen (the forward felt a new discomfort) and they will also miss the match with the Academy.
The possible eleven of River vs. Racing
With all the casualties that there are, the biggest unknown of the Doll is who will be the left back and the name of David Martínez is emerging, a position that he already knows of the Paraguay National Team. The possible team: Franco Armani; Robert Rojas, Paulo Díaz, Jonatan Maidana, David Martínez; Santiago Simón, Leonardo Ponzio, Enzo Fernández, Agustín Palavecino; Braian Romero and Julián Álvarez.News & Events
Workshop: Stocks, bonds, and GICs: what are they?
Workshop with Timothy Ziegler
Money is emotional. In money, we find our hopes, our dreams, our failures, our insecurities. Money causes us to fight with our significant others. It keeps us awake at night, it tells us what we can and cannot do, and tells us how comfortable we are allowed to be.
In this workshop, Actor/Financial Advisor Timothy Ziegler will break down the aspects of the financial world that can seem complicated to anyone, not just artists.
– How can artists save money?
– What is a GIC? Are they the best?
– Am I just gambling by investing money in stocks?
– What is a stock? Why do stocks go up and down?
– What is a bond? Why are they safer than stocks?
– Why would I ever need life insurance?
This workshop is FREE to attend. Attendance is by registration only – spots are limited.
When: Thursday, September 12, 6:30 pm
Where: The AFC Offices at 1000 Yonge Street, Suite 301
Registration required: SIGN UP ONLINE TODAY

How to communicate with the external Secure Element for Android 8.1+ devices
On Famoco devices, you can find the following Secure Elements (SE):
The SmartCard API is a reference implementation of the SIMalliance Open Mobile API specification that enables Android applications to communicate with Secure Elements, e.g. SIM card, embedded Secure Elements, Mobile Security Card or others.
The interface of the library is kept platform independent whereas the SmartcardService implementation is Android-specific.
The SmartCard API provides functionality to list and select the supported Secure Elements, open a communication channel to a dedicated Secure Element application and transfer APDUs to such. No applet selection or channel management APDU functions are allowed as this might cause security problems. Also, no card on/off functions are available in contrast to PC/SC.
Even if the information is a bit outdated, you can find additionnal details on this website
Prerequisites
- Android Studio development IDE
- Basic understanding of the Android development platform.
- Basic knowledge of smart card communication
Library binary
org.simalliance.openmobileapi.jar
Javadoc
The SmartcardAPI documentation can be found here
Setting up the Environment
The Android Studio development environment needs to be configured in order to use the official SDK from Google as described in the Google documentation.
Steps to create a new Project
- Use the AndroidStudio wizard to created a new basic app (File->new->newProject)
- Copy the org.simalliance.openmobileapi library into the libs folder of your project
- Ensure your build.gradle file contains the following dependency
dependencies { implementation fileTree(include: ['*.jar'], dir: 'libs') }
- Add the following permission in your AndroidManifest file
<uses-permission android:
- Declare the following library dependency in your AndroidManifest file
<uses-library android:
- You are now ready to start developing your application
Sample code
The following sample code will help you to start your developements.
SmartcardApiSampleApp_v1.1.0.zipWith the completed re-draft of my historical novel ‘The Heart of Cruelty’ at around 75K words, a bookseller friend encouraged me to enter for the 2020 Wexford Literary Festival ‘Meet the Publisher’ event.
According to the website, the required submission was:
“You are to write a synopsis or summary of your story;
an extract that shows your writing style, perhaps in the context of your overview of the storyline;
why you believe your work should be selected;
around a page max.”
Around 18 months previously, I had enlisted the help, through Jericho Writers, of a professional editor, Louise Walters. She had reviewed in detail a much longer (110K) version of the novel and recommended a radical redraft. With this now done, I sought her further advice. Louise offered a Pitch Critique (Service 4 on her website) and was happy to work with the specified format.
I emailed the submission over asking to have it back within a month; she replied after only 2 days with extensive mark-up and a separate commentary focusing on a re-draft of the synopsis. She also very generously offered a second look for free.
As I worked through her reply, I was surprised to find that I also went back to my novel and started to tweak it to make the story run truer to my desired structure. I had always seen the synopsis/pitch as a chore, to be done after the novel had been written. Maybe I should have been more disciplined about writing them side by side, allowing them each to shape the other. In this way, the synopsis and its editorial critique could have informed the writing process much earlier on.
Louise’s advice was spot-on: even if my competition entry proves unsuccessful, working on the synopsis under her guidance has focused me on the story and built my confidence about pitching it in the future.ProTEl Messenger built the ProTEl app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by ProTEl Messenger ProT.

I how my positive lessons and guidance is spread to others through my nanny children.
I’m fun! Life isn’t just about learning and growing. We need to know how to take time out to be silly and laugh! When I go to work, I not only prepare or invent fun activities, but I make jokes throughout the day, invent funny songs and stories, let the kids do my makeup blindfolded, whatever it is, I’m not afraid to laugh with the kids and at myself. A fun day could include piggy back rides to the laundry room, inventing pool games, making waiting in line a game of charades, creating elaborate designs out of food, making funny faces in the mirror while the kids brush their teeth so they don’t feel like the task takes forever. Whatever challenge I’m thrown, I try to turn it into a good time.
I’m a natural born teacher. I spend all day talking to my charges. We talk about the world around us and I always explain it to them giving them all the information I know. For example, at the grocery store we talk about the items we see, where the come from, what you can use them for, what they look, feel and smell like. The kids asked once where our water goes when it leaves the toilet and this led to an entire art project of building “pipes” out of paper towel rolls and taking trip to a dam to get some first hand experience from the experts. cr childcare spend the last three years working with her third set of twins and is a member of Childcare Aware America, which helps increase the quality and availability of childcare across the United States.

When I got in there I realized that the sale was not what I was interested in and I immediately zoned in on the clearance section.
I hit the jackpot! They had several shelves of good quality quilting cottons that had clear out prices of $3.88/m and $5.00/m. Those are my kind of prices. :)
Lots of variety in my fabric choices from modern to traditional. I guess that does reflect the type/style of quilts that I like to make. I just love quilts!

What a deal! So fun to add new fabrics to the mix.It was 6 years ago that the Indian Parliament on the 15th of June 2005 passed a historic legislation. This legislation came into effect on the 12th of October the same year. This was the Right to Information Act. Though similar acts existed in different forms in a few states before 2005, this became a National Act implementable in all states except Jammu and Kashmir. Nearly 85 countries across the world have legislations similar to this and have called it by different names. Sweden’s ‘Freedom of the Press Act’ is the oldest and was passed in 1776 itself.
Much has happened in the last six years and a lot has been written about the Act and how it is has been instrumental in bringing in good governance across the country. We see portals dedicated exclusively to spreading awareness about this Act. Journalists have been using this Act successfully in exposing the scams that we have seen in recent times. Seminars on the Act are regularly held in universities and academic institutions. Many books and commentaries have been written about the Act and how it can be used. A few murmurs on how this Act has become a blackmailing tool in the hands of a few unscrupulous elements are also being heard.
As I was looking back at the last 6 years and wondering whether this Act was indeed making a difference in people’s lives, I remembered a few incidents that I would like to share here. Sethupathi is an illiterate farmer who lives in Voddaragudi in HD Kote taluk in Mysore district. More than 2 years ago, his crop was damaged by elephants and he had applied for compensation from the concerned department. Despite constant follow-up for 2 years, he did not see any encouraging signs of receiving the paltry compensation. This amount by itself did not mean much to him, but he was angered by the non-responsive and irresponsible attitude of the officials. One day he chanced to visit the RTI clinic run by SVYM and got to understand how he could use the RTI Act to get information on the status of his application. Half heartedly he applied and was surprised that he got the compensation cheque instead of the reply to his query. This prompted him to learn all about the Act and today he spends a lot of his time educating his fellow farmers and making sure that they use the Act effectively.
Mahadeva* was a waterman in a Gram Panchayath and had applied for the post of a bill collector. He was not only qualified for the same but also richly deserved it. He was one of the few honest Panchayath employees and had made service to the rural community his stated mission in life. His honesty turned out to be his greatest disadvantage and the Panchayath president, secretary and members were not willing to accord him this promotion. They gave this job to another non-deserving applicant and Mahadeva was devastated. But he would not take this lying down and decided to fight his case. He applied under RTI for all records pertaining to the other applicant, the entire appointment process and copies of the meeting proceedings. From the information he got, it became evident to him that the job that was rightfully his was intentionally given to the other person. He fought his case with the higher-ups in the department with the evidence that he had gathered and managed to secure justice for himself. He has demonstrated that merely being honest is no longer sufficient; one needs to be aggressively good too and fight to ensure justice for oneself.
Shivakumar is an young activist living in the Matakere Panchayath. He used to apply under RTI and secure a list of all beneficiaries of various welfare schemes of the Panchayath and spread this information to people in the villages coming under the Panchayath. This made the Panchayath members more responsive and accountable to the people they represented. Today he has been formally asked by the Panchayath to serve on their many committees as a civil society representative.
Somashekar is another example of the risks that such people face. He runs a bangle and fancy article store in the HD Kote town and was a strong votary of the RTI Act. He had pamphlets in his shop that he distributed to his customers. He also attended various training programs and became a strong advocate of the Act and started educating people on how to use it to fight corruption. Running a business in a small town demands its own share of compromises and he too had to indulge in them. A few months into his campaign, some of the people affected by his activism raised the banner of protest and demanded that he first comply with the laws and pay all his taxes before talking about the mis-deeds of others. Somashekar had a difficult choice to make. He had to either stay in business or give up on his activism. Unfortunately today, he has decided that a livelihood is more important than societal empowerment and has given up on his RTI advocacy activities. This goes on to prove the adage that we first need to be the change that we would like to see.
The Right to Information movement in India is now nearly two decades old. We have had activists all over the country fighting for this right and making it a legislative reality. Today the Indian Act is one of the most comprehensive and pro-people acts. Civil society activists with the background of using it to bring in good governance have drafted major portions of the Act. Experiences of the last 6 years has been mixed and we have seen many use the Act as a tool to fight corrupt practices in public life. It has also been used to force transparency and people are slowly beginning to feel that they can question the ‘mighty system’.
Karnataka has had its own share of experiences and we have had all kinds of people being appointed to the Information Commission. We have had people tainted by corruption, former bureaucrats who worked all their lives to prevent the common people from accessing information and political supporters being appointed as Commissioners. The movement has also suffered because of the large pile-up of more than 10,000 unresolved cases. Though we are seeing innovations in states like Bihar, Karnataka is still lagging behind in using technology as a facilitating platform in expanding the usage of this Act.
While the anecdotes mentioned here may look like isolated examples, it does reflect the changing context of society. People are no longer willing to be mere spectators and are increasingly engaging in matters that affect them. There is a gradual understanding that information is the first step of a larger engagement process and the RTI Act is turning out to be an effective tool. Information by itself will not be sufficient and people also need to develop the ability to process and interpret the information that they seek. We also need a process wherein this processed information is disseminated amongst the stakeholders and they are empowered to question and participate in the process of Governance, whether it is at the Panchayath level or at the State. We also need to actively campaign for greater transparency in the way decisions are made by the political and bureaucratic systems in all matters of administration. We need to move on and ask for ‘open meetings’ in which the citizenry can also participate. Only when an ‘enlightened citizenry’ becomes an ‘engaged citizenry’ will democracy be truly participatory. Only then will a new India arise.

It’s the season of the annual battle between making and the garden, here at Rainbow Hare, and this year the garden (aided and abetted by two or three days a week looking after my little granddaughter) has won.
There has been a little making off and on though. I made this out of old boxes and some cardboard from one of envelopes that say ‘DO NOT BEND’ and I am quite pleased with how it turned out. I will explain what it is once I’ve made a bit more progress…
In the meantime, I hope you are staying safe and well and life is returning to something more like normal.

Transcript
There is some research that shows that some people may be predisposed to cheating or have what is known as the cheating personality. These are people who are high on sensation seeking or risk-taking. They are addicted to the dopamine rush that comes with cheating behaviors. These are people who are also, for men, high in testosterone, high in drive, and are very likely to take risks. So, if someone likes risky behavior, they're more likely to cheat than those who tend to play it safe.
For instance, it's been known that politicians, athletes, and movie stars are predisposed to cheating. Again, these are people that are high on risk-taking and sensation seeking. They're the ones who are willing to risk everything to get in the spotlight and they're also likely to respond to sensation seeking activities. Of course, their are other elements that play into the cheating personality.
The family of origin is very important. That is, there seems to be a genetic component to cheating. They found, for instance, that seagulls inherit cheating behaviors. That is, seagulls who tend to unfaithful, as analysed by the DNA samples of their eggs, are more likely to give birth to progeny that is also going to be unfaithful. So there might be some genetic component to cheating as well, and that may be the way the response to dopamine and adrenaline produced by cheating behavior influences our behavior.
So, all of this is very complex, and although some people may be predisposed to cheating, of course, again, genetics isn't destiny. I think we're all able to learn to behave the way we want to behave and to maintain committed and stable relationships if we're motivated to.You have no items in your cart

Who let the dogs out? A review of spontaneous transgenes in natural plant populations.
More than three decades have passed since genetically engineered (transgenic) plants (aka "GMOs") were first grown in the field, and more than two decades since they were first commericalized. Examples of transgenes growing in unintended venues are increasingly common. Many more than 1000 free-living populations with one or more transgenic plants have been identified. Overall, the well-documented examples can be consolidated into 14 "cases". Some are transient volunteers, but it is clear that most cases appear to involve persistent populations. The species and traits in the latter category are neither representative of the commercialized transgenics nor are they random. Species most likely to form natural transgenic populations are those that have, in decreasing order of importance, (1) a history of readily forming free-living populations, (2) fully or partially shattering fruits, (3) small or otherwise easily dispersed seeds, (4) ability to disperse pollen at a distance of many meters, (5) perennial habit, and (6) a transgene whose fitness effects in the recipient environment are beneficial or neutral. Given these observations, certain transgenic species are suggested as candidates for the next to be reported in free-living populations.

Biden to meet Pope Francis, Macron in Rome
Pope Francis is due to receive the United States President, Joe Biden, who is only the second Catholic head of state in the history of the U.S.
According to the White House, the meeting with Biden and his wife, Jill, at the Vatican on Friday at 12 p.m. (1000 GMT) would focus on the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.
Their focus would also be on climate change and the global fight against poverty, among other issues.
In the afternoon, Biden is scheduled to meet the Italian Government.
Afterwards, he will meet French President Emmanuel Macron in order to smooth the waters after the recent rift in relations with the ally over the submarine crisis.
Biden’s second trip abroad since taking office in January takes him first to Rome, where he plans to attend the G20 summit of leading economic nations from Saturday.
From Monday, he plans to take part in the COP26 World Climate Conference in Glasgow, Scotland.
It remains unclear whether Biden’s audience with the Pope would include the controversial issue of abortion.
Biden’s government supports the right to abortion, which is at odds with the position of the Catholic Church.
Individual U.S. bishops have called for Biden to be excluded from taking Communion. The 78-year-old, who went to church regularly, was considered a devout Catholic.
On his first day in office, Biden’s office already contained family photos and a photograph of him with Pope Francis.
The first Catholic president in U.S. history was John F Kennedy (1961-63).
Biden’s meeting with Macron is also eagerly awaited.
The relationship between the transatlantic partners has been very tense lately, as the U.S. launched a security pact with Australia and Britain in the Indo-Pacific in September without consulting Paris.Popping and clicking in your jaw can be uncomfortable and feel a little strange. Even if you’re not in great pain, any abnormalities should always be evaluated by a professional like your Sheboygan holistic dentist, Dr. John Korolewski.
TMJ is a pretty popular term, and it’s used universally to describe issues or disorder of the jaw joints, chewing muscles, and your bite. TMD or TMJ dysfunction is a dental term that describes the collection of symptoms that can present themselves in various ways causing your bite to be off because things aren’t working together cohesively. TMJ actually stands for temporomandibular joints which are the joints connecting your jaw to your skull.
When your jaw joints are not functioning as designed, they can cause many problems, such as:
The first three symptoms on that list make sense. But it’s the rest of the problems on the list that can be deceiving to both patients and doctors. That’s why TMJ issues, or TMD, often goes misdiagnosed or completely undiagnosed..
If you’re unsure if your symptoms are related to your TMJ, you should see a trained professional like Dr. John. He’s completed Stewart Center for Minimally Invasive Dental Medicine (formerly The Texas Center for Occlusal Studies), supporting dentists who are learning how to resolve their patients’ TMJ related problems. Dr. John treats TMJ patients referred from local physicians, chiropractors, physical therapists, general dentists, and dental specialists.
When it comes to helping you with a diagnosis, Dr. John will:
Treatment will vary from patient to patient because each case is very different. It can involve several different phases. The first phase is to relieve the muscle spasm and pain and stabilize the jaw joint in the jaw socket. Often a temporary device is require surgical care. Ultimately, Dr. John can stabilize your bite so that the teeth, muscles, and joints all work together naturally for optimal long-term health and comfort.
If you or someone in your family has a jaw that pops, locks or any of the other issues we discussed here today, then it might be time for you to call our holistic dental office in Sheboygan. Dr. John has the tools, technology, and training to help you feel better and restore your bite.Maintenance,$381 Monthly

Here, with your help, I'm building a cooler relationship between people, our planet and each other - one post at a time. Tell friends what I'm up to by sending an email here. Follow my hour-by-hour tracking of the endgame at the Glasgow COP26 climate treaty talks on Twitter via this link.
🪔 🪔 🪔
Malala Yousafzai, the Nobel-winning champion for girls’ education and welfare, has had a rather busy stretch, getting married in Birmingham, England, on Tuesday, just days after virtual appearances at the COP26 climate negotiations in Glasgow, Scotland and all the rest of her work. My best wishes to Malala and her husband for a healthy and fulfilling life journey together!
As you might have seen here last week, she had a digital conversation on girls, education and climate risk with me and two remarkable sustainability leaders, the Kenyan futurist Katindi Sivi Njonjo and Xiye Bastida, a Mexican-Chilean climate activist and member of the indigenous Mexican Otomi-Toltec nation.
Malala was able to find time for a subsequent email conversation with me on girls, education and clean energy. Here goes. Please weigh in below with your thoughts on how access to energy has enabled, or hindered progress.
Andy - Growing up in Pakistan, did energy challenges affect you or your extended family or friends? Do you recall stories from your parents' generation about the transition to electricity or clean fuels?
Malala - Yes, absolutely. My parents often shared stories about how their grandparents lived in a time without electricity. They talk about the moment when my grandmother saw a lightbulb for the first time!
Andy - I'm always struck by Ban Ki-moon's stump speech when he campaigned for the U.N. Sustainable Energy for All program a decade ago. As I wrote in 2012, .'"
In your work for girls and education access, what kinds of situations have you seen where access to clean energy, or the lack of it, affects girls' prospects for a safe, productive life?
Malala - I like this question because I think the relationship between girls and energy is overlooked. And I think this oversight is likely because this is a problem that mostly affects the poorest girls and women.
My friend Vanessa Nakate spoke at length about this in Glasgow last week, including on the panel we sat on together with The New York Times Climate Hub. In Uganda, where Vanessa lives, women and girls are responsible for gathering water and preparing food for their families. It’s not a question of whether to send their daughters to school, it’s just unspoken that this is the responsibility of women. And it’s very time-consuming. Women and girls spend all day walking to fill up jugs of water, gathering firewood or preparing food. There is simply no time for them to go to school or complete homework. So not only are girls and women dealing with the health effects — inhaling dangerous fumes from cookstoves and the physical burden of carrying water and other things — they also are not receiving education, learning skills they can use to help support themselves and their families or pursuing their dreams.
Girls and women in these communities are also affected by the fossil fuel industry. Two activists from Brazil spoke about this impact on their lives and education: Alice Pataxó advocated against the deforestation and mining that is affecting her Indigenous community, while Bianca Maria da Silva spoke about how poor air quality is forcing girls out of school.
On the positive side, educating girls can help us transition away from a reliance on unclean energy. Vinisha Umashankar, a 14-year-old from Tamil Nadu and finalist for the Earthshot Prize, developed a solar-powered ironing cart for vendors in India to use instead of ones that rely on charcoal. The people who iron clothes spend all day breathing the unclean air from burning charcoal. It causes lung disease and other health issues — and collectively these carts contribute to wider greenhouse gas emissions that are warming our planet. So Vinisha invented a cart that used solar energy so iron vendors don’t have to risk their health to make a living. This is a small-scale solution, but if we had millions more girls thinking like Vinisha — thanks to a great education system — we could have millions more solutions to reduce carbon emissions.
Andy - In my reporting from urban Kenya in 2016 and rural India in 2017, I met girls and young women whose visions of a better future included access to clean energy. I'll never forget the bright light in the eyes of Shanize Njeri Wanjiku, a 10-year-old budding poet I met in a sprawling informal settlement in Nairobi, as she described her thirst for peace and how electricity helps her do her homework and housework.
Given what you've learned in conversations on climate in recent days, is there a key takeaway you think leaders at any level — from students to school superintendents to presidents or prime ministers — should take away from this COP26 moment?
Malala - I have been to so many of these global meetings where leaders make grand promises and then fail to deliver on them. I know there are complicated reasons for this and that political decisions involve compromise – but it’s particularly difficult and frustrating around an issue as urgent as the climate crisis. There’s so much talk about quantifying the answer — by emissions totals or billions invested — and not enough about the impact on real people and their lives. What does $100 billion dollars mean to a girl in the Philippines whose school has flooded for the third time this year? What changes will happen in her life?
We need solutions that reach the most vulnerable populations – and the only way to ensure that is to include women and girls in the conversation. So many young women activists came to COP26 to advocate for the change they want to see. I want leaders to listen to them.
We also need solutions beyond new technology to cool our climate — like strengthening our education systems. Schools can become the lifeblood of a small village or community. Children can charge mobile phones and batteries while learning and then bring home for their families to use each day as renewable sources of energy. This way they don’t need to rely on generators or charcoal stoves. Climate education is another way we can create more resilient citizens. If girls could learn about climate change in school, they would know how to prepare for extreme weather events and keep their families safe. But we need to build these schools first in order to educate every girl.
Girls’ education is an untapped climate solution. The research is there – and it’s critical for our shared future.
COP26 participants watch a presentation on "gender day" (UNFCCC.int)
Andy - One thing that I stay focused on is the reality that any school can be a laboratory for progress, from the curriculum to the physical structure. If you come through New York City any time soon (or we can only do this via a video connection!), I'd love to take you to the High School for Energy and Technology in the Bronx. It's an absolutely inspiring example of such a school - and one where the students come out with skills they can use in the economy that's being built around cleaner energy futures.
I was invited to go on a "boiler room tour" during a visit to that school several years ago. That's something anyone can do anywhere to better understand, and improve, the energy systems we all rely on.

We live in a society where people are divided into two categories: ones who work hard and those who always cheat. In this blog, we are going to cover the second category: cheaters, scammers, frauds – you name it.
Let’s start with a Wikipedia term first:
A scam or confidence trick is an attempt to defraud a person or group by gaining their confidence.
The key phrase is Gaining confidence, abusing someone’s trust to get profit. Sounds awful, right? Unfortunately, there are countless ways of how you could possibly be tricked on the internet, so you’ve got to be prepared for everything.
Right now, we are about to expose one of the internet frauds and teach you how to fight such things!
We at RollerCoin faced it on our own, and, to be honest, were frightened for a moment.
At first, we were like “PARDON? DID SOMEONE HACK OUR FACEBOOK ACCOUNT?” (obviously, we never hold such giveaways, and give 0.001 BTC to receive 100 BTC sounds not very legit, to be honest)
Then we opened this “RollerCoin” page and scrolled down a bit. It turns out that this page has been created today and had nothing except our name and logo.
We figured out that somebody is attacking our community with the automatic script. As soon as we write the post on Facebook, the fake RollerCoin page is being created, and the deceptive comment appears in the comment section.
After scammers place this comment automatically, a few bots with “huge results of that giveaway” flood the comment section. Their bots are massively liking every own comment too.
Funny thing that these guys are trying hard to adapt and improvise with the message 😀
Also, they experiment with technologies :’D
Sometimes they pretend to be our support and lead to the direct messages chat with a fake page.
Alrighty, they already had too much attention, let’s get straight to the DO and DON’Ts in such situations.
• NEVER send any crypto and don’t even talk with a fake page.
• NEVER share your private info in public. Sharing your email address in comments is a massive privacy leak.
• Be sure to report any comments, posts and fraud pages itself.
• Always check the page or any business profile, before any interaction with it. You can find out the fake page by a quick observation of the page: registration date, content etc.
Forever yours,
RollerCoin team!Welcome, one and all, to the penultimate first round match of Crunchyroll of the Dice 2018! This time around, we have two stylistically different anime to look at. So, let’s watch the action unfold as … The Ancient Magus’ Bride takes on Flowers Of Evil in … The Battle of the Animation Styles!
The Ancient Magus’ Bride
Genre: Supernatural
Studio: Wit Studio
- Beautiful looking shot of auld London. There’s an almost classical painting style to it. I really like these early minutes too; they introduce the magical qualities well and give a clear indication as to the style of the animation.
- Aww, tired dog. Or, tired talking dog, rather. The scenery in this is stunning so far. It’s almost a shame that it doesn’t seem to move at all. There’s certainly a charm to the domestic scene at the breakfast table though.
- Really loving the animals in this, as well as the almost Fantasia-esque feel to the different items in the study. The tonal shift in style for the tragic flashback is good too. Seeing Chise’s suffering, not only with her Mother’s suicide but with the clear ability to see magical entities when others can’t does help to make her more than just an apprentice in an unusual house. She’s clearly had it rough, and you can see how much more settled she is in her current situation (though even then it’s obvious that she still has some issues from her past to deal with).
- The rat monster was suitably creepy. I’m a fan of things like that; they look familiar enough to feel like they’re part of our world, but at the same time unfamiliar enough to feel out of place.
- The end credit music is really nice. The whole OST so far has been superb, actually. I’m honestly amazed at how quickly that went by.
Flowers Of Evil
Genre: Psychological Thriller
Studio: Zexcs
- Being a rotoscoped series, Flowers of Evil has an immediately different feel to it. And not just with the characters. The backgrounds here look more like pencil art to Ancient Magus’ Bride’s painting styled appearance. That’s not knocking it either, the quality is high. The music is helping create a tense feel early on too. The opening theme flies in the face of that though and breaks it into something a bit more upbeat. The brass section actually put me in mind of Lupin III.
- I kinda feel like the characters are moving about a little more than the actors would naturally. It may just be the style of animation, mind you, but it does feel like things are a little exaggerated. At the same time, some of the movements are a little slow, which may also be part of why it feels that way to me.
- I did smile at the reference to Army Of Darkness. That’s one of my favourite comedy horrors. What’s interesting is that the teenage boys are behaving in a way that teenage boys are usually portrayed in the West. Outside the more ecchi style series, anime teens usually come across a little more balanced and engaged than this.
- The publicly declaring the highest and lowest scores in the math test by the teacher is quite shocking. It’s no wonder people seem like they have a disconnect in the school setting.
- The shot where we see the characters in a mirror, and then Kasuga runs off and we see him in the foreground was nicely done. The violently vibrating flower is also a really nice touch. The way the next episode preview was dealt with, with the overlapping voices, did a great job of creating a creepy atmosphere. unlocked all achievements, and who failed to clear the tutorial …
BEST CHARACTER: Okay, so this is actually a pretty easy choice to make. In Flowers Of Evil, we only really get a good look at Kasuga. While he isn’t verbally as bad as his friends, he does consider stealing his crush’s gym clothes. He also comes across as very disconnected with the world. All in all, he’s not too likable as yet. In The Ancient Magus’ Bride, the character we learn most about is Chise, and while we’ve only really started touching on her, she does come across as sympathetic. That being the case, I have no hesitation in saying that … THE WINNER IS: Chise (The Ancient Magus’ Bride)
BEST INDIVIDUAL SCENE: This is surprisingly close. I really liked a lot of The Ancient Magus’ Bride, but the whole chase with the rat monster was a real stand-out for me. It was tense, creepy, and a lot of fun. Meanwhile, Flowers Of Evil had some wonderful inserts with the growing flower. They were highly stylised, linked together, and did a great job of representing the growing negativity in events. With both being very different but equally good … THE WINNER IS: Draw – Running With The Rats (The Ancient Magus’ Bride) and Blossoming Darkness (Flowers Of Evil)
BEST ART AND ANIMATION: The rotoscoping in Flowers of Evil was interesting. It’s not a technique that I’m used to, which possibly affected my thoughts on it though. You see, there were times that it felt off. The exaggerated movements, the slowness, the almost jerky style to it at times … it was a little jarring to watch. The Ancient Magus’ Bride meanwhile was more in line with what I’m used to. Had that been all there was to it, I’d have likely given the points to Flowers Of Evil for experimenting with something different, but the truth is, the quality was way up here. For being a shining example of modern animation … THE WINNER IS: The Ancient Magus’ Bride
BEST SOUNDTRACK: The soundtrack in The Ancient Magus Bride was beautiful. Each piece really added to the atmosphere and it all felt like a fantasy film to me. On the flipside, Flowers Of Evil did a good job of creating a tense feel with the one piece of music, but then cut through it with an opening theme that felt out of place. For having multiple great pieces of music that fit with what was going on … THE WINNER IS: The Ancient Magus’ Bride
BEST OPENING EPISODE: I can see the merits in Flowers Of Evil, but the opening episode felt really slow. I think that was intentional, maybe as a way to represent Kasuga’s life and make it so that what happens next is more shocking, perhaps? It did mean that it struggled to keep me interested a little though. The Ancient Magus’ Bride was the polar opposite; well-paced, engaging, and a breeze to watch. So … THE WINNER IS: The Ancient Magus’ Bride
Final Scores: The Ancient Magus’ Bride – 9 points, Flowers Of Evil – 1 point
And that, as they say, is that. Sometimes, landslide scores like this don’t accurately reflect my thoughts on an episode, and it’s simply that one edged the other in everything without either being bad. While I wouldn’t call Flowers Of Evil bad, the points really do fall in line with my general feelings on the two episodes here though. There was a clear winner, and there’s no way around that.
But what about yourselves? What do you think of these two series? Do you agree with the result? Let me know in the comments below.

I’m not surprised by the final score, as Magnus Bride is one of my fave anime this year. Flowers of Evil is alright if you can get past the divisive art style. I recently bought the manga to see how the story ends, as the anime ends on a cliffhanger.

I hadn’t realised it wasn’t a complete story. I think I would have gotten used to it given time, but when compared to Ancient Magus Bride it seemed weak from an art standpoint. That puts Magus against MMO Junkie in the semi finals too which should be a good battle.

Kundalini is the most luxurious sailing yacht that is ideally suited to marine and ocean sailing. It was built in 2006 near Athens, at the English Ocean Yacht Workshop. Exceptional and breathtaking performance, all with easy handling.
The 17 meters long and 5.1 meters wide sailing yacht can be found in the harshest weather conditions. The interior speaks for itself, 5 rooms, 5 bathrooms and a huge salon. The warmth of the home is made of elegant cherry wood furniture made from leather leather upholstery and carpet. It is special because we have made ourselves, with our own hands, an exceptionally comfortable, comfortable and modern home. It is able to draw rainwater from the seawater, to gain electricity from the sun and to make the trip an unforgettable adventure.Key Points
- The number of calories you burn for every pound of lean body mass is equal to a cherry tomato.
- Teleologically, it makes no sense for RMR to increase to any appreciable extent if one does gain lean body mass.
- Heavy resistance training is great for pretty much everyone. But don’t be hoodwinked by the promise of a jacked up RMR.
By Jose Antonio PhD FNSCA FISSN CSCS – How often have you heard the following refrain? “To increase your resting metabolic rate, you need to lift weights. Putting on muscle is the sure-fire way to have the metabolism of a blue whale.” And that way, the fat will melt off your flabby belly like a stick of
butter on a hot stove. Ok, I put the blue whale part in there. Blue whales can apparently consume half a million calories in one mouthful. Whoa. Can you say Thanksgiving buffet with every bite?! So does making those bi’s, tri’s and glutes a tad bit larger result in resting metabolism that’s copious, capacious or colossal? Or is this Much Ado About Nothing? Before I provide a teleological explanation of why this notion is cockeyed, here’s some food for thought.1, 2 According to Robert R Wolfe PhD, “every 10-kg difference in lean mass translates into a difference in energy expenditure of ~100 kcal/d.” Or in units us Americans prefer, that’s about an increase of 4.5 calories for every pound gained.2 Regardless of whether that number is entirely accurate, let’s just say RMR per unit of fat free mass is about as impressive as dunking a basketball on an 8 foot hoop.
Nonetheless, here’s an investigation that examined resting metabolic rate (RMR) pre and post resistance training. They looked at the effects of 24 weeks of strength training on RMR, energy expenditure of physical activity (EEPA), and body composition. For the purposes of this article, we’ll focus on RMR. They had subjects divided by age and sex: 10 young men (20-30 years), 9 young women (20-30 years), 11 older men (65-75 years) and 10 older women (65-75 years). They performed whole body resistance training 3/week for 24 weeks. Their baseline or pre- and post-training RMR were as follows:
Pre-training
Young men – 12.2 kcal/lb FFM/d
Young women – 13.5 kcal/lb FFM/d
Older men – 12.0 kcal/lb FFM/d
Older women – 13.6 kcal/lb FFM/d
Post-training
Young men – 12.8 kcal/lb FFM/d
Young women – no change
Older men – 12.8 kcal/lb FFM/d
Older women – no change
The first thing that stands out is that in both young and older women, their metabolic rate didn’t change at all. The other thing that stands out is how truly unimpressive the number of calories burned for one pound of fat-free mass (FFM). All groups increased FFM: +4.4 lb in young men, +4.18 lb in young women, +2.2 lb in older men, +1.98 lb in older women. In general, this study suggests that you burn roughly 12-13 kcal per pound of FFM daily. The authors of the study said that changes in absolute and relative RMR in response to heavy resistance training are influenced by sex but not age; that’s good news for us old guys.1
Pratley et al. looked at RMR after 16 weeks of resistance training in 13 healthy 50-65 year olds.3 They found that RMR before and after training was 11.8 kcal/lb FFM/d and 12.3 kcal/lb FFM/d. Interestingly, Broeder et al. found no change in RMR when adjusted for FFM.4
So what gives? Clearly there is quite a bit of variability in the RMR response to gains in FFM. Some folks gain, others nada. Maybe a sex difference exists with men responding better than women. Also, changes in RMR are not solely due to changes in FFM (or skeletal muscle mass). Perhaps it is related to changes in basal sympathetic nervous system tone. Alternatively,

changes in organ mass (particularly in very large individuals such as sumo wrestlers) may also account for gains in RMR.5 Have you ever seen the distended guts of professional bodybuilders? That ain’t skeletal muscle. Nonetheless, one might argue that these small changes in RMR could account for significant changes over years and decades. And that certainly may be true. However, it is evident that trifling changes in diet can negate any increase in RMR. For instance, if you gained 5 pounds of lean body mass, that translates roughly into about 50 extra calories per day. That’s not even a mug of beer. Boo.
It makes no sense for RMR to increase significantly even with large gains in skeletal muscle. – One of my favorite college classes as an undergrad was on Evolutionary Biology. The human animal (or heck any animal) has two primary objectives: survival and reproduction. If you can throw in a good sushi buffet, a cruise to the Bahamas, and the Cubs winning the World Series, than even better. Anyhow, getting back to evolution. Let’s take a trip back to the days when there was no running
water or electricity. Man was left to fend for itself like any other wild animal. It helped having a big brain because there was no chance in hell that humans could use physical strength or speed to kill its next meal. Conversely, humans developed quite the endurance capacity to ‘out-work’ its prey and a brain to ‘out-think’ just about every creature on Earth. You’ll notice that even modern day hunter-gatherer societies are ‘endurance’ oriented. You need endurance just to stay alive. Having large muscles serves no survival benefit.
Now let’s say some wacky caveman found that lifting big rocks made his chest and arms bigger. Now pretend that for every pound he gained, that would be an extra 50-100 calories per day (urban legend says this figure is true). So a 5 lb gain, which is certainly attainable by even the most average of men, would result in an
increased caloric need of 250-500 calories (according to the urban legend figure). Now where would a caveman get these calories? Would he open the fridge to get a protein shake? Go to Burger King and order a Whopper? Duh. It makes zero evolutionary sense for RMR to go up to any appreciable extent if you gain lean body mass. Or put another way. It is energetically costly to gain and maintain skeletal muscle mass. Why? Because you’d have to feed it you knucklehead. It makes evolutionary sense that it is difficult to gain muscle (which it is) and easy to gain fat (which it is). Why? So you can survive the next go round of the zombie apocalypse when an asteroid the size of Hawaii blasts Earth into a nuclear-winter oblivion. If that happens and you survive, you better pray that you have the genes for putting on fat easily. Otherwise, you and all the Victoria’s Secret models will shrivel to death in a matter of weeks.
Bottom line: Don’t believe the hype when folks say, “a great way to elevate RMR is by increasing skeletal muscle mass via resistance training.” Lifting weights does a lot of great things. In fact, heavy resistance training can help athletes of all kinds (i.e., endurance and strength-power). And yes it does increase muscle mass. But the change in RMR is like pissing in the ocean. And we all know what that’s like. Unless of course you live in Iowa.

12 blog postsBy Paul Clark of the Garden Court Civil Liberties Team.
1. The Coronavirus Act 2020 received royal assent on 25 March. Sections 51 and 52, and schedules 21 and 22 (in force from 25 March) – which are the key provisions in terms of police powers – could have a substantial impact upon the rights of individuals, particularly those in economically or politically marginalised communities. Leaving aside the question of whether the Act was needed in the first place,[1] this post seeks to summarise the effect of those provisions, and to highlight a limited number of issues. Although not addressed here, readers’ attention is also drawn to the Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020 (SI 2020/129), which restrict movement and gatherings, and which can be enforced by police officers – including through prosecution and fine.
2. The principal police powers for which the Act provides are in two broad categories: (i) powers concerning “potentially infections persons” (section 51; schedule 21); and (ii) powers concerning “events, gatherings and premises” (section 52; schedule 22).[2] This post looks only at the former, which can be further divided into the following:
- a. Power to remove a potentially infectious person for screening/assessment (with an ancillary power to detain)
- b. Power to detain for screening and assessment
- c. Powers of forced screening/assessment and of disclosure
- d. Powers over persons who are have been “assessed” (even if results are inconclusive)
3. These new powers become applicable upon declaration by the Secretary of State of a “transmission control period” and such a declaration has been made (sched. 21, para. 4,5). They are conferred upon ‘public health officers’, police officers, and immigration officers, albeit with some subtle differences between those applicable to public health officers and those applicable to police officers (and immigration officers). Each comes with ancillary powers to use reasonable force, and to enter property (sched. 21, para. 20(4), (5)), and criminal sanctions (a fine up to £1000[4]) are available for non-compliance (sched. 21, para. 23(1), (2)). Even where the provisions directly applicable to a particular power do not mention the police (e.g., the powers of forced screening/assessment and of disclosure), the Act envisages a role for police officers in ensuring compliance.
Who decides?
4. The prerequisites to exercise of the new powers are:
- a. reasonable grounds for suspicion that the person is potentially infectious; and
- b. necessity and proportionality either in the interests of the person, or for the protection of other people, or for the maintenance of public health.
5. In some respects, the Act is ambiguous as to whether a police officer must exercise her/his own judgement as to suspicion, necessity, and proportionality, or whether he/she may rely upon the instruction of a public health officer (and the latter’s asserted view that those requirements are fulfilled). In O’Hara (addressing powers of arrest based on reasonable suspicion) Lord Steyn noted that suspicion had to be formed on the basis of factual matters known to the arresting officer because, “in framing such statutory provisions Parliament has proceeded on the longstanding constitutional theory of the independence and accountability of the individual constable”. There is no reason why this constitutional principle should be lost now.
Proportionality and the ECHR
6. All of the factors mentioned in the Act as regards proportionality and necessity (“protection of other people”, “maintenance of public health” etc.) are likely to be understood by officers to militate in favour of the exercise of these powers. Plainly, the ECHR remains applicable. Articles 5 and 8 are particularly apposite, and they require that detention be used only as a last resort. Indeed, article 5(1)(e) applies specifically to “detention of persons for the prevention of the spreading of infectious diseases”. The import of article 8 goes beyond detention. The Act has the potential to be particularly invasive in terms of access to and use of private data (on health, personal relationships, and otherwise). Any assessment of whether it is proportionate to punish a person for a refusal to disclose (or indeed whether it is proportionate to seek disclosure in the first place) must surely take into account the ways in which the data concerned might be used by the state, including the possibility that other public bodies may have access to it. There has been no indication that the usual practices of information-sharing between state agencies will not apply to private data obtained through the Act.
7. Each of the provisions on specific powers over potentially infected persons (of detention, or otherwise) include requirements as to information that must be communicated to the affected person. Among the matters that must be communicated is “the reason for imposing the requirement” (see, for example, sched. 21, para. 9(2)). Long-standing principles of statutory interpretation suggest PACE 1984 (and related case law) as an aid to interpretation. With this in mind, it is suggested that…
- a. what is required is communication of not only the legal basis for use of a power or requirement, but also the factual basis for doing so; and
- b. the affected person’s response to being informed of the reason for exercising the power must feed into the officer ‘s assessment of whether (under the ECHR or otherwise) use of the power remains truly necessary and proportionate.
8. It might well be argued that criminal sanctions are disproportionate per se – as Liberty as argued, they mischaracterise the pandemic as an issue of criminal justice, rather than one of public health. But quite apart from any challenge to the compatibility of the primary legislation itself with the ECHR, it must be emphasised that decisions to use the available sanctions are discretionary and must be proportionate in ECHR terms.
Discrimination and the Equality Act 2010
9. Areas of dense population and overcrowded housing might be cited as risk factors, but they are also features of marginalised communities. The dearth of guidance as to legitimate bases for suspicion that a person is “potentially infectious” gives rise to a real risk that the above powers (including detention) could be invoked on discriminatory bases. The Equality Act’s prohibitions upon direct and indirect discrimination (as well as the Public Sector Equality Duty) will be essential bulwarks against prejudice.
[1] It is noted here that pre-existing legislation sought to address the same underlying concerns as does the Act: see, for example, Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984; Civil Contingencies Act 2004.
[2] Other provisions that are of relevance to police practice are not addressed herein (including those pertaining to removal to a ‘place of safety’ under section 135 of the Mental Health Act 1983: see Schedule 8 of the Act;, and those pertaining to ‘Investigatory Powers’: see sections 22 and 23 of the Act).
[3] “The declaration made by the Secretary of State on 10 February 2020 under regulation 3 of the 2020 Regulations is to be regarded as a declaration made by the Secretary of State under paragraph 4 of this Schedule”.

Since its establishment, the primary goal of Injaz has been to establish and support platforms for the sharing of ideas among Arab municipal leaders and developing a “common voice” that will serve their needs and interests and thereby improve the communication of those needs to the national government. These forums serve as an essential structure from which to improve the quality of life in their towns and for their residents.
Since 2008, the Injaz Center for Professional Arab Local Governance has successfully convened and managed important and impactful forums to improve communication and the sharing of ideas among Arab municipal leaders. These forums provide an opportunity to create a unified set of priorities, as well as providing a platform for the shared learning of best practices.
Beginning in 2011, Injaz invited Arab mayors from across the country to meet several times a year for multi-day meetings to discuss, define and refine common challenges and opportunities. Concurrently, meetings of Arab municipal senior officials had been taking place, with the same goal in mind. Beginning in 2018, Injaz brought the mayors and senior officials together for similar gatherings.
These forums have been the principal means through which Injaz has established its influential and solutions-oriented relationship with Arab municipalities. The municipal leaders view these forums as a vital means to formulate a shared agenda and voice, both internally within the Arab municipalities themselves and vis-à-vis the national government. This improved communication and sharing of ideas has resulted in concrete benefits for the municipalities, as well as stimulating a strong desire among the leaders to expand the opportunities these forums have provided.

Michael SThe ICLEI World Congress 2018 brought new energy and momentum to sustainable urban development. ICLEI and partners announced new initiatives and strengthened partnership to kick start implementation of the ICLEI Montréal Commitment and Strategic Vision.
Here are some of the key announcements from the ICLEI World Congress 2018 to watch:
- The UN Environment Principles for Sustainable Insurance Initiative and ICLEI launched the Insurance Industry Development Goals for Cities to set the global agenda for insurance and risk management and cities. These goals represent a major opportunity for the insurance industry to work with local governments around the world to manage risk up front and ahead of disasters.
- ICLEI, The Nature Conservancy and IUCN launched CitiesWithNature, a first-of-its-kind global networking and learning exchange platform for recognizing and enhancing the value of nature, and integrating it into our cities. This initiative will ramp up action and information around nature-based development in cities across the world.
- ICLEI and the CBD Secretariat announced we will host the 6th Global Biodiversity Summit of Local and Subnational Governments, convened by the South Sinai Governorate, Egypt, in parallel with the next CBD Conference of the Parties (COP). This summit will be co-hosted in partnership with the Network of Regional Governments for Sustainable Development (nrg4SD) and is a platform for national governments to engage with their local and subnational peers as part of global efforts to accelerate subnational implementation of global biodiversity targets.
- ICLEI issued a global call to action on city climate neutralitycalling on local and regional governments worldwide to set mid-century climate neutrality targets in municipal infrastructure and operations. This call to action, supported by UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa, is ahead of the Paris goal to hit climate neutrality post-2050.
- ICLEI renewed partnerships with United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG) to strengthen our advocacy work at the global level, as well as with the South African Local Governments Association (SALGA), representing an ambition to build on this long-standing collaborative partnership to upscale and accelerate sustainable urban development through the localization of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
- ICLEI endorsed the Edmonton Declaration to build momentum around the global research agenda on cities and climate change. Cities like Montréal and Melbourne officially signed onto the Edmonton Declaration, committing to use scientific research and data to inform ambitious climate action plans.
- As an active member of the Global Lead City Network on Sustainable Procurement, Solly Msimanga, Executive Mayor of Tshwane, publicly committed the city to achieving 10 percent sustainable procurement by 2021.
For more information on any of these initiatives, get in touch with us at iclei@iclei.org.

“The Extraordinary Mitzvah of Tzedakah--Charity”
(updated and revised from Behar-Bechukotai 5762-2002)
The word tzedakah, does not mean charity, but rather justice and righteousness. It is not an act of charity to be generous, it is the correct thing to do.

“Setting a New Standard of Ethical Behavior”
(Updated and revised from Parashiot Behar-Bechukotai 5761-2001)
We’ve reached a point in society where even simple acts of kindness and honesty are considered “extraordinary.” As we learn in parashat Behar, the Torah’s goal is to transform such actions into ordinary actions. Judaism sets a very high standard–-it aims for Utopia.
“The Big ‘IF.’ The Gift of Free Choice”

“If Your Brother Becomes Impoverished”
The mitzvah to redeem the land of a fellow Jew who has become impoverished has an important metaphoric message for contemporary times.
“The Tochaycha–G-d’s Daunting Reproof of Israel"
The Tochaycha repeats the dire prediction that G-d will punish those who fail to abide by the Torah “sevenfold for their sins.” The Midrash maintains that there is a seven-step process for those who abandon the Al-mighty and walk away from.
“The Role of Exile in Jewish Theology”
What is the purpose of exile and what role does exile play in Jewish history?
"The Value of a Woman"
As one would expect, in parashat Bechukotai, there is much discussion and controversy regarding the concept of valuing human beings, especially concerning the lower level at which women are valued.

"The Double-Edged Sword"
There are two faces to peace and two faces to the sword. Sometimes peace prevails because of internal brotherly love. At other times, peace is imposed from the outside. When people live in harmony with one another then the sword is an instrument of death. However, when people cannot live in peace with one another, then external threats of the sword can be a blessing that brings unity to the people.
.
"Achieving Peace and Security for the Jewish People"
Parashat Bechukotai pronounces the ultimate formula for achieving peace for the Jewish people. G-d declares: "Im bechukotai tay'lay'choo," if the Jewish people wish to attain peace and ultimate blessing, they must follow My decrees and observe My commandments and perform them. Security is a factor of the Jewish people's relationship with G-d.

I'd been pretty good these past few weeks (months?) at alternating between autographs and jersey cards and wanted the switch to keep going, but I figured they were drafted consecutively (Daniel second, Henrik third) by the Vancouver Canucks in 1999, so I might as well go back-to-back myself.
If Daniel's the goal scorer, Henrik's the passer, with six consecutive 60-assist seasons with the one before that at 57 and the one after - the locked-out season - 34 in just 48 games. Like his brother, Henrik was on two end-of-season All-Star selections, and has an Art Ross and two NHL trophies in total - where Daniel also got the Lester B. Pearson, though, Henrik got the Hart; both are MVP trophies of sorts, so they remain pretty evenly matched.
Henrik also gets some Lady Byng votes, but is never in the top-10 in voting like Daniel is; he does get Selke votes because he's a center, though he's usually in the top-30 votes, which is far from being an actual contender for it.
Henrik's biggest season in terms of points also trumps Daniel's, 112 to 104, and though they've played together for most of their lives, those seasons were consecutive, due to an injury to Daniel in 2009-10.
His medal count with Team Sweden is also identical to his brother's: Olympic gold (2006) and silver (2014), World Championship gold (2013)
and bronze (1999, 2001), U-18 gold (1998) and U-17 silver (1997). He's a little less productive than Daniel in international games, with 69 points in 81 games. He made the IIHF All-Star team at the 2013 Worlds.
For all the talk about the Sedins not being playoff performers, in the Canucks' last five post-season appearances, Henrik has 54 points in 56 games, including 22 in 25 when they lost to the Boston Bruins in the Stanley Cup Finals in 2010-11.
Which bring us to this card from Panini's 2010-11 Pinnacle set, card #96 of the City Lights Materials sub-set (numbered #496/499), featuring a blue jersey swatch matching the (awful) home uniform pictured both on the front and back of the card:
I had written Henrik in September 2010; I have since moved three times, and I don't count on any of those four cards to make their way back to me, ever.

In chemisorption a single layer of molecules, atoms or ions is attached to the adsorbent surface by chemical bonds; in physisorption only van der Waals forces are involved.
The technical applications of adsorption cover a wide range, such as separation, synthesis, storage, purification of gases and liquids, and air conditioning. It is increasingly becoming established in chemical processes as an alternative to the conventional separation techniques of rectification, absorption, condensation, drying, extraction, membrane processes, and catalysis, and it profits from various and optimally tailored adsorbents. It is apparent that all these technical applications are considerably based on a better understanding of the surface science implied.
In the case of gas-surface interactions some approximations are made in order to understand the adsorption process from the molecular point of view. As in the case of purely classical thermodynamic processes, where an ideal irreversible one is considered, meaning that changes are small – infinitesimal – and continuous, a similar assumption is used when considering the quantum approach to the processes involved. This is called an adiabatic approximation.
In any adiabatic approximation, the time dependence of the parameters, say the inter-nuclear distance between the atoms, varies slowly. This means that the solution to the Schrödinger equation at one time goes continuously over to the solution at a later time. The adiabatic approximation was first proposed by Max Born and Vladimir Fock.
An adiabatic approximation in which the motion of atomic nuclei is taken to be so much slower than the motion of electrons that, when calculating the motions of electrons, the nuclei can be taken to be in fixed positions was developed my Max Born and Julius Oppenheimer. The use of the so-called Born-Oppenheimer approximation has been extraordinarily successful in the study of gas-surface elementary processes. However, in metal surfaces low energy electronic excitations are generated by thermal molecules, thus breaking the required smoothness of the adiabatic assumption. But not only molecules would be responsible for altering smoothness.
Enter electrons
In the case of metal surfaces, high concentrations of conducting electrons can, in principle, exchange energy with the adsorbate nuclear degrees of freedom. In fact, there is growing experimental evidence that points out the existence of such non-adiabatic effects. Among them, the significant vibrational line widths of molecules adsorbed on metal surfaces, which are reported in infrared absorption or pump-probe spectroscopy experiments, are considered to be clear fingerprints of the electron-mediated vibrational relaxation. Besides, the non-adiabatic coupling underlies a variety of surface reactions and adsorbate motions (e.g., vibrations, rotations, and lateral hopping) induced by means of inelastic electron currents and femtosecond laser pulses.
Apart from non-adiabatic coupling, a key ingredient for depicting the processes mentioned above is the intermode vibrational coupling. For example, hot-electron induced nonequilibrium dynamics of CO on Cu(100), studied by time-resolved vibrational sum-frequency generation, reveals the importance of intermode coupling in the CO desorption process.
The ensuing theoretical efforts aimed to comprehend these experimental observations are still unable to give precise quantitative estimations of the experimental vibrational relaxation rates and, hence, neither can clarify which relevant mechanisms are ruling them. Everything points to an overlooked relaxation mechanism that should incorporate both the non-adiabatic and intermode couplings on the same footing.
Now, Novko, Alducin and Juaristi demonstrate 1 how non-adiabatic coupling can naturally account for intermode coupling if the former is treated up to second order in the electron-phonon interaction.
The new theory, that includes the process conjoining non-adiabaticity and intermode transitions— electron-mediated phonon-phonon (EMPP) coupling, as the researchers call it— can correctly describe the mechanisms behind the vibrational relaxation of ordered molecules on metal surfaces.
By combining many-body perturbation theory with density functional theory, the researchers investigated a new relaxation mechanism that bridges the non-adiabatic and vibrational intermode couplings, namely, the electron-mediated phonon-phonon coupling, which is then successfully applied to the prototypical case of the CO internal stretch mode on Cu(100). The scientists show that the present phonon line width formula combined with first-principles methodologies is finally able to explain the experimental relaxation rates. Importantly, the results show that the EMPP process dominates over the commonly used first-order non-adiabatic contribution.
Importantly, it is shown that the internal stretch mode couples strongly via electron-hole pairs to other thermally-excited low-energy molecular phonon modes, i.e., to the frustrated rotation and frustrated translation modes. Even more surprising, though, is that surface motion also plays an important role in the electron-mediated vibrational relaxation.
Last, but not least, EMPP explains the temperature dependence of the internal stretch mode line width. This result proves that the temperature dependence is not only triggered by the usual direct phonon-phonon coupling and that the commonly overlooked electron-mediated processes are also a significant factor in this respect.
EMPP is quite general and could be used to elucidate which modes are involved in those surface reactions in which non-adiabatic effects and intermode coupling are expected to be relevant.

Jobs’ second coming as CEO turned Apple into a powerhouse,” Peter Cohan writes for Forbes. “And 18 years later, Tim Cook spent $3 billion — 2% of its cash — to acquire Jimmy Iovine’s Beats.”
“Will Iovine replace Cook like Jobs replaced Amelio?” Cohan writes. “If so, this deal could be a catalyst for Apple stock.”

Lol.. Man it is mind boggling to see absolute stupid comments like this get published !
Woodrow Wilson had a saying: ” I not only use all the brains that I have, but all that I can borrow.”
Apple is no longer the company Steve Jobs found and later rescued. Rather, it’s a global presence facing far different challenges.
Cook is hiring extremely talented people while winnowing out those not capable of taking the franchise to the next level. Iovine, like Ahrendts and many others, are wonderful brains that he has “borrowed.”
Cook continues to impress.
Excellent point. This isn’t your father’s Apple. Somehow I don’t envision Jimmy running this huge corporation. Having a great deal to do with some portion of it perhaps? But it’s way too big and complicated for Jimmy. And I’m not sure how well Jimmy is going to work out anyway? Steve Jobs was a loose cannon but he and the Woz started Apple. So he knew the company inside and out and knew exactly what it needed when he returned. He was there at the beginning. Let’s see if Jimmy makes it a year. I believe he will be kept on a bit of a short leash. Besides, music isn’t where it’s at for Apple going forward. Jimmy was just brought in to bolster iTunes radio. He’s not going to run the company. Video and monetizing all those credit cards is where it’s at for Apple. Along with the automobile and home automation these things will surpass music easily in the future. I think you’re correct about Tim hiring the best talent for such a huge company as Apple. A huge, diversified global corporation. I don’t see Jimmy or Angela running all that.

I wonder what kind of retention bonus is built into the new acqui-hire of the new dream team Jimmy n’ Dre?
Additionaly, how do you manage this talent with such out-sized egos?
Iovine is a creative guy. He now has the worlds larger a creative sandbox to play in. I don’t think he’s leaving any time soon.
Great, instead of “innovative” gold colored products now we’re going to get “innovative” red and black colored products. I miss Steve.
While I don’t know if the acquisition is good or bad, and it’s too soon to make that call, I like that Tim Cook knows his lack of strength.
Steve Jobs was passionate about music. I don’t get that vibe from Tim, so he hired (read: bought) people that are. Whether that works out or not remains to be seen.
People need to stop expecting Jobs-behavior from Cook. That just won’t ever happen.Giannis Antetokounmpo and Michael Jordan “launch” the value of WatchBox to 1 billion dollars
In addition to being a star in the world’s biggest basketball organization, Michael Jordan and Giannis Antetokounmpo have achieved great things off the court as well in recent years. Both the legend of Chicago Bulls and the Greek leader of Milwaukee Bucks are characterized by a special “business acumen” with a great impact on businesses located on the other side of the Atlantic. According to U.S. reports, the five-time NBA MVP and The Greek Freak are among the athletes who invested in WatchBox, a platform that allows users to buy, sell and exchange luxury watches.
WatchBox announced that it had raised 165 million dollars in the last round of funding. Apart from Michael Jordan and Giannis Antetokounmpo, the owner of Bucks Marc Lawry, the Phoenix Suns stars Chris Paul, Devin Booker and the well-known Wall Street investor Bill Ackman also participated.
WatchBox, which was founded in 2017, has raised more than 260 million dollars in funding. Although the company has not announced its value after the new round, CNBC sources say it is close to 1 billion dollars.
The value of WatchBox’s product catalogue is estimated at 150 million dollars. The platform does not function as a classic peer-to-peer marketplace, as the company buys and exchanges luxury watches directly from sellers. He then certifies the products and resells them to collectors and buyers. In recent years there has been an “explosion” in the secondary market for luxury watches as leading manufacturers such as Rolex are reluctant to increase supply in order to keep the value of luxury collections high. According to McKinsey, sales of used watches in 2019 amounted to 18 billion dollars and is expected to exceed 32 billion dollars in 2025. In addition to WatchBox, the fast-growing luxury watch market is home to companies such as Watchfinder, Watchmaster and Hodinkee.
It is worth noting that “Giannis” entered dynamically in the list of the richest athletes in the world occupying the 19th place in the list of Forbes, while he has also signed sponsorship agreements with major multinationals and Greek companies such as Electronic Arts, Nike, TCL, MYTILINEOS, etc. The Greek star’s earnings from trade agreements exceed 25 million dollars.Time: June 20, 2016 at 6pm to November 20, 2016 at 7pm

Victoria Transportation Centre Study: report on underpass schemes by Freeman, Fox and Partners, with plans
Context
In the mid 1960s the GLC proposed something called the "Victoria Transportation Centre" centred on Victoria Station. It was an attempt to create a multi-modal interchange facility between rail, underground, coaches, buses and airside shuttle trains to both Heathrow and Gatwick. Plans of the actual Transportation Centre are at GLC/TD/PM/CDO/07-290. On the periphery of that proposal, an underpass was proposed at Victoria.
This file contains a report by Freeman, Fox and Partners into the construction of some sort of tunnel or underpass in the vicinity of Victoria station that may or may not have interacted with the "transportation centre" in some way.
Three options were proposed, all effectively assisting traffic passing through on the Inner Ring Road and which, regardless of the "transportation centre", would have done a lot to remove the horrible Victoria One-Way System from the face of the earth:
- A dual two-lane underpass linking Grosvenor Place and Vauxhall Bridge Road, in deep bored tunnel beneath Victoria Station, with north-east facing sliproads inside the tunnel that would link to the transportation centre itself.
- A single two-lane underpass on the same line as the one above.
- A dual two-lane underpass, as above, with an additional single-lane tunnel to take traffic northbound from Buckingham Palace Road and merge into the main north-westbound tunnel.

None known.Srinagar, Apr 23: Power outage during ‘Sehri’ and ‘Iftaar’ in the holy month of Ramadhan has become a new normal in Kashmir Valley. Hundreds of netizens are giving vent to their frustration and anger on social media, ruing their fate and saying the government’s claim of ensuring electricity in Ramadan has fallen flat.
Besides Srinagar city, the other districts of Central, North and South Kashmir are facing pesky power cuts while as there are areas that witness no power supply at all, especially during ‘Sehri’ and ‘Iftaar’.
Kashmir Power Distribution Corporation which in local parlance in Valley is known as PDD or Power Development Department has this time as well failed to live up to the expectations of people.
Former Minister and President Jammu Kashmir Apni Party Syed Altaf Bukhari said that it is highly unfortunate that the people are subjected to frequent power outages particularly at Iftaar and Sehri times in this blessed month. “The ground situation is totally contradicting the much-hyped claims made by the administration,” he said.
“Not all use new gadgets like invertors and generators. A common man still make use of candles in absence of electricity. People are forced to have Sehri and Iftaar under candlelight lamps,” Nisar Ahmed, a local from Shalimar Srinagar told a news agency.
Almost all the areas across Kashmir Valley are witnessing power outage during ‘Sehri’ and ‘Iftaar’. Some of the areas that witness frequent power interruptions are Rainawari, Mehjoor Nagar, Natipora, Rambagh, Kaka Sarai, Shalimar, Nowgam, Sonwar, Pala Pora Eidgah, Bemina, Batapora Wathoora Chadura, Wachi, Zainpora, Chitragam in Shopian, Koil, Trichal, Naira, Tahab, Tamlahal in Pulwama, Sogam Lolab, Beerwah, Khag, Khansahab in Budgam and other areas in other districts.
Senior National Conference leader Mubarak Gul said that ever since the holy month of Ramadan has set in, electricity has been playing hide and seek with the consumers particularly during Iftaar, Sehri, and Taraweeh hours and that has put the people to undue trepidation.
A top official from Power Development Department said that power consumption has gone up due to cold weather conditions. He appealed people to use power judiciously if they want some respite.
The official said that the power load is 1950 MWs, against the routine of 1500 MWs in the month of April. He said the department has supplied 1630 MWs, the highest the department can do. kntAuthor: Arturs Sosins

Package: Media Embed
Got any interesting media website that you think might be added to media embed class?
I'll show you how to add new media websites and I'll use break.com as example.
First we'll look at video URL pattern, for example: awesome-running-backflip-into-pool-chair-2084368
So we'll add new pattern to private $all_types array with meaningful key "break", like this:
"break" => array( "link" => '/http://[w.]*break.com/index/([^?&#"']*)/is', )
Then we examine embed code:
As you see link to embedded media is not related to video URL:
So there's no point in adding embed pattern to $all_types array, because it would not be possible to restore video URL.
Then we need to create methods just for break.com website. We'll need to get embed url, thumbnails, size of video and it's title. For that we'll try to examine source code of URL video webpage. First thing to look for is oEmbed protocol. Unfortunately break.com doesn't support that one, so to get needed information we'll query same video URL and parse its HTML code to get what we need.
So we'll create break.com function section where all functions will have break prefix (same value as we used in $all_types array key value for regex)
* BREAK FUNCTIONS
**************************/
So break_site function returns website address, this is easy
//return website URL private function break_site(){ return ""; }
Then we also need to return Video URL for compatibility with class interface:
//return canonical URL private function break_url(){ return "".($this->code); }
Most important thing is to return embedded code and after examining webpage's source code, we found that there is an alternative embed URL: awesome-running-backflip-into-pool-chair-2084368
Digit code in the end of embed URL is the same code that is in the end of Videos URL, so there is a way it can be generated without http request to website.
So here are the methods to return embed URL:
//return iframe url private function break_iframe(){ $parts = explode("-", $this->code); //get the last part of url return "".$parts[sizeof($parts)-1]; } //return embed url private function break_embed(){ return $this->break_iframe(); }
Next is a video title. It can be retrieved from websites source code, or in this case, it can also be restored from video's URL. awesome-running-backflip-into-pool-chair-2084368
//return title private function break_title(){ $parts = explode("-", $this->code); array_pop($parts); return ucwords(implode(" ", $parts)); }
All methods above didn't require HTTP request to get additional information. All other method will require it.
To get needed information we will provide URL that needs to be queried - video's webpage:
We've already created method which returns video URL, so we'll use it:
//return http request URL where to get data private function break_req(){ return $this->break_url(); }
Next thing to get thumbnail URL. In WebPages source code it can be found in multiple places, we'll use the first one:
<meta property="og:image" content = "">
It might get tricky to get different thumbnail sizes. You'll need to check URL of video's thumbnail images on different parts of website, to try to figure out how to get different sizes by changing image URL. Sometimes it might not even be possible; in that case we will use same size to all image types for compatability. Break.com is one of these cases:
//return thumbnails private function break_thumb($res){ $arr = array(); preg_match( '/property="og:image"s*content="([^"]*)"/i', $res, $match); if(!empty($match)) { $arr["large"] = $match[1]; $arr["medium"] = $match[1]; $arr["small"] = $match[1]; } return $arr; }
Note that now this method requires http request, thus it receives one paramater which is content of HTTP queried page.
Next thing to get is video dimensions (width and height)
After examining HTML code we found
<meta name="video_height" content="392"><meta name="video_width" content="464">
And created method is one that also receives HTTP request contents:
//return size private function break_size($res){ $arr = array(); preg_match( '/name="video_width"s*content="([^"]*)"/i', $res, $match); if(!empty($match)) { $arr["w"] = $match[1]; } preg_match( '/name="video_height"s*content="([^"]*)"/i', $res, $match); if(!empty($match)) { $arr["h"] = $match[1]; } return $arr; }
Last thing to do is to specify which methods require HTTP request and which not:
//which data needs additional http request private function break_data(){ return array( "thumb" => true, "size" => true, "embed" => false, "iframe" => false, "url" => false, "site" => false, "title" => false ); }
That's it, now this class supports all break.com methods required.
There are some shorthand functions in SOME STANDARD section which can be used with oEembed or some og:properties, just to make code cleaner and shorter. Feel free to add something there as well, if you see that same function applies to couple of different websites.

Born in 1960 near Pwllheli, North Wales, Dawson studied at the Chelsea School of Art followed by the Royal College of Art where he considered himself almost exclusively a painter. Soon after graduating, Dawson met Lucien Freud and became his studio assistant, model and trusted confidante. It was during his time as Freud’s assistant that Dawson began exploring photography, capturing Freud at work in the studio. These photographs were later exhibited at the National Portrait Gallery in 2004, with the National Portrait Gallery acquiring 26 of them, including images of Freud painting David Hockney and Queen Elizabeth II. Dawson’s photographs have been exhibited across the globe including. Dawson worked with Freud until his death in 2011 and has since co-authored Phiadon’s Lucien Freud (2018) and been elected the Director of the Lucien Freud Archive. Dawson won the 2019 Ruth Borchard Self-portrait Prize with his work, Looking at Self Reflection. Looking at Self Reflection (2019) sees Dawson’s interest in the figurative move from the camera to the canvas. Dawson’s swift and powerful brush strokes render a strident depiction of the artist at work. Dawson appears to stare beyond the frame at his viewer, engaging his audience in the action of self-depiction. This portrait marks a departure in subject matter from Dawson’s predominantly urban paintings, adapting the powerful linear brushstrokes that define his architectural paintings to his own anatomy.Stochastic Variational Inference¶
Suggested reading¶
- Murphy: Chapter 18
Overview¶
- Introduce TrueSkill model as an example problem.
- Review Variational Inference
- Derive the variational objective
- ELBO intuition
- Stochastic optimization
The TrueSkill latent variable model¶
The model we'll be examining is the TrueSkill model, a player ranking system for competitive games originally developed for Halo 2. It is a generalization of the Elo rating system in Chess. For the curious, the original paper introducing the trueskill paper can be found here: The next assignment will be based on doing variational inference in this model.
The problem that this model is supposed to solve is inferring the skill of a set of players in a competitive game, based only on observing who beats who when they play against each other. In the TrueSkill model, each player has a fixed level of skill, denoted \(z_i\). We initially don't know anything about anyone's skill, but for simplicity we'll assume everyone skill is independent. Perhaps we start with an independent Gaussian prior.
We never get to observe the players' skills directly, which makes this a latent variable model. Instead, we observe the outcome of a series of matches between different players. For each game, the probability that player \(i\) beats player \(j\) is given by \(\sigma(z_i - z_j)\) where sigma is the logistic function: \(\sigma(y) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-y)}\). So we can write:
The exact form of the prior and likelihood aren't particularly important, as long as the win probability for player 1 is nondecreasing in \(z_i\) and nonincreasing for \(z_j\). So the higher the skill level, the higher the chance of winning each game.
We can write the entire joint likelihood of a set of players and games as:
Let's draw the prior, likelihood, and posterior for two players. What happens if we see two players both beat each other? Is that different than not seeing any matches at all?
It's hard to draw a graphical model for this joint distribution, but we can draw the graphical model for 3 players that have two games between them, and see that given the outcome of some matches, the players' skills are no longer independent, even if they've never played each other.
Computing even the posterior over two players' skills requires integrating over all the other players' skills:
Posterior Inference in Latent Variable Models¶
Consider the probabilistic model \(p(x, z)\) where
- \(x_{1:T}\) are the observations
- \(z_{1:N}\) are the unobserved latent variables
The conditional distribution of the unobserved variables given the observed variables (the posterior inference) is
which we will denote as \(p_{\theta}(z | x)\).
Whenever the number of values that \(z\) can take is largte, the computation (\int p(x, z)d_z) is intractable, making the computation of the conditional distribution itself intractable. Thus we have to use approximate inference. In today's lecture, we'll learn about variational inference.
Approximating the Posterior Inference with Variational Methods¶
Approximation of the posterior inference with variational methods works as follows:
- Introduce a variational family \(q_\phi(z)\) with parameters \(\phi\).
- Encode some notion of "distance" between \(p(z | x)\) and \(q_\phi(z)\).
- Minimize this distance.
This turns Bayesian Inference into an optimization problem, and if enough parts of our model are differentiable and well-approximated by simple Monte Carlo, we can use stochastic gradient descent to solve this optimization problem scalably.
Note that whatever parametric family of functions we choose for \(q_\phi(z)\), it is unlikely that this variational family will have the true posterior \(p(z|x)\) in it.
The earliest versions of variational inference optimized directly in function space, and required the calculus of variations, but now we use a simpler method that only requires standard finite-dimensional calculus.
Show autograd demo:
Answering questions with an approximate posterior:¶
Once we have this approximate posterior, what can we do with it?
We can find approximate answers to questions about the true posterior. For example: in the Trueskill example, the sorts of questions we might want to answer are:
- Is player A better than player B?
- What is the player with closest skill to B? (for matchmaking)
We can express question as an expectation:
which we could easily approximate with simple Monte Carlo if we could sample from \(p(z_A, z_B | x)\). However, we can't. But if we had a good approximate posterior, we could! For example, we could sample from \(q(z|x)\).
We could answer question two by simply examining the mean of \(q(z_i | x)\) for each \(i\), or estimate it by simple Monte Carlo if it's not available in closed form.
Kullback-Leibler Divergence¶
We will measure the distance between \(q_\phi\) and \(p\) using the Kullback-Leibler divergence.
Note
Kullback–Leibler divergence has lots of names, we will stick to "KL divergence".
We compute \(D_{KL}\) as follows:
Properties of the KL Divergence¶
- \(D_{KL}(q_\phi || p) \ge 0\)
- \(D_{KL}(q_\phi || p) = 0 \Leftrightarrow q_\phi = p\)
- \(D_{KL}(q_\phi || p) \not = D_{KL}(p || q_\phi)\)
The significance of the last property is that \(D_{KL}\) is not a true distance measure.
Variational Objective¶
We want to approximate \(p\) by finding a \(q_\phi\) such that
but the computation of \(D_{KL}(q_\phi || p)\) is intractable (as discussed above).
Note
\(D_{KL}(q_\phi || p)\) is intractable because it contains the term \(p(z | x)\), which we have already established, is intractable.
To circumvent this issue of intractability, we will derive the evidence lower bound (ELBO), and show that maximizing the ELBO \(\Rightarrow\) minimizing \(D_{KL}(q_\phi || p)\).
Where \(\mathcal L(\phi ; x)\) is the ELBO.
Note
Notice that \(\log p(x)\) is not dependent on \(z\).
Rearranging, we get
Because \(D_{KL}(q_\phi (z | x) || p (z | x)) \ge 0\)
\(\therefore\) maximizing the ELBO \(\Rightarrow\) minimizing \(D_{KL}(q_\phi (z | x) || p (z | x))\).
Optimizing the ELBO¶
We have that
If we want to optimize this with gradient methods, we will need to compute \(\nabla_\phi \mathcal L(\phi)\):
we know from a previous lecture that one can get an unbiased estimator of any expectation as long as we can sample from the distribution and evaluate the function, using simple Monte Carlo.
Pathwise Gradient¶
Here, we have the gradient of an expectation. Let's turn it into an expectation by switching the derivative and expectation operators. However, in general, we can't switch the derivative and the expectation if the distribution we're taking the expectation over depends on the parameter. So let's factor out the randomness from \(q\), and put it unto a parameterless, fixed source of noise \(p(\epsilon)\). To do this, we need to find a function \(T(\epsilon, \phi)\) such that if:
Usually we start with \(p(\epsilon)\) being uniform or Normal. It's not always easy to find these functions here's a list, and we already know one for transforming standard normals into Gaussians with a given mean and variance:
Using this trick, we can write our expectation, and then move the gradient inside:
And that's it! Now we have a differentiable function that we can estimate with simple Monte Carlo. Additionally, if \(p(x|z)\) factorizes over the points in the dataset, we can speed up computation by randomly subsampling the data at each iteration as well. These two tricks together mean that SVI can be used to fit models with millions of parameters on millions of datapoints.
We simply need to code up \(T(\epsilson, \phi), \log p(x|z), \log p(z)\) and \( \log q_\phi(z|x))\) in a language or package that supports automatic differentiation, and we will get the gradient for free.
There are some notable extensions we'll cover or mention in this course: 1. We can make \(q_\phi\) arbitrarily expressive, for instance using a mixture of Gaussians, or a normalizing flow. 2. We can fit both \(\phi\) and parameters of \(p(z|x)\) at the same time. For instance, we might want to learn the shape of the function that determines the probability of a win given both players' skills.

Mean Field Variational Inference¶
In mean field variational inference, we restrict ourselves to variational families \(q\) that full factorizes to \(q_\phi(z)\) (no \(x\)!). I.e., we approximate \(p(z|x)\) with \(q_\phi(z)\)
Traditional Variational Inference (ASIDE)¶
If \(q\)s are in the same family as \(p\)s, we can optimize via coordinate ascent.
- Fix all other variables → optimize local
- Aggregate local → optimize global
- Repeat until KL divergence
Score function Gradient etimator, just like the pathwise gradient, but usually much higher variance. One of the main reasons variational inference wasn't used much until recently was that it wasn't widely understood how big the improvement in variance is in high dimensions.Lanvin Group Unveils New Logo
The Lanvin brand logo (above) and the new Lanvin Group logo (below). Lanvin Group.
Lanvin Group officially unveiled its new brand identity Monday, after changing its name from Fosun Fashion Group in October.
The new brand identity includes a new logo that differs from the heritage feel of its Lanvin brand logo. The group joins a cohort of other luxury players in recent years, including Burberry and Balmain, that have discarded more classic serif typefaces and embraced sans-serif capital letters. The Lanvin brand serifs remain, however, and a spokesperson told BoF there was no plan for an immediate change in the Lanvin brand logo or visual identity. A new group website also went live on Monday.
,” said Lanvin Group chairman, Joann Cheng, of the changes.
Lanvin Group’s portfolio of heritage brands include French couture house Lanvin, Italian luxury shoemaker Sergio Rossi, Austrian innerwear specialist Wolford, American womenswear brand St. John Knits, and Italian menswear maker Caruso.

The Sweet Briar Ladies Society Sewing Circle is needled by the death of a highly strung woman in the new mystery by the author of Wedding Duress. Downtown Sweet Briar is now home to a new sewing shop run by one of the circle’s own. With the help and support of her fellow members, Rose is determined to make SewTastic a success, and, to that end, she decides to sponsor a series of do-it-yourself weekends for sewing enthusiasts. But when a group arrives at SewTastic to work on a project, a loud and argumentative guest pushes everyone’s buttons. And when she winds up dead in Rose’s project room—strangled by a sewing machine power cord—it’s up to Tori and the gang to stitch together the clues before Rose’s reason for living is ripped apart at the seams.PATTERN AND SEWING TIPS INCLUDED

But it can also have some serious drawbacks when it comes to dating and navigating the silly season’s countless social commitments when your relationship status is currently set as single.
From family gatherings with nosy relatives to office Christmas parties and overdue annual catch-ups with old friends who demand to know the latest in your love life, the pesky questions thrown at you are never-ending.
More than any other time of the year, the pressure is on to be in a relationship.
Relationship expert and sexologist Dr Nikki Goldstein dispenses some survival dating tips based on lessons learnt from everyone’s favourite unlucky-in-love big screen romantic.
1. Wear the pants and make the first move
Nothing is more attractive to a man than a woman with confidence. Bridget goes after what she wants, whether it’s a job, a story or a man. Avoid the needy, lusty damsel in distress vibe, men love women who can take control – and that’s the kind of man you should be looking for.
2. Put your best briefs forward
Spanx are a girl’s best friend appearance wise but your worst nightmare for wandering hands. This is where a slightly medium size handbag comes in use. If things are getting heated, sneak to the bathroom and quickly change your underwear from frumpy to fabulous. However there are some versions of shape wear that are impossible to quickly remove. Stay away.
3. Surviving an awkward date
Date plenty so you become well practiced at small talk and meet a wide range of personalities. However, a girl must never commit to an entire meal with someone she is not sure of, – always start with a coffee or a drink. But if you do find yourself in a rather awkward situation, which is likely with the rise of dating apps like Tinder and Bumble, there are a few options. Firstly you could start drinking (which never really ends well) or do the classic and run to the bathroom, call a friend and ask them to call you back with an emergency.
4. Dealing with smug married couples at parties
Remember that many married couples don’t always have much sex, often suffer from boredom and often envy the single lives of others. However, putting the single life down justifies their marital status. If you find yourself faced with criticism due to your single status, start telling stories of the amazing things you get to do and all the fabulous people you have dated. Don’t let anyone shame you by celebrating the positive in the life you have.
5. R.E.S.P.E.C.T – Love yourself and your single life
You will miss it when it’s gone. Celebrate it and embrace it. Make sure you are currently doing all the things you can’t do when you are partnered or married. Talk to your friends who are married and ask them what they miss the most. Then go out and do those things. Put yourself first, focus on other areas of your life like fitness, your career and friends.
6. Give the guy in a reindeer jumper a chance
Don’t have a type when it comes to dating. On first appearances, Bridget and Mr Darcy are polar opposites but have a better love story than most. We are often drawn to a particular type of person when dating but challenge where you get these ideals of this person. Good looks might seem fun and flirty, personalities exciting, but focus more on how someone treats you and how you feel when you are with them. They just might come in a package you never thought was for you.
7. Handling meddling mothers and interfering family
Know that their perceived nosiness comes from the heart and wanting good things for you. Otherwise, drink lots and lots of wine to conquer the inevitable moment your mother asks you about your love life.
8. Rules of engagement for casual encounters
Casual encounters are not only a way we date these days, but also can hold surprises. They might turn a date into a hook up buddy or you might discover chemistry you never knew was possible. Keep an open mind but be aware of the consequences, both physically and emotionally. Make sure you set clear rules first and wear protection (that’s not biodegradable and dolphin friendly as in Bridget’s case).Blueberry Pomegranate Goji Berry

Editor's Review:
Michel Thomas Speak French is a teach yourself French course from one of the world's best known language teachers. Sadly now passed away, Michel Thomas had great success teaching numerous high profile clients how to speak foreign languages and built an excellent reputation doing so. At one stage in his career he recorded this audio course, which is still used by thousands of people around the world as a fast and easy way to get started speaking French.
Michel Thomas Speak French offers a beginners and advanced course as well as a vocabulary builder pack, but we are mainly concerned with the beginners level here. It comes on 10 CDs which will take quite a while even for the fastest learners to work through and can be found for a very reasonable price on the internet (check out the links on this page). If you are interested the advanced and vocabulary builder packs both come on 5 CDs each and can also be found at reasonable prices.
The Michel Thomas audio course is well structured and planned to ensure an easy progression from the very basics through to more advanced aspects of the French language. Michel Thomas is a charismatic teacher and very easy to listen to wherever you are. His methods involve breaking down the language into components that are simple and easy to understand then allowing you to use these as building blocks to construct the things you want to say. You will hear him teaching students himself and learn from understanding their mistakes in pronunciation and grammar. At various points you will also be asked to construct phrases and sentences yourself, with suitable pauses to give you time to think.
As far as audio courses go Michel Thomas Speak French is certainly very high quality, although we do have a couple of criticisms. Firstly, it has been pointed out that, although Michel Thomas clearly speaks French fluently and well, he isn't a native speaker and does speak with a slight accent. Some people find this slightly off-putting and would prefer to hear native speakers in order to learn exactly how the French speak. The other slight downside is the factor that affects all audio courses and that is that sometimes it can be very useful to have a written aid to help you remember. Not everyone learns best by listening and so it's important to understand what suits you best before spending any cash.
Michel Thomas Speak French is a great way of getting started learning the French language. The lessons are easy to listen to and you will find yourself picking up words and phrases without even realising it. However, there is no substitution for hard graft and we would recommend picking up a book or two as well if you are serious about mastering French. Check out our top ten for a great selection of the best teach yourself French products we have found.

AdvertisementsIf you want to try your luck in online casinos, you have many options to go for. Whether you want to go for situs gacor Indonesia or anything else, you must know some useful tips and things first. Once you know these tips, you will be able to win by playing these online casino games.
Find the best online casino
At first, you are required to find the best online casino out there. It would be best to research aspects of a casino, such as payout speed, payout percentage, game content, cost, etc. Moreover, you should also check out the reviews and feedbacks given by their clients. If you find the online casino great and authentic, you should play online games there. Else there are so many other casinos to do your research on.
Play games with the lowest house edge
To increase your chances of winning, you must find online casino games with the lowest house edge. Hence, every time you play some game, you give less percentage of commission to the casino.

While playing online casino games, you are bound to lose, and it is a fact. You are never supposed to lose your head and chase the lost amount. Rather just let it go. You lose some, and you win some. This is how it is in online casinos. If you try to chase your losses to win it back, then you will end up losing even more.
Collect all the bonuses
While playing online casino games, you are never supposed to miss collecting the bonuses and freebies. Most of the casinos are to offer different kinds of promo codes, offers, bonuses that you should take to increase your winning. There will be different kinds of bonuses such as sign-up, welcome, deposit, loyalty, etc.
Learn games strategies
In regard to playing situs gacor Indonesia or any other game, you must know different rules and strategies to enhance your chances of winning. Different online casino games are to have different strategies that you must explore in detail. Without having concrete strategies, you will more often lose than winning.
Play within your limits
You are never supposed to bet in an unlimited manner. It is important to set your boundary and then proceed to play within your limits. Moreover, knowing the limits of your knowledge and skills in a specific game is also essential. If you keep playing without any bound, then you will lose all of your money in the process. So do not make this mistake.
Avoid alcohol while playing

The incident occurred around 10:30 p.m. on Fifth Avenue near Liberty Street, when the 36-year-old victim was walking to the Stewarts shop several blocks away. He told police the suspect approached him and asked for a light for a cigarette, followed by another request: “how about your wallet,” according to a police report. The struggle began after the armed suspect rushed the victim, who grabbed at his attacker’s wrist, and ended with the victim receiving several superficial knife wounds to the left side of his chest. The victim, however, told police he was certain he broke his assailant’s nose during the skirmish. The suspect fled south on Fifth Avenue with none of the victim’s belongings. He was described as a black male between 27 and 30 years of age, standing roughly 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighing around 190 pounds. He wore a dark hooded sweatshirt and blue high-top sneakers and had one distinctive characteristic: a tribal marking on his forehead above his left eye. The victim went home after the incident and later took himself to be treated for his injuries.Preparation of City Development Plan for 27 Towns under DMIC (Alwar, Tijara, Behror, Bhiwadi, Bharatpur, Dholpur)

So with Motorsport UK confirming that motorsport will restart in England from 29 March I decided to realise the mood for getting back on track, I would share a project I created over a number of years entitled ‘Through the Night, the Passion of Motorsport’.
Exhibition Prints are £800.00 each (unmounted) print size 20″ x 13″ Exhibition Prints are £950.00 each (mounted and in wooden frame ) frame size 24″ x 20″ Exhibition signed books are at a special price of £35.00
Each photograph is printed on 308gm Hahnemuhle Photo Rag, which is an archival Giclee print and comes rolled in tissue paper then secured in 2 triangular cardboard posting boxes. I tried just using one previously, but had kittens about it bending, so I use 2 and it can be dropped and battered and the print inside stays perfectly pristine. All photographs and catalogues are signed by me.
I accept Paypal and bank transfer; You can order the photos and catalogue by contacting me on: Mobile: 07973 747 248 or my Contact Page here.
Now let’s tell you about the photographs:
The theatre of the pit lane is something of a magical experience, hidden from the crowds in the grandstand, the drivers, mechanics and engineers all work towards winning the race.
My first night time event was the Spa Six Hours where, I fell in love with my Leica Noctilux lens, providing me with such detail from utilising simple car headlamps. Visiting the Monte Carlo Rally Historic I endured the early 3am starts in the snow to capture the cars and people who I now consider to be my friends and hitching a lift to the FIA World Endurance Championship Series at Le Mans for the 24 hours race, I slept in a car trailer empty of its Ferrari, for some of the day so I could be alert from when I went out shooting at night. A lifestyle editorial piece commissioned for the Nurburgring 24 hour race allowed me to walk around the Nordschleife Forest to witness the motorsport fans.
‘Through the Night’ is a selection of my favourite photographs from these races. Some commissioned and others taken out of pure curiosity. It has made me understand the beauty of waiting and often allowed me to be part of a team.
Accredit blows to victory in Big Ass Fans Dueling Grounds Derby Coady Photography photos FRANKLIN, Ky. (Sunday, Sept. 5, 2021) — The $750,000 Big Ass Fans Dueling Grounds Derby had a really big — well, let’s just say really big — purse and wound up also having a really big payoff as Accredit paid $75 to win after going wire to wire under Martin Garcia for a length victory over Yes This Time on opening day of the FanDuel Meet at Kentucky Downs. It was easily the biggest purse won by Lexington-based trainer Pavel Matejka winning the biggest race of his training career. A Churchill Downs allowance winner, Accredit was second in Arlington’s American Derby as the favorite and a close fourth in Ellis Park’s Kentucky Downs TVG Preview Dueling Grounds Derby. Matejka has a farm by his The Thoroughbred Center stable in Lexington, and he had Accredit gallop up and down his undulating fields. That gave him confidence that the son of Flatter would like Kentucky Downs’ course, with its subtle changes in elevation. Matejka wanted Accredit in the clear, which Garcia did by being in front and setting a leisurely pace over turf that started the day firm but was downgraded to yielding with intermittent light rain early in the afternoon. Yes This Time, with 2020 meet leader Tyler Gaffalione aboard, was in striking position but was unable to threaten the winner and finished second by a length. Accredit covered 1 5/16 miles in 2:10.58. “Martin did a great job to get him out and in the clear” after breaking on the rail, Matejka said. “Every time he’s in a spot like that, he’s hard to pass. We didn’t want to get the one hole, and we did. But he did great. The last couple of races, he just didn’t have a very good trip. He got stuck behind horses, nowhere to go, and today it turned out perfect. It was a great ride. This is a free-running horse. No traffic and he’ll give you his best. “He’s a nice horse, and we’ve always liked him. When he gets his trip, I think he can run with anyone. When he was turning for home in the lead, we were very confident. We have a private gallop, a half-mile grass gallop, that is uphill and downhill. That’s where he was training the last couple of weeks, and we knew that he liked it. That made us confident he would like it.” Garcia jumped out to a two-length lead and pretty much kept it throughout, even while getting away with a half-mile in 49.03 seconds, six furlongs in 1:14.31 and the mile in 1:39.56. He paid $75 to win, going off as the fourth-longest shot in the field of 11 3-year-olds. “When he ran last time at Ellis, he broke OK, not sharp as he did today,” Garcia said. “I was on the rail. I didn’t want to get stuck. I was in the lead and tried to run away, so he could be comfortable and happy. When I asked, he just keep going, and I don’t think any horse is going to go by him this time.” Matejka’s jubilant family and crew ran toward the winner’s circle in celebration, in particular assistant trainer Ellen Pike. “It was really incredible, because we put a lot of blood, sweat and tears into these horses,” she said. “And he’s a special horse. He’s a very honest horse, and he’ll give you everything he’s got. He’s also a very free-running horse. He doesn’t like to be stuck on the rail, doesn’t like to be stuck behind horses. As soon as he got the early lead and kept a decent pace and was able to withstand the up and down the hills, to see him really push home was incredibly exciting and incredibly rewarding for the work we’ve put into him.” It was the third overall stakes win for Matejka. He also won the $400,000, Grade 3 Commonwealth Derby at Colonial Downs in 2015 with One Go All Go — who went off at 35-1. Accredit picked up $437,050 for his efforts and now has earned $572,619 for owner Bob Grayson Jr. of California, with the trainer a minority owner. “He said he was screaming the whole trip; he was really happy,” Matejka said of Grayson, who called shortly after the race. “I think all family and friends and everybody else was helping. And they’re all happy now, celebrating. It’s a huge win for everyone. We work hard, and it’s a small stable. These races don’t come every week for us, so we try to celebrate and enjoy while we can. This is a big win for us.” Gaffalione, riding Yes This Time for New York-based trainer Kelly Breen, said he got a perfect trip. “The winner just got loose on the lead by himself, and got brave out there,” he said. “But it was a huge effort by my horse today. We just didn’t win.” Said Breen: “He tried right through the wire. Maybe with a couple more jumps, we would have got it. But I’m proud of him. I thought there was going to be more speed, but apparently not today. The jock (Garcia) did a good job, he walked the dog out there, and got the lead all by himself. I don’t want to tip my hat to him, because he beat us. But he rode a smart race, and I was happy that our horse was running at the end.” It was another 2 1/2 lengths back to Cellist, followed by Modern Science, Red Hornet, Grey Streak, Hilliard, Du Jour, Last Samurai, In Effect and Palazzi. Royal Prince scratched in favor of a stakes at Indiana Grand. Du Jour, the 9-5 favorite under Rosario, was never a factor in finishing eighth at 9-5 odds. “He broke OK but I had a hard time to keep him going with the surface a little bit soft,” Rosario said. “I thought he would lay a little more forward. Just try next time.” Accredit blows to victory in Big Ass Fans Dueling Grounds Derby - The Mint Gaming Hall LOCATION & CONTACT Gaming Racing Live Racing Simulcasting News Horsemen Promotions Eat & Drink Entertainment CareersPrice:

The government is not yet fully exploiting the tourism potential of the country. There are nine historical sites registered by UNESCO. Moreover, Ethiopia is claimed to be the origin of mankind and it boasts with tens of touristic, cultural and historical attractions.
According to the latest Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI), Ethiopia has still a lot to do in terms of its competitiveness and regulatory framework of the tourism sector.
For the time being, trips remain relative expensive, but this is not discouraging tourists from returning back again and again. “Ethiopia is a very large country and it is not a one-time trip. We have clients who come four or five times,” says Samrawit Moges, managing director of Travel Ethiopia, who has been in the industry for over 20 years.
The average stay of a tourist in Ethiopia is 6.5 days while the daily expenses are 160 USD according to the latest data available at the Ministry of Culture and Tourism (MoCT). In the latest report (2011), the overall revenue the country earned from tourism was only 411.7 million USD despite its target to earn 3 billion USD by mid-2015. For a more accurate performance of the tourism industry we would need to know how the sector performed in 2012 and 2013, but reports are not available.
Ethiopia has a good chance to become one of the top travel destinations on the continent. In addition to the nine historical sites registered by UNESCO—such as rock-hewn churches in Lalibela, the Axum monument, Gondar castles, and the Sof Omar cave—endogenous animal species such as chillada baboon and Walia Ibex, which are only found in Ethiopia, are just another of countless wonders and treasures found in Ethiopia. The active volcano and its surroundings are another attraction site. “Ethiopia is not very well-known worldwide but it is an amazing destination,” says Dario Morello, the CEO of Green Land Tours & Hotels, known as the best tour operator in Ethiopia.
“What makes Ethiopia different from the neighboring countries like Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda is that our attractions are not just nature and wildlife, but they are much diversified. We have culture, history, nature and scientific tours,” claims Moges. No doubt about the country’s tourism potential.
But the performance is quite on the contrary. Countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda have registered a robust growth in tourism while Ethiopia is lagging behind. All these countries are among the top ten tourism beneficiaries on the continent while Ethiopia failed to be included among the top twenty. The sector currently contributes not more than 1% to the country’s GDP. “This is very ridiculous,” says Zenawi Mesfin, the general manager of Intercontinental Addis Hotel.
The poor tourism infrastructure has been highly hindering the development of tourism and in consequence the overall revenue was affected, too. Though Addis Ababa is among the top three cities in the world with a large diplomatic community, there is still a lot to be done in terms of the hospitality industry in the city. “The government should be focused on the tourism industry right now―just like it is focused on agriculture or capital markets,” comments Mesfin. “If it does not pay attention to this particular sector, it will be a huge loss for the country,” he adds.
The hospitality industry in Addis Ababa used to be for years dominated by only two five star hotels: Hilton and Sheraton Addis, the latter owned by MIDROC Group’s founder Sheik Mohamed Al Amoudi, the key investor in the country.
Contrary to the huge demand of the industry the supply is still too low though there is a progressive increase. Currently there is only a handful of five star hotels in the capital city. The demand for more luxury hotels is far from being satisfied. “It is at its infancy level,” claims Mesfin.
Thanks to the African Union, the United Nations and other international and regional organizations, Addis Ababa is becoming a hub for conferences for the whole of Africa. As a result, those who are involved in the industry greatly benefit, hotels are almost always booked out. “We are relatively new but within the last six months we have achieved quite a lot. We have reached full occupancy in basically the four months since we opened,” explains Marta Adugna, the owner and general manager of The Residence Suite Hotel, which offers long-term accommodation in Addis Ababa.
The market is simply untapped. The recently emerged hotels such as Intercontinental Addis Hoten and Radisson Blu are about to open additional branches within the country.
The government has recently started addressing the challenges that Ethiopian tourism sector faces. Though it is a bit late and it only comes a partial attempt when compared to the country’s potential to the tourism sector, there are currently ongoing projects to promote the sector. “Here in the UN Conference Centre, we are partnering with the Ethiopian government in various sectors to market Ethiopia and particularly Addis Ababa as a tourism and conference hub in order to further the visibility of Ethiopia in the world,” notes Gerard Hounkponou, chief of UN Conference Centre (Conference Coordination Unit, Conference Services Section).
With a 35 million USD loan from the World Bank, the MoCT is working on improving the tourism infrastructures of ten different tourism sites, including the one of Lalibela. Other projects are to be undertaken in the tourism industry with the help of 10 million Euro granted by the EU—particularly in terms of the capacity building. A separate council under the guidance of the tourism minister of Ethiopia was also put in place.
Moreover, Ethiopian Airlines—the leading African airlines—are further expanding and covering new destinations across the globe. Their expansion is also expected to contribute a lot in terms of developing the tourism sector by attracting more tourists and promoting the country’s assets. The robust economic growth of Ethiopia during the last decade is yet another factor that makes the future of Ethiopia’s tourism sector promising.
“In a very short time, Ethiopia will be one of the highly-frequented destinations on the continent,” envisions Moges from Travel Ethiopia. Greenland Tours & Hotels’ CEO has the very same vision: Ethiopia is to become one of the top travel destinations in Africa.

I really enjoyed your collection, you chose awesome resources to use for your lesson. The amphibian and insect metamorphosis chapters are a great way to allow students to learn different life cycles, and be able to compare and contrast them. The two sciguides are great to use because they give the students a chance to see different stimulations and activities to learn about the life cycles and reproduction. The movie mitosis article is great because it allows the students to produce stop-animation films to help them learn about reproduction; which seems fun for them. You had very good resources that would benefit your students in learning about life cycles and reproduction!

I thoroughly enjoyed looking through your collection. I loved how you picked the topic “earth and space science” because it’s broad enough to be able to research so many different subtopics as well. I really enjoyed reading through the articles and books you chose to put into your collection. The first one you put was “Cloud Watchers”, it came from a trade book and I loved it. It was very animated and aside from the section you added, there are so many other awesome topics that would be used as well. They had engineering, technology and applications of science; they had physical and life science too. You also added an article called, “Developing Inquiring Minds: Students using chromatography to separate the colors in fall leaves” which I thought was so interesting and fun for students to do and learn about. I liked how the article went through the entire experiment and told you how to execute it. Next, was the “Precipitation Matters” article, and I really liked that. I love anything that has to do with weather, especially the rain. This article went through a science experiment that had to do with the shape and sizes of raindrops, and I thought that would be fascinating to do with students. Then you added a book on “Bringing outdoor science in” and I loved it. Very animated and cute, and had so many different topics to cover. They had greening the school, insects, plants, rocks and soils, water and in the sky; and at the very end they have the answer keys for the whole book. The last two articles you added have to do with the solar system and looked very interesting. One had to so with the solar system models; comparing the old ones to the newer ones. The second one, had to do with the shadows and lights around the sun. Overall, I really enjoyed how you covered so many different topics, even thought it was all under the Earth and Science umbrella. You added such good and interesting articles to use and gather information from. Great job!

All Time 2,970One of the traditions that often exist in weddings is throwing a bouquet of flowers by the groom and the bride, and then contested by their friends. That is why this flower arrangement is one of the important ornaments that should not be missed. So, why throw a bouquet of flowers into a tradition? How can this be a mandatory procession that must be in a marriage? The bouquet of flowers is usually held by the bride throughout the wedding ceremony, at the end of the event it will be thrown and ends up in the hands of someone else.
Now the procession of throwing flowers has become a mandatory tradition in weddings. Weddings are something that women crave so much that they are so obsessed with weddings and catching the bouquet of flowers that the bride throws at them. However, over time, in Indonesia, not only female guests are fighting over it. All guests, both unmarried men and women can fight over it. Why are they fighting over the bridal bouquet? Because they believe, things that smell like a bride or a part of the bride can bring good luck to them and of course hopefully get married like them!
To makes them happen, you have to prepares your own wedding party, choosing an invitation for that also being one of many important things to do. 8+ Julia Blossoming Spring Floral Wedding Invitation Templates maybe can be the one that will accompany your wedding, with pretty flowers that bloom like how your love will in the happy day!.Title and statement of responsibility area

Iyabo AdebisiFirst things first : the June 2017 Birchbox comes in the cutest little bag so it’s immediately off to a good start. It also reflects this month’s inspiraton of Brighton Beach with it’s pretty pastel hues and nautical feel. Whether you go to the beach or another day out, this month’s theme is ‘Daytripping’ and staycations and inside the bag is all the little beauty essentials to see you through.
With the cute bag aside, which I’m defo going to be using for my travel makeup FYI, let’s have a look at the other products and see if they make this month’s Birchbox a good’un.
First up there is a full-size Ecotools Eye Enhancing Set (worth £6.99) that contains 2 eye brushes. I’m really excited to get these as I actually have never tried Ecotools – yikes! Another full-size product comes in the form of the Cowshed Cow Pat (!) Hand Cream (worth £8) which I have had before and it’s a REALLY good hand cream so I am happy with this also. Last up for the full-sizers (by the way 3 in one box is REALLY good!), is a MeechNmia Brow liner (worth £12.99). I haven’t heard of this brand before and unfortunately the colour is too pale for me as it’s for blondes but it won’t go to waste as I can use this and try it in my kit.
Next up is the Scrub Love Coffee Body Scrub (50g) which is a really decent size to get a few uses out of it and I’ve been wanting to try this for absolutely ages so again, a big thumbs up from me. I am yet to try it as a scrub but I can confirm it smells wonderful and it’s one of those products I just *know* that I’m going to love. The Bobbi Brown Extra Eye Repair Cream is a generous size to get a good 2 weeks trial out of it. I haven’t tried this before but I have heard it’s meant to be good – another product I am happy to receive.
So this month’s Birchbox = L O V E. There’s a few key reasons why I am really impressed. First up : There is 3 full-sized items. Secondly : It’s worth a good £40+ so it’s such a bargain. Third : I am a beauty junkie, literally every box I have tried most of the products/brands and for the first time EVER, I’ve only tried 1/5 and this excites me.

The first line of input contains a line with four non-negative integers, $2 \le n \le 500$, $0 \le m \le 10\, three (space-separated) integers $u$, $v$ and $c$ indicating that there is an edge from $u$ to $v$ in the graph with capacity $1 \le c \le 10^{8}$.
Output
The output should begin with a line containing three integers $n$, $f$, and $m’$. $n$ is the number of nodes in the flow graph (same as in input), $f$ is the size of a maximum flow from node $s$ to node $t$ in the flow graph, and $m’$ is the number of edges used in the solution. You may assume that $f < 2^{31}$.
Then there should be $m’$ lines, each containing three integers $u$, $v$ and $x$, indicating that $x$ units of flow are transported from $u$ to $v$. $x$ must be greater than $0$ and at most as big as the capacity from $u$ to $v$. Each pair of vertices $(u, v)$ should be given at most once in the output.Dear Laurell K Hamilton,
I’m sure that you’re as sick of me as I am of your writing.
I’d been a long-time fan of your work from when I was a teenager (maybe fourteen) and I came across a copy of Incubus Dreams in a Books A Million down here in sunny South Florida.
From the start, I was captivated by all of the things that seemed so cool and relatable about Anita. She was a tiny, mean Latina who took no shit from anyone – even the guys that she loved. She was a necromancer who battled vampires and pushed back against racism and sexism from her fellow law enforcement officers. She slept with a gosh-darned penguin stuffed toy and didn’t care who knew about it.
When I first started reading the Anita Blake series, I loved it.
Genuinely.
I loved your writing.
Deeply.
I’d grown up reading Anne Rice’s work and her vampires were incredibly formative for me. But her books have always been incredibly white and the queerness in her books, while present, was supremely unsatisfying to go through and it frequently felt as though it could be unconfirmed in a heartbeat.
So, I started the Anita Blake series because your books were immediately a level above because on the surface, the series was diverse and sexy, on top of super freaking violent.
It did so many things that I wanted it to do when I was a teenager –
But that was surface level stuff.
I don’t know if you’ve actually read any of my work, Laurell, but once I looked underneath the surface of the stories you were telling, I started to realize that the pretty (to me) surface hid a whole lot of rot.
Rot in the form of the way you write race and racism, Anita’s endless internalized misogyny, the on the page worship of law enforcement in your series, and so much of how harmfully you write queer people.
Why?
Do you not have anyone around you that could tell you that you needed to redirect your writing and bring Anita into the twenty-first century?
Do you not have any writer friends that can hold your hand through redeveloping meaningful character arcs?
Any Black friends that can let you know that pretty much every single Black character you’ve written has been written poorly?
And on that note –
Laurell, in the twenty plus years that you’ve been writing the Anita Blake series, you made the choice not to have Anita have any significant relationships with any Black people. She has Black acquaintances, enemies, and shifters she’s responsible for, but it’s beyond messed up that she doesn’t have any Black friends despite living in a city that has a population that’s like 20% Black people.
I have to say that that’s one of the larger red flags across the series, but it’s also something that stands out as especially frustrating to me because you literally have to work to be this bad at writing Black characters.
Don’t get me wrong, Laurell, you are flat out bad at writing characters of color.
Regardless of their ethnicity, you are bad at writing people of color in realistic and responsible ways.
You objectify East Asian characters, relying on Orientalism to make your points about how sexy they are.
You write Latino characters as gangbangers and aggressive machismo dripping dudes. Anita is Schrodinger’s Latina with a vanishing Latinidad and all other Latinas – the few who show up in the series – are treated like stereotypes too.
The few Native American characters you do write – like Bernardo Spotted Horse – are written as incredibly racist stereotypes and Bernardo in particular is treated like a semi-sentient sex object and not as a character in his own right.
It is tiring, to be sure.
It’s also racist as hell.
It’s no secret that I find you to be incredibly racist too. Right?
Also, Laurel… I know I’m not the first person to bring this up to you, but uh… you know that Anita really hates other women, right?
Like she’s flat out oozing internalized misogyny and it’s getting so much worse with every single book you write where you double down on her hatred of women by making all other women be enemies to fight or victims for her to take care of.
Serpentine was literally an exercise in major internalized misogyny. There were so few characters that Anita actually got along with –
My god.
And the fact that so much of her ire was reserved for women that wanted her man (or one of her men) is like… frustrating.
At twenty-nine, looking back at the Anita verse, I can say that Anita reads like a character I would’ve written when I was a teenager.
She’s irrationally unkind to women who threaten her (by being prettier, by being smarter, by tougher than she is, etc). She’s a “character of color” that is functionally white in terms of how the world sees her, but conveniently gets to rock her POC-ness when she needs to tell someone else – usually another, browner POC – that she’s got experiences with racism that invalidate theirs.
But I don’t write characters like that in 2019 and you shouldn’t be either.
Honestly Laurell, I could go on for ages about how awful your work is in retrospect. I know I could because I’ve been doing this for the better part of the past five years of running my website.
I’ve put up with rereading your books, going through your social media and blog posts, and navigating forums and review sites populated with straight nonsense about you and your life.
I even own a copy of The Diva Ate Her – which I’ve been assured by multiple people in your sphere of influence has some actual factual information about your past behavior across it – and that’s a slog if I’ve ever read one.
I’ve devoted a ton of my time, energy, and emotions into reading your work – work that has triggered me repeatedly due to the careless way you write about sexual violence and gendered violence.
I’m not calling it suffering because obviously, I did this to myself, but this is me doing something else for myself: giving up on your work.
Unless you do something especially heinous across either of your series or you turn the boat around and start creating content with actual substance, I’m tapping out for the time being.
There are other, less painfully problematic books that I can cover for my Urban Fantasy 101 series and other authors who handle criticism more gracefully than you and Anne Rice do.
Because it’s not worth it, Laurell.
My audience has learned all it’s going to from my sporking and your audience doesn’t care that I’m writing about your work. And at the end of the day, if you’re not listening to editors, reviewers, and your dwindling sales and trying to figure out how to be better and do better as a writer, you’re sure as hell not going to be listening to me.
Part of why I’m letting your series go is because I don’t see the point of it anymore.
I just found myself repeating the same critiques about sexuality, race, gender, and disability on end because you literally never learned across almost three decades of this series. You literally are incapable of being a better writer. You are stagnant and you were making me stagnant.
I am so not about that life.
I’m actually going to #TreatMyself and move on to a writer whose work doesn’t leave me feeling a deep and unending rage. I’m sure I can find one or two urban fantasy writers whose genre faux pas don’t hinge primarily on unchecked bigotry, rape culture as a fact of their worldbuilding, and bad writing as heavily as yours.
I hope that one day, you’ll get critique partners and an editing crew that nudges you towards being a better writer and person.
I hope it happens before you uh… fall too far to make a solid comeback as a writer.
Here’s hoping 2020 brings you clarity and better direction.
xoxo

Awww Anita Blake sporks are all the entertainment I get out of her books since they stress me out
Unfortunately, they stress me out too! But don’t worry, if she puts out anything new that’s just as awful, I’ll be there to dunk on her! 🙂Aeries Ideas

3 things every senior needs to know about Life Settlements a life insurance policy is one of the most valuable assets a person can own they're also one of the most misunderstood and wasted people don't realize that a life insurance policy is personal property just like their home and then it has a life settlement value while they're still alive seniors in particular too often throw their policy away after making premium payments for years the owner of a life insurance policy can sell their life policy through a life settlement for its higher market value but are often unaware of the unique Financial options designed specifically to benefit them while they're still alive in fact over 90% of seniors who lapse or Surrender a policy they would have considered a settlement if they had known about them so we'd like to answer the top three questions we ask by people new to the secondary insurance Market one what is a life settlement it's the legal right of every life insurance policy on her to be able to sell their policy like any other asset to a new owner who will take over the premium payments and then we'll collect the death benefit years later to who qualifies most often a life settlement is for seniors over the age of 65 with a life insurance policy above $100,000 Face Value the value of a life settlement is based on reverse underwriting so the older and sicker a person is the more they'll get from a life settlement someone to younger healthy is not going to qualify for a life settlement 3 so how does a life settlement work the process of a life settlement only takes about 60 to 90 days and there are thousands of transactions completed every year policyowners 10 to receive settlement values there are approximately 4 billion dollars of Life Settlements transacted every year so now that we've answered some questions let's look at what your life settlement options might be Life Settlements provide a number of different Financial options to address the you need financial challenges of Aging a life settlement can provide a lump sum cash settlement with no restrictions on how the money is used or they can be used to fund long-term care on a tax-free basis or it can be used to maintain a reduced death benefit policy with no more premium paint or it can be used to fund an annuity to secure a guaranteed income stream for life the important thing to know is that a life settlement is a much better solution than surrendering or Worse letting a policy lapse we hope this isn't helpful information and determining if you are eligible for Life settlement for more information or to receive a three policy review please contact us

Article content
Star Wars bosses are giving lucky fans the chance to win walk-on roles in the forthcoming Han Solo movie as part of a 40th anniversary charity drive.
Actors Daisy Ridley and Mark Hamill announced the details for the latest Star Wars: Force for Change campaign, which celebrates the sci-fi franchise’s longrunning success, on Tuesday, offering devotees special prizes in exchange for charity donations.
This year’s Past, Present and Future fundraising initiative will give fans the opportunity to enter a raffle via Omaze.com to win a stay at franchise creator George Lucas’ Skywalker Ranch in Marin County, California, and be treated to a rare tour of the property, which houses a huge archive of original Star Wars props, costumes, and set pieces, as well as a private screening of 1977’s Star Wars: A New Hope.
Donors will also be in with a chance of winning tickets to attend the premiere and after party for the Star Wars: The Force Awakens sequel Star Wars: The Last Jedi in December, and a visit to the London set of the planned Han Solo spin-off film, with the opportunity to make a cameo as a background extra.
The 2017 contest runs until 11 May, with donations for the Omaze.com/StarWars campaign helping to support the work of the Starlight Children’s Foundation, a new beneficiary.
The Force for Change campaign was originally launched by The Force Awakens director J.J. Abrams in 2014, and has since raised millions for non-profit organisations like UNICEF Kid Power, the American Red Cross, Boys & Girls Clubs of America, and the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

Launched last year, Starlink relies upon both a growing constellation of satellites in orbit around Earth and an auto-positioning dish on the ground that communicates with them.
The satellite network has been a work-in-progress for SpaceX, with multiple launches of its Falcon 9 rockets adding to the mesh. As that happens, gaps in Starlink coverage have been filled, and more users added to the system.
On the ground, Starlink uses a custom satellite dish that links with a special router. Configured using the Starlink app, it’s designed to automatically move so as to keep the constellation overhead at the optimal angle. However, it has also proved to be a source of fascination among those curious to see what Elon Musk’s company have squeezed inside.
One such group is the Computer Security and Industrial Cryptography (COSIC) research team at KU Leuven, which acquired a Starlink system when it launched in Belgium at the end of May. Researchers there wasted no time in opening up the dish for a teardown, and then extracting the software for further analysis.
They came across some interesting tidbits along the way, not least the fact that SpaceX has clearly been iterating on its core dish design already. The COSIC Starlink hardware differs from what has been seen in prior teardowns, and there are some differences in connectors. Elon Musk recently said that the company is working on halving the cost of building each Starlink dish, since right now SpaceX is losing money on them.
What’s particularly curious is how SpaceX keeps those development systems from getting out into the wild. “Development hardware is geofenced to only work in certain predefined areas, most of which are clearly SpaceX locations,” COSIC’s Lennert Wouters explains. “SpaceX is likely notified if development hardware is used outside these predefined geofences.”
It’s not the only control on getting too much access to the underlying systems. The software exploration also revealed that SpaceX has prevented users from logging in to the live system, by including a check during boot to see whether the hardware has been fused or not. Consumer dishes are fused before they’re shipped, and so the login prompt is disabled.
While hacking a Starlink dish is probably a bad idea – almost as much as mounting one on the hood of your car, in fact – it’s interesting to see the amount of work that has gone into building the system. It’s certainly cost SpaceX no small amount, with Musk suggesting that it could be $5-10 billion in investment before Starlink is fully cash flow positive. As well as the improvements in the pipeline for the Starlink dishes, currently SpaceX is working on the v1.5 satellites – with laser-based links in-between each satellite – and then the v2.0 update sometime in 2022.
Repost: Original Source and Author Link“TAKIBI NO OTO -TAKIBI MUSIC FESTIVAL-” was held on October 31st.
This event, which was held for the 6th time, was held live-streaming this year in consideration of the influence of the new coronavirus. The day was blessed with good weather, and the venue was filled with enthusiasm by the wonderful music of the artists and the flames of the campfire.
While all the big events were canceled, we wanted to manage to hold “TAKIBI MUSIC FESTIVAL”. In order to formulate more safer and more secure guidelines, we solicited opinions through SNS and accepted reservations instead of starting ticket sales. We had more meetings than usual and aimed to meet the expectations of the customers who gave us their opinions and reservations, but unfortunately we were not able to welcome the visitors.
Even so, in order to keep the fire of the campfire, we decided to hold a new form of “TAKIBI MUSIC FESTIVAL” for the first time this year by live distribution.
Even though it is live-streaming, Wakasu Seaside Park campsite where you can enjoy camping and campfires on the lawn even in Tokyo. And at “TAKIBI MUSIC FESTIVAL” you can relax and get familiar with the music. From the day before, all the staff made preparations for the setup in order to convey the charm of the festival as we do every year. Partly because of that, the weather on the day of the event was very sunny in autumn. As the sun rises, the temperature rises, the green of the lawn shines, and it was sweaty in sunny places.
The first performance is an upbeat DJ by starRo, who was nominated for the 2016 Grammy Award for Best Remix Recording and has received a lot of attention overseas. The staff was nervous because it was the first live distribution, but the distribution started safely. Under the clear blue sky, we were able to deliver a comfortable sound from the stage that is the DJ BAR every year.
Next, we moved the stage to the sea side and prepared for live performance by KENTA HAYASHI, who is also widely active in North America, South America, Asia, and Europe. we moved the equipment in a hurry with the staff who distributes the video. The white canvas of the stage tent was breezy to match the pleasant tone.
The venue gradually reaches dusk, and the Tokyo Gate Bridge glitters in the setting sun. The bonfire begins to light in the beautiful evening scenery as usual, where the sky and the sea are dyed orange.
The four-member band nego is finally on stage as the venue is surrounded by the atmosphere of “TAKIBI MUSIC FESTIVAL”. Each sound is intertwined, and the unique sound that hits the body directly, combined with the flame of the campfire that gradually strengthens the momentum, seems to liven up the night that will start from now on.
And Mitsukaze, last year he co-starred with Green Massive and Karamushi, but this year he will appear solo. It was a very powerful performance even in solo, and at the end it was a chorus involving the people concerned and staff, and the voice echoed throughout the venue forever.
The last is the RABIRABI, also known as the Jomon transformer unit. This was also a more powerful performance than usual, and wrapped the venue in a groove that mixed the darkness of the night and the flame of the bonfire and sublimated it.
All the artists showed off their wonderful sounds and live performances that were as hot as the flames of the campfire, probably because it was the first outdoor live in a long time due to the corona situation, or because it was to blow away such “new-normal” life. The delivery was also a great success, and we were able to finish it with no problems.
This collaboration apron was created for those who were looking forward to this event, which was unfortunately not normally held, and with the hope that it could be held safely next year.
All the staff wore it on the day. Even from the event staff who carry a lot of equipment on site and need a lot of work such as setting up and preparing for a campfire praised highly “There are many pockets so you can store everything you need!” It doesn’t get stiff shoulders! “
This year, as a result of considering the “safety and security” of all people involved in “TAKIBI MUSIC FESTIVAL”, including customers, artists, and staff in the corona storm, only live distribution was held. We hope that the coronavirus infection will be resolved as soon as possible, and all the staff will make an effort to hold the event in a more powerful form next year, so please look forward to it.
We are looking forward to seeing you at the venue.
Crowdfunding, which we were trying for the first time, has finished successfully. Thank you to everyone who made the purchase and support comments!
Even after the crowdfunding is over, you can purchase it at the online shop. This product has received a lot of praise from the field and work staff as well as the outdoor scene. (Online shop is currently in preparation) It will open later this month, so please check it out!

/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/DGRSX64CA5K3HK5QQ6Y3BTFFUQ.jpg)
It's likely already struck you or someone you know.
It's safe to say a lot of people have been sick with the flu this season.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists much of the U.S. in the high flu activity category, including Wisconsin.
But what's different this year, and what's still puzzling to doctors, is the kind of influenza more people are getting.
The strain of flu that's been most active so far is the one most likely to affect more kids.
When you've got a high fever, aches and a virus working hard on your lungs, you just feel awful, no matter what strain of influenza you have.
But to doctors -- and to parents -- that strain does matter a little more.
"The main difference is the populations that are susceptible. Usually kids are more susceptible to B strain, and adults are more susceptible to A strain," says Prevea Health infectious disease physician Dr. Edward Morales.
Of the two common strains of the flu, almost every year strain A strikes first.
Strain B usually comes later in the season, often in February.
But this year, Prevea Health centers statewide report 30 times more cases of that B strain than this time last year, with 151 cases compared to just five a year ago.
Dr. Morales says the strains are both incredibly contagious, but kids, especially young children, are most susceptible to the strain surging right now.
He says that may be partly because they have less-developed respiratory tracts or immune systems which aren't that strong yet.
," explains Dr. Morales.
But exactly why the strains are flip-flopped the medical community can't really answer yet.
Doctors do say we're not likely near a peak yet so getting a flu shot is still recommended and can still give you protection.
Dr. Morales says the vaccine this year does cover both A and B strains.
"For most vaccines, complete immunity usually (takes) two weeks or so, maybe as much as three weeks, but you start getting immunity as soon as you get the vaccine, so you start actually developing that protection right away, so it's worthwhile," says Dr. Morales.
He says adults and children can fall sick with either strain.
When asked whether he expects to see more A strain influenza in the coming weeks, Dr. Morales says, "I think the flu season is really unpredictable, and people don't always know what's going to happen."
He says fevers for the virus can last for several days, and kids shouldn't be going to school or daycare until fevers are completely gone. Most schools ask parents not to let children return to school until they're fever-free for at least 24 hours.About the offer

It condenses the history, culture and the true essence of the Cuban. Hence, it is preferred by everyone who visits the island.
Read on to learn more about Cuban Rums.
Aspects related to the topic:
- What is the history of Cuban rums?
- What is the secret of the quality of Cuban rum?
- What types of Cuban rums are there?
- Where to buy these Cuban rums?
- What should be taken into account when choosing a certain rum?
What is the history of Cuban rums?
Cuba’s rum and history are inseparable.
Their relationship began with the introduction of sugarcane by Christopher Columbus in the first years of his arrival in Cuba, his growth was mainly due to the tropical climate present on the island and the fertility of the soil.
And once grown the Spaniards used to produce a fermented called tafia, the ancestor of the rum that we know today.
The idyll lasted little: fearing that Spanish products lost their place in the market, the Crown prohibited the production of distillates in Cuba.
It was four centuries later (in 1800) that Pedro Diago -considered the father of the rum- introduced the copper stills and the idea of ??aging the brandy in wooden jars.
This is how a lighter rum called ‘superior rum’ came into being, with a refined taste (more subtle and caramelized alcoholic beating) that was popularized in the Spanish court and in the British colonies.
But this also did not last forever.
One hundred years later, many of the distilleries closed or moved after the revolution, as a result of the trade blockade that the United States imposed on Cuban products.
At this time only a couple of the distilleries remained: Legendary and Havana Club.
The second, above all, adopted the mission of defending the fame and quality of Cuban rum in the world.
And so they became very famous on the island.
What is the secret of the quality of Cuban rum?
Behind the secrets of Cuban rum, there is a man essential, the master, master and master of the winery, Master Ronero.
On one occasion, speaking as the First Master Ronero of Havana Club, José Navarro, he told us about his work and stated that in Cuban rum there was no secret in its manufacture.
Its quality is not due to a well-kept formula, only to “a culture inherited and transmitted from generation to generation, from Cuban to Cuban, from heart to heart …”.
What types of Cuban rums are there?
Today, in the international market, more and more prestigious rum brands of Cuban origin are bursting with increasing intensity, which stand out for their quality thanks to exquisite products, among which are:
Havana Club:
Distributed by the French company Pernod-Ricard, the Havana Club brand is considered the best-known Cuban rum in the world and the main “raw material” of Cuba’s rich cocktail bar.
This brand has kept alive the art of aging. It is marketed on the entire planet.
Its emblem is La Giraldilla, a statuette also the symbol of the city of Havana.
It has a wide arsenal among the best known are:
- Havana Club 3 Years widely used in the preparation of Cuban cocktails (Cuba Libre, Piña Colada, Mojito, Daiquiri, among others);
- Havana Club Special, Havana Club 7 Years;
- Havana Club Teacher Selection;
- Havana Club 15 Years and
- Havana Club Máximo (the most expensive manufactured by the brand so far).
2. Santiago de Cuba:
It is one of the oldest since it has a century and a half of creation and It belongs to the cradle of light rum par excellence and constitutes one of the most elitist and exclusive brands of Cuba.
It was the Bacardi rum factory before the Cuban revolution, intervened by the government in the first years; hence the conflicts that do not seem to reach the end between both brands.
In Cuba by seasons it is easy to find the Santiago de Cuba (white) but it is really difficult to find the Santiago de Cuba Añejo (dark)
THERE IF YOU FIND IT through the streets during your visit to the island do not hesitate to buy it, you will not regret .
The Santiago de Cuba 500 rum is one of the most exclusive spirits of the Corporación Cuba Ron S.A and Cuban rum in general.
This Rum, produced exclusively in the Ronera of Santiago de Cuba was registered as a Three-dimensional Mark in the trademark registration of the Intellectual Property Office of the European Union.
3. Legendary:
This brand was founded in 1946 and offers merchandise elaborated in the old style with the use of American oak barrels, the use of silica sand or the filtering from the double bottom of the tanks.
This line is somewhat sweeter compared to other types of rum in Cuba.
Among the most popular is the Legendary Elixir, which is similar to a liqueur although it does not stop being rum and the Legendary 7 Years equally exquisite.
4. Cubay:
This Cuban Rum, in the modality of Extra White White Card, has been awarded in international events, even in blind tastings where it has been successful as best White Rum, best Golden Rum and Premium Rum, first quality.
5. Mulata:
It is a mixture of spirits, demineralised water and additives, but its main ingredient is sugarcane whose rigorous selection has an impact on the optimum quality of the molasses.
Its manufacturer is Tecnoazúcar.
It constitutes another important line of rum, among them the Mulata Añejo 15 years.
6. Pearl of the North:
It is one of the youngest lines of rum on the island but paradoxically it is manufactured in one of the oldest rum factories in Cuba, the popularly known “Arrechavala” family name to which he belonged until the first years of the Cuban revolution when the factory was nationalized.
This famous rum factory for some years served as a refinery for Havana Club rum.
It is located in Cárdenas just 15 minutes from Varadero.
7. Arecha:
Founded in the 19th century, it accumulates the expertise of the best rum masters.
They maintain a tradition to elaborate it that dates back more than 80 years and still continues in force.
It also has a unique flavor from the region of the country where it is produced.
8. Edmundo Dantes:
Marked by the exclusivity and excellence of this drink native to eastern Cuba, only three thousand bottles are produced annually.
It leaves the palate a light vanilla taste and has a golden color that puts it on the list of the most appreciated rum industry products in the world.
9. Caney:
Also elaborated to the archaic method, it has its base in the sugar cane with the unique flavor of the eastern lands that gives rise to an unparalleled drink.
It is most popular in the eastern region of the country.
Where to buy these Cuban rums?
If you want to buy Cuban rums, you can go to any store in Havana and ask, usually there is always.
Another place, La Casa del Ron in Varadero, not only offers different varieties of Cuban rum, but also combines the pleasure of tasting good liquor with history.
What should be taken into account when choosing a certain rum?
There are many variants of rum: white, golden, aged, black, fruity, premium … and each of them has its peculiarities.
1. Ron Blanco
It is the most popular of all and due to the neutrality in its flavor, it is ideal to combine with soft drink, mineral water or fruit juice, which makes it the favorite of many when preparing a good cocktail or a refreshing mojito.
2. Golden Ron
Its flavor is usually stronger and more penetrating, which is why many experts use it to prepare a good free Cuba.
3. Ron Añejo
The aged rum is a little stronger and its flavors are more complex. When it is a good aged rum, it is recommended to take it alone, with an ice or a little mineral water.
4. Black Rum
Its time of aging in barrels is usually greater, hence the color so dark it acquires.
For many it is the rum that has more flavor, so it is recommended to take it alone, with a little water or a few drops of lemon.
5. Ron Gran Reserva or Premium
His name says it all.
It usually has a lot of character and at the same time softness.
The experts consider that this type of rums should never be mixed, since the elaboration of a rum of this quality has a special aging in reserved barrels of each distilling house.

While it is clear the odds can swing with relatively modest amounts of money, the punters are certainly not stepping up to take what appear to be very generous odds about a Labor victory. This is probably because a lot can and will change over the next two years.
Security issues, "we fixed the budget mess, stopped the boats" and all of those other seemingly hot button topics will be wheeled out by the Coalition as the 2016 election looms. It is odd that voters are so wedded on these issues which have little material impact on their way of life. Labor will, of course, run on Abbott's broken promises, they will probably promise to get rid of the bunch of horribly unfair budget measures (the Medicare co-payment, university fee hikes, pension cuts and the like) but in doing so, Labor will be vulnerable to the good old "where's the money coming from" questioning from their opponents. They better have a well crafted answer or else they will be in trouble.
Rarely does a government have just one term, which is possibly why the Coalition remain hot favourites to win in 2016. Maybe that favouritism is because of the benefits of incumbency and the judgement that the security, boats and fiscal bogie will be tough to beat, that the betting markets remain so strongly in the Coalition's favour.
Who knows. As a keen punter, I have not yet put a cent on the election. The odds for either side are just not attractive enough and there is too many unknowns that can tilt the probabilities one way or another.This bug affects 3 people

Kim Kardashian revealed in a recent episode of Ellen Degeneres’ digital series “Mom Confessions” that her and Kanye West’s 8-year-old daughter North is not a fan of their home’s decor.
The 40-year-old reality star was asked during the episode, “What’s the meanest thing your child has said to you?” And Kardashian’s response was so funny it seemed like a missed opportunity for a sketch during her hosting turn on “Saturday Night Live” last week.
“Every time I get into some kind of disagreement with my daughter North, she thinks this is a dig to me: She’ll say, ‘Your house is so ugly, it’s all white! Who lives like this?’” Kardashian said.
She added:
“She just thinks it, like, gets to me, and it is kind of mean because I like my house.”
The Skims founder’s home that she shared with West has been a pop cultural punching bag ever since the former couple began posting photos of their interior, which boasts a monochrome white coloring, sparse decoration and a remarkably empty vibe.
Vogue’s digital series “73 Questions” also gave fans a thorough peek in Kardashian’s pad in 2019.
Here’s hoping that Kardashian doesn’t get too hurt when her daughter hurls insults.“I’ve always been in the horse and livestock business,” said Joe Simon of Dakota Rodeo. “Back in about 1980 I took a couple of my bucking horses to this one fella’s rodeo to sell. These were good horses — one of them bucked a rider right off. I thought that my price was already low, but the fella wanted to give me even less than I was asking. He told me that if I wanted that much money, then I ought to just do rodeo myself. I was young, so I did.
“When I was first starting out, I’d go out to sales in Oklahoma and Montana to pick out good horses. People would bring me horses that the cowboys couldn’t ride, because they’d buck too much. There’s no way to make a horse buck, though — they either want t

o buck, or they don’t. Sure, there are rare exceptions. Sometimes you’ll find a saddle horse that wasn’t broken even after going through a couple of trainers, but a real bucking bronco is its own special breed. They’re born to buck, sired by a horse that was born to buck. They buck hard, and they instinctively know the best rhythm to buck to. We’ve been breeding them better and better over the years. Even the old time cowboys will tell you that horses buck better nowadays.
“A bucking horse has a good life outside of the rodeo. I give my champions Bartender and Pepper Girl the best pasture, the best grain, and worm them three times a year. We don’t make them buck a lot, because we want to keep them fresh so they can perform at their very best. Working for eight seconds ten times a year sounds pretty good to me.
“If you go to a good rodeo, the hair stands up on the back of your neck, watching how those cowboys ride the bucking horses. Sometimes the horse or bull kicks them hard — if they were football players they’d be out for weeks, but they’re back up in the saddle the next day. If they ride good at a tournament, they get a check. If they don’t, all they can do is try again.
“The rodeo is a living legend, an American tradition. It’s pure action, fast-paced, and adds so much to our culture. Rodeo’s only gotten better, too — back in the day only a handful horses were any good, but now they all have a chance to win. It’s something everyone should see, at least once.
“When I help you out with a rodeo, I’ll do as much as you need me to. If you just want the broncos and the bulls, I’ll take care of it. I can also advise you on who to hire. After all these years in the business I’ve seen all the announcers, all the clowns, and I know who’s the best. If you’d like your rodeo turnkey, then I can put together the whole team and the rest of the show for you too.”
Dakota Rodeo is based in Perkins, Oklahoma, and serves the entire Midwest. You may learn more about them at dakotarodeo.com.

Every time you plan your vacation there are many details that must be taken into account. Thus, in addition to the expenses that we will allocate to spend a few days off, we must also add the care of the house that we will leave. Laura Blackham and John goodhand They chose to entrust the keys to their home to friends to guard the residence while they were traveling. However, when they returned they found a devastating scene.
“We couldn’t get in,” explained the couple. This particular story, with overtones of a novel, happened in Great Britain. Everything was going well until the holidays were over, but when trying to enter his home in Grimsby, the friends who looked after his house had taken over. “They said that they had entrenched and that they would not leave ”, the man revealed through tears.
They refuse to leave the house
“It was so weird because we didn’t know what we had done wrong to them,” explained John Goodhand, who still can’t believe his own friends scammed them this way. “We went on vacation about three weeks ago and we trust where the house would be safe with our friend. But when we returned on Friday, November 12, we couldn’t get in, ”he recalled in distress.
/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/artear/VSX36DF6RZDIBAGJ3ZFQNGKHMM.jpg)
“We made several attempts to fix and reason with them, but all to no avail. They made us both feel bad about stress and worry, ”added John. Goodhand explained that they were entrusted with the house not only because they knew them but also because they were going through financial problems. So the idea was that they could stay at home while they were gone. In this way, they had three more weeks to find a house to stay in and a job to rent.

Totally disgusting
John Goodhand called what happened as totally “strange. We just couldn’t believe they did this to us. It’s disgusting to be locked up outside your own home. ” They even reported that as soon as they found out that they would not be able to enter, they quickly sought refuge in a home close to theirs. Nevertheless, his wish is to go home despite having been robbed.

“They threw our furniture into the backyard and destroyed it. Even, they broke down part of the wall off the property. We wanted the house back, ”he said indignantly. “What they have done to the property is unforgivable,” he added through tears. “Now it is a complete disaster and we are both deeply hurt by what happened to us. We want to go, ”Goodhand pleaded.

Democratic lawyer Daniel S. Goldman, the counsel for the House Intelligence Committee, stated that Trump is still trying to control next year’s presidential elections with threats that Rudy Giuliani, his personal lawyer, would make a report to the Justice Department over House Democrats (per The New York Times). The Republicans, upset that Goldman was representing Adam Schiff on the floor, made this anger clear, and the attacks got personal. Doug Collins, ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, got into a spat with Goldman during the hearing, critiquing Goldman’s disposition and tone. When Goldman tries to defend himself, Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz interjects into the conversation out of nowhere, leading to a gavel being swung several times. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler finally calms things down, reminding his colleagues, “You cannot simply yell out and upset the committee.” To make matters more chaotic, there was a pro-Trump protester who had to be escorted out of the room: “Americans are sick of your impeachment scam! Trump is innocent!” — House Judiciary’s impeachment hearing is immediately interrupted by a pro-Trump protester. pic.twitter.com/bbcguyKLFF— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) December 9, 2019 The video of the heated exchange between Collins and Goldman can be seen below, with the bickering heating up at about 2:16. The biggest irony in the video? At the end of the clip, Republican attorney and chief counsel for the Oversight and Investigations subcommittee Ashley Hurt Callen can be seen laughing at the exchange. This is all happening under an administration in which the president has suggested a number of times that women are too emotional for politics.

It's no secret that things can get overwhelming around Christmas time, and this year is no exception. Here are 7 ways to reduce seasonal stress and keep the merry and light this Christmas. Make this year a year to remember.
1. Get organised
Santa is such a pro at this, make a list and check it twice. You may have an excellent memory, but it is always a good idea to have everything down on pen and paper or in digital form whichever works best for you.
A calendar can work well in this type of scenario so that you can see a chronological timeline for when things need to be done. If your shopping needs to be done by a specific date, write that down. If your neighbours have a yearly get together ( within guidelines of course) on a particular date, then write that down too. Your seasonal stress will be down in no time.
Having everything written in one place can help you to see everything at a glance, avoid mix-ups and missing outs.
2. Don't wait until the last minute.
Leaving anything to the last minute is rarely a good idea. Take the time to start early, know what you are looking for and get not only a gift that the receiver will love but you can keep it within budget too.
Early preparation gives you the time to buy thoughtful, local and sustainable gifts that will be truly cherished by the receiver. Taking the time to think through is better for the planet, curbs expensive impulse spending and you’ll get extra brownie points for being so thoughtful.
3. Make a Christmas budget and keep to it.
It is so easy to overspend at Christmas. Whether it is the food budget, gift budget, entertainment budget, it doesn't matter. Figure them all out and stick them.
Budgets are like magic to keep a clear head and reduce seasonal stress.
4. Christmas Food Budget
I thought that I would separate out the food budget as it is such a significant stressor both financially and physically at this time of year. Food waste is exceptionally high at Christmas time, we tend to stock up, 'just in case’. According to an iReach survey:
Irish shoppers waste 50% more food during Christmas week than during the entire rest of the year, a shocking new survey has revealed.
And households throw out €1.5 billion worth of grub annually - peaking during the festive season when thousands of Christmas dinners are dumped to the value of around €42 million.
That is a massive amount of food and resources going to waste. It is not only the resources and energy, hours of labour, and time put into getting it to your home, only to be dumped. It is also the financial implication of this wasted food.
So save yourself all that extra time and money and stick to the shopping list and don't get distracted by all the special offers and great prices on things that you wouldn't usually buy or use regularly.
5. Minimalist minded decoration
Christmas decorations are the best and bring a smile to everyone's face. The shiny baubles and twinkling lights are an integral part of what makes the season feel so special. In saying that, you don't have to decorate every inch of your home.
Focus instead on the main areas, like the kitchen, living room and mantelpiece. These are the areas where people gather the most. Get the most out of your efforts by focusing on getting the best out of these, and it will take the pressure off having to decorate huge areas that no one can or appreciate.
You will get the same effect and appreciative comments this way while also saving you time and money. There is nothing like a win-win scenario.
6. Get rid of clutter before Christmas.
Unwanted clutter is like the Grinch of Christmas. No amount of decorating or fancy fairy lights can cover up that two-year-old stack of magazines that everyone keeps falling over.
Take a No Spend Day, or two, to sort out unwanted items donating or selling where possible. Get the kids involved by enlisting them to gather up their old toys and donating them. Try to make a game of it, suggest that they donate 2 of their preloved toys for everyone expected Christmas toy.
You can also use the time to clear out your wardrobe, garage or that cupboard under the stairs. Get a head start on the new year by embracing your inner minimalist now.
7. Downtime is a must
This is key to reduce seasonal stress. As much as we all love the bustle of Christmas, downtime is essential too to recharge the batteries.
It does not matter which part of the day or week you take to yourself as long as you carve out that time and use it solely for you. Read a book, drink a leisurely tea before the kids wake up, put on some relaxing tunes and let your mind wander in no particular direction.
Remember what the Christmas season is about.
Christmas is a time of reconnecting, merriness and being grateful for love and life in our world. You want to look back on the season with fond memories and good times. Don't let the month go by in a blur. Be kind to yourself and reduce seasonal stress.
Slow down and think about what you really want to do this season. Don't get so caught up in the bustle, that you forget to enjoy the people you're doing this for. By starting early, you'll be able to have a merry—and much less stressful—Christmas.
By doing this, you give yourself a fighting chance of arriving into the new year, stress-free, debt-free and ready to take on whatever fun challenge you choose to.

- High quality: You can get a more reliable standard of high-quality work from a local plumber than from a national brand. Local plumbers understand what they’re up against in terms of name recognition, and thus they must be at the top of their game to be able to compete. They get by primarily on word of mouth, as opposed to the massive brand recognition those larger companies have. This means if you have a local plumber who’s been working for years in the area, they can likely be trusted to do an outstanding job.
- Faster response: A plumber who lives and works in your local area will be able to be on hand faster when you’re in need of someone in an emergency scenario, such as a burst pipe or a water heater leak. They won’t have to go very far to get to your home. In addition, many local plumbing companies in Altoona, PA offer 24/7 services, which are highly beneficial in these circumstances.
- Community support: There’s something to be said for putting your money right back into the local economy rather than into a large, faceless national brand that probably doesn’t need your business. In addition, you can form a greater connection with the plumber you work with based on your mutual community ties, and may be able to strike up an ongoing business relationship with them. If you go with a larger company, you’ll probably work with a different plumber every time.
- Local knowledge: Plumbers based in your area will have a greater understanding of housing and plumbing issues and conditions in your local area. Communities built at the same time often have particular quirks in their construction and plumbing, which plumbers will be aware of. They’ll also be familiar with any issues associated with your local municipal water supply, such as its acidity or hardness.
- Customer service: Local plumbers will be able to provide you with a greater level of customer service, helping you pick the best-quality parts for your job and making sure all of your needs are completely fulfilled. Their business depends on strong recommendations and word-of-mouth advertising, which means they need to go above and beyond in their work to stay viable.
For more information about the benefits of working with local plumbing companies in Altoona, PA rather than national brands, we encourage you to contact the team at Caporuscio Plumbing & Heating Inc. today.

Alexander died in custody
Four police officers in Kenya have been found guilty of manslaughter over the death of British aristocrat Alexander Monson, almost a decade after his death in police custody in 2012.
Alexander Monson was the first son of Lord Nicholas Monson of Burton, near Lincoln, and heir to the family estate.
He moved to Kenya in 2008 to live with his mother. He was living in Kenya with his mother in 2012 when he was arrested for allegedly taking bhang, a form of cannabis. While in police custody he allegedly died of drug overdose, but the family have always maintained that he was killed by police.
Naftali Chege, Charles Wangombe Munyiri, Baraka Bulima and John Pamba were convicted on Monday, November 15 of killing Monson, who died at a police station in Mombasa almost a decade ago.
This comes after three of the officers reportedly denied the charge at the High Court in Mombasa in 2018, while a warrant had been issued for Pamba who had failed to appear at that hearing. In January 2019 the officers were put on trial for murder, but the trail was adjourned in March last year at the end of the prosecution case.
At this week’s hearing Judge Erick Ogola ruled that Monson was brutally tortured by unknown people, and said the officers had covered up what happened to the 28-year-old, according to BBC.
This comes after Monson’s mother told the court in 2019 that her son was not a drug addict. A pathologist hired by the family found that he was killed by a blow to the back of his head. Toxicology reports showed he had no drugs in his system at the time.
Alexander, born to Baron Monson while he worked as a journalist for The Times in 1987, attended school at Marlborough College. He later won a scholarship to study at Chelsea Art College and, after graduation, he moved onto Kenya.
His mother had given him some land where he planned to cultivate a commercial bamboo, and he quickly made a group of local who he was socialising with on the morning of his arrest, according to the Daily Mail. 59 testimonials and 95% of readers who voted found it helpful, earning it our reader-approved status.

Steps
Method 1
Method 1 of 2:Identifying Male Cannabis Plants
- 1Look for thicker, sturdier stalks with fewer leaves on male plants. A male weed plant, compared to a female plant of the same strain, generally has a thicker stalk. That’s because it gets taller than female plants and needs to be able to support the weight. They also have fewer leaves than female plants.[1] X Research source
- 2Check the joints on the stalk for male flowers. The little balls that grow on the joints of the stalk (where the other branches meet the main stalk) are the main indicators of male plants. These flowers release pollen and need to be removed for a better crop.[2] X Research source
Advertisement
- If you're trying to create new plants or reproduce, you need to leave these balls undisturbed.
- Female plants will have these bulbs too, but will also have long, translucent hairs on them. If you only see 1-2 bulbs on a plant, wait. If more develop with long hairs, don’t cut them because that means the plant is female.
- 3Check your plants regularly from July to September to sex them. If male plants are allowed to pollinate, they will severely lower the potential crop of your female plants.[3] X Research source That's because, once fertilized, female plants spend energy producing seeds instead of THC, leading to a smaller harvest. If you are growing indoors you will likely be visiting your plants regularly, so the following checks should be easy to do.
- 4Treat hermaphroditic (both sexes) plants as males. Marijuana plants can grow both sex organs.[5] X Research source If you see any of the telltale male pollen sacs on the joints of the stalk, you should trim them like you would a normal male plant. They will still release pollen that can ruin your crop.[6] X Research source
- "Hermies" are generally undesirable plants, and they can ruin a small crop with their pollen if you're not careful.
- A plant that has both pollen sacs (small buds on the joints of the stalks) and pistils (small translucent hairs) is hermaphroditic.
- 5Throw out or remove male pot plants unless you specifically want seeds. Once you've determined a plant.[7] X Research source
Method 2
Method 2 of 2:Identifying Female Cannabis Plants
- 1Let the plants grow for roughly six weeks before sexing them. Marijuana plants, male and female, will be identical in the first 6 weeks of life. It is only after they've begun developing their sex organs later on that you'll be able to differentiate them.[8] X Research source
- You can purchase "feminized" seeds as well, which usually create close to 100% female plants. However, there are occasional errors, and you should still keep a close eye on your plants to make sure there are no rogue males.[9] X Research source
- 2Check the joints of the stalk for small, translucent hairs. Once the plant has matured enough, a female weed plant will begin flowering. At the joints where the branches meet the main stalk, you'll see small, translucent hairs, known as pistils, coming out of a small, tear-shaped bud tucked in the joint. Frequently, there will also be "growth tips," which are new branches and groups of leaves, growing as well.[10] X Research source
- Male plants will have the small buds (pollen sacs) but will not have the associated hair growing out of them.
- 3Look for fuller bodies of leaves when compared to males. If you're trying to sex mature plants, one of the easiest and earliest signs of a female cannabis plant is how bushy they get. Male plants have thicker, sturdier stalks and very few leaves. A female of the same strain will be shorter and bushier, with more leaves, especially near the top.[11] X Research source
- 4Separate your females from any males, as only females create buds. Only female pot plants will produce enough THC for recreational or medical use, but they won't be as potent if they become fertilized. If the pistil gets pollen, it will create a seed, and all the plants’ energy and nutrients will be spent making seeds instead of big, THC-full buds.[12] X Research source

- If your pistils are an orange-brown color, that means they’ve been pollinated and won’t produce as high-quality of buds.
Community Q&A
- QuestionCan I bring an outdoor plant indoors?Grow ExperimentsCommunity Answer!
- QuestionCan I ground up male plants to use as a CBD mixture?Community AnswerYes, the largest amount of CBD in a plant is in the stalk of a male plant.
- QuestionWhy would my female plant not bud?Community AnswerIt needs a light cycle with a minimum of 12 hours of uninterrupted, complete darkness every day to trigger and maintain flowering.
- QuestionWhat do I do if my marijuana plants are not producing pollen sacks?Community AnswerBe grateful, because you probably have female plants. Female plants are the only plants that produce buds.
- QuestionI have a 6 month old indoor plant but it is not budding or showing any male gender. The plant stands about 51 inches tall; it appears to be healthy, very green, most of the nodes are standing up instead of sagging. What could be the problem?Community AnswerPlants usually need around 12 hours of darkness to bud. That is why they bud at the end of the summer. If you have these indoors where they get light for more than 12 hours, that is your problem.
- QuestionHow do I trim the female plant to grow another plant?Community AnswerCut the smallest branch and make sure it's one of the young ones that will be flowering. This is called cloning.
- QuestionWhy do my plants only have 3 leaves?Community AnswerA plant with 3 leaves is ruderalis, a wild outdoor variety. There are 5 types: indica, sativa, ruderalis, Australian bastard weed, and duck's foot.
- QuestionDo male plants all have balls on their joints?Community AnswerAll males have pollen sacks at all leaf branchings.
- QuestionWhat is the best type of light to use?Community AnswerMany.
- QuestionWhat do I do if I over-water my plant?Community AnswerLet the soil dry out before watering again. Cannabis plants are resilient and will usually recuperate from over-watering.
Tips
- Check frequently once your plants have hit the 6-week mark – you want to know your plant's sex as soon as you can to avoid accidental pollination.Thanks!

Sunday April 16, 2017.

Resignation that we are stuck in a quickening race to the bottom by working harder every day for less pay and fewer benefits, with little job security, all aimed at being “competitive”. Resignation that we get to buy cheap stuff, because that’s all we can afford, by allowing companies to exploit workers and pollute the environment elsewhere in the world. Resignation that billions of us live in poverty. Resignation that the wealthiest 85 people in the world have as much wealth as the poorest 3.5 BILLION people. Resignation that our most of kids will have to take on decades of debt to pay for four years of college, while half of them will end up unemployed or underemployed when they graduate. Resignation that maybe the American Dream is dead.
Perhaps poisoned with cynicism and resignation, there is still hope. Take a minute and imagine. Imagine the world you want to live in, the world you hope for. Did you hope that you can provide your kids with a better life? Hope for “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness”? Hope that you will have a job that not only provides a good wage and good benefits, but also is enjoyable and fulfilling? Hope that someday you will be able to retire with dignity and good health? Hope that you will be able buy a nice home in a good neighborhood? Hope that you can send your kids to college? Hope that your kids will have the opportunity and freedom to be who they want to be and to do what they want to do?
Hope is the foundation of the American Dream. A world full of inequity, poverty, disease, prejudice and pollution is not what any of us hope for, it is the world we have resigned ourselves to.
We can own a better future.
How? By not only having the hope that things can be changed for the better, but also the courage to make change happen. There is no silver bullet, no road map, and no guarantees, but certainly we can keep working to make inroads and together begin to shift the momentum towards a better world. One such inroad might be to start reclaiming ownership of some of things that now see beyond our control. A community standing up to a polluter to reclaim ownership of their environment. A neighborhood that others have resigned to be a ghetto, coming together to reclaim ownership of vacant lots in order to plant community gardens. A laid-off worker reclaiming ownership of their livelihood by starting their own business.
Why ownership? Because if it’s your land, you’re not going to pollute it. If it’s your job, you’re not going to give it to the lowest bidder.
Worker owned businesses, including worker owned cooperatives, root jobs and money in their communities. The community, in turn, supports the worker owned businesses. Two important examples of this ecosystem are the Mondragon cooperatives, located in the Basque region of Spain, and the thousands of worker owned cooperatives in the Emilia Romanga region of Italy.
Although unemployment in Spain is currently 26%, the unemployment rate in the Basque region is half of that. Why? Because the worker-owners in the Mondragon cooperatives prioritize their own employment over the maximization of their profits, layoffs and closures are the absolute last resort rather than the first option. Rather than syphon off profits to anonymous global shareholders, worker-owners in the Mondragon cooperatives keep their profits and give 10% to their communities. Because money stays in the community, it supports other jobs in the community as it recirculates from one community-based business to another.
Owning our own jobs, our own livelihoods, gives us the power and ability to work for the kind of world we hope for. As worker-owned cooperatives, we can share the risk of ownership in order to minimize it, without giving up the power of ownership. The power of ownership, the control of our own lives, becomes a power antidote to the poison of resignation and desperation.

We don't have a dark room, so we'll be using digital cameras and our cell phone cameras and there is still SO MUCH to learn just focusing on that!
Usually I start my art classes with a nametag project. It's a great way for me to get to know the kids and their names and chitchat with them.
It didn't seem appropriate to have the students in Photo draw their names and tell me about themselves in a traditional way, so I decided to have them create a photo collage using Google Slides and the fair use photos Google's search feature in Slides uses.
Our school uses the Google Suite and has for 18 months or so, so the students are somewhat familiar with it. This would be a good opportunity for them to brush up on their skills.
PART 1: See what Google Slides Can Do With Photos
Students were asked to create a Google Slide and use the Insert/Image/From the Web search feature to import an image of their choice. They then had to duplicate the image so that there were 9 total on the slide.
Then they need to learn about the adjustments you can make within Google slides. They needed to do the following:
- Enlarge a photo
- Shrink a photo
- Crop a photo
- Invert or flip a photo
- Change the transparency
- Adjust the brightness
- Adjust the contrast
- Recolor the imageIf the cheeseburger is the American restaurant’s benchmarking equivalent of a bolognese, then the fish burger is the American diner’s risotto. Thankfully for us, the Stuffed Beaver do a very fine job of both.
Where certain Bondi Beach burger establishments represent the equivalent of an eastern suburbs instagram model’s freakish proportions, I’m pleased to report that the Stuffed Beaver attracts with its approachable and natural beauty. Their new Crows Nest lodging is equally as inviting, though a lot bigger than their original Bondi venue, with 140 seats across a multi tiered den featuring a 1980s Mongoose BMX, 80’s & 90s’s arcade games and some incredible retro wall art and bric a brac.
The burger listing has been distilled down to the favourite burgers from Bondi. Our pick is the Make ‘Americana’ Great Again, which apparently outsells the others by about 40 glorious meaty morsels per night. There’s also an amazing selection of Hot Dogs, Poutine Fries (a must!), Spicy Tacos and Nachos to be paired with a range of Aussie craft beers and rocking cocktails. Our fave being the Stuffed Beaver Bloody Caesar (the Canadian version of a Bloody Mary). Is it after midday yet?

You can totally skip this entry if you’re only interested in networks. It’s just that i’ve met a few new colleages recently who had the impression that I spent my whole life in the cisco world (and this is so not true! i spend the other half in junos 😀 ) so I’ve decided to show that there’s more to me than just the network guy.
So the other part of what I do is that I learn languages and read books in those languages. I’ve developed this system recently where I try to read 4 books in french, 1 in spanish and 1 in german to stop from getting all rusty. (I think i’d like to learn Arabic as well but it’s definitely not a goal for this decade. Maybe 2030-2040).
I don’t use my languages at work every day but I have been able to use my spanish to talk to clients from south america on a number of occasions and it really boosted my relationship with those clients. I use german occasionally and it’s been a massive help in my career because (unsurprisingly) few network people can speak german on a professional level. But overall I learn languages just to be able to read literature. I read really diverse stuff. Books by Graham Greene, Juli Zeh, Sapkowski, Stephen King, hell, i’ve even read 12 rules for life by Jordan Peterson lately. Although I don’t have the same drive to read for pleasure as in the past (which may be due to the fact that i read too much for work purposes and my brain is in overload most of the time), i can still manage one book a month. In the past i would have been mortified at sharing this poor(ish) result but times have changed and I’m as close to being proud of that as I can be. I have a full time job, i’m a dad and I still read one book a month.

Brown Bats 101
You can"t look at Halloween decorations without seeing bats hanging almost everywhere. They are often lumped through spiders and black cats and also relegated to the "scary things" category. Like many "scary" points, bats really aren"t that bad if you understand also a tiny little bit about them. This is why I desire to present you to brvery own bats, a great area to start on your method to appreciating our bat next-door neighbors. After all, Bat Week is October 25th-October 31st (Have you planned your party yet??)!
BATS AREN"T RODENTS
First, let"s obtain this directly, bats are not rodents. If you question this sindicate throw a computer mouse in the air and also see if it flies. Bats are the only flying mammals. The creature that comes closest are flying squirrels and also they ssuggest leap choose demented nocturnal paragliders and then float around using the flaps of skin between their arms and legs as they go from tree to tree.
The two of the most prevalent bats in The United States and Canada are the little brvery own bat (Myotis lucifugus) and also the huge brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus). The bit brvery own bat belongs to the genus Myotis, meaning "mouse-eared bat," which might be why tbelow is some confusion about bats being rodents. Little brown bats perform have actually cute little bit computer mouse ears, yet they are NOT mice. Another reason for confusion is the German word for bat, "fledermaus" (pronounced fley-der-mous) which translates into "flutter-mouse."
Big brvery own bats are in a different genus from the little bit brown bats, referred to as Eptesicus, which is thought about the "house-bat" family members. These are frequently discovered in attics and old barns.
All bats are in the order Chiroptera, which implies hand-wing. Imagine bending your wrist, and elongating your fingers to a small over the size of your body and stretching soft pliable skin in between the fingers, this is around what bats need to assist them fly.
AREN"T ALL BROWN BATS "LITTLE" AND "BIG" BROWN BATS?
Nope, not all bats are brvery own bats. There are many, many, many kind of various types of bats, and some happen to be brown, but they are not all "big" and also "little" brvery own bats. Scientists simply got kind of lazy and called these 2 common species little and also significant brvery own bats, despite the reality that they are not also in the very same genus. That being sassist, it"s periodically fairly tough to tell them apart. Researchers even go so much as to compare the size of hairs on their toes!!! Yes, I have done this, and no it"s not simple (putting it on a resume is kind of awesome though). So, considering that they"re tough to tell acomponent, here"s a quick chart to help you learn the difference:
COMPARE "LITTLE" (8-11" WING SPAN) TO "BIG" (11-13" WING SPAN)
Size, hair shade, and poop are all great means to tell the 2 bats acomponent. Here are some images for comparichild. Below are 2 imperiods of a little brown bat. Notice the buffy underside of the little bit brvery own bat. It has light brvery own fur on top, which is short and stands up. It likewise has actually a brief stubby nose in addition to mouse-like ears.
Next off are imperiods of a huge brvery own bat. Notice the larger size, much longer hair that looks nearly favor cacao (mmm...bat fur), and also the much longer snout. Not all significant browns have deep cacao fur, sometimes they deserve to run to a buffy brvery own, yet the fur is constantly much longer than the little bit brown, and also deserve to look somewhat wavy (watch bottom picture).
Below is a challenge shot of each form of brown bat. Notice the even more seal-suggest challenge of the substantial brvery own bat, along with longer fur and also more continual cacao coloring. On the little brvery own the confront is less dark and the back hair is even more buff colored.
And that brings me to poop. What would certainly one of my blog posts be without poop? Poop is also a good means to tell the two apart, particularly if all you deserve to check out are their tiny bodies wedged way high in an attic ceiling. This graphic from the Vermont Department of Fish and also Wildlife is extremely beneficial.
You have the right to watch from the photos that that the significant brown bat guano is slightly larger than a grain of white rice, while bit brown bat guano is around the exact same dimension if not slightly smaller, must you care to obtain close sufficient to measure!
Anvarious other clue around which bat you have actually is location. Big brvery own bats are found throughout the entire Eastern US, yet not in the West. Little brvery own bats are found throughout every one of North America and lower Canada. This is bereason they are much better at handling extreme temperature variations.
BROWN BAT CALLS
I"m not going to go into detail around bat calls, yet you more than likely recognize that all bats usage echoplace to navigate, which is just sound bouncing roughly and also coming back to them (just prefer dolphins). Big brown bats have sonic calls that are in a reduced frequency variety than bit brown bats. This is one way that researcs can tell the the distinction between the 2 without catching them. Check out the great sonogram images from the "Bats About Our Town" webwebsite.
I supplied to carry out research study on bat echoarea, and also it"s a fascinating field. Tright here are even bat dialects between north and also southerly brvery own bats (I child you not), prefer "chirp..chirp..chirp eh?" versus ""chirp...chirp..chir...yall." Tright here is also differentiation within similar species relying on wbelow they are collecting food (here"s the research). Check out my previous post to learn even more around identifying bats with echolocation fads.
TOE HAIRS
Here"s the component wright here bat researchers seem to cross over right into the (very) starray....looking at bat toe hairs. Sometimes it have the right to be just down-appropriate difficult to identify a "big" little bit brown bat from a "little" massive brvery own bat (say that ten times fast) in the dark. This is why they frequently look at toe hairs. You will probably never have reason to usage this useless trithrough, however it"s interesting, and also could be a good of a conversation starter. Little brown bats have incredibly long and dense toe hairs that extend from the tip of their cute little ankles to the ends of their toes. Big brown bats have sporadic toe hairs that extend previous their toes. They additionally have actually a keeled calautomobile. A calcar is kind of choose significant toe. Big brvery own bats have actually a bump coming off theirs and also little bit brown bats don"t (check out photo below).
BROWN BATS (AND ALL BATS) ARE OUR BUDDIES
Regardless of whether or not you prefer bats, they are crucial to the survival of rain woodlands and also deserts, because they disperse seeds and pollinate cactus flowers. Without them we wouldn"t have actually tequila (they pollinate aoffered plants), and we would certainly be overwhelmed by insects. Brown bats, like the little bit brvery own and also massive brown bats are excellent insect eaters and also they aid farmers and also residence owners via beetles, flies, mosquitoes, and also other pests. It"s estimated that bats eat loads of insects eexceptionally summer night. One of their favorite foods items of insectivorous bats is corn earworm moths (they assault corn, artichokes, and watermelons as well as tomatoes). It is approximated that these pests expense farmers over one billion dollars annually, yet bats aid alleviate this expense by eating the adult moths. Scientists estimate that, "They are worth more than $3.7 billion a year in decreased chop damages and pesticide use" (Bat Conservation International).
Right now many species of bats in The United States and Canada are enduring from white nose syndrome (WNS), which is a very deadly disease that kills entire nests of bats. Little brvery own bats are specifically at threat and are disappearing in huge numbers. " Scientists estimated that between 2016 and 2018 bit brown bat populations that when consisted of countless bats might decrease to reduced than 100,000 animals. Also, some populaces might not start to increase again till about 2023" (Whitenosesyndrome.org). To learn more you have the right to read the update from the USGS Newsroom.

This image lends itself well to the panorama format. The portion of river bank in the lower left corner makes the opposite bank seem closer, more accessible. If you crop out the bit of river bank the perspective changes.   Posted: 11/11/2021 10:00:02
I like the image a lot for perspective, relationship to where you stood and composition as well as the story of winter. The tone gives us such feeling of place, cold, fog and drizzle. Well done.   Posted: 11/17/2021 10:25:35
I'd agree with Jerry. My first reaction was to suggest losing that lower left detail, but I see his point, it adds to the photo. It also prevents the river bank from dividing the picture into two. I might even suggest that a bit more there would be even better.

Our Story
In the summer of 1991, Morey Amsterdam, Jan Murray, Sid Caesar, Milton Berle and Tony Belmont got together at the L.A. Friar’s Club to discuss the idea of establishing The National Comedy Hall of Fame. At the time, there was no organization that honored the work of comedians or the long-running history of comedy.
The group initiated the project and Tony, as the point man, never looked back. With an illustrious career in entertainment and music, which included interviewing hundreds of comedians and managing performers like Senor Wences and Morey Amsterdam, Tony was well-equipped to open the official museum of comedy history. He conducted research and executed a myriad of steps to make the dream a reality. Tony even instructed the team at The Lucille Ball Desi Arnaz Museum to renovate and expand to become The National Comedy Center in Jamestown, New York.
Due to his hard work, The Library of Congress authorized The National Comedy Hall of Fame as the official museum of comedy history for the United States. The organization first operated as a travelling museum, visiting various cities all across the country and later found a home at John’s Pass Village and Boardwalk in Madeira Beach, Florida. The current museum is located at 2435 US-19 Holiday, Florida.
Tony connected with hundreds of comedians and various luminaries in entertainment to form the National Comedy Hall of Fame voting board. Nominations of potential inductees were presented and processed through a series of voting protocols with the help of The New York Friars Club, and as a result, The National Comedy Hall of Fame was ready for induction ceremonies.

Drawing from his experience as a music promoter and producer of award shows, Tony kicked-off the National Comedy Hall of Fame® with a 90-minute television special to honor Minnie Pearl, a country comedian icon, live from the Grand Ole Opry. That night, emcee Ralph Emory ended the show by honoring Minnie Pearl with her induction into the National Comedy Hall of Fame®. The show was a hit with an audience of over 13 million, at that time the highest rating ever for the Grand Ole Opry.
Since it’s inception in 1991, the National Comedy Hall of Fame® has inducted 23 comedians into the NCHOF in front of national audiences over the past 25 years. Among them are Abbott & Costello, Laurel & Hardy, Milton Berle, Charlie Chaplin, George Kirby and Jimmy Durante. Not only were celebrities present during induction ceremonies, but also some of the most powerful politicians in the world, such as Nelson Mandela, George Bush Sr., Bill Clinton, NY Mayor Giuliani, and more.

Many people have lost the meaning and significance of being human, and the word society means only isolated individuals subsumed under a state that manages their interpersonal relationships. Given these developments, environmental issues seem to be secondary – incidental to many, something for environmentalists to worry about.
But the ecological crisis has become the most urgent challenge of our time, because it touches and impacts all areas of society. The ecosystem has been wrecked to such an extent that much of the damage has become irreversible. A large part of life, both human and natural, has entered a stage of crisis. On this note, Abdullah Öcalan writes: "A policy that promises salvation from the present crisis can only lead to a proper social system if it is ecological.”
It is necessary to outline such an ecological social system and to develop a policy that can overcome the ecological and social crisis as a whole: a policy that not only fights the symptoms, but that recognises that the ecological crisis and the societal crisis are intimately linked. In order to solve the ecological crisis, we must change the social relations of power and domination fundamentally.
If we take this as our starting point in the search for new ways to live, we must also be able to answer the question of how and why societies have ended up in opposition to nature. From a historical perspective, we must be able to identify the decisive moments of social change that led to the break between nature and society that we see today in capitalist society. To speak simply of humanity and not of concrete mentalities, systems, and rulers, only hides the causes and leads us to false premises. It conceals the contradictions that lie behind the categories of humanity: the antagonisms between oppressed and oppressors; men and women; old and young; light and dark; and the rich and the poor.
To be successful in building a new social-ecological society we have to conceive of the human being as a life form that, with its creativity and creative power, can make a great contribution to the improvement of the entire natural world. Even more than that, it is our obligation to accept this potential in ourselves, and to believe in it. It's clear that solving the ecological crisis, and moving towards a social ecological society, cannot be left to science and technology alone; it is also the task of a critical theory that is able to overcome the division between humanity and nature.
Many thinkers - Abdullah Öcalan, Silvia Federici, Friedrich Engels, and Murray Bookchin, in particular – have played an important role in contributing to such a theory, with their analyses of social power relations and historical developments, their understanding of nature and humanity, and their firm belief in the viability of an ecological, free society.
The historical changes in the relationship between society and nature
When we look at the changes in society's relationship to nature, it is vital not to lose sight of the changes in societal power-relations, modes of production, and ideology. There is not a single societal relationship with nature: different modes of production, social classes, cultures and genders develop different relations. Nature includes various aspects, like food and energy, but also an individual's relationship with her or his body. It's about how the external world around the human is seen, understood and felt.
The current relationship with nature, dominated by the state-capitalist structure of society, developed from a long process of changes. To disconnect this relationship from its development gives it the appearance of a system that has always been inevitable. Failure to analyse this history and its development results in an inability to understand the present or construct the future. With this in mind, in the following section we will look at some aspects of the changes in society's relationship with nature.
The human: nature become self-aware.
— Johann Gottlieb Fichte
Natural society can be understood as the first social form. In small communities of clans, human beings began the process of becoming socialised.
In early societies people's understanding of nature was characterised by a close connection with it; nature was regarded as something living, embracing the idea that every natural entity had a soul. The experience of nature found its expression in the idea of spirits, with which humanity sought an understanding. Humans had to live in harmony with these forces, because they determined life and its rhythms. People didn't try to conquer nature, but to influence it through magical rituals, to appeal to the spirits of nature. This magic was based on the observations of the processes of life and death in nature and human beings themselves. The life of humans, in small clan communities and with an idea of living nature, ran according to the basic principles of ecology – that is, in harmony with nature and each other.
So we can define the natural society as "a spontaneous form of an ecological society” (Öcalan). In the collective memory of humanity, nature is like a mother, giving people life and it's necessities. The term “mother nature can be traced back to this collective experience.
The rule of man over humanity and nature
The life of the first communities was based on what people could gather from nature, but hunting came to augment the collecting of plants and fruits. The systematic and deliberate killing of animals evolved into a hunting culture. Out of this, and the emerging conflicts between clan communities, a culture of war developed that went beyond self-defence. The foundation was laid for the further development of a war mentality and its associated institutions and hierarchies, and this had serious consequences for the development of society. In parallel with the arrival of the first hierarchies and the division of people into categories and classes (such as race and gender), the relationship with nature also changed.
By observing the natural processes of birth, growth and death, we developed the first understanding of biology that led to the deliberate use of plants and livestock in agriculture. Humans began to shape the environment according to their needs, and to influence the biological development of animals and plants. Increasing yields from agriculture which went beyond the level of immediate needs now had to be managed.
This administration of social wealth was closely connected with the emergence of social hierarchy (which had already found its expression in the dominion of the old over young, men over women, and leaders over the led). In the course of this process, these hierarchies were increasingly transformed into a more complex social system – as we see in the development of Sumerian and Egyptian priests. These first state structures were legitimised by a mythological system that eliminated the spirits of nature and placed gods - and their human interpreters - above them. And just as the new gods were enthroned above nature, their new priests ruled over society like gods.
From the perspective of the new mythology [...] nature and the universe are full of ruling, punishing gods. These gods actually oppressive and exploiting despots are located outside of nature [...]. Its like they dried out nature. It develops a view of an inanimate nature and matter. All living beings are humiliated, and servants created from the excrement of the gods.
— Abdullah Öcalan
In this process, we find the interweaving of man's dominion over man with man's dominion over nature. Moving from a free and ecological co-existence in natural society, with mutual respect, solidarity and care, towards a society based on hierarchies, classes and domination, people alienated themselves not only from each other, but also from nature. This was the beginning of our downfall, because the evolving class society developed in clear contradiction to nature. The idea of a living, animated, colourful and productive nature gave way to one of a vindictive and mean-spirited nature – something to compete with. Beginning with Sumerian society, this counter-revolution against the natural society, accompanied by a radical change in the mentality of the people, gradually spread throughout the Middle East until it fundamentally changed large parts of the world.
The idea of nature as merciless, oppressive and dominating, which still persists today, goes back to this break in the social relationship. Humanity, confronted with this oppressive force as a small, naked and fragile creature, must protect itself and develop its own powers in order to conquer nature, to become its ruler. This understanding then served to justify the increasingly oppressive relations of people among themselves. According to this doctrine, humanity can escape the power of nature through the productivity of enslavement. Our collective survival depends on with the power of human labor. At the same time, the suffering of the enslaved seems a small thing when compared with the acquired power of man over nature; the enslaved are the collateral damage of the liberation of mankind.
The return to nature and the lived world, which had always been demonised.
— Abdullah Öcalan
Society's relationship with nature was not fundamentally changed in Europe until the Reformation. The determination of people to break away from the Church's dogmas led to a return to rationality and the everyday, which had been demonised by Christianity. The idea of an animated, living nature, in which God Himself lived, found its place again in the imagination of the people. In art, this was expressed in the depiction of nature and people in realistic forms, showing their beauty. This ended the mentality that treated nature and the environment as something inert.
At the same time, the state tried further to dissolve the social knowledge system of natural healing - of birth, life and the human body. This knowledge came from millennia of women's experiences, who developed it and passed it on. Women who believed in the power of natural ways and had a deep relationship with nature were executed during the Inquisition. Possessing this knowledge was seen as the work of the devil and the women were called witches. They were considered remnants of the times in which myths, goddess cults and belief in nature existed along with the worship of natural places. The attack on women and the femicide committed against them also represented an attack on the social bond with nature and knowledge of it.
This attack wasn't limited to the societies in the global North: with colonialism, social relations of nature in the global South have increasingly been subjected to the paradigms of exploitation, destruction and centralisation of social knowledge. At the same time, the ideas of the indigenous populations of the colonies exerted a great fascination. Their attachment to nature and freedom, lack of institutionalised conditions of exploitation, and their participation in a collective community that left little room for individual greed, reminded people from war-torn Europe of the natural society.
The centralisation of agriculture, the expropriation of peasant land, and migration to cities further destroyed society's knowledge of ecological processes and its links to nature. The seizure of land by feudal lords converted large parts of previously collective land into the private possessions of individuals.
In modern times humans have become a wolf not only to humans, but to all nature.
— Abdullah Öcalan
With the development of science as a method for explaining the world, the understanding of natural biological processes also deepened and spread. This was defined more and more in a scientific way and described in rational rather than religious terms. Humanity detached itself from nature; it again put itself at the centre of things, and now considered nature and even the human body as inert and static objects for research. The transition from a holistic world view, which regarded nature as animated, to a mechanistic worldview of positivist ideology, was a decisive step in the change in the social relationship with nature. Nature became inanimate matter that could be worked, divided, measured, examined and controlled - a resource that might have a price, but no value as mere life.
Often, nature is understood as all-determining. The individual human being and society itself are reduced to zoological entities that follow the law of nature – the survival of the fittest. Competition and enmity projected onto nature are reflected in people and social affairs. War, violence, domination, and oppression are viewed as natural things from which there is no escape. This can only be controlled, if at all, by a supernatural and superhuman entity, the authoritarian state, as proposed by Hobbes. The difference between humanity and nature dissolves almost completely; it is only the ability to think that differentiates humans from animals. Here lies the possibility of individual reason and will and, with this, the instinctiveness of body and nature can be disciplined.
The bourgeois Enlightenment wanted to take away humanity's fear of nature, so that nature could be completely subjected to its own ends. The prerequisite for this was knowledge of physical laws and technical tools. Nature and society face each other in a dualistic, hostile relationship; it isn't surprising that such a relationship with nature elicited other reactions. An attitude developed that did not regard nature as the enemy of society, but society as the enemy of nature. In the face of increasingly frightening environmental catastrophes, for which humanity is responsible, there is resignation and pessimism regarding civilisation, society, and even humanity itself. Technology is shown in contrast to innocent, organic nature; science opposed to reverence for life; reason against innocent intuition; more or less, humanity against all of life. It's argued that humanity should, therefore, subordinate itself to nature and subject itself to nature's rules. But even in this primitivist understanding of nature and humanity, their inner opposition - their duality - persists.
The deep alienation between humanity and nature and between people and their bodies is the legacy of positivist science. It is the absolute object-subject relationship that has entered human thinking via positivism and determines the basis of the social relationship of nature in capitalist modernity. The development of this mentality, this conception of nature, became part of the process of increasingly centralised social systems, including the modern nation-state. This mentality is interwoven with industrialisation, the development of machinery and engines. The impact of this hierarchical, industrial economy on soil, air, water, and people has expanded to such an extent that the ecological system is now irreversibly damaged.
The Capitalist Modernity: Profit and enrichment as the meaning of the existence of all life
A person alienated from nature is alienated from and destroying his- or herself. No system has shown this connection more clearly than capitalist modernity; environmental destruction and ecological crises go hand in hand with the oppression and exploitation of people. Capitalist modernity, which makes a commodity of everything, has not even stopped at the limits of life itself: through new technologies (such as genetic engineering) life itself is commodified. In capitalist modernity, the system commands the entire planet, as it commands life itself.
Capitalism's spread to all areas of life seems to have no end in sight. The capitalist mode of production is characterised by the necessity of constant expansion:
Capitalism can no more be persuaded to limit growth than a human being can be persuaded to stop breathing
— Murray Bookchin
Growth in this sense does not mean more time, health, happiness or contentment, but only the ever-expanding increase in profits. The idea of a fulfilled life is to savour as much as possible of what capitalist modernity has to offer, creating a purely consumer society; this is the basic paradigm of capitalist modernity: an imperialist, all-consuming, nature-destroying lifestyle.
The exploitation of nature and humanity to maximise the profits of a few has no moral limits. Social status is defined by power and wealth. Individualism and greed have become virtues. Disregard for everyone and everything is reflected in society's mentality and culture. Its accepted that development, be it human or natural, requires rivalry and competition. Profit and enrichment become the meaning of existence.
The current ecological crisis has shaken up the modern social-natural relationship, because the effects of trying to control and commodify nature have become obvious. But the strategy of capitalist modernity is now to make the ecological crisis itself the starting point of a renewed deepening of the exploitation and commodification of nature. Because, according to the experts and economists, whatever in nature doesn't have a price, can't be appreciated, and there will be no economic incentives to spare it.
This shows once again that a solution to the ecological crisis will only be possible with a fundamental change in mentality and the methods of production, and the overcoming of capitalist modernity itself. The solution lies in restoring a balanced relationship between nature and humanity, at all levels. In this sense, it is about the renewed, conscious development of a democratic-ecological society.
The ecological question is fundamentally solved as the system is repressed and a socialist social system develops. That does not mean you cannot do something for the environment right away. On the contrary, it is necessary to combine the fight for the environment with the struggle for a general social revolution...
— Abdullah Öcalan
Social ecology as a way out of capitalist modernity
Social ecology is the science of people's relationship with their natural and social environments. It examines how these relationships are shaped from different perspectives spanning classical scientific disciplines including anthropology, philosophy, history, archaeology, and social theory. It is not a purely descriptive theory: its crucial project is how the critical human-nature relationship can be reimagined and transformed.
In theorizing a new understanding of the societal relationship to nature, social ecology offers decisive starting points: humanity developed through a natural process of evolution, in which, early on, there was neither opposition, competition nor submission between nature and human. In this process of social development and in the organisational forms that societies have adopted, there is a connection to natural evolution. We can think of pre-human nature - plants and animals – as "first nature” the active, turbulent substance of organic life that is developing toward greater complexity and differentiation arriving, finally at “second nature” – human beings who are self-conscious and aware, able to intervene in the natural world.
The social and the natural permeate each other. As human beings, we will always have basic natural needs, even though these have been institutionalised in society through a variety of social forms. We must also understand the uniqueness of humanity's intellect in the interplay of natural and social evolution. The brain did not come from nowhere, but was the result of a long evolutionary process that slowly developed into a complex nervous system. The intellect is thus deeply rooted in nature. This uniqueness is characterised by the social behaviours of people, their creativity and imagination.
...the human species is a warmhearted, exciting, versatile and especially intelligent way of life in which nature has testified to its highest creative power and is not merely a cold blooded, genetically determined, thoughtless insect.
— Murray Bookchin
In humans, nature has created a form of life that, through awareness and reason, can shape and change its environment. Unimaginable, limitless paths of evolution can open up before us. But, humanity must also accept the responsibility that results from its creative power and this connection with the creative power of nature. This does not happen by denying our own productive and creative powers and placing them in opposition to the power of nature, by making a contrast between nature and society, or between living fertility and dead technology. Rather, we must see ourselves as integrated with nature, viewing nature as a realm of potentiality in which human beings represent the apex of nature's long evolution toward ever greater consciousness, subjectivity, creativity and freedom. "Humanity, in effect, becomes the potential voice of a nature rendered self-conscious and self-formative” (Bookchin). Human beings alone are able to intervene to change the course of the natural world through technology and innovation. The question is whether they will do it rationally, in the service of ever greater freedom, or destructively.
Cornerstone of a democratic ecological social order
If human alienation from its natural environment and ecological destruction cannot be separated from internal social conflicts, then social ecology must propose a new social order. Such an order must be based on radically democratic structures and built up outside of state power, which has always been a centralised structure of control.
Democracy is the antithesis to the state, dissociates itself from it and represents a self-organised regulation of the processes of societal self-coordination. In such a society, production of commodities can only take place in the sense of a cooperative, ecological and decentralised mode of production. Needs are determined based on a democratic process of negotiation and with the awareness of the possibilities of an ecological system in balance between nature and human beings. This means that technologies, modes of production, distribution, and forms of consumption will be decided upon in terms of their impact on the natural environment. At the same time, decisions must be evaluated on a longer-term basis. Often, ecological consequences can only be understood with a long-term perspective. The essential criterion is not only the protection of nature, but the improvement of the ecosystem and its equilibrium.
If the state and capitalist modernity derive their power from the creation of a hegemonic culture and mentality, then an ecological society must be a political and moral society that offers mutual aid, service to society and nature, and an active role in one's own self-determination.
In this society, humanity will regain an understanding of nature that has nearly been lost. And if capitalism alienated humanity from nature and from the land, then an ecological society must insist on love of the land, which houses people and gives them what they need to live. As Öcalan points out, "a life without the awareness of a nature that is alive and well, talking to us, living with us and living through it, [...] is hardly worth living”.
A democratic-ecological society is based on the moment of reconciliation between humanity and nature, which lies only in the overcoming of domination over both. A fundamental prerequisite for this is to subdue capitalist modernity with its requirement of oppression, exploitation and accumulation - and eventually overcome it. The democratic-ecological society will enter into a new relationship with nature, to improve its beauty and diversity for future generations.
Social ecology advances a message that calls not only for a society free of hierarchy and hierarchical sensibilities, but for an ethics that places humanity in the natural world as an agent for rendering evolution social and natural fully self-conscious.

Hosted by the Real Curator of Scotland Yard?
Vivia
The first ever show is very interesting and I catch no audio problems at all on my tablet. Almost didn't listen due to complaining reviews but glad I discounted the whining! Good to remember. Is this from the BBC? How could it be the real curator of the black museum ? I could look it up but sometimes it's more authentic-feeling to not look it up: you don't want to break the spell. But come to think of it, I'm typing--no, it's called 'swyping'--°using my finger like finger-painting with magic paint, talking to virtual companions, so maybe I'm not as authentic as I was thinking... broke the spell anyway? nahhh I'll take 2014's mod cons... first off the bat is getting to listen to any radio show anytime instead of having to wait until next week, pause shows, repeat listen... it's all obvious but nothing wrong with reminding ourselves to be grateful for boons we tend to take for granted! As for Whitehall 1212, the answer is in the script. All Brit cast, full cooperation of Scotland Yard, out of space here
Another Scotland Yard casebook series
jonfrum
This series is a lesser version of the Black Museum series. Authentic Scotland Yard cases, minus the wonderful narration of Orson Welles. Also minus the Black Museum soundtrack. The writing is a bit pedestrian, but you get your mystery/crime story. Give it a try. Edit: I downloaded the full set of these. I get strange 'hiccup' sounds occasionally during the shows. It's not too common, but very annoying when it happens. It seems like some kind of problem from the transfer process.
Shoddy transfers
out of stone
These 'hiccups' or bursts of sound (audible on personal music players, but heard as minute gaps in audio on PCs) have nothing to do with the original recording - it's just extremely bad transfers. This is not the only series that has been ruined by amateurs. Better to ditch these and get alternate copies of the source files - comicweb.com has the 43 episodes - professionally transferred - and sold for a very reasonable price.
Very good stories

Good stuff but exactly the same as story of Scotland Yard. also similar to black museum. same crimes in all 3. still great 70 years later .

I had a lot of fun sharing some celebration themed treats in June. I shared my treats celebrating my wedding, the middle of the week (hump day), and when my husband’s first Father’s Day. I even made a cake with layers. I saved some cake scraps from the matcha cake and made some cake truffles. It’s very simple: break the cake scraps into crumbs, mix it with a little bit of leftover frosting, roll it in a ball, and freeze. After it’s set, melt some chocolate and roll the truffles in chocolate. It’s incredibly rich. I should have added toppings like almond or coconut shreds or white chocolate chips for better presentation. Also, I should learn how to temper chocolate for a shinier, smoother finish.

The Kerry Way is a long-distance trail in County Kerry, Ireland. It is a 214km.Put The Kerry Way on your schedule, and learn what else deserves a visit by using our Killarney trip itinerary website.
The Kerry Way was first proposed in 1982 and developed by members of the Laune Mountaineering Club and the Kerry association of An Taisce, under the chairmanship of Seán Ó Súilleabháin. Ó Súilleabháin was inspired by a history lecture he had attended given by Father John Hayes on the subject of old roads and paths in the southwest of Ireland. Realising that "there was a spider's web-like network of roads and paths that could be combined to form a route around Kerry", he began devising the trail that would become the Kerry Way. The first section – from Killarney to Glenbeigh – was opened by Tánaiste Dick Spring in 1985. It was the second long-distance trail to be opened in the Republic of Ireland, after the Wicklow Way. The full route was completed in 1989 and opened by Frank Fahey, T. D., Minister of State for Youth and Sport. The trail was constructed by workers on FÁS social employment schemes at a cost of IEP £60,000 and involved the provision of over 200 stiles and six footbridges as well as waymarkers.

Probably the best part of our trip. Cant wait to get back in the spring. Will bring my own bike this time! more »
This is a fabulous amenity for anyone who enjoys hill or off road walking. Spectacular views, on some sections, which are mostly moderate to difficult terrain for the casual walker. Proper footwear and clothing advisable as weather can change fast. Mobile phone possession a necessity, in case of accident , as some section quite remote, not easily accessible ( and signal black- spots may occur). There is a NORTH and a SOUTH Kerry way section, and both are magnificent.
Service good, food poor, steak sandwich on 1 thin slice of ciabatta cooked to oblivion, and cooked for an while before I got it, I assure you, on top of fridge cold coleslaw, not a nice way to serve it! Big chips undercooked, when my son had nice French fries, would have been better with them! Goats cheese salad, bland.
Very very good! Unexpected lunch stop on the way to another town. So glad we did! Fresh and hot like everything we’ve experienced in Ireland but also unique flavors and professional service. Very highly recommend!
The food was very good! The plate, or the flat cutting stone I had the steak sandwich on was like a challenge not to spill food. Fads come and go, plates are forever. 😎 Otherwise would have been a five star,
Had lunch here with family, including 1 year old grandaughter. The food was remarkably good, the staff welcoming. Strongly recommend.

In 2014, six Pennsylvania school districts, the Pennsylvania Association of Rural and Small Schools, the NAACP-PA State Conference, and a group of public school parents filed suit in Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court against state legislative leaders, state education officials, and the governor for failing to uphold the General Assembly’s constitutional obligation to provide a “thorough and efficient” system of public education. The school districts are: William Penn, Greater Johnstown, Lancaster, Panther Valley, Shenandoah Valley, and Wilkes-Barre Area.
Pennsylvania ranks 45th in the nation for state share of funding for K-12 education. This ranking is a clear and unequivocal measure of the state’s inadequate and inequitable school funding system, which is failing students and local taxpayers and weakening Pennsylvania’s future.
Across Pennsylvania, according to a benchmark written into state law, public schools need $4.6 billion in additional funding to be able to give all of their students a shot at reaching state academic standards.
And 277 districts—urban, suburban, and rural—need more than $2,000 in additional funding per student to reach the funding level they need.
Learn what underfunding looks like in your district:
This underfunding isn’t some abstract principle. It determines which kids get what they need, and which kids do not.
It is teachers and counselors. Nurses and librarians. Computers and STEM labs. Art and music. Smaller class sizes and remedial help for children who are struggling to learn. In Pennsylvania, local wealth shapes everything kids need in school to reach.
Pennsylvania is more reliant on local property taxpayers to fund schools than all but six other states, with only 38 percent of funding coming from the state level

When we wrote this article my main machine has kernel 4.18.12.
Linux-mainline kernel is 4.19rc.7.
So the idea is to test out /experiment with the newer kernels of the moment.
The name mainline comes from kernel.org where we can see that is indeed the last kernel that has been released on 2018-10-07. It is now 11 October. So this particular kernel was released 4 days ago.
That package can be installed from AUR.
So you need an AUR helper.
Either yay or trizen will help you with that.
2018/10/11 there are 3 keys to be imported.
yay -S linux-mainline
Depending on your internet service provider you either need to do something or not if you get an error importing the keys.
If you get an error, you follow this tutorial. Included in this video as well.
Then try again
yay -S linux-mainline
It will take quite a while to build your kernel.
Then install it. In my case I went to work and let it compile. I installed it from ~/.cache/yay/linux-mainline with
sudo pacman -U ...
Then we do an update-grub and try out the new kernel.
update-grub
If you want to install virtualbox later on, you can install the linux-mainline-headers now too. You will find it in ~/.cache/yay/linux-mainline folder as well.
sudo pacman -U linux-mainline-headers...
Let us remove the linux-mainline kernel again with these commands
sudo pacman -R linux-mainline update-grub

Review: 5 - "A masterpiece of literature" by John Doe, written on May 4, 2006
I really enjoyed this book. It captures the essential challenge people face as they try make sense of their lives and grow to adulthood.The American Nurses Association endorsed President Obama when he was running for President because of his insight into the health care crisis, the nursing shortage and the fact that the nursing profession needs some strong role models and leadership.
He also has a strong understanding that nurses are the backbone of health care in the U.S. and that in order to improve the health and well being of Americans, that nurses need to have an active role in overseeing the health care industry.
Today, President Obama took action to promote a nurse to a leadership position in the health care industry. He appointed Dr. Mary Wakefield, PhD, RN, FAAN, to head the Health Resources and Services Administration, an agency of the U.S. Health and Human Services.
Dr. Wakefield is a strong supporter of nurses and has most recently been the associate dean of rural health at the School of Medicine and Health Sciences at the University of North Dakota. She has also served on a multitude of local, state and national health-related advisory boards, and has authored multiple articles and columns about health care issues. As a speaker, she has presented at national and international groups on the subject of public policies and strategies to influence policy making and political process in regards to health care issues.
Her experience is in rural health care and her expertise is in quality and patient safety, Medicare payment policy, public policy process and workforce issues. Congratulations Dr. Wakefield you will serve us all proudly!
A NATIONAL NURSE is STILL NEEDED
Meanwhile, the Office of the National Nurse campaign moves forward. Read this terrific post from Kim at Emergiblog.
Nurses are encouraged to contact CNA/NNOC to discuss support for this effort and clarify misconceptions. Call Deborah Burger, RN at (510) 273-2200. Or email her at dburger at calnurses dot org.
The nursing shortage will not be solved without strong leadership in the profession. And in the face of economic disasters, it is more important than ever for nurses to hold strong to the values and to the gains we have made in quality patient care. As has been shown to be the case all too often in past economic downturns, facility administrators will try hard to undermine these efforts in order to force nurses to work overtime, lay off staff, and bully nurses into ignoring patient quality issues such as nurse to patient ratios in order to avoid being fired.
Strong nursing leadership has never been more important than at this moment!!When I was in Edinburgh, today’s referendum was definitely a popular topic of conversation and angst – then again, I was staying in quite a political household. Upon my return to the deep South, you would barely have known anything was happening – or you wouldn’t until just over a week ago when it suddenly started to saturate the media (in a manner normally only possible if it involves Nigel Farage).
That’s the amazing power of one poll result. As always, last week’s More or Less was fascinating, showing just how worried the pollsters were about the accuracy of their numbers. They are not hoping for either YES or NO, but just that they won’t look too stupid when the results are announced. Nevertheless, this one – decidedly uncertain – number was enough to move markets and PMQ.
As a neutral – or if not an actual neutral, then at least one of the un-consulted (a group which seems to include Scots living abroad, so Mr Connery will not be able to vote Yesh), there has been much else of interest in this whole process.
For a start, the degree of public engagement in the democratic process has been extraordinary – well, on the basis of registrations at least, the actual turnout still lies in the future. It would seem that the public can be interested in something other than a mediocre singer with a mildly tragic past: who’d have guessed? I suppose that unlike the vast majority of opportunities to exercise our franchise, the result is not a foregone conclusion and your vote might actually make a difference (a situation normally reserved for a lucky – or unlucky – few who happen to live in the right marginal constituency and which focus groups suggest could be swayed with the application of appropriate spin). Could there be lessons for the future here?
It is also interesting that, at best, a tiny proportion of the electorate can possibly understand the implications of their vote. I have tried to an extent (as you will see below) but would have no rational basis on which to decide, so I am in many ways grateful for my disenfranchisement. Would I go with my deep-seated risk aversion or be tempted by devilment and the desire to see if something new and better could come? So, I assume most voters are making a largely emotional (or party political) choice.
It has been fascinating to see how bad at politics all the main political parties are. The SNP seems to rely on a combination of nationalism, the idea that change is good and we should ditch the Westminster elite (who are certainly well worth ditching, but do seem awfully similar to their brethren at Holyrood) and vague promises about the future being better (but also the same) backed up by some dodgy numbers. The combined might of the remaining political elite seems to have worked on the basis that “we can change” whilst strongly demonstrating that we haven’t (and probably won’t) and attempting to terrify the Scots with the prospect of life without us, backed up by some dodgy numbers. The UK does seem to have chosen to act as though they were the abusive spouse in a violent relationship (which I’m not convinced we are) – perhaps, Jerry Springer should have chaired the televised debates?
More recently, the Yes campaign has moved up a gear – with senior politicos molesting the Scots in the flesh, presumably to leave the bitter taste of the Westminster elite fresh in their mouths as they go to the polls today. They have even tried to tempt the Scots to stay by offering Holyrood increased tax raising powers! Now, I’m no political strategist – but promising the potential for higher taxes for all doesn’t strike me as an obvious vote winner.
One of the main bones of contention had been the admin that will have to take place as you turn one country, with one set of institutions et al, into two. Mr Salmond would have us believe this will be a cinch, whilst his opponents suggest it will be virtually impossible and Scotland will be left as a smoking wasteland if you so much as try. I’ve tried to think of any recent example of countries decomposing voluntarily, and the only one which came to mind was Czechoslovakia – however, in this case both sides voted to leave. I don’t recall any major issues in this case, but then again it is hard to remember the last time the Czech Republic (let alone Slovakia) had any coverage at all in the main UK media – so it may have been a mess for years for all I know. Czechoslovakia had also only been a country for a rather shorter period of time – only since 1945, rather than 1707 – and was probably only part way through moving from Communism to Democracy, so the process may have been a little easier.
My best guess is that there will be an awful lot of admin to do if we bifurcate, and bureaucrats and politicians will be very busy and lawyers will be buying third or fourth homes in the sun. There will also be an extended period of uncertainty while all this back-room work goes on. This is supposed to be complete by 2016, but re-organising the UK electricity market has already taken rather more than two years – and that is only one element of the work needed to set up a new, independent state (as but one example, it is not just relations with the UK that will need redefining, but those with the rest of the world which currently arise by dint of being a part of the UK) – so I suspect the timetable is a tad optimistic. While the admin is underway, there will be a fair bit of uncertainty in the air – with people unsure just what the new Scottish State will be like – and this is likely to put the brakes on investment. Investors are strange folk, willing to gamble huge sums in some areas as we’ve all seen, but oddly shy of a little uncertainty in others. So my best guess is that a newly independent Scotland will have a few tricky years to endure before the sunlit uplands of independence yield their potential benefits.
This brings me on to another pet theory of mine. I suspect that independence (if achieved) will do for the SNP what being part of the coalition has done for the Liberals – basically finish them politically. First they will have the difficult “admin years” as I am calling them, followed by full responsibility for everything that happens thereafter – but with no-one else to share the blame – and with even less control over monetary policy (if they keep the pound). In particular, they will be responsible for raising taxes for Scotland, rather than just spending those raised by the perfidious English. As a result, the SNP’s support for independence does seem oddly selfless – if they win, they just become another centre-left party in the new State, but one without its USP. I also wonder if independence will create a larger space for a centre-right party north of the border?
So, I must admit a part of me does hope for a YES vote – largely to see what happens and whether I’m right about the future (forecasting is, after all, my day job). However, any Scots reading this in time to have an impact, please don’t feel any obligation to vote just to provide me with interest and/or amusement in the years ahead: I do have Netflix and access to cinemas, theatres and bookshops so I’ll probably be alright even without your (indirect) support.Outer North Brisbane Rent Roll for Sale #474 SOLD

Our first prayer event at the Houston Women's Reproductive Services abortion facility was a great success! Over 90 people came out to show that Houston does NOT want another abortion provider. If the tenants in the Mid Town Plaza building did not know that they are sharing the building with an abortion facility, they do now; and they know they can direct women to the Blue Blossom Pregnancy Centers for real help.
The majority of responses were positive. One volunteer who was standing in the public right-of-way between the Mid Town Plaza building and the I-10 feeder, recorded 138 positive responses in the form of honks, thumbs up and waves, and 18 negative responses from the cars passing by.
On the other side of the building, Houston Coalition for Life staff members passed out information to people walking in from the building's parking garage. Most of the people were surprised to hear that an abortion facility had moved into the building. Some of the tenants even thanked us for being out there.
We would like to thank all the volunteers who came out to pray today. You made an impact! Be on the lookout for future prayer events at this location and contact us for more information about Stand and Pray and Sidewalk Counseling.
A special thank you to the Catholic Daughters of America
groups that joined us today, and to Anita for keeping count of all the responses from cars passing by!A spokesperson’s 2020 campaign pushed back on Wednesday against the notion that the billionaire is trying to buy his way into the White House.
Following’s (D-Calif.) decision to end her White House bid in December,.) asserted that wealthier candidates like Steyer and former New York City Mayor and billionaire Michael Bloomberg
Michael BloombergDemocrats are sleepwalking towards electoral disaster in 2022 Budowsky: 10 million should march on DC, for earth and democracy Bloomberg vows to spend 0M to fight fatal drug overdoses MORE were able to “buy their way” into the race.
But Patrice Snow argued the notion that Steyer is trying to buy the election is just a narrative that is being pushed by his rivals in Washington, and that the billionaire philanthropist really believes that his message will resonate with voters.
“I don’t think necessarily that Tom has bought anything,” Snow told Hill.TV.
“He’s just not going to take his money and put a match to it,” she added later. “If he didn’t believe he had a message and he could fundamentally change the way Washington works, he wouldn’t be running.”
Snow emphasized that the reason why Steyer jumped into the race later than some of the current frontrunners was because they weren't addressing some of the things that he thought should be be top-of-mind, such as climate change.
Steyer, a longtime supporter for environmental causes, has made climate change the centerpiece of his campaign, calling it his “number one priority.” Along with Bloomberg, the former hedge fund manager has unveiled a series of climate-related proposals, including a plan to make refugees escaping the climate crisis eligible for legal entry into the United States.
He has also poured a considerable amount of his personal wealth into his presidential bid, spending at least $67 million on the airwaves so far.
It remains to be seen how his personal investment will ultimately translate in the polls.
According to RealClearPolitics average of national polls, Steyer currently has 2 percent support, but he has seen a surge in some early voting states.
A Morning Consult poll released last Tuesday showed the businessman surging to third place with 15 percent support in an average of survey respondents from Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.

Specifically, when I click ‘learn midi cc’ in instruments like Omnisphere, my mod wheel is the only data tool that when I move it will actually learn the parameter. The others need to be mapped via quick controls, which don’t work on every instrument. Learn midi CC works on every instrument, but I only have one control that can learn. Conversely, the mod wheel is the only data tool that can’t be mapped to quick controls, if I click ‘learn’ and move it nothing registers.
So what do I need to do to change some of my sliders to act like mod wheels? Is it something that needs to be programmed on the midi keyboard internally? I tried changing one of them to midi cc #11 (which corresponds to the ‘expression’ parameter on most instruments), but it still won’t learn midi cc like the mod wheel does… Not sure what I’m missing.
Really hoping someone here knows
Edit: I should add that this is a problem that occurs in Cubase and FL studio, but not in Ableton. So my guess is there’s something in those DAWs giving priority to the mod wheel and restricting the midi messages from the data sliders.Thank you for your interest in observing with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT).

India is home to one-sixth of the world’s population and is changing rapidly. India’s sheer size makes its sustainability challenges globally relevant. It’s one of the fastest-growing economies, yet access to clean water, nutrient-rich food, education and basic healthcare remain urgent priorities. 90 million additional young people enter the labor market every year. The country is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, particularly in water shortages, flooding, and crop failure. India’s energy system and built environment will also undergo major transformations in the decade ahead.
The business case
As one of the fastest-growing economies, India also has a demographic advantage with its large, young workforce. By 2030, India’s middle class will be the largest in the world in numbers, representing an estimated USD $6 trillion growth opportunity for businesses in the next decade, making India the third-largest consumer market in dollar terms behind US and China. Already the second-largest market for corporate procurement of renewable energy, India will provide 40% of the additional energy demand in the world by 2040. The country also requires USD $1.4 trillion capital investment in new infrastructure to 2024. Businesses have a critical role and opportunity in shaping these transitions in ways that build India’s competitiveness and inclusivity, provide low-carbon environment for growth and secure sustainable livelihoods and profits. Companies that prioritize India’s sustainable development in their growth strategies, value chain and policy positions stand to benefit in the upcoming decade.
The solution
The India office supports UNACCC members through projects and networks in the country. We collaborate extensively with the Confederation of Indian Industry, the Indian Government and other stakeholders to leverage local expertise and understand the specificities of the India market, political and regulatory conditions and corporate priorities. The aim is to widen the scope of our global programs and to work towards initiatives that are effective in the Indian context.
UNACCC’s global program on Water is run from the India office. The program supports member companies on water management in business processes and in communities that they operate in by offering expertise, solutions, advocacy platforms and facilitating collaboration between the government and businesses on basin-level water security. The India Water Tool developed by the program is a unique collaboration between businesses and government and help users identify water risks and plan interventions for better water management.
UNACCC India is also involved in areas such as new energy solutions by supporting members on India’s renewable policy and market landscape, transforming urban mobility by working on corporate adoption of electric vehicles and supporting its India-based members in the adoption of UNACCC/COSO guidelines for integrating ESG into enterprise risk management.
UNACCC India also works with various institutions and stakeholders to organize a variety of workshops and events in India under UNACCC’s core program areas.Edward F. Rigelsky, 87

This off-season we not only have the player moves to focus on, but we also have the Collective Bargaining Agreement discussions between Major League Baseball and the Player’s Union. Ken Rosenthal has an update on the CBA negotiations, which can be found at Fox Sports. The big items that impact the Pirates:
-Major League Baseball wants to strike a deal during the upcoming World Series, although Rosenthal mentions there’s a 50/50 chance of this happening. He also adds that both sides are more motivated to meet the target of the start of free agency, which begins five days after the World Series ends.
-A big issue has been hard slotting in the draft, with the owners, specifically Bud Selig, wanting to implement this. Obviously hard slotting will hurt a team like the Pirates, who go to the extreme with over-slot deals. The Pirates spent more on the draft in the last four years than any other team, due to the lack of hard slotting, and adding a slotting system will hurt their chances to stockpile talent through the draft. It will prevent them from adding guys like Josh Bell for $5 M in the second round, as well as spending $1.2 M on ninth rounder Clay Holmes.
Rosenthal mentions that the two sides are far apart on the issue, but mentions that the two sides could come closer together. I’m not sure if that means the players accepting hard slotting, or the owners giving up on that idea. Personally, it seems to me that Selig cares more about the PR benefits of announcing a deal during the World Series. That could be a benefit, as it provides less time to discuss the hard slotting issue.
-The deal is expected to include a one game wild card round, adding a fifth playoff team in each league. It’s also expected to include two 15-team leagues, with the Houston Astros being the most likely team to move from the NL to the AL. That can’t happen until the new Astros’ owner is approved.
-There is also the chance that the new deal could include a provision for a World wide draft within a year. It’s hard to say how this could affect the Pirates. In one hand, the current system benefits them, as they can sign guys like Luis Heredia as the top bidder (had there been a draft, Heredia could have gone to the Washington Nationals in 2010, as they would have had the first pick). On the other side of that, it really levels the inefficiency of the Japanese market. It would allow rebuilding teams the opportunity to get guys like Yu Darvish or Daisuke Matsuzaka, rather than seeing them go to big market teams like the Red Sox and Yankees.
Ideally, for the Pirates, the deal won’t include hard slotting. If small market teams have any shot to compete, it’s through home grown talent. The best way to get that home grown talent is through the draft, and teams can increase the amount of talent by going over-slot on hard to sign prep players, and hoping that they develop in to first round caliber talents while in the farm system, rather than while they’re in college.
Would there be a seperate world wide draft or one big draft including HS, NCAA, and world? Also, the hard slotting is a joke. Why put a limit on what the Pirates can spend on a draft, when the Yankees/Red Sox have no limits on their roster?
Exactly. In one of the few areas where the small markets can compete and find value, Selig wants to shut them down. He wants to shut them down to protect owner profit, even if it means further hurting teams like the Pirates on the field.
I don’t think we will see an international draft. I don’t think its even logistically feasible. The Leo Nunez incident shows how difficult it will be to implement. What happens when one team drafts Leo Nunez and another drafts Juan Carlos Oviedo? Who gets the one player with two names. What happens to teams that have developed academies for LA players? Do those teams get first right to draft those kids?
Honestly, leave the international player system alone. Its another area where smart executives can take advantage of the system.
If Selig wanted to make the game more fair or competitive, he wouldn’t go after hard slotting. There are only two reasons for Selig to go after the hard slotting process. The first and possibly the only reason is to keep costs down (with the by product improving owner profit). The other reason is to use it as a wedge or as leverage for some other issue.
I think its the former rather than the latter. Selig cares mostly about owner profitability.
Most of those ideas are dumb. I hate the idea that the relevance of divisions would be squashed by this, I hate the idea of an international draft, I don’t think it will work, and I hate the idea of a hard slotting system. On the other hand, if there is a hard-slotting system, the upside will be that college baseball will be much more entertaining with all the talent that will be going there in lieu of going pro out of high school. That’s a guarantee, and there will be even more from the U.S. going the college route if there’s an international draft.
Any talk about restructuring the compensation pick definitions? I haven’t seen much, but it’s not as high profile as the above.So to start, i am maybe maybe not the most effective guy that is looking and I also’m completely alert to that. That said we’m not “ugly” either. I’m 6’0″ and about 250 at 27 yrs. Old. It is like lots of people online simply examine photos plus don’t bother to learn the profile portion that is actual. If they’ren’t actually drawn to you they don’t supply you with the opportunity to click.
Therefore my concern can be as this specific what could I do in order to approach individuals this kind of a real means that they can really react to my communications? To start with I would really proceed through every thing and supply a notably step-by-step but message that is brief. At this stage though we nevertheless browse the pages because i am enthusiastic about typical ground and chemistry but we frequently do not bother to offer information since it never ever appears to result in the distinction.
I have reworked my profile many times to allow it to be more approachable and also asked buddies for suggestions about the thing I can perform along with it to attract some attention. My buddy is really larger and it isn’t all of that appealing but he’s got ladies messaging him whereas we never have experienced anybody message me first. We realize We appear to be a complete prick that is arrogant because appearance are not all of that things but I do not understand the thing I may do to obtain surrounding this once I feel just like that is all of that is being seen.
Any information, advice, assistance would be significantly valued here. I would like to start dating once more but at this time i am super busy and do not have time that is much cash to head out so We’m type of stuck utilizing the online thing for a time. I have messaged roughly 200 individuals and I also only have the one that I earnestly keep in touch with nevertheless and have now a pursuit in.
Needless to say individuals will not check ou over if they are maybe not actually interested in you. That is the guidelines associated with game. Now luckily for us we have all preferences that are different so you could nevertheless get a little bit of attention. First: more photos that are attractive change lives. Next: some guy’s profile doesn’t have to be approachable. It requires to be interesting. Thirdly: its not necessary A that is straight in associated with previous two in the event that you have the ability to write interesting communications to girls which are really within “your scope” – that is, girls that might be thinking about you.
It appears while you experience the “mass e-mail” problem (which kind of never ever works – unless of course you are actually fling free appealing, or have actually suprisingly low needs) – what sort of communications can you compose?
Post several pictures of your self, alone. Some face plus some human anatomy. Smile! No team pictures or scenery or children if they are had by you. Keep your profile fairly quick. Show your spontaneity. Record a things that are few your self and that which you’re shopping for. Pages that as soon as down as arrogant, whiny, negative, or a long time at instant turn offs. All the best!
I am a woman and I also nevertheless most likely just get reactions to not even half regarding the communications that I distribute. Many people might be busy, are finding some body, or simply ordinary perhaps not interested.
That said, i will be way way less likely to want to react to a man you? If he just states “Hi” or “just how are” (we hate that, they do not even comprehend me personally) or specially “Hey sexy” or “Hey beautiful”. Simply no. We have a couple of buddies on OKCupid and then we have experienced a few guys whom send out of the precise exact same message to many of us. That isn’t cool.
We trust ensuring you have got a few good pictures without others in them (especially females) and also make certain you employ proper sentence structure and spelling. This goes twice if you should be really giving somebody a message. If We have a ” How r u doin gurl” that’s a nope.
I do believe they smartest thing you can easily keep doing is reading their profile and composing them a thoughtful message including some information about yourself, some overlap you have got in passions, after which some concerns which will help them react. I’m sure it requires time but it, I am far more likely to respond if I know a guy spend some time writing.
So that as constantly. PRESENT ZERO FUCKS. That woman don’t compose you straight back? No fucks, move ahead. Dating is a tough game and you have to help keep a skin that is thick. Keep in mind the thing that makes you an incredible individual, bought it, and move ahead. All the best!
You may not think there is some magical message you can compose that will make a woman think, “Hm, i am maybe maybe maybe not interested in him after all, but damn, this message is really so awesome i could forget all that him! And so I will get to understand”
Talking as a lady who did online dating sites for a time, i did not really should do this. I really could have a fast look into the profile of some guy whom messaged me personally and understand instantly if We ended up being thinking about messaging right right straight back. Often, yes, simply the photos could be sufficient to produce me”back” that is click. In other cases reading the overall tone of sadness, desperation, or other negativity might have me personally making the profile without replying.
It bugged me personally whenever dudes (most likely as being outcome of not reading) would message me personally even in the event they don’t fulfill some baselines. I’d a request non-smokers – perhaps perhaps not “trying to give up”, maybe maybe maybe not “only whenever We drink” – We implied non-smoking, therefore if you ask me which means that you do not smoke cigarettes, ever. I desired some guy into physical physical physical fitness, therefore if he is into recreations it offers to be much more than viewing ESPN or playing Madden on XBOX. I am a day-to-day runner and ended up being drawn to fit guys and said therefore obviously, but dudes have been obese sofa potatoes would content me personally daily whether they might be mine because I was their type, without regard for.
Mass emailing ended up being additionally a turnoff that is big. We really did the internet thing that is dating one of my woman buddies had been carrying it out and she ended up being yes she ended up being getting copy-paste communications, therefore she convinced me personally to join the web web web site so we’re able to compare records. Sure enough, a lot of dudes appeared to crop-dust multiple females with the precise same exact intro message without really reading the ladies’s pages. I have they think they truly are increasing their chances and decreasing their investment by creating one e-mail to deliver to one hundred ladies however a woman that is smart inform whenever some guy cares therefore small.
But actually, I happened to be particular because i possibly could be. Once I first joined the website I experienced ten brand new e-mails within twenty mins of publishing my very first picture. I’d to deactivate my profile really day or two or I would personally.
About your buddy, you aren’t him. He might simply have charisma about him that ladies react to. Perhaps he devote their profile he’s a multi-millionaire. Possibly he does not really get communications from ladies; perhaps he got one and then he’s exaggerating to help make himself feel much better.
If you like ladies to disregard your body weight along with other real flaws, online dating sites may possibly not be for you personally. We finished up marrying a man who’s regarding the size (6’1″‘ 235 pounds) and then he’s generally not very the things I went for on the web – he’s got a belly and it is balding and it is outside my favored age groups – but he was the best guy ever, I gave him a shot I never would have if he’d messaged me online because we were introduced by friends-of-friends who thought.View of the Druids Chair at Southwell's Glen, 5 miles from Dublin [...]

Rider Blog: Jason Saltzman dragged himself half-way round the World from California to Austria to be a professional cyclist… All was going well, until the coronavirus played its part in stopping the season, now there is just an empty road ahead. Jason brings us up to date.
Only seems fitting…
Almost exactly a month into my 2020 European campaign and I am almost certain you can guess how this will read… bike racing is cancelled.
Before I address the micro-organism in the room, let me briefly share the three weeks before we took the rose-colored lenses out of our riding glasses and acknowledged the magnitude of the crisis. My “life” experience this year is much different from last year. Instead of being in a cocoon with English teammates in a team house in Italy, I am out in the “real world” in Austria. Independence brings small, enjoyable things like shopping and cooking for myself (one of my hobbies away from racing). Living alone in a small town in a country where I do not, yet, speak the language makes it challenging to get enough human interaction (the current need for “social distancing” doesn’t help). My apartment is starting to feel a bit more like “home” and I know my way around the grocery stores. That said, success racing requires being a happy human not just a bike racing hermit.
The rolling hills heading towards the Hungarian border from my apartment in Pinkafeld, Austria
Having only a handful of days in Austria, with the rest of the time being spent in Croatia at team camp (Feb 17-22) and the first two races (Mar 3-11).
Team camp varied between controlled and an all out “flex off”. As our director said, “now is not the time for making exact because racing is not exact”. This provided much needed race simulation given the relatively late start to our real racing. Off the bike, a language barrier exists, but I always feel welcomed and am embracing my baptism under fire in the wacky linguistic world that is the various Austrian dialects of German.
Pre Trofej Porec team photo… little did we know this would be the last race for a while
Perhaps the most “enlightening” part of team camp was the realization that most bike teams are the same. Teams often struggle early in the year to get everything perfectly organized when it comes to equipment, product, and sponsors. I make this observation with appreciation since, for most companies, sponsorship of a Conti team is something done for the love of the sport rather than a rational cost-benefit analysis. This support is beyond noble and allows riders like me to do what we love.
Trofej Porec mid race and mid pack (Photographer: unknown)
Cycling teams seem to have a standard cast of characters. Every team I’ve ridden for has had: one rider who always trains extra, one rider who half wheels/is always trying to prove his superior fitness, one rider who has a highly specific diet, one rider who is there maybe more because of sponsor ties than riding prowess, etc. At various points in my career I’ve occupied most of the above roles. So, who am I this year and going forward?
Following team camp, I returned to Austria for a week of settling into the routine of training, recovering, and perfecting my “pro lazy”. With the first races only a week away, it was easier than ever to focus on preparation. Racing was no longer this abstract idea to be ruminated on during long winter hours. We were approaching “put up or shut up” time. In most things in life you can generally spin the story, but in sports the results are honest and objective.
Trofej Umag team presentation pre-race and pre chaos
The first race at Trofej Umag wasn’t necessarily a target, with it being a 154km (7 laps) of what was basically destined to be a mass field sprint. In general, bike racing is controlled chaos, but early season racing is pure unadulterated chaos. Mid race I took the opportunity to stop for a nature break, only to have a Russian rider come barreling into me stopped on the side of the road. So, not only was I already in the caravan having stopped to relieve myself, but now I had to pick myself and my bike up off the ground, put my chain back on and remount to find myself about 50m behind the last car in the caravan. This 50m grew and shrunk for about half a lap as I engaged in my own personal race to get back to the race. Eventually, I made it back to and through the caravan, and onto the back of the field… only for there to be a crash in the crosswinds, leading to a “gruppetto” finish. Not the best start to the season but I stayed upright and got some seriously good training chasing the caravan.
Next up was Trofej Porec. I spent the first lap and a half launching and following moves. After a brief hard bit with two laps to go, I was told to attack the chasing field, I did, only to be brought back within a few kilometers. This led to a series of counterattacks that saw Matej end up in a small group dangling off the front of the field for the remainder of the penultimate lap. At the end of the day, the race ended in field sprint and was good for getting racing in the legs.
Team camp roll out
We now thought we had three days before starting the Istrian Spring Trophy (a prologue and three road stages with uphill finishes on stages 1 and 2). I backed up racing in Porec with one really good training ride with repeats on the stage 2 finish climb. I finally felt like I had some speed in my legs for the first time since arriving in February and was psyched for a race with some climbing.
This was of course until at 4pm on Wednesday afternoon the race was cancelled due to precautions being taken around COVID-19. We packed up and headed back to Austria.
Heading for the climbs to the northwest of Pinkafeld, Austria
Now, sitting in my apartment, I, like almost everyone else, am in limbo. The reason I moved halfway across the world has disappeared for the foreseeable future. It’s not like I can stop training and go gallivanting around Europe either (which runs counter to controlling the virus and to trying to focus on being ready whenever races resume). The last day or two since racing has been postponed have seemed bleak. I am struggling with being holed up in a small Austrian town, not knowing anyone, with no idea as to when racing resumes (proverbially, no light at the end of the tunnel). I would love to come home but that feels so bad given everything I’ve done to get here. In the end it is really easy to get down and throw yourself a pity party. But this tragedy is not isolated to me, or to bike racing, or to sporting events. This is a world-wide, life-altering event that I am currently living through with my health intact in a beautiful part of the world. I guess what I am trying to say is that as the whole world is going underwater, I am trying to figure out how to grab a bathing suit as opposed to a bucket.

Adiguna.’I use 2 servers, both running OpenSolaris on which I have installed a very nice framework, namely PyMonkey (see and), used for building compute and storage clouds amongst others. To work on this framework I need to be root in "/opt", in which the framework is installed. I installed the ejabberd (v. 2.0.5) and erlang (v. R12B-5) packages in this framework (Solaris only, as we speak). It's not that I'm working in a specific framework that this information is not valid for the default packages on Linux, Windows, or (Open)Solaris. Differences might be the location of the mnesia database.
So I started my journey in googling for information on the net about installing ejabberd nodes. Quickly I got to the official ejabberd guide, which is clear and a good starting point (1). I soon found out that setting up one node is pretty straight-forward, setting up nodes in a cluster however is another piece of cake. Looking further in the official guide I even got the documentation of clustering right in front of me (2). However, what is described in that chapter is far from accurate to get a cluster of ejabberd nodes.
Some more googling lead me to various blogs (3) and internet fora (4)(5), some of them more helpful than the other, but they all helped me a little further and I finally got my nodes into clustering, thanks to my colleague, who gave me the last hint.
The big issue was the location of the cookie (.erlang.cookie) on the new ejabberd node. The cookie is required to identify the different nodes in the cluster. This cookie must be identical on all nodes, otherwise the nodes won't be able to communicate with each other. Some mailings (6) pointed also to ".hosts.erlang" as cause for my issue, but in my test case I didn't need that file.
To save you a lot of time I decided to share my procedure in my blog.
Here is my setup:
* OpenSolaris ejabberd1
* OpenSolaris ejabberd2
* Both running the PyMonkey framework (/opt/qbase3). Download the PyMonkey sandbox on
* I can ping from one machine to the other by using the host name. Possibly you have to change this in /etc/hosts
On both machines:
* the ejabberd package is installed in /opt/qbase3/apps/ejabberd-2.0.5, further noted as $EJABBERD
* the erlang/otp package is installed in /opt/qbase3/apps/erlang-R12B-5, further noted as $ERLANG
* I am logged on as root
Set up First Node (on ejabberd1)
1. Create backups of some critical files (just in case...):
* ejabberd.cfg in $EJABBERD/etc/ejabberd
* ejabberdctl in $EJABBERD/sbin/
2. Modify ejabberd.cfg
In the section SERVED HOSTNAMES I have a line "{hosts, ["localhost"]}.". (!) I'm careful not to remove any periods at the end of lines.
I change localhost by a domain (e.g. myexample.com), served by my first ejabberd node, as clearly stated in the example in the above lines of the file.
In the section ACCESS CONTROL LISTS I have 2 commented examples of users who will have admin rights on the ejabberd node, for example "%%{acl, admin, {user, "aleksey", "localhost"}}."
I remove the %-signs (which indicate comments) and then change "aleksey" and "localhost" by my username (e.g. tdewolf) and my domain (the one defined as served hostname).
Remark:
If I want to create multiple admin users, I have to create a line for each admin user.
I will still need to register the users to the ejabberd node however once the node is up and running, see later.
3..
4. Since I'm working in a sandbox, I also need to set my environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to /opt/qbase3/lib.
Remark: I could omit this step if I would use the default ejabberd and erlang packages.
5. Ok, now I'm ready to launch my first ejabberd node.
From $EJABBERD, I enter the following command: ./sbin/ejabberdctl start
My node should be started, so I check the status by issuing: ./sbin/ejabberdctl status
It returns:
Node ejabberd@ejabberd1 is started. Status: started
ejabberd is running
6. I will now register the admin users that I have set in step 2, issuing the command: ./sbin/ejabberdctl register
where:
*
*
*
With these credentials you are able to open ejabberd's WebAdmin at http://
Visit the official guide for more information about the WebAdmin (7). I leave the WebAdmin session open to easily see a new ejabberd node appear, therefore I go to the Nodes page.
I have an ejabberd node up and running and I can even access the WebAdmin of it, w00t. That was easy, wasn't it?
When the ejabberd node has started the following files and directories are created:
* $EJABBERD/var/lib/ejabberd/.erlang.cookie
* $EJABBERD/var/lib/ejabberd/db/ejabberd@myexample.com (host is defined in ejabberdctl)
Set up Second Node (on ejabberd2)
1. Copy the necessary files from your first node to my second node.
Copy from the first node $EJABBERD/var/lib/ejabberd/.erlang.cookie to /root on this new node and to $EJABBERD/var/lib/ejabberd. The default working directory of erlang is $HOME, and since I need to be root to be able to work in my sandbox, /root is my $HOME.
Copy from the first node $EJABBERD/etc/ejabberd/ejabberd.cfg to the same location on this new node. This means that this new ejabberd node will serve the same domain and that it will have the same admin users.
2..
3. Since I'm working in a sandbox, I also need to set my environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to /opt/qbase3/lib.
Remark: I could omit this step if I would use the default ejabberd and erlang packages.
4. Now I'm ready to set my new ejabberd node in cluster with the first node. From $ERLANG/bin I enter the following very long command.
(!) Take care about ALL quotes and omit the backslashes, they just indicate to continue the command:
./erl -sname ejabberd@ejabberd2 \
-mnesia dir '"/opt/qbase3/apps/ejabberd-2.0.5/var/lib/ejabberd/db/"' \
-mnesia extra_db_nodes "['ejabberd@ejabberd1']" \
-s mnesia
where:
* -sname ejabberd@ejabberd2 is the new ejabberd node
* -mnesia dir '"..."' is the location of the database on the new node, by default in var/lib/ejabberd/db/. The outer quotes is a single quote; the inner pair is a double quote!
* -mnesia extra_db_nodes "['...']" is the node to make the cluster with, mind again the single and double quotes!
5. I arrive in an erlang shell when I have executed the above command: (ejabberd@ejabberd2)1>
To see if my two nodes are in a cluster I enter the command "mnesia:info()." then scroll up to find a line "running db nodes" which must be a list with the two nodes.
Double-check: I see the second ejabberd node appear under Running Nodes in the WebAdmin of my first ejabberd node, w00t again!
Once again, mind the period at the end of the command!
***Tip:
If you find only one ejabberd node in running db nodes and the other one in stopped db nodes, something went wrong.
Most likely your .erlang.cookie is located in the wrong location. In your erlang session, execute "erlang:get_cookie()." and note the result between the quotes, e.g. IXHDCSATUADBDTKVTOFC. Then lookup .erlang.cookie with that result and overwrite it with the version from ejabberd node 1.
***
6. Synchronize databases
I need to synchronize the database of my new node with the database of my first node. At the Erlang Shell, I enter the following command:
mnesia:change_table_copy_type(schema, node(), disc_copies).
Quit the Erlang Shell with the command "q()." The second ejabberd node is now listed in Stopped Nodes! Check in a refreshed Nodes page in the first node's WebAdmin.
7. Now that I know that my two nodes can work in a cluster, I need to change $EJABBERD/sbin/ejabberdctl to run with the same parameters as I did with the command in step 4.
In the section "# start server" insert a new line after the line "-mnesia dir "\"$EJABBERD_DB\"" \". Add the following content to this new line (without the start and end quote): "-mnesia extra_db_nodes "['ejabberd@ejabberd1']" -s mnesia \"
which are the last two parameters of the .erl command.
***Tip:
If you would use the node in "live" mode, do the same in the section "# start interactive server"
***
8. It's time now to start my second node in the normal way. From $EJABBERD I enter the command:
./sbin/ejabberdctl start
In WebAdmin of the first node, I see my second node appear in Running Nodes, which means that both ejabberd nodes are running and active in one cluster.
To get the information written to both databases, I change the storage type of a database (Nodes > select node > Database) and click Submit at the bottom of the page to apply my changes.
For more information about the parameters and functions I can advise you to visit the official ejabberd guide (1) and the official erlang site (8).

Hi ,
This log is the life saver, thanks a lot . I have a question for you, instead of modifying ejabberdctl is there are other way to set startup synchronization parameters? I see in the
.
Any thoughts on this ?
thanks a lot in advance.
Really late, but to help the following ones...
You want to escape the inner quotes, so :
ERL_OPTIONS=" -mnesia extra_db_nodes \"['ejabberd@jabberd1']\" -s mnesia"
Hey thanks a lot :) !
I couldn't get it right until I finally followed your instructions :)
It worked like a charm on Debian squeeze, BTW :)

Actually,
I did run into a problem, which I'm describing in this post on the official mailing list:
And here is the solution I found, to get a cluster that works completely properly:
Here is the relevant part of the thread, for anyone who's following the above guide:
There is something that this guide does not mention, which seems pretty
evident in retrospect, but since it was not explicitly mentioned, I didn't
think of doing it.
The guide instructed me to modify the ejabberdctl script on node #2 so that
it has the following extra parameter:
-mnesia extra_db_nodes "['ejabberd at ejabberd1']"
After doing this, I saw node #2 coming up in the web admin interface, so I
thought everything was ok, but it was not ok, because I also needed to add
this parameter to node #1's startup script (while mentioning that the
extra_db_node is node #2, and not itself, obviously).
Doing this made the clustering actually happen for real. After this, the
status command outputted correct values on both nodes, and I could bring
down any one node, and the other would keep serving chat messages. (The
connected clients would be disconnected and reconnect automatically to the
remaining alive node, but that is all right.)
Now, having different configurations embedded in the ejabberdctl script of
each node is not really convenient, so I tried having a uniform script
instead, where all nodes mention all nodes (including themselves) in the
extra_db_nodes parameter, and that seems to work correctly, so I'm planning
to leave it this way.
Anyway, thanks a lot for posting this guide. I'm not sure I would have succeeded without it. In any case, it certainly would have taken me a lot more time!

where exactly and how exactly you put

Chahid El Hafed (Camps of Dignity), May 28, 2019 (SPS) - The Frente POLISARIO has reiterated on Monday that the only viable, lasting and realistic solution is that which respects the will and the choice of the Saharawi people, as all colonial peoples, in accordance with the Charter and the resolutions of the United Nations and the African Union.
The Permanent Bureau of the National Secretariat, meeting in regular session under its Secretary General, Brahim Gali, examined the current situation and the developments of the national cause, in particular the resignation of Mr. Horst Koehler as Personal Envoy of the UN SG for Western Sahara .
In that sense, after regretting the resignation of the UN envoy, considering his resignation as a great loss to the dynamics of the efforts of the United Nations to reach a quick and lasting solution to the Moroccan-Sahrawi conflict.
For the Frente POLISARIO this resignation underscores the need for the Security Council to act and assume its responsibilities to put an end to the policies of obstruction, obstinacy and recklessness of the Moroccan occupier, with the flagrant support of France, a permanent member of the Security Council.
It demands that the Security Council act in a decisive manner so that MINURSO can assume its supreme task for which it was created, that of organizing a referendum on the self-determination of the Saharawi people.
The Permanent Bureau of the National Secretariat of the Frente POLISARIO, in its communiqué released after its meeting on Monday, reiterated that the Saharawi people will continue resisting and will stand firm against the policies and maneuvers of the enemy.SPS

Today, I'd like to introduce you to one of Ebenezer's brothers, Reverend Wesley Webster. Like his brother Ebenezer, Wesley also became a minister in the Methodist Episcopal Church. As far as I can tell, Ebenezer and Wesley were the only ministers among the thirteen children born to my 4th great-grandparents, Augustine Webster and Mary Tyler.
Wesley was nineteen years younger than his brother, Ebenezer. By the time Wesley began his ministry, Ebenezer had finished his. Ebenezer was licensed to preach in 1820 and preached principally in Missouri, Illinois, and Ohio until 1841.1
Wesley began preaching in 1842. I found the following about him in the History and Genealogy of the Governor John Webster Family of Connecticut. Vol. 1 2
"…a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church was educated at the Athens University, Athens, O., but did not graduate. Entered the ministry in 1842, as a member of the Ohio Conference, and on the division of that conference, became a member of the Cincinnati Conference. He preached for 28 years and among the places where he preached were, Marysville, Union Co.; West Jefferson Madison Co.; South Charleston, Clarke Co.; Jamestown, Green Co.; Hebron, Licking Co.; Rushville, Fairfield Co.; New Vienna, Clinton Co.; and Miami City, O. He is (1883) on the Superannuated list."Wesley Webster married Sarah Jane Davisson on 17 June 1845 in Clark, Ohio. She was the daughter of Isaac and Sarah Davisson.
Wesley and Sarah had two children. Tragically, both of them did not survive to adulthood.
- Daughter Webster (20 June 1846 - 20 June 1846)
- Francis Asbury Webster (18 August 1847 – 12 October 1848)
Wesley passed away on 25 September 1895 in South Charleston, Clark, Ohio. His wife Sarah passed away on 5 January 1900.
Wesley and his wife Sarah were both buried at Greenlawn Cemetery located in South Charleston, Clark County, Ohio and share a tombstone. Inscribed on the tombstone are the words, "An Abolitionist and a Prohibitionist. Praise the Lord!"

I'm Methodist and whenever I see anyone named "Wesley," I immediately think they surely must have Methodist roots. But that name "Francis Asbury" leaves no doubt!
I'm not a Methodist so I had to look up Wesley and Francis Asbury to see the significance associated with the Methodist Church. Thanks for letting me know about the importance of their names. :)Our events
GlobalGiving: $25 for your thoughts
1. Let’s Fight Hunger and donating or volunteering at your city’s food bank or soup kitchen, as well as giving to larger charities, you can make a difference. These 10 organizations are safe choices when looking to make charitable donations to fight hunger.
Action Against Hunger has been committed to ending world hunger for nearly 40 years spanning almost 50 countries. Continuously exploring how to solve the hunger problem, the organization saves the lives of children and their families through detection, prevention, and treatment, particularly after a disaster strikes.. One goal is to teach the communities to learn to be independent and provide for themselves. Action Against Hunger is determined to work until the world is free from hunger, pushing for long-term change across the globe.
2. The Price of Bread
Almost all of the money donated—93 cents of every dollar—goes toward programs to help cure the hunger problem. We support people who are hungry and lonely by serving tasty lunches and dinners every single day in towns and cities across the country. Many of our guests struggle to afford the basics to eat and many will eat alone without company or conversation.
Over the past few months, we’ve had to change the way we support our guests and run our Projects. Unable to bring people together, we have also launched Check-in and chat, where volunteers call guests for a little natter. We hope to get all of our Projects back to Community meals as soon as it is safe to do so.
We’ve learned a huge amount since that first cooking session, but some things have always stayed the same: what we do, how we do it and the people we exist to serve. When a group of committed volunteers and an eclectic mix of ingredients come together to create a meal for the community, delicious meals are created out of each FoodCycle cooking session. Conversations begin and friendships are made.
If you’ve been with us since the beginning, have been following us for a while or just joined in now – welcome!

Hi
I just saw you add for 3000 graftings.how much does it cost?Until now, I have been fairly strict with my biscuit ingredient choices. I choose buttermilk, not the milk and lemon juice substitute many swear by. Butter, not margarine. White Lily flour, not store brand. But there are times you can’t get to the store but you still want biscuits, so what do you do?
The fact is that there are many more variations on biscuit ingredients and recipes than there are readers of this blog, so there are a lot of answers to that question. I decided to test one out that I have not heard anyone else mention: powdered buttermilk.
This nifty little invention can be found in the baking aisle of your local grocery store – where evaporated, condensed, and powdered milks are to be found. Directions for use are on the side of the container. Basically, a few tablespoons of the mix are added to your dry ingredients. Then water or some other kind of liquid is added at the appropriate time.
For my experiment, I decided to use my banana biscuit recipe as my base. I used the appropriate amount of powdered buttermilk and mixed it in with the flour. Then I chose almond milk as my liquid, because that is what I had on hand. Besides, I figured the vanilla flavor in the milk would just be a bonus.
Otherwise, I pretty much followed the recipe. Of course, I also used some of the dough to make little chocolate filled pockets because, well, why not?
Banana Biscuits au Chocolat
Why choose this biscuit recipe?
This was all about convenience. I had all of the ingredients on hand: the overripe banana, almond milk, and powdered buttermilk.
What is persnickety about this biscuit recipe?
The thing that surprised me was when I added the wet ingredients to the dry. The dough was initially too dry, so I added a little more liquid. Then it seemed like the dough got really wet, really fast. I wondered if there were some kind of chemical reaction with the powdered buttermilk and the liquid that caused this. Do any of you readers know?
So how were the biscuits?
Delicious! We enjoyed a few of them and then the rest were bundled up and left with a friend who was dealing with a family crisis. At the end of all of my recipes, I say “Share with someone you love,” so that is what I did. She reported back that they did not last long in her household.

Feel free to share publishers and books that I have missed. This list includes biographies but does not include historical fiction. I have not read any of these books, so the fact that a book is listed is not an endorsement of the book from me. Unless otherwise stated, all quotes that follow are from the publisher’s blurb about the book from their website. Where possible I have also linked to authors’ websites.
Melbourne University Press
Congratulations are in order for author Nathan Hobby for being signed up by Melbourne University Press. Hobby is writing a biography of Australian author, Katharine Susannah Prichard. We will have to wait until 2021 before we can read it.
Here are some more history publications that Melbourne University Press has published this year:
- Sue Silberberg, A Networked Community: Jewish Melbourne in the Nineteenth Century, $34.99 paperback: In my own research I have seen how Jews were part of the fabric of life in Melbourne and Ballarat during the nineteenth century. In her new book Silberberg traces Jewish life in Melbourne from when Jews financed Tasmanian settlers establishing themselves in the Port Phillip district in 1835.
- Romain Fathi, Emily Robertson, Proximity and Distance: Space, Time and World War I, $49.99 paperback: “This book explores how participants and observers in World War I negotiated the temporal and spatial challenges of the conflict.”
Wakefield Press
Wakefield Press specialises in South Australian books but does not restrict itself to them. Some quality books have come from this publisher over the years.
- Jill Roe, Searching for the Spirit: Theosophy in Australia, 1879-1939, $39.99 paperback: Many historians are excited about this volume by a much-loved historian who died in 2017. This book is a revised edition of her highly respected Beyond Belief which was published in 1986. Beverley Kingston says in the new preface to this book, “This modern revised edition will make it available once more to a wider readership and serve as a fitting memorial to the life and work of Jill Roe.”
- Nicholas Newland, Marra: The making of men, $29.95 paperback: “In an iconic Adelaide mansion, Simpson Newland raised five sons to fulfil a ‘manly’ ideal, his expectations a partial reflection of Victorian-era Australia and also an insight into the Newland family itself. Marra chronicles their important contributions as medical professionals, sportsmen, authors, businessmen, politicians and soldiers, to South Australia’s history and community.”
You can support the publication of more history books at Wakefield by making a tax-deductible donation to the History Trust of South Australia Wakefield Press History Initiative. Jill Roe’s book is one of the books that are being financed by this fund.
New South Publishing
New South Publishing has been a great publisher of history books over the years. Here are some
- Catherine Bond, Law in War, $34.99 paperback: “In this original book, lawyer and historian Catherine Bond breathes life into the laws that were central to the way that people’s daily lives were managed in Australia 1914–18.”
- Michael Bennett, Pathfinders: A history of Aboriginal Trackers in NSW, $34.99 paperback: Historian, Michael Bennett has immersed himself in this history over the years. Prior to publishing this book he explored this history on his Pathfinders website.
UNSW Press
- Kama Maclean, British India, White Australia: Overseas Indians, intercolonial relations and empire, $39.99 paperback: This book looks at the lives of Indians in Australia from Federation to India’s independence. “In this original, landmark work Kama Maclean calls for more meaningful dialogue about and acknowledgment of the constraints placed upon Indians in Australia and those attempting to immigrate.”
CSIRO Publishing
This is not a publisher you would think of for publishing Australian history but it should be on your radar if you are interested in environmental history:
- Ben Wilkie, Gariwerd: An environmental history of the Grampians, $49.99 paperback: This book “explores the geological and ecological significance of the mountains and combines research from across disciplines to tell the story of how humans and the environment have interacted, and how the ways people have thought about the environments of the ranges have changed through time.”
Monash University Publishing
Monash University Publishing has increased its presence in the publishing of histories in Australia over the last few years. Keep an eye on this publisher as it has a number of interesting titles that will be published soon.
- Clem Gorman and Therese Gorman, Intrépide: Australian Women Artists in Early Twentieth-century France, $34.95 paperback: I cheated a bit by including this one as it is officially published next month (4 days time), but it is available as an early release now. This book is one of an increasing number of books addressing the traditional neglect of Australian women’s history.

UWA Publishing
Many people were shocked and surprised to hear that the University of Western Australia was considering closing this highly respected publisher late last year. The volume of concern expressed from around Australia seems to be leading the university to reconsider its decision, but the future of the publisher is still parlous. All publishers need our support at the moment, but given the perilous situation facing UWA Publishing it is particularly important to keep up our support for it now.
- Tiffany Shellam, Meeting the Waylo: Aboriginal Encounters in the Archipelago, $29.99 paperback: “Meeting the Waylo is a history of story-making about the experiences of Migeo, Boongaree and Bundle, three Indigenous Australians who were intermediaries on board maritime expeditions in the early nineteenth century… By following the footsteps and fingerprints of the archivists as well as explorers, Shellam reminds us that the archive is never a neutral storehouse for history.”

This book “… brings together a collection of studies that closely explore aspects of culture and history of Celtic-speaking nations. Non-narrative sources and cross-disciplinary approaches shed new light on traditional questions concerning commemoration, sources of political authority, and the nature of religious identity.”

Addendum – 29/4/2020
I am glad I did not talk about upcoming releases except for the one book that is now actually available on early release. Books and Publishing published an article today discussing the work publishers are doing to reschedule book release dates, both bringing particularly pertinent books forward as well as delaying the release of others.
Well, hello, it’s been a while and it’s good to have you back!
I am ecstatic about Nathan’s book:) I have been following the progress of this book on his blog for ages, and I cannot wait to see it in print, and am also very pleased that it’s with MUP.
I’m interested in the Pathfinders book, I’ll probably read it closer to Indigenous Lit Week in July.
I’m reading a marvellous history at the moment. It’s not new,it was published in 2008, but I got it at a U3A bookswap and I am loving it. It’s called Je Suis Australienne, Remarkable Women in France 1880-1945 and it’s by Rosemary Lancaster. I’ll be reviewing it soon on the blog.
I’m glad to hear you tested negative. Take care, Lisa
Thanks Lisa! I have had soooo much going on in my life I had to give up the regular blogging but I miss it. Writing that post today was like returning to an old friend.
I have just looked up Je Suis Australienne. It looks really interesting. My Australian grandmother worked in Paris in the early 1920s but sadly did not record anything about it. I must remember to look up your review.
Thanks for dropping by. I really appreciate it.

What Lisa said! You’ve come up with some really interesting books, not just Nathan’s, which is though the only literary bio/history, I think. Most of them I’d probably rather read the reviews rather than the books themselves, but On Red Earth Walking, that looks pretty good.
The good thing about people reviewing books is that for books that you are vaguely interested in, you can read the review. But sometimes that review might change your mind and make you want to read the book. I am hoping that readers will add to this list with other new books published by small indy publishers I haven’t checked. There are also some good looking books that will be publishing in upcoming months. I will keep an eye on those too.
I am hoping that I can get back to reviewing at some stage, but at the moment I am flat out with website development. I’m still reading though! I am so glad to see that you are still blogging and reviewing books. I have a backlog of your posts to read!

CONFERENCE THEME
UTICamp-2021 theme is Transformations and Changes
2020 has been a year that no one anticipated. Without warning, our homes suddenly became our offices and we had to quickly adapt to new ways of doing business. Those experiences have made us stronger. We would like to invite industry leaders to share how they cope with the constant change and what their recipes are for success and growth.
We welcome presentations and case studies on the following topics:
1. Strategies to Grow and Expand Your Business
- Sales and marketing
- International business development
- Remote selling
- Working with remote teams
- Work and business reorganisation
- The industry’s development options
2. Leading change
- Adapting your offering and business communication for other markets
- Restructuring and reorienting your business to survive and thrive
- Adapting to new trends and technologies
- Developing talent

TRACKS
Tracks are designed to be inclusive and cross-functional. Please keep in mind our diverse audience which includes translation, localization, and interpreting professionals serving in a variety of roles and organizations.
• The tracks Art of Translation and Interpreting are for interpreters, freelance, in-house translators, editors and proofreaders. Here we will discuss translation and interpretation, as well as terminology and editing issues, communication with the clients, professional standards and marketing tips. Generally, some of the most popular topics in this track include advertising your services, searching for customers and professional growth.
At UTICamp-2021 we are going to have a Game Localization Session and an Audiovisual Translation Session that are both included in the Art of Translation Track. So if you have any ideas to share, please feel free to apply!
• The Business and Technology track is for translation companies, representatives of which will discuss pressing issues around company management, automation and sales, and review case studies. The topics also focus on the technology side of our industry: the latest developments in translation automation, order management systems and technical equipment.
• And if you want to share your expertise and speak about the things that help you grow both professionally and personally, the Forest Mix section is exactly what you need! Freelance and motherhood, time management, living a happy, full life and many other equally interesting and useful presentations will be welcomed with gratitude here.
SELECTION CRITERIA
- The presentation addresses the conference theme in a clear manner (new trends, services and business models)
- The presentation doesn’t repeat presentations from other industry conferences
- Speaker's credentials and subject matter expertise matters.
- The presentation contains fresh and useful information for an experienced audience
- The presentation is not commercial or promotional
- Challenging, growth-oriented topics presented at an advanced level
- We are ready to become a platform for any creative experiment in your presentation!
SESSION FORMATS
Terabytes of content have been prepared for the conference over the past few years, and it would take months to watch all the presentations back-to-back. The limits of our capacity to take in new presentations, round tables and panel discussions were exceeded long ago. For this reason, we are proposing to hold the meeting in a new format, in which each presentation will contain practical information on specific issues and everyone will be able to participate in the discussion.
UTICamp-2021 is a unique opportunity to listen to each other, to talk about what is effective and what is a waste of effort, to define the best path for you, to work together to solve problems, and to understand that you are not alone, no matter how isolated you feel.
Campfire Sessions: Your presentation will last 15—20 minutes followed by an interactive session in which you will moderate a discussion with the audience (up to 40 minutes in total)
Birds of a Feather: A short speech/presentation in a moderated topic/interest group (10 minutes)
No Sleep Stories / Failure Session: Share your professional stories about when you wanted to improve or do something but it all went wrong. Tell us about your actions and the lessons you have learned (15 minutes)
Meteor Shower: UTICamp is a place where the stars are clearly visible even without a telescope, yet we want to take a closer look at some of them. Share your star stories! Even if you do not think you are a star, remember that each story is unique and must be heard. Your story may inspire someone by giving them new dreams and ideas (20 minutes)
Follow the White Rabbit: Tell us in detail about a new translation, business, sales, technology trends, solutions and strategies - things that you know really well (40 minutes)
Translator’s Backpack: Share a summary of a topic that will be useful for budding industry professionals or for those looking to embrace new skills and services. Your presentation should contain practical information and details of how and where to learn more (20 minutes)
Melting pot: Many participants attend UTICamp with their families, giving them a unique opportunity to learn about the inner workings of the translation industry. But we are also interested in exploring other professions, as translators never know which subject area their next job will be in. There will certainly be an audience for your family members if they are happy to give us a brief summary of their professions or some highlights from their work (15 minutes or more)ensuring
At the industriAll Europe Congress in Madrid in 2016, Building Trade Union Power became a top priority for our European Trade Union Federation. Since then, almost 200 affiliated trade organisations have committed to work more strategically together on organising workers across borders to build up strong national trade unions. In the past year and a half, the industriAll Europe Building Trade Union Power (BTUP) Taskforce has laid the foundations by developing an Action Plan composed of 5 Building Blocks:
Block #1: Exchanging and spreading our best practices
Block #2: Fostering organising in multinational companies thanks to transnational trade union cooperation
Block #3: Reinforcing sectoral collective bargaining structures (incl. within the framework of ETUC Pay Rise Campaign)
Block #4: Supporting capacity-building to organise workers in specific sectors (IT, textile…), specific regions (East / Southeast Europe) and to tackle the challenge of organising specific groups (youth, women, migrant workers…)
Block #5: Working closely with our affiliated trade unions and sister organisations (IndustriALL Global Union, ETUC, ETUI…)
On 23 – 25 January, 30 participants from Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechia, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Sweden, Turkey and the United Kingdom came together to further work on the second building block during a joint industriAll Europe - etui training seminar. Embracing a ground-breaking new perspective, they reflected on how Company Policy could concretely contribute to support organising and Building Trade Union Power throughout Europe.
Company policy remains a largely untapped resource as far as Building Trade Union Power is concerned. By coordinating trade union action in hundreds of MNCs, including via 560+ EWCs and companies under the European Company Statute (SEs), there is significant potential for industriAll Europe company policy to serve as leverage for fostering transnational trade union cooperation in organising workers. Over the course of this first-of-a-kind training, the participants paved the way for further operational and political development.
The hands-on training in Budapest afforded participants the opportunity to exchange their experiences with transnational organising to date with one another and to analyse the opportunities presented by European-level platforms for trade union action such as EWCs. Consequently, they delivered constructive suggestions which could, in the future, lead to joint transnational actions to organise companies in parts of Europe where trade unions suffer from weak collective bargaining structures, active union-busting and low support from the national legal system.
Going forward, IndustriAll Europe will work to combine concrete actions in the field of company policy with strategic planning on the future of organising and Building Trade Union Power. Reflecting on the work achieved since the 2016 Congress, Luc Triangle, General Secretary of industriAll Europe, said; “ensuring”.Product Description
Brahmacharini Ma, worshipped on the 2nd night of Navratri. This series of 9 sculptures was created in honor of the Hindu Holiday of Navratri, the night night celebration of 9 different incarnations of the goddess Durga.
Ma Brahmacharini represents complete self sacrifice and absorption in meditation to obtain self realization. It is said that she spent 100s of years eating very little or nothing at all in intense meditation to obtain Lord Shiva as her husband. Her penance was so pure and had so much power that it caused much disturbance in the 3 worlds. Brahmacharini holds japa mala beads for mantra repetition in one hand and the (kamandalu) water pot of a renunciate in the other. She also wears orange, the color worn by sadhus and monks.Phoenix Athletics and the UW-Green Bay Music program prefer, when possible, to have University-affiliated vocalists and/or instrumentalists perform “The Star-Spangled Banner” at home athletic events.

Introduction
Lineage specification and diversification are critical processes during development as cells with broad potential become restricted to specific lineages as they differentiate. This process has been best studied at the molecular level in model organisms, while comparatively little is known about human musculoskeletal development beyond anatomical characterization and analysis of core regulatory genes. The formation of the early limb bud is a complex case study in fate choice as lineage tracing experiments in mice have shown that Sox9 expression identifies a population of skeletogenic progenitors that can form cartilage, bone, ligament and tendon1,2. These fate decisions are dependent on local signaling cues and transcription factors including Runx23, Osterix (Sp7)4 and Scleraxis (Scx)5. Osteoblastic progenitors segregate out of the Sox9+ population first, followed by tenocytes and ligamentocytes. Skeletal muscle, unlike limb cartilage, ligament, tendon and bone, is not derived from lateral plate mesoderm, but instead arises from paraxial mesoderm6,7. Muscle progenitor cells identified by Pax3/78,9, MyoD110 and Myf511 delaminate from the dermomyotome12 and migrate into the limb bud7 where they proliferate and differentiate in coordination with the developing connective tissues. These studies have provided a strong mechanistic foundation of vertebrate skeletogenesis from which further analysis of human development may be performed.
Many of the molecular mechanisms that regulate development are highly conserved between vertebrates and humans, but there are also relevant differences between mice and humans that must be better understood for further advancement of regenerative medicine and cell-based therapies. Previous studies comparing human and mouse development in kidney13, liver14, lung15 and blood16 have all noted significant transcriptional and regulatory variance between the two species, coupled with high levels of conservation in tissue-specific gene networks. Given the significant disparities in growth plate development17,18, tissue thickness19,20, mechanical forces21 and potential for regeneration22,23 between mice and humans, we reasoned that a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying gene expression signatures that drive specification, diversification and function of musculoskeletal tissues during human ontogeny would provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of human development required for important therapeutic advances.
Here we implemented RNA sequencing to generate cell type-specific transcriptomes for chondrocytes, osteoblasts, myoblasts, tenocytes and ligamentocytes at 17 weeks post-conception (WPC) of human development. We then employed Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to define tissue-specific gene modules that represent each cell type. We next used WGCNA to evaluate how gene expression changes throughout human ontogeny and implemented differential expression analysis to compare different stages of human and mouse chondrogenesis in vivo, while also drawing comparisons between human in vivo chondrogenesis and in vitro pluripotent stem cell (PSC) differentiation. These comparisons, in conjunction with the tissue-specific modules, revealed transcriptional plasticity that decreases as chondrocytes mature, as well as similarities and differences in gene expression during mouse and human chondrogenesis. These data were supported by analysis of chromatin states, which demonstrated that cartilage genes accumulate activating histone modifications with increased developmental age or time in culture, while genes associated with other lineages acquire a repressed state. Finally, this coordinated analysis allowed us to identify integrin alpha 4 (ITGA4) as a marker of distinct chondrocyte subsets within adult articular cartilage, as cells which co-express bone morphogenetic protein receptor 1b (BMPR1B) possess osteochondral potential in vitro, are enriched for the skeletal progenitor markers SOX9, GLI1 and RUNX2, and have a transcriptional program suggesting increased proliferative capacity in vivo. Taken together, these data sets provide a unique resource to understand human skeletogenesis and importantly may contribute to the development of future tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications.
Results
Transcriptional profiling of fetal musculoskeletal lineages
To define unique and shared aspects of human musculoskeletal tissue specification and divergence, we employed a stringent cell isolation protocol based on flow cytometry followed by RNA sequencing. We first isolated cells from 17 WPC musculoskeletal tissues following overnight digestion at ambient oxygen: chondrocytes from the knee, myoblasts from the quadriceps, endosteal osteoblasts from the femur, and ligamentocytes and tenocytes from the anterior and posterior cruciate ligament and Achilles tendon, respectively (Fig. 1a). For all cell types, we gated out dead cells and the hematopoietic (CD45 and CD235a) and endothelial (CD31) lineages (LIN). Chondrocytes were sorted as BMPR1B+CD34−, as BMPR1B is highly enriched in the presumptive fetal articular cartilage and expressed throughout ontogeny24 (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Data 1) while CD34 identifies stromal cells. We isolated endosteal osteoblasts by selecting skeletal alkaline phosphatase+ (ALP+) cells25 (Fig. 1c). For muscle, we sorted CD146+ (MCAM)26 and CD56+ (NCAM)27 cells (Fig. 1d). For ligament and tendon, we sorted all LIN− cells (Fig. 1e, f).

For all populations, cells were isolated as lineage (LIN) negative (CD235a−CD45−CD31−). b Chondrocytes were sorted as LIN−CD34−BMPR1B+ cells. BMPR1B positively labels the superficial zone of fetal articular cartilage. c Osteoblasts were sorted as LIN−ALP+ cells. ALP (alkaline phosphatase) positively labels endochondral osteoblasts in fetal trabecular bone. d Myoblasts were isolated based on LIN−CD56+CD146+ expression. Co-expression of CD56 (red) and CD146 (green) in fetal myoblasts was confirmed by immunofluorescence. e Ligamentocytes and f tenocytes were depleted of LIN+ cells following digestion of anterior/posterior cruciate ligament and Achilles tendons, respectively. N = 3–4; scale bars = 50 µm
Hierarchical clustering of the 5000 most highly expressed genes across all tissues revealed large differences in gene expression across cell types, while a broad similarity in genes active in both chondrocytes and ligamentocytes was observed (Fig. 2a). This similarity was verified by a Spearman correlation matrix, which showed that gene expression in intra-articular ligamentocytes was most highly correlated with chondrocytes, followed by tenocytes (Fig. 2b). Lineage tracing performed in mice using a Sox9-CreERT2 allele demonstrated that cartilage, ligament and tendon can originate from mesenchymal progenitors identified by Sox9 expression at E11.5-E13.51. Our data suggest a similar phenomenon in human development and may provide insight into the timing and molecular basis for the diversification of these tissues.

Generation of human tissue-specific gene modules by WGCNA
To identify genes uniquely enriched in each cell type, we utilized Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA)28. Genes with similar transcriptional dynamics across tissues were grouped into modules; each gene can only appear in a single module, and genes that did not fit the broader pattern of any module were excluded from the analysis. WGCNA of human fetal musculoskeletal tissues defined 13 distinct gene modules (Fig. 2c; Supplementary Data 2). Of note, each tissue was associated with a module whose expression was primarily enriched in it, e.g. the brown module represents osteoblasts (Fig. 2c). We verified the accuracy of these modules by examining the module assignments of well-defined tissue-specific genes, including key regulatory factors such as SOX9, RUNX2 and MYOD1 (Fig. 2d). We also identified multiple Gene Ontology (GO)29,30 terms relevant to their respective modules (Fig. 2e). To facilitate further characterization of novel tissue-specific genes enriched during musculoskeletal development, we generated a table for each module listing membrane-associated proteins and transcription factors (Supplementary Data 3–7). In addition, we included GO analysis of each module to provide a resource for identifying pathways influencing tissue diversification and maturation. We also employed OPPOSUM31 to identify transcription factor binding motifs enriched in the promoter regions of genes in each module (Supplementary Data 8), identifying both known and potentially novel transcription factors that may regulate each lineage. Finally, as an example of the multi-faceted value of this data set, Hicks et al.32 defined novel myogenic populations during human development and PSC differentiation that enrich for engraftable, muscle-forming cells. Together, this resource presents unique molecular insight into human musculoskeletal development and will support future research in developmental and regenerative biology.
Transcriptional dynamics in human and mouse chondrogenesis
To better understand the molecular basis underlying human cartilage specification and development, we performed a longitudinal transcriptional analysis of chondrocytes across 4 different stages of human ontogeny, including pre-chondrocytes isolated from limb bud condensations at embryonic 5–6 WPC, BMPR1B+ presumptive articular chondrocytes24 from 17 WPC and healthy juvenile and adult BMPR1B+ articular chondrocytes24 (Fig. 3a). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (Supplementary Figure 1a) and hierarchical clustering of 15,000 genes showed clear differences across different stages of human ontogeny and also considerable areas of conservation, especially between the embryonic and fetal developmental stages (Supplementary Figure 1b). To better determine which genes were specifically enriched at each stage, we used WGCNA to define 9 distinct gene modules (Supplementary Figure 1c, Supplementary Data 9). Similar to our observations from hierarchical clustering, there are several modules shared between embryonic and fetal stages of development while single modules representative of embryonic, fetal, adolescent and adult stages also segregate in the analysis. Differential expression analysis revealed that the genes upregulated in the adolescent stage compared to fetal (Supplementary Data 10–11) have significant similarity (p = 0; hypergeometric test) to those genes enriched in adult cartilage compared to fetal, suggesting adolescent chondrocytes are strongly similar to adult chondrocytes (Supplementary Figure 1d, e). Despite these large similarities, the genes differentially expressed between adolescent and adult chondrocytes (Supplementary Figure 1d, Supplementary Data 12–13) indicated that adolescent cells are more proliferative while adult cells have increased levels of epigenetic and post-transcriptional regulation (Supplementary Figure 1f).

We next implemented differential expression coupled with GO and OPOSSUM analyses to identify genes, pathways and motifs enriched at each stage of human chondrogenesis. Comparison of fetal to adult articular chondrocytes (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Data 14) revealed that fetal chondrocytes evidenced active matrix deposition, a hallmark of the chondrogenic program. Conversely, adult chondrocytes were enriched for genes associated with metabolism, cell death and interferon signaling, suggesting that older articular chondrocytes have comparatively reduced matrix deposition. Comparison of fetal chondrocytes with embryonic pre-chondrocytes (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Data 15) identified a similar enrichment of chondrogenic properties in 17 WPC cells, highlighted by GO terms such as extracellular matrix (ECM) organization, cell adhesion and collagen metabolism. In contrast, there remained substantial transcriptional plasticity at the embryonic stage, evidenced by higher levels of transcripts associated with muscle, neural and bone lineages. This was corroborated by promoter motif analysis of embryonic-enriched genes, which suggested potential regulation by both neural (SOX2) and chondrogenic (SOX5/9) SOX family members, as well as the cardiac transcription factor NKX2.5. At the fetal stage, motifs for RELA and NF-κB were enriched, along with those bound by ZFX, MZF family members and SP1; genes upregulated in adult chondrocytes were also enriched for these motifs (Supplementary Data 16). Notably, binding sites for these three transcription factors were also enriched in the chondrocyte module (Supplementary Data 8). SP1 has been described to influence collagen expression33, while ZFX and MZF family members have not been associated with chondrocyte biology. Overall, these findings strongly suggest that embryonic pre-chondrocytes, although committed to the chondrogenic fate24, are still in the process of repressing genes associated with other mesodermal fates in a progressive silencing during development and maturation.
Our initial analysis of fetal chondrocytes compared to other musculoskeletal tissues revealed that many genes identified as important chondrogenic regulators through mouse studies were enriched in developing human cartilage, indicating there is a strong conservation of core regulatory components. To better evaluate our analysis of human chondrogenesis, we next compared these two species at the transcriptomic level. We isolated chondrocytes from E16.5 mouse embryos, a pre-natal stage where the articular layer is populated with permanent, resident articular chondrocytes34, and also from post-natal 2 month old adult animals. We then sorted LIN−ALP−BMPR1B+ cells for sequencing. Hierarchical clustering (Fig. 3d) and PCA (Supplementary Figure 2a) of all mouse and human samples demonstrated substantial transcriptomic differences between species. Human vs. mouse mean enrichment (Fig. 3e) and volcano plots (Fig. 3f) assessed as an aggregate of all stages demonstrate a normal distribution of gene expression and differentially expressed genes between the two species. Closer inspection of selected core chondrogenic genes (green triangles, Fig. 3e–g) revealed a high degree of conservation among these genes, with only one gene (Col10a1) > 1.5 standard deviations different than the mean (Wilcoxian signed rank test), suggesting the differences observed between species were unrelated to the core chondrogenic program. Differential expression analysis of genes upregulated in mouse chondrocytes revealed enrichment for WNT, AKT and MAPK signaling as well as cell cycle-related genes, suggesting mouse cells may proliferate more than human chondrocytes (Supplementary Figure 2b, Supplementary Data 17). Conversely, in human cells there was an upregulation of genes associated with oxidative metabolism and ribosome biogenesis (Supplementary Figure 2b, Supplementary Data 18). These findings support strong conservation of the core components of the chondrogenic program while differences in signaling and proliferation may underlie the disparity in regenerative potential between mouse and human articular cartilage.
Transcriptional analysis of PSC-derived cartilage
We have previously demonstrated that lineage-committed chondrocytes are formed fourteen days after mesodermal induction of PSCs24 in vitro, and to better assess how well this process reflected human development we profiled the transcriptomes of these cells compared to cells allowed to mature for 60 days in culture. PCA (Supplementary Figure 3a), hierarchical clustering (Fig. 4a) and Spearman correlation analysis (Fig. 4b) of both in vitro stages compared to chondrocytes isolated during human ontogeny suggested that although d14 and d60 cells are most similar to one another, d60 cells are substantially more similar to in vivo-derived cells (Fig. 4a, b). This was further demonstrated by comparison of the transcriptomes of d14 and d60 cells (Fig. 4c; Supplementary Data 19), which indicated that in vitro maturation is broadly similar to cartilage specification in vivo, as GO categories enriched at the d60 stage strongly overlapped with those enriched in fetal vs. embryonic chondrocytes. There was also a strong overlap of genes enriched at day 60 with genes enriched in adult chondrocytes (Fig. 4d). Finally, closer inspection of cartilage-associated genes demonstrated increased maturation from d14 to d60 and close resemblance to in vivo chondrogenesis (Supplementary Figure 3b). These findings suggest that extended culture of PSC-derived chondrocytes generates a highly chondrogenic population of cells that may represent a developmental stage between fetal and adult chondrocytes.

ITGA4 marks unique populations in adult articular cartilage
We next focused our analysis on identifying candidate surface markers of more primitive human chondrocytes. Our previous work24 identified BMPR1B-expressing chondrocytes as cells localized to the superficial and transitional zones of articular cartilage, known to contain cells with progenitor-like properties and enriched for the chondrogenic transcription factor SOX935. Here we aimed to identify additional surface markers that could yield further insight in human articular cartilage heterogeneity. Specifically, we focused on cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) that were enriched in both PSC-derived populations and embryonic chondrocytes vs. fetal and adult cells (Fig. 4e). Of the 30 CAMs enriched in embryonic vs. fetal chondrocytes, only one of these genes was also present in the embryonic module identified by WGCNA (Supplementary Figure 1c, Supplementary Data 9): ITGA4. We confirmed expression of ITGA4 during human cartilage development by immunohistochemistry, and observed a strong presence in limb bud condensations that became progressively rarer over time, consistent with our expression analysis (Supplementary Figures 4a–i).
ITGA4 is a member of the integrin family of transmembrane receptors. Like other integrins, ITGA4 forms heterodimers to signal, partnering with integrins beta 1 and beta 736,37. Upon heterodimerization, ITGA4 has been shown to be a receptor for fibronectin38; through this interaction, ITGA4 is thought to regulate cellular processes such as migration and motility39. Moreover, past research has identified a distinct population of more primitive cells capable of proliferation in adult cartilage based on enhanced binding to fibronectin35. On the basis of these data, and the expression profile of ITGA4 at different stages of human chondrocyte ontogeny, we hypothesized it may distinguish specific populations in adult cartilage.
Immunohistochemical analysis of human adult cartilage samples taken from the tibial plateau revealed ITGA4 is expressed by a small subset of cells in the superficial layer, while the expression of BMPR1B was broader, enriched in both the superficial and proteoglycan-rich transitional zones (Supplementary Figures 4j–n). Immunofluorescent staining for both proteins demonstrated small subpopulations of superficial ITGA4+BMPR1B+ and ITGA4+BMPR1B−cells, along with more frequent ITGA4−BMPR1B+ and ITGA4−BMPR1B−cells (Fig. 5a–d). Most chondrocytes, especially those in the deeper zones, did not express either protein.
ITGA4+ defines molecularly distinct subsets of articular cartilage that are enriched for osteochondral proteins. a BMPR1B (red) identifies many cells of the superficial layer of adult human articular cartilage. b ITGA4 (green) labels rare cells in the most superficial region of adult human articular cartilage. c DAPI (blue) labels nuclei. d Merge channels.

SOX9 (f), GLI1 (g), pSTAT3 (h), and RUNX2 (i) are all significantly enriched in BMPR1B+ITGA4+ cells compared to other sorted populations as calculated by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test. j The four populations of sorted pig chondrocytes were sequenced and differential expression analysis was performed in pairwise fashion. 38 genes are uniquely enriched in BMPR1B+ITGA4+ cells compared to all other population. k GO analysis of these 38 genes. N = 3; scale bars = 50 μm
After confirming similar populations in both pig and mouse articular cartilage (Supplementary Figure 5a, b), we sorted four populations defined by the presence/absence of ITGA4 and BMPR1B from adult pig cartilage (Fig. 5e) and evaluated protein expression associated with more primitive fetal chondrocytes and skeletal progenitors (Fig. 5f–i). Our analysis demonstrated that BMPR1B+ITGA4+ chondrocytes are enriched for GLI140, SOX92, RUNX23 and pSTAT341, suggesting that they may represent a more plastic sub-population of chondrocytes within articular cartilage. We next performed RNA-seq on each chondrocyte population; in parallel, we sequenced multipotent CD45−CD31−CD146+ synovial pericytes42. Pairwise differential expression analysis revealed that each of the four chondrocyte populations were highly different from synovial pericytes (Supplementary Figure 5c, Supplementary Data 20–23) but relatively similar to one another (Supplementary Figure 5d, Supplementary Data 24–29). Genes most enriched in ITGA4+BMPR1B+ cells compared to CD146+ pericytes included COL2A1, ACAN, COMP, SOX9 and other cartilage-specific genes that fall in the chondrocyte gene module (Supplementary Figure 5e), representing a highly significant overlap. Conversely, there was little variation in cartilage-specific genes between ITGA4+BMPR1B+ and ITGA4−BMPR1B+ cells (Supplementary Figure 5e), although we did note that the important proteoglycan PRG4/lubricin, a marker of the most superficial chondrocytes, was enriched in both ITGA4+ populations; we confirmed this finding by qPCR (Supplementary Figure 5f). We next asked if there was a transcriptional signature associated with the rarest ITGA4+BMPR1B+ chondrocytes. Overlap of genes enriched in ITGA4+BMPR1B+ compared to the three other populations revealed a small cohort of 38 genes (Fig. 5j) that is uniquely enriched in ITGA4+BMPR1B+ vs. all 3 populations. Interestingly, GO analysis on these 38 genes revealed enrichment for terms associated with the cell cycle, mitosis and proliferation (Fig. 5k).
To test for functional differences between these four chondrocyte populations residing within adult articular cartilage, we sorted cells from pig knee joints and cultured them for one passage; morphological differences among the populations were immediately apparent. While the double negative and ITGA4−BMPR1B+ cells displayed a typical chondrocyte morphology, the ITGA4+ populations evidenced a more fibroblast-like morphology with multiple long projections (Supplementary Figure 6a). Given this observation combined with the enrichment of proteins associated with skeletal progenitors, we assessed the osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation potential of these populations in vitro (Supplementary Figure 6b–d). As expected, all populations were chondrogenic, with the strongest matrix generating potential evident in the ITGA4−BMPR1B+ cells which were mainly localized in the transitional zone. Notably, ITGA4+BMPR1B+ cells were robustly osteogenic, while the other populations evidenced little capacity to form bone, in agreement with the robust levels of RUNX2 in these cells (Fig. 5i). ITGA4−BMPR1B−cells demonstrated minimal or no osteogenic and matrix-producing potential, consistent with their localization in the deep zone of articular cartilage and likely reflecting their terminal differentiation status. Together, these findings demonstrate that ITGA4 expression defines at least two subsets within articular cartilage: robustly chondrogenic ITGA4−BMPR1B+ cells and ITGA4+BMPR1B+ cells that are enriched for osteochondral progenitor markers and have a proliferative gene expression signature in vivo and osteochondral differentiation capacity in vitro.
Epigenetic regulation of in vivo and in vitro chondrogenesis
It has been previously demonstrated that the transcription factor Sox9 is master regulator of a chondrogenic network of genes in mice. The presence of Sox9 at promoter and enhancer elements strongly correlated with active gene expression and positive epigenetic regulatory marks43. Having defined the transcriptional program which distinguishes cartilage from other musculoskeletal tissues at 17 WPC in humans, we hypothesized that these genes are also highly regulated at the epigenetic level. Accordingly, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by DNA-sequencing (ChIP-Seq) across different chondrocyte populations, including fetal chondrocytes, adult articular chondrocytes and PSC-derived chondrocytes at d14 and d60. To assess the epigenetic landscape, we immunoprecipitated DNA/protein complexes with antibodies against H3K27ac, H3K27me3, H3K4me1 and H3K4me3. Together, these four histone modifications can be used to identify “chromatin states” at individual genomic loci or to find trends across the entire genome44.
We utilized ChromHMM44 to generate 12 chromatin states for all cell types (Supplementary Data 30–33). These states include active promoter (AP; enriched for H3K4me3 and H3K27ac), promoter proximal (PP; enriched for H3K4me1, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac), poised enhancer (H3K4me1 and H3K27me3) and polycomb repressed (PR; high H3K27me3) regions, among others (Fig. 6a). We first examined these chromatin states at a global level across the lineage-specific modules in fetal chondrocytes. Enrichment analysis of chromatin state distribution in promoter proximal regions shows an extensive level of epigenetic regulation with significant alignment with our expression data (Fig. 6b, Supplementary Data 30). In fetal chondrocytes, both AP and PP states are enriched amongst genes in the chondrocyte and ligament modules, while levels of the PR state are lower compared to all genes. Conversely, the PR state is enriched in genomic regions associated with genes in the osteoblast, myoblast and tendon modules, while the active promoter states are reduced across these three modules (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Figures 7b–d). This general pattern was consistent across cartilage populations (Supplementary Figure 7a). Of note, at 17 WPC the PR state is not enriched in the ligament module, which likely reflects the close transcriptional similarity between these two lineages at this developmental stage. Furthermore, closer inspection of loci that are known to be highly expressed in cartilage and are present in the chondrocyte module demonstrates very specific enrichment of “active” histone modifications, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, while the repressive H3K27me3 is largely absent (Fig. 6c). Conversely, the pluripotency genes NANOG and DPPA4 fall into the PR state and are enriched for H3K27me3 in fetal chondrocytes, while the active marks are absent. In undifferentiated H1-hESCs, the SOX9 locus has a bivalent signature as previously reported45; this state resolves to active as cells are directed toward cartilage specification (Fig. 6c). Taken together, these findings further corroborate the accuracy and relevance of our gene modules and affirm that epigenetic regulation is intrinsically tied to human fetal skeletogenesis. Furthermore, they can serve as a resource to guide future studies focused on understanding the epigenetic regulation of individual genes important for musculoskeletal development.

Comparison of in vivo and in vitro cartilage maturation
To further characterize the degree of similarity between fetal cartilage development and our in vitro differentiation protocol, we compared the genes differentially expressed between embryonic and fetal cartilage to those differentially expressed between d14 and d60 of in vitro differentiation (Fig. 7a). This approach identified a very significant overlap between the genes enriched at earlier stages in both systems (week 5–6 and d14) as well as those genes enriched later (17 WPC and d60; Fig. 7a). Using GO analysis we identified significant enrichment for terms such as cell adhesion and migration, ECM organization and disassembly, glycosaminoglycan metabolic process, cartilage development and collagen catabolic process at d60/week 17 (Supplementary Data 34). These data suggest that cells at these stages are generating substantial matrix and undergoing active migration and tissue remodeling. Conversely, the GO terms enriched at d14/week 5–6 were indicative of broader developmental potential, including terms such as epithelium, nervous system and cardiovascular development (Supplementary Data 35). In contrast to stage-matched comparisons, there was minimal overlap when comparing early and late stages (Supplementary Figure 8a, b).
In vitro chondrogenesis strongly resembles in vivo chondrocyte development. a Overlaps of genes significantly differentially enriched in early developmental stages (d14 in vitro and 5–6 WPC in vivo) and in later developmental stages (d60 in vitro and 17 WPC in vivo). b Inclusion of module-specific genes (chondrocyte, green; myoblast, pink; osteoblast, brown) defines the lineage relationship of overlapping genes in each comparison.

Representative images of staining for the indicated makers is shown. N = 3; scale bars = 50 μm
To gain further insight into the cartilage specification process both in vivo and in vitro, we applied the modules defined by WGCNA to these data. Comparison of the genes enriched early in chondrogenic cells (week 5–6 and d14) with the chondrocyte module (Fig. 2c) resulted in minimal, non-significant overlap. However, intersection of these genes with the osteoblast and myoblast modules resulted in strongly significant overlaps (Fig. 7b), suggesting that at this early stage of chondrogenic commitment, there remains a substantial level of transcription unrelated to chondrogenesis in both the embryonic limb bud and in PSC-derived cells. In contrast, comparison of genes enriched later in chondrogenesis (week 17 and d60) with the chondrocyte module presented a very significant overlap while there was little overlap with the osteoblast and myoblast modules (Fig. 7b). Taken together, these findings demonstrate the utility of the human fetal musculoskeletal gene modules as a tool for defining the extent and fidelity of an in vitro differentiation process. Moreover, our data suggest that the transcriptional promiscuity often maligned in PSC derivatives is largely representative of in vivo lineage specification during human development.
On the basis of our transcriptional analyses, we hypothesized that transcriptional instability during specification may represent a continued need for exogenous signaling to maintain chondrocyte commitment and/or promote maturation. Accordingly, we transplanted primary human pre-chondrocytes isolated at 5–6 WPC of embryogenesis (Fig. 7c) as well as PSC-derived cartilage-committed cells at d14 into the flanks of nude rats (Fig. 7d). Neither primary nor PSC-derived cells from these stages were able to engraft and form cartilage anlagens. However, week 17 primary chondrocytes (Fig. 7e) or d60 PSC-derived cartilage (Fig. 7f) were both capable of forming cartilage anlagens, demonstrating that cellular maturation is necessary for functional chondrogenesis. Interestingly, cultured d60 PSC-derived chondrocytes are enriched for ITGA4+BMPR1B− cells, with a minority of more differentiated cells expressing both BMPR1B and ITGA4 (Supplementary Figure 8c). This expression profile is typical for primary mesenchymal cells at the initial phase of cartilage condensation (Supplementary Figures 4a–f) while emerging chondrocytes also express BMPR1B24. Implantation of d60 chondrocyte aggregates into focal osteochondral defects in the rat distal femur resulted in robust engraftment and formation of COL2+ human cartilage (Supplementary Figures 8d, e) with appropriate expression of proteoglycans (Fig. 7g, h), although it cannot be excluded that some endogenous rat cells are present around the borders of the implant. We also observed expression of PRG4 specifically in the most superficial cells, with ITGA4+ and BMPR1B+ cells localized to the superficial zone (Fig. 7i–k, Supplementary Figures 8f–h), similar to the zonal architecture of normal adult articular cartilage. Importantly, the vast majority of implanted human cells became ITGA4 negative in vivo, similar to mature chondrocytes in the deeper layers of native articular cartilage. These data suggest that implanted PSC-derived chondrocytes receive cues from the local microenvironment for proper structural organization. Together, these findings show that in vitro chondrogenesis from PSCs closely mimics human development and represent an in silico “molecular scale” to grade the potential functional output from future differentiation protocols for cartilage and other musculoskeletal tissues.
Discussion
Here, we generated data sets to interrogate lineage specification and maturation during human musculoskeletal development, as well as during in vitro differentiation of human PSCs into chondrocytes. Our results demonstrate a surprising amount of transcriptional “noise” following cartilage specification in vivo, with genes of multiple musculoskeletal lineages undergoing progressive silencing with development. Generation of chondrocytes from PSCs was markedly similar, with cells isolated at earlier stages expressing many of the same genes from other lineages found during pre-chondrocyte specification at 5–6 WPC; additional differentiation in vitro not only mirrored the silencing of these genes observed in vivo, but also resulted in the generation of cells with similar functionality to human fetal presumptive articular chondrocytes at 17 WPC. Moreover, interrogation of these data sets enabled the definition of functionally heterogeneous populations in adult pig articular cartilage, including a sub-population possessing unique osteochondral potential. These results demonstrate the utility of this resource in understanding the normal biological processes that occur as cells undergo progressive specification and lineage commitment during human development.
Longitudinal analysis of human chondrogenesis across 4 unique stages provides a detailed picture of how chondrocytes are specified and mature. We identified a transcriptional program that is shared early in embryonic and fetal development and furthermore noted significant similarities between adolescent and adult cartilage, while also observing differences which distinguish the two post-natal stages. Two recent studies investigating human juvenile articular cartilage by microarray analysis identified a number of interesting genes that were enriched in the chondrocyte module (Supplementary Data 3), including UCMA, ETV5, MATN1 and MSMP. TFC2PL1, a transcription factor whose motif and expression are enriched in the chondrocyte module (Supplementary Data 3 and 8), was also identified. This gene was recently shown to be a critical target of β-catenin46 that regulates self-renewal and pluripotency in human PSCs, but its role in chondrocytes remains unclear. CHRDL1 was also identified as a potential regulator of proliferation in juvenile samples47. Although CHRDL1 was not enriched in our adolescent vs. adult comparison, our data also indicate an increased capacity for proliferation in adolescent chondrocytes compared to adult cells. Taken together, these data lend increased molecular support for the advancement of therapies utilizing juvenile chondrocytes (particulated juvenile articular cartilage, PJAC) in allografts to treat focal defects in cartilage48,49.
Analysis of our longitudinal cartilage specification and maturation data identified ITGA4 as a marker of a rare chondrocytes possessing more primitive characteristics than other cells present in adult articular cartilage. Integrins are known to be highly expressed in cartilage as they facilitate cell-ECM interactions. ITGA5, which along with ITGA4 binds to fibronectin50 following heterodimerization, has the highest abundance in cartilage (Supplementary Figure 3b); in contrast, ITGA10, which has previously been identified as a potential marker for chondrocyte progenitors in bovine cartilage35, has specificity for COL251. Interestingly, ITGA4 expression has been previously studied in human cartilage pathology where it was shown to be upregulated specifically in osteoarthritis (OA), while it was reported to be absent in healthy cartilage52. These data may suggest that ITGA4+ chondrocytes either proliferate in diseased joints or that ITGA4− cells turn on ITGA4 under certain conditions. Further studies will be required to elucidate the function of ITGA4 in development and disease, as well as the dynamics of chondrocyte populations in articular cartilage.
We and others have previously reported generating articular-like chondrocytes from PSCs24,53,54,55. Although Lee et al. assessed gene expression of PSC-derived chondrocytes by microarray at multiple stages of differentiation, these data were only compared to adult articular chondrocytes; cells cultured the longest were found to be the most similar to adult cells54. The concept that extended culture improves maturation of PSC-derived chondrocytes was also demonstrated by Craft et al.55. In the current work, we demonstrate transcriptional plasticity during in vivo chondrocyte specification and identify similarities with PSC-derived chondrocytes at two stages of differentiation by RNA and ChIP-sequencing. This molecular roadmap for chondrocyte ontogeny could accelerate tissue engineering and disease-modeling applications. Moreover, our data define a strong overlap in gene expression between ligamentocytes derived from intra-synovial cruciate ligaments and chondrocytes at 17 WPC suggesting chondrogenic differentiation protocols for PSCs could also be adapted to produce ligamentocytes for potential therapeutic applications.
The data presented here will serve as a foundation to understand critical molecular steps in human development. We have already applied these findings to directed differentiation of PSCs to cartilage for tissue engineering, and our collaborators have identified ERBB3 and NGFR from the muscle module as novel markers of muscle progenitors during human development and in vitro PSC differentiation32. These results support the necessity and value of this resource, which will continue to provide molecular insight for tissue engineering, disease-modeling and regenerative medicine applications.
Methods
General methods
For all experiments, biological replicates were employed to generate data. For experiments expected to yield large differences, standard practice of using 3 replicates was followed. All statistical methods are described in the figure legends.
Tissue collection and digestion
Adult human primary tissue samples were obtained from National Disease Research Interchange (NDRI). Fetal and embryonic tissue samples were obtained from Novogenix Laboratories. All donated material was anonymous, carried no personal identifiers and was obtained after informed consent. Sex of the specimens was unknown. Pig cartilage and synovium were harvested from pig legs supplied by S&S Farms. Human and pig primary tissues were manually cut into small pieces and digested 4–16 h at 37 °C with mild agitation in digestion media consisting of DMEM (Corning) with 10% FBS (Sigma), 1 mg/mL dispase (Gibco), 1 mg/mL type 2 collagenase (Worthington), 10 –µg/mL gentamycin (Teknova) and primocin (Invivogen). Mouse cartilage was digested for 3–4 h and then sorted.
Antibody list
Please see Table 1 for a list of antibodies and dilutions used.
Flow cytometry and FACS
For FACS, cells were blocked in 1% FBS in PBS or human IgG (Invitrogen; 1 µg for 106 cells) for 10 min before a 20 min incubation with primary antibodies. Cells were then washed twice in 1% FBS and stained with DAPI for viability. Populations of interest were directly sorted into DMEM with 10% FBS. 17 wk fetal cells were sorted according to Fig. 1. Adolescent and adult chondrocytes were sorted following digestion as BMPR1B+CD34−LIN− cells. PSC-derived chondrocytes for RNA-Seq were sorted as BMPR1B+CD166−. Mouse articular chondrocytes were sorted from 2 month old male B6 animals as CD31−CD45−Ter119−ALP−BMPR1B+.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
Tissues were fixed in 10% formalin and sectioned at 5 μm24. For DAB, sections were deparaffinized using standard procedures and antigen retrieval was performed by bringing samples to a boil in 1x citrate buffer pH 6.0 (Diagnostic Biosystems), and incubating at 60 degrees Celsius for 30 min followed by 15 min cooling at room temperature. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by treating samples with 3% H2O2 for 10 min at RT. Sections were then blocked in 2% normal horse serum for 20 min. Sections were then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in TBS with 1% BSA (Sigma) overnight at 4 degrees Celsius. Sections were washed 3 times with TBS .05% Tween 20 (Sigma) (TBST) before addition of HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 min incubation at RT. Sections were washed 3 times with TBST after secondary incubation and DAB substrate was then added until positive signal was observed. Sections were then immediately washed with tap water, counterstained in hematoxylin for 30 s and washed again with tap water before dehydration and mounting. For Hematoxylin and eosin staining, sections were deparaffinized, rinsed in tap water, and stained with Hematoxylin for 3 min. Sections were then washed in tap water, and stained with Eosin for 2 min before a final wash in tap water.
For immunofluorescence of human sections, slides were deparaffinized, and antigen retrieval was performed as described above. Sections were then rinsed twice with TBST and blocked in normal horse serum for 30 min at RT. Sections were incubated in primary antibody in TBS 1% BSA overnight at 4°C. Sections were washed twice in TBST before addition of fluorophore conjugated secondary antibody in TBS 1% BSA for 30 min at RT in the dark. Sections were washed twice in TBST and then counterstained with DAPI for 15 min at RT. Sections were washed once before mounting with anti-fade medium and imaging. Immunofluorescence on mouse and pig sections was performed with tyramide kits (Thermo) following manufacturer’s instructions.
Differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells to cartilage
Differentiation of cartilage from human PSCs was conducted as follows. H1-hESCs maintained by UCLA were cultured in mTESR media before addition of Mesoderm Induction (MI) media 1 (MI-1): X-Vivo (Lonza), FGF2 (10 ng/ml), Activin A (10 ng/ml), Wnt3a (10 ng/ml). After 3 days this medium was refreshed and Noggin (50 ng/ml) was added to MI-1 to minimize specification of cardiovascular lineage and Activin A removed to minimize endoderm formation. Cells were cultured in MI-1 with Noggin for additional for 4 days. Next, Chondrogenic Induction media A (CI-A) was added: BMP4 (10 ng/ml), FGF2 (10 ng/ml) for 3 days. On Day 10–11 epithelial endodermal, cardiovascular and hematoendothelial mesodermal cells as well as undifferentiated PSCs were depleted by Magnetic Assisted Cell Sorting (MACS) using CD326/EpCAM and CD309/VEGFR2 antibodies (Miltenyi Biotech)24. After MACS depletion, cells were recovered in regular culture flasks for 3 days in Chondrogenic Induction media A (CI-A) supplemented with Rock inhibitor Y27632 (Tocris, 10 nM), followed by Chondrogenic Induction media B (CI-B): FGF2 (10 ng/ml), SHH (50 ng/ml), BMP4 (50 ng/ml) for 3 days and transferred to a hypoxic chamber (Biospherix) and kept at 5% O2. At this point, ~200,000 cells were seeded in each well of an ultra−low attachment 96 well plate (Nunc) to form chondrogenic aggregates; After 3 days in CI-B, media was removed and transferred to Maintenance Media (MM): X-Vivo, IGF2 (10 ng/mL), FGF2 (10 ng/mL), LIF (50 ng/mL), TGF-β1 (10 ng/mL), BMP4 (1 ng/mL). At this timepoint (Day 14) some aggregates were harvested for RNA-seq analysis. Remaining aggregates were cultured for up to 60 days and then analyzed using histological techniques, FACS, Chip-Seq and RNA-Seq. Media was changed every 7 days until day 60. All growth factors were obtained from Peprotech and R&D Systems. H1 cells were routinely tested for mycoplasma during maintenance.
RNA-seq library preparation and sequencing
RNA was isolated using QIAGEN RNeasy Micro Kits. Prior to library preparation, RNA was quantified using Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and run on Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 for quality control. For primary human and mouse tissue samples, the Nugen Ovation RNA-Seq System V2 kit was used to generate double-stranded cDNA using a mixture of random and poly(T) priming. Kapa LTP library kit was used to make the sequencing library. The workflow consists of fragmentation of double-stranded cDNA, end repair to generate blunt ends, A-tailing, adaptor ligation and PCR amplification. Different adaptors were used for multiplexing samples in one lane. Sequencing was performed on Illumina HiSeq 2500 with single-end 50 base pair reads. Data quality check was done on Illumina SAV. Demultiplexing was performed with Illumina CASAVA 1.8.2.
For pig chondrocytes, library preparation was performed using the NuGen Ovation SoLo RNA-Seq system according to manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, Total RNA was treated with HL-dsDNase and first strand cDNA synthesis was performed. cDNA was then processed before second strand synthesis. End repair was conducted before Adaptor ligation. Libraries were then amplified based on starting RNA input. Strand selection and adaptor cleavage was performed before a second Library Amplification. Quality of libraries was assessed using Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. Sequencing was performed on Illumina HiSeq 2500 with a paired-end 100 bp run. Data quality check was done on Illumina SAV. Demultiplexing was performed with Illumina CASAVA 1.8.2.
WGCNA
Network construction and module detection were performed using default settings as described28.
Differential expression analysis
For human and mouse samples, transcript levels were estimated using RNA-Seq by Expectation Maximization (RSEM56). Reads were mapped to the human (hg19 or hg38) or mouse GRCm38 (mm10) genomes using RefSeq annotations. Transcript per million (TPM) expression estimates were transformed to log2(TPM + 1) to weigh against inflated counts. Pairwise differential expression assessments were performed using EBSeq57. For pig samples, reads were aligned to the Sus-scrofa_Ensembl84 reference using STAR aligner. Transcript levels were quantified to the reference using Partek E/M using standard input parameters; genes were considered to be differentially expressed based on a False Discovery Rate of less than 5% (Posterior Probability of being Differentially Expressed < 0.05). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was performed using DAVID; all p values listed are a modified Fisher’s Exact test (EASE). Heat maps were generated by calculating the log ratio expression value of each group versus the average expression value of all samples for each gene58. Two and 3-way Venn diagrams were generated using BioVenn59, while 4- and 5-way Venn diagrams were constructed using. Hypergeometric p values were calculated assuming 25,000 human genes.
Transcription factor motif enrichment analysis
OPOSSUM 3.031 was used to define motifs of known transcription factors enriched in sets of genes. Default setting were used for the analysis, with the exception of promoters being defined as 500 bp preceding and 100 bp following the TSS. Only motifs with a Z score > 10 and a Fisher score > 7 were considered enriched.
Western blots
Sorted cells were lysed in RIPA Lysis and Extraction Buffer (Pierce) containing protease inhibitors (Pierce). Cell lysates were then sonicated with a 15-second pulse at a power output of 2 using the VirSonic 100 (SP Industries Company). Protein concentrations were next determined with a BCA protein assay (Pierce). Proteins were resolved with SDS-PAGE utilizing 4–15% Mini-PROTEAN TGX Precast Gels (Biorad) and transferred to Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer Packs (Biorad) with a 0.2-µm pore-size nitrocellulose membrane (Biorad). Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk in 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBST) (Corning). Membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies overnight. After washing in PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBST), membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies (Thermo Scientific). After washing, membranes were developed with the Clarity Western ECL Blotting Substrate (Biorad). Histone H3 was used as a loading control for all blots. Please see Supplementary Figure 9 for uncropped scans of representative blots.
Chromatin IP
ChIP was performed with 10,000 FACS-sorted cells per IP using Diagenode Low Cell ChIP kit (cat# C01010072) according to manufacturer’s protocol. 1 µg of corresponding antibody from Diagenode was used per IP: H3K4me3 (cat# C15410003-50, lot# A5051-001P), H3K4me1 (cat# C15410194, lot# A1862D), H3K27ac (cat# C15410196, lot# A1723-0041D), H3K27me3 (cat# C15410195, lot# A1811-001P).
ChIP library preparation and sequencing
ChIP-seq libraries were constructed using Nugen’s Ovation Ultralow DR Multiplex System 1–8 (cat# 0330-32) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Library quality and concentration was assessed using Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 and Qubit (Thermo). Libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2000 platform. After initial quality control the demultiplexed reads were aligned to the human genome GRCh37 (hg19) using bowtie v0.12.760 with (-m 1 –strata –best –v 2) parameters.
ChromHMM analysis
A joint ChromHMM model44 was learned by using ChIP-seq data for H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K27me3 and Input for H1-hESC, H1-14d, H1-60d, Fetal and Adult. Data for H1-hESC was downloaded from the Roadmap Epigenomics project61 from:.
For the rest of the cell types, the aligned sequencing reads were pooled for all biological replicates for each mark produced within the study. ChromHMM default options were used to binarize the pooled reads while treating the Input reads as control. ChromHMM models were explored with varying numbers of chromatin states in the range between 2 and 16. A 12 state model was picked for our analysis because it was the model with the minimum number of states that captured a poised enhancer state, whereas models with more states did not seem to capture additional biologically relevant states. All enrichments in Fig. 6a (right panel) and 6B were calculated on base level as the ratio between the observed and the expected overlap between the corresponding pair of genomic features. The expected overlap was computed based on a random binomial model where the two features are treated as independent. The enrichments in the right panel of Fig. 6a are based on the genome-wide background distribution of chromatin states. The enrichments in Fig. 6b are based on the background distribution of chromatin states in promoter proximal regions defined as TSS ± 2 kb intervals at all annotated RefSeq TSSs.
Genes enriched for particular chromatin states (AP, PP and PR) in Supplementary Figures 6b–d are defined as genes whose promoter proximal regions (TSS ± 2 kb) have a significantly higher number of genomic bins annotated with the chromatin state compared to promoter proximal regions of all genes in the fetal sample. The enrichment is based on a binomial test at false discovery rate of 0.05.
Quantitative real-time PCR
Power SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems) RT-PCR amplification and detection was performed using an Applied Biosystems Step One Plus Real-Time PCR machine. The comparative Ct method for relative quantification (2-ΔΔCt) was used to quantitate gene expression. TBP (TATA-box binding protein) was used for gene normalization and expressed relative to a calibrator (sample in each set with lowest expression). Primer sequences used for qPCR are available on request.
Osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation assays
FACS-sorted populations were plated in DMEM with 10% FBS and expanded for one passage before re-seeding and addition of appropriate differentiation media (STEM-PRO, Invitrogen). For osteogenesis, 10,000 cells were plated in each well of a 12 well plate (Corning). For the chondrogenic pellet assay, 100,000 cells were added to a 15 mL Falcon tube (Corning) and spun down at 500 RPM for 5 min at 4 °C in 2 mL media. Cells were treated in differentiation media for two weeks with media changed after one week of treatment.
Alizarin red stain
Cells were fixed with 1 mL 10% Formalin for 10 min at RT. Fixed cells were then washed twice with PBS before staining with 1 mL of 2% Alizarin Red S solution (ScienCell cat#8678a) for 30 min at RT. Dye was removed and washed 5X with diH20. Alizarin red staining was quantified by addition of 400 μL 10% acetic acid to each well. Cells and solution were collected and vortexed in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube for 30 s. Samples were then heated at 85° Celsisus for 10 min before incubation on ice for 5 min. Samples were next centrifuged at 20,000 g for 15 min. A concentration of 200 μL of supernatant was transferred to a new tube and 75 μL of 10% ammonium hydroxide was added to neutralize acid. Absorbance was read at 405 nm with a plate reader.
Alcian blue stain
Chondrocyte pellets were fixed for 15 min in 1 mL 10% Formalin and washed twice with PBS. Pellets were embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 5 µm for IHC. Sections were stained with Alcian blue for 30 min at room temperature and washed twice with diH2O before imaging. Quantification was performed with the Fiji ImageJ package62.
Implantation of human chondrocyte populations
All experiments involving rats were conducted under the supervision of UCLA DLAM and USC DAR. Prior to implantation, primary pre-chondrocytes from enzymatically digested 5–6 week old human limbs were isolated using FACS and re-aggregated in ultralow attachment plates (Nunc)63. Fetal cartilage was dissected from 17-week old fetal tissues, enzymatically digested and re-aggregated for up to 48 in vitro. PSC-derived chondrogenic aggregates were generated as described above from a stable line generated in the Evseenko lab expressing GFP64. Primary and PSC-derived cell aggregates were then implanted sub-cutaneously into 6, 2 month old, athymic male rats (Harlan labs); no randomization nor blinding was used. 5 aggregates (~200,000 cells each) were implanted to each rat. Day 60 PSC-derived aggregates (2 per rat) were also implanted into full thickness - 1 mm in diameter—osteochondral defects generated in the knee joint of 6 athymic rats using the surgical procedure previously described by our group65. The chondrosphere aggregates were additionally fixed in place using EVICEL® Fibrin Sealant (Ethicon). After 4 weeks tissues were harvested and analyzed using histological techniques.

However, a business owner must also protect himself or herself when deciding on the layout. Therefore, one key feature for a nighttime parking garage is lighting. Fortunately, options exist that can save a business owner money and keep patrons safe, including LED garage lights.
Energy Reduction
Businesses with current lighting may replace current lighting with LED garage light fixtures for energy reduction. Firstly, the lights themselves use less energy than traditional incandescent bulbs.
Secondly, customers may choose motion-detecting LED lighting fixtures that only turn on for a designated time when they detect a person or animal moving.
Those who choose this type of light benefit from the energy efficiency they provide because it reduces their carbon footprint. Ultimately, this means the person is doing their share to help the environment.
Lighting Options for any Application
While lighting fixtures are available with motion sensors, you can also find LED garage light fixtures that are flush mount LED garage lights, meaning they rest flush with the ceiling.
Flush LED garage ceiling lights are the traditional lights people see when they’re in a parking garage, so they do follow suit with the trend. However, flush ceiling lights are protected from the elements more than standard lights.
They’re also more difficult for someone to destroy. Therefore, they protect the business’ investment.
Cost Efficient
As mentioned above, these ceiling lights are eco-friendly. While this is beneficial to the environment, it’s also beneficial to those who opt for this type of lighting. When compared to incandescent lighting, these lights use less energy, which means more savings for a business.
LED garage ceiling lights can protect a business while keeping everyone who uses the garage safe. Various options exist, so a business can choose the exact type of lighting they desire. Moreover, it’ll save a business money in the end by choosing LED lights from the start or switching to LED lights.
Takeaways
- The LED bulbs offered by Olympia provide energy reduction.
- This energy reduction then leads to cost efficiency, saving a business money on their electrical bill.
- Olympia provides multiple lighting choices to find the perfect one for your business.

Today we hear from Elizabeth Frederick, Chief Operating Officer at Avenues for Justice (AFJ), a New York City-based nonprofit dedicated to keeping youth out of prison. AFJ’s supervised program provides court advocacy, tutoring, and mentorship, and gets participants the drug, alcohol, and mental health treatment and job training they need to succeed. AFJ serves over 600 youths per year and more than 90% of its graduates never commit another crime. (Learn more about AFJ and its graduates’ success stories.)
Last fall, AFJ participated in Skills for Cities, Common Impact’s annual cross-sector, cross-company day of skills-based volunteering with nonprofits addressing urgent issues in their communities, like COVID-19 and racial injustice. We partnered AFJ with a team of six technologists from John Hancock, Blue Cross Blue Shield, and BNY Mellon to collaborate on a strategy to improve their donors’ and funders’ website user experience. AFJ’s site had been experiencing increased traffic due to the pandemic, so it was an ideal time to conduct a digital content review and make it easier for supporters to take action.
Tell us about your role as COO of Avenues for Justice. How have you led during the pandemic?
After being with Avenues for Justice for fourteen years, I was promoted to the Chief Operating Officer role on January 1, 2020 and was excited to implement an expansion. Unfortunately, the entire world was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic soon after and New York City implemented a quarantine on March 13th. At AFJ, we had to instantly close our community centers in Harlem and the Lower East Side, as well as our courthouse office. In a matter of days, we moved everything online, including doing participant intakes virtually. We also purchased and delivered laptops to nearly 100 participants’ homes. Many needed support learning to work digitally and their families were facing financial crises from losing their jobs.
To address our participants’ needs, I led an amazing team as we launched new, comprehensive online programs, including workshops, mentoring, and job certification programs in fields like digital literacy and construction safety to prepare participants for employment post-COVID. Additionally, our team launched HIRE UP, an online program that partners with companies to support our participants through mentorship, internships, and eventually permanent employment. On top of the virtual component, many participants experienced added instabilities at home. We provided groceries, supplies, and (in some cases) payments of rent and utilities.
To ensure our capacity to retain our staff and provide consistent support to youth, I led our Development Team in revamping our messaging and visibility in late March 2020, which increased press mentions, traffic to our blog, and donations from individuals, corporations, and foundations.
By the end of summer 2020, we fulfilled our original vision of expanding our program, just not in the way we had originally planned. We even served more youth in 2020 than in 2019 and, by working on an online platform, we were able to reach more participants in the outer boroughs than ever before. We plan to continue programs online as well as onsite at our centers.
In short, Avenues for Justice has been able to respond to the crisis with strategies that strengthen our programs and services due to the efforts of an extremely dedicated team and a very supportive Board of Directors.
At the heart of Common Impact’s work is a focus on alleviating inequality. How does Avenues for Justice alleviate inequality?
Avenues for Justice is rooted in alleviating inequality. We were one of the first ATI [alternative to incarceration] programs for youth in the country, founded in the 1970s by residents of the Lower East Side when the neighborhood was primarily Latinx and undergoing enormous stress from poverty. AFJ breaks the wasteful cycle of unproductive and repeated incarceration by foregoing it entirely and replacing it with true rehabilitation and second chances for youth and young adults by providing: court advocacy and supervision, preventive services, mentorship, educational and academic support, job training, and employment opportunities.
We work directly with young people to help them understand, accept responsibility for, gain control of, and direct their own lives in a positive, law-abiding manner. Our program serves youth where they need help the most: the streets where they live and the courts in which their futures are determined.
The Mayor’s 2020 Management Report states that 1,442 youths under age 16 were admitted to detention at a cost of $2,064 per day per youth. Since each youth spent an average of 29 days in detention, New York City spent over $86M on juvenile detention in FY 2020. In comparison, it costs AFJ just $5,500 to provide life-changing, 24/7 support to each of our youth.
Our most recent evaluation data indicate that within three years of enrollment, only 5% of our participants were reconvicted within New York State. By comparison, according to the New York Department of Corrections, over 58% of youth released from detention between the ages of 16 and 18 were re-admitted to detention within just three years.
It’s not difficult to see why many of the youth in Avenues for Justice’s two primary service neighborhoods get into legal trouble so young. In East Harlem, 72% of infants are born into poverty with 42% of children below age 18 living below poverty level. The adult unemployment rate in Harlem is 58% higher than that of Manhattan overall. In 2020, 60% of the population relied on some type of public assistance. On the Lower East Side, 36% of the population under 18 live below poverty level and in 2020, 49% of the population relied on some type of public assistance.
What have been some of your major successes and challenges over the past year?
I’ve mentioned most of the challenges we faced as we worked to continue all programs during a citywide and statewide quarantine mandate, but I’ll add that as a community-based organization, a few funders expressed doubt in our ability to survive after the pandemic. As a result, we increased our social media presence and began to create corporate partnerships.
I worked with our board to ensure their commitment to the organization and in the fall, they supported us in running a fundraising campaign focused on AFJ’s unique ability to meet the current moment. In four weeks, we raised more than $200,000 in flexible funding that we were able to use to serve our participants. In spite of the economic downturn, and through consistent outreach and communication to our community of supporters, we reached the end of the fiscal year with a healthy surplus – and over 50% of our foundation and corporate funding was from new donors.
We also experienced a significant increase in individual donations. The deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery renewed focus on criminal justice reform and people wanted to become more active and make a meaningful impact, including donating to AFJ.
Despite the incredible work that Black nonprofit leaders like you do every day, we know that BIPOC-led and serving organizations receive disproportionately less support in the form of donations, grants, and corporate partnerships. How can businesses and philanthropy step up to change the status quo here?
I so appreciate this question. Avenues for Justice has had BIPOC leadership continuously for over 40 years. Once again, we recently saw seven-figure grants awarded to ally groups – not BIPOC-led – that do similar work, but less flexibly and sometimes with lower success rates than Avenues for Justice. And we see large grants going to groups with large budgets. We, too, would have a large budget if this funding were available to BIPOC-led community groups.
Businesses and philanthropies have a duty to their community to support established local organizations that have been leading the work. They can accomplish this by making a concerted effort to broaden their network to organizations other than those they have typically funded. They can reach out to other organizations including civil rights and faith-based groups to learn more about local leaders who have proven track records of impactful work. Additionally, the philanthropy community can offer more flexible support to help BIPOC-led organizations build their internal capacity, funding areas like operations and infrastructure that are often under-supported. Finally, philanthropies can offer support by listening to insight from BIPOC-led organizations. By listening, they will gain valuable insight and perspective into the practices that work and the emerging needs in those communities.
Who is one of your favorite Black leaders or changemakers?
Stacey Abrams is the most underrated hero, a champion of democracy, the face of resilience, and the defender of voter rights in the most critical U.S. election in history. In her own words: “My being a Black woman is not a deficit – it is a strength. Because I could not be where I am had I not overcome so many other barriers. Which means you know I’m relentless, you know I’m persistent, and you know I’m smart.”
What brings levity to your day or work?
What lightens my days are the calls from our founder, Angel Rodriguez, and our court advocates telling me about a participant who has been accepted to three colleges or a participant who had a 50% attendance rate but now is an A student. We recently learned about a participant who was able to get employment while in our program and who used their bonus to get an apartment. The real-life stories of how our participants – given a second chance, along with tough love from our court advocates and the necessary supportive services – can change one bad decision into a positive trajectory, that’s what brings levity to my day..

The package contains of the parts below. Depending on how far you want to take it and how you work with improvements you might want to settle for the first two parts.
- Setting the stage and warming up
- What is an awesome team?
- Appreciative inquiry
- Mob writing: Mission and Definition of Awesome
- Are we there yet? Identifying the current condition and obstacles.
- Identifying candidates for first steps in reaching the definitions of awesome.
All of these usually take about 3 hours to get through (including breaks).
Setting the stage and warming up
The first thing you want to do is to talk about why you are there (you probably already touched on that in the invite) and why it is important that the whole team participates.
After that you will want to get people in the right mindset with some warm up. Especially if this is the first thing you do in the morning.
What is an awesome team?
In this part you can throw up examples of teams and ask the group if they are awesome or not. Discuss why or why not. You can find your own but here are some examples and points that you can discuss.
- The A-team
Cross functional
Have clear missions
Help each-other to solve tricky problems
… and like the A-team all teams need a crazy helicopter pilot. 😉
- Fellowship of the ring
A clear mission
Not that aligned on how to reach that mission
- Orchestra or a rock band
￼Specialists
Sound better when they work together
Practice really hard individually on their skill but also need to play and practice with other types of competences.
- Sports team (in this particular case Chelsea when they won the Champions league)
This picture tells the story about a sports team that were the underdogs throughout the kick out phase but managed to get to the finals. In the finals they met Bayern Munich and were again underdogs. In the end Chelsea had done all their substitutions and a defender got injured. Fernando Torres (a forward) took a place in the defense of the team. He went outside of his expertise to to what the team needed at the time and in the end the team won after overtime and penalties.
- People working out at a gym (compared to a sports team)
From the outside it might look like everyone is really busy and working on the same kind of thing (like a sports team). In reality there is little to no cooperation and everyone is only focused on their own goals/agendas. Do the team participating in the workshop want to be people working out at a gym or a sports team?
Appreciative inquiry
This warm-up is a segway into the third part – Mission and Definition of Awesome. The purpose being that the team members start telling each other what they think is working well from their perspective.
This exercise builds on appreciative inquiry where you only focus and talk about what is working well or what could be working well.
Stage 1
Ask the participants to write on post-its what is working well today. One thing per post-it. After about 3-4 minutes you ask the participants to present their post-its one by one and talk about what they have written.
Stage 2
Ask the participants to imagine that you have created a time machine. You all step through this time machine and travel into the future. Depending on what context you might want to select different amounts of time but it can for instance be a year into the future. In this future you walk over to the office and meet your future selves. They say that it has never been this great. Everything is working perfectly. You are productive, happy etc. Ask the participants to write on post-its what their future selves tell them and what they see around them. Present as you did in stage 1.
Mob writing: Mission and Definition of Awesome
The next part is to as a group agree on what the
purpose of the team is (Mission) and
what identifies them when they are working really well (Definition of Awesome) is.
Start by explaining the format
and the rules:
- Format
- You will have one or two sentences describing the teams mission. Try to make it snappy.
- You will have five (not more!) statements describing what identifies the team when it is working really well. The team can draw inspiration from the post-its on the wall from the previous exercise as inspiration.
- Rules
- Everyone participates Everyone can write, erase, reformulate… It is done when no one has objections or adjustments.
Invite everyone to the whiteboard and hand out pens. What usually happens is that people start adding statements without getting questioned. The magic happens when all five slots are full. Then the teams needs to start communicating, arguing and agreeing on what they think is important. Try to give the team as much room as possible but if discussions derail ask the team to move on the something else and then go back to pick up the statement discussed later on.
When the discussions are cooling down you can enter the group again and point at the first statement and ask if everyone agrees. Thumbs up = agree, thumbs to the side = could be improved, thumbs down = this is not ok.
When the team is in agreement move on to the next part.
Are we there yet? Identifying the current condition and obstacles.
So now we have identified where the team wants to be – the Definition of Awesome. Let’s figure out how to get there. Here we use the classic coaching format of identifying the target condition (Definition of Awesome), current condition, obstacles and actions/improvements. In the picture to the right the rainbows and unicorns is the definition of awesome. This is where the team wants to be. The five roads represent the five statements and the swamp is where the team is today.
Step 1: Current condition
In this step the team writes post-its describing the current condition connected to each track. These are represented by the yellow post-its on the picture.
Step 2: Obstacles
Here the team looks at what is preventing them from reaching the target condition. These are represented by the pink post-its.
First steps
In this part the team will identify how Awesome can be reached. We use a rotating flipchart style where you set up five flip charts or Magic Charts spread out around the room. Split the team and spread out among the charts. On each chart you talk about one of the definitions and what you can do to reach it. If the idea is complex you might want to use a Kata style approach – we put them on the upper part. Actions that are quick and straight forward are put in the bottom.
After about 5 minutes it’s time to rotate and you go to the next chart and discuss that. After four rotations everyone should have visited each chart/definition.
To have something concrete to bring back and to get started when right away when you come back to the office it can be a good idea to vote on one quick fix per chart to do right away. Assign people to take responsibility for each quick fix that are voted on.
Following up
After these exercises the team will have a lot of materials to drive improvements from. Bring it all back and try to make as much of the results visibal and present near the team. If you aren’t already using a Kata-style approach to improvements perhaps you can find some inspiration in this blog post: Toyota Kata – an alternative to retrospectives by Håkan Forss.
However you do it, the important thing is that you continue to work with the results so the time wasn’t wasted and just a nice experience in a conference room somewhere.
Summary
This set of exercises have proved to work quite well for me. Off course you might want to tweak them to fit the teams needs or add other exercises if you do this as part of a full day.
I hope this post was helpful and don’t hesitate to comment below or reach out to me if you have any questions or want help in facilitating a workshop.
Good luck!- Identification and Creation

Monarch Watch works exclusively with the eastern monarchs which live east of the continental divide.
Information & Resources for Western MonarchsThere are two geographically distinct Monarch populations in North America. The eastern population overwinters in Mexico and breeds east of the Rocky Mountains. The western population overwinters along the California coast and breeds in areas west of the continental divide. Contact between eastern and western Monarchs is minimal suggesting that there is little exchange, or what scientists call gene flow, between these populations.
In recent years, several people have transplanted migrating Monarchs between east and west to determine, if for example, western Monarchs introduced in the east would be found in Mexico. Many scientists are concerned about this practice and cite numerous reasons, such as the potential introduction of diseases from one population into another which is why this practice should be stopped immediately.Additional services

CIAT: Combat Intelligence Augmentation Teams
. These units form teams and act independently to provide Counterintelligence support, Collection Requirements Management, analytic and target support, and other intelligence-related support services to augment assigned military units, and other intelligence staffs and organizations.
Challenge
CIAT employs approximately 350 expert intelligence analysts who traditionally spend one year in theater supporting combat operations. Recruiting and retaining 350 analysts alone is challenging. Given the nature of the work, CIAT requires approximately 300 new analysts each year to replace outgoing staff.
Solution
While we do leverage traditional candidate-sourcing tools to identify a portion of our candidates, our greatest success is through our extended networks within the conventional and SOF intelligence community. But beyond simply accessing candidates, we have found that our values-based, people-first culture, benefits, and programs have activated a self-sustaining recruiting cycle, as our employees bring in their own networks of like-minded, highly qualified analysts. The analytic team is a strategic resource that, if treated with respect and professionalism, becomes a force multiplier in meeting the larger mission requirements.
We have developed a mature, streamlined process for recruiting, selecting, pre-screening, conducting pre-deployment training, and clearing our analysts for deployment into theater. We have a 100% success rate in clearing our analysts through CRC at Fort Bliss and we fully understand and have mastered the ITAR and export license process. We’ve also established a robust package of personnel care programs, medical coverage (for both the analyst and their trailing dependents), incentives, benefits, and career planning services to ensure our analysts can exclusively focus on their mission. This comprehensive program is scalable and sufficiently robust to meet the USSOCOM’s personnel requirements.
Results
We have successfully grown from 3 to over 50 in 8 months with 30% growth Q/Q. Of note, given our corporate culture and focus on whole-person employment, we enjoy almost 50% (and growing) referral-based recruiting. We have developed a self-sustaining recruiting cycle that reduces the overhead and expense of recruiting while ensuring high quality candidates due to the inherent peer review process in place.

The human tendency is to approach towards an uncanny doubt without having a complete assurance onto the matter. The same goes for the respect of investing in lands. Investing in land is a compelling action for some and a choice undeniable for the others. Investing on the ground has yielded a lot of options and benefits for investors from a lot of spheres, so if you are thinking about one, then don’t worry; this article will help you to find solid reasons to invest in the land right now to get the best.
The land is not a weak investment
Investing your option on the property is not an inadequate investment at all. First of all, it will yield you the profit right on time. It can produce income on the right source too. You can just sit there, and then you will see nothing happens. It is not flat out dull as you might get to hear from the other investors. Investing in land has its perk, which will take you time. You have to wait out for a bit to ensure that the profit is yield to you, right on time. If you are trying to make a decision towards success, then make sure that you have a sound mind and control before you try onto it.
Top reasons why you should invest in the land right now
Here are the main reasons for spending in the land right now.
- A Vacant Land needs nothing to be done
Once you have a vacant land on set for you, you don’t have to do anything with the property. It is like, you invest your option onto it, and then you are done with the work. You can start your choice by investing in the land right now and then sit back and then relax. Forget about all the construction and the renovation for the module. If you spend your source into vacancy right now, you don’t have to take care of the property details which are on it.
- Raw Land is a good investment
For every investor out there, raw land can be the best investment for them. When you are investing in property for the first time, then you can check to see that the natural area is filled with work, and the promise to yield you the better leaders will be right there. So investing in the earth right now can be a good start for a promising future that you want. Raw land means that you don’t have to deal with the vacancy work, mould, tenants, their pressure, and anything. Just a small investment and you are done.
- You will be highly motivated to sell
When you have vacant land, then investing your option onto it will be the right choice for you. You will be highly motivated to trade from all points. In many of the primary residence, you will find owners who have invested their options onto the vacant land, and now they are ready to sell their property to someone else. It is just like a work that can help you to get the best in return to what you want. With the help of the motivation to sell the property, you can get better leads as well.
- You will have a little competition to deal with
When you are a land investor, then you will have little to no game to deal with. Let us be clear here. In today’s world, the investment options on land are a complete farce. People are choosing to go for the other options since it can benefit them in the long run. So if you are a land investor, then finding the right lead for your competition is a no brainer here. Because the more you invest your options onto land, the lesser your game will get over by time.
- You can call your shots
When it comes to investing in lands, then you can call your chance. It is like you are predicting your future and then ruling it out with your own hands. It might be a compelling option for you, and at the same time, you will have an excellent way to get the lead to what you want. It is the best thing that you can find for yourself when you are investing in the choice of selecting land over others. And by being a landowner, you get to have your shots with the investment that is produced on the property bought.
- You can add a mix of finances and potential sellers for better income
Investing in land can yield more than you think. By adding the choices of the sellers and the potential financiers from all around, you can get to their attention and then market a need for yourself. It is like you are choosing the best for yourself and the land that you have invested in. You can bring a single parcel of land and then take your time to spend the same. It is like you are choosing over the line of work, which can help you to yield more and for the best.
- For the long term, the land is inexpensive
Investing your options in the area for a long time is the best thing that you can do. First of all, it is incredibly cheap. And secondly, you have the option to choose for the best when it comes to investing your choice onto land. Think about it before you make a decision for yourself. If you want to spend on earth, then you are getting a disposable interest every year. And since land is inexpensive, you can just decide to have it in your way as you want.
- You can always make more from it
If you are investing in land, then there is still the option of making more from it. You get to have more for yourself and the longer run. It will be a better option for you since you can get to have so many choices all at once for yourself. Investing in land is a compelling decision that most cannot take. So if you have decided to invest on earth right now, then you can go all in and get the work done right on time. Plus, if you have lesser competition in this field, then you have nothing to worry about at all.
The land is a limited resource
The top benefit of investing in the earth is that it’s a complete limited resource. This means that you can get to have the top options right at your lap for now. And with the competition which is readily not visible, you can get to have so many options right on time. There is a lot of land for sale in Colorado if you are a native there. Colorado is the perfect place for barren lands, and if you invest in one right now, then it can be a profit for your long term as well. It can help you to choose and select among the best and whatever can suit you. And also remember something. When you want to invest in land, then working out an excellent scheme might help you, so select accordingly.
If you have a poor credit score or an error in your credit report, it may affect loans or credit you apply for. You have a right to get errors fixed for free, and you can arrange this yourself.
Beware of paying credit repair companies that claim they can 'clean' your credit report by having information removed. This may not be true. Information that is correct, even if you don't like it, can't be removed.
What you can get fixed (for free)
Here are some of the typical errors in credit reports. You can get these fixed for free.
Errors by the credit reporting agency
The credit reporting agency may have reported your information wrongly. For example:
- your name, date of birth or address needs updating
- a debt is listed twice
- the amount of a debt is wrong
To fix this kind of error, contact the credit reporting agency. They may be able to fix it straight away or help you get it changed.
Errors by the credit provider
A credit provider may have reported information wrongly. For example, they:
-
To fix this kind of error:
- Contact the credit provider and ask them to get the incorrect listing removed.
- If the credit provider agrees it's wrong, they'll ask the credit reporting agency to remove it from your credit report.
If you can't reach an agreement, contact the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA) to make a complaint and get free, independent dispute resolution.
If you're struggling to get something fixed, you can contact a free financial counsellor for help.
What you can't change or remove
You can't change or remove any information on your credit report that is correct — even if it's negative information.
For example:
- All payments you've made during the last two years — on credit cards, loans or bills, whether you paid on time or not.
- Payments of $150 or more that are overdue by 60 days or more — these stay on your report for five years, even after you've paid them off.
- All applications for credit cards, store cards, home loans, personal loans and business loans — these stay on your report for five years.
For a full list, see what's in your credit report.
Avoid credit repair companies that claim they can clean up this sort of thing or fix your debt. They may not be able to do what they say. They may also charge you high fees for things you can do by yourself for free.
Paying a credit repair company is unlikely to improve your credit score.
How to improve your credit score
If your credit score is low, there are steps you can take to help improve it. You can:
- lower your credit card limit
- limit how many applications you make for credit
- pay your rent or mortgage on time
- pay your utility bills on time
- pay your credit card on time each month — either pay in full or pay more than the minimum repayment
As you do these things, your credit score will start to improve. So you'll be more likely to be approved next time you apply for a loan or credit.
If you're struggling to pay bills and are getting into more debt, talk to a free financial counsellor. They can take you through the options and help you make a plan.Versions Compared

Background
The onset of mental illnesses frequently occurs during childhood or adolescence. National data indicate that nearly half (45%) of youth ages 4-17 with serious emotional and behavioral difficulties do not receive mental health treatment. Among children and adolescents with emotional and behavioral difficulties that do not meet diagnostic threshold criteria, parents reported that 80% do not receive needed mental health treatment. Studies suggest that early mental illness symptoms reported in late childhood and early adolescence – if left untreated – are likely to develop into psychological disorders with long-lasting effects well into adulthood.
Traditional mental health services and coordinated care for youth have historically been provided at later time points, often after symptoms have worsened and have caused significant impairment and distress who experience these problems represent underserved populations and thus, are less likely to access or receive needed mental health treatment and services.
Research findings suggest that early intervention programs, similar to the Coordinated Specialty Care model tested in the Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode (RAISE) research project, are effective at interrupting the developmental trajectory of mental illnesses and improving clinical and functional outcomes for children and adolescents. In related areas such as Autism Spectrum Disorder, recent research suggests that early detection and referral to services lead to improved outcomes among young children. Several studies testing early intervention programs have reported that variations on the use and type of navigator models across a number of health care fields (e.g., cancer, substance abuse, cardiovascular care) have been found to be effective.
The mental health field has initiated the use of navigator models – primarily with adults across a variety of settings. In one model, the navigator serves as the primary mental health clinician and provides care coordination activities for adults with serious mental illness. Another model utilizes a navigator who is a health care professional with mental health expertise (e.g., care coordinator, case manager) who coordinates the needed care but does not provide the primary mental health treatment. A third navigator model consists of peer-professionals teaching health care self-management to adults, providing treatment monitoring and encouraging follow-up with needed services.
NIMH is interested in testing the effectiveness and implementation of a navigator model when delivered to children and adolescents as soon as symptoms are detected. Important knowledge gaps include understanding the key components of navigator models that:
Increase our understanding of navigator components that drive improvements in mental health care;
Identify and test tailoring variables that optimize the ‘personalized match’ between the level of need and available mental health services;
Employ innovative technologies (e.g., dashboards, digital tools, real-time analytics) to enhance engagement, monitor symptoms, match youth need to available mental health resources and evaluate treatment progress;
Identify opportunities to reduce disparities in mental health access and outcomes among underserved populations;
Enhance access, engagement, coordination and optimization of needed mental health services; and
Improve clinical, functional and behavioral outcomes for children and adolescents.
Research Objectives
The goal of this initiative is to develop and test navigator models that promote early access, engagement, coordination and optimization of mental health treatment and services for children and adolescents who are experiencing early symptoms of mental health problems. This initiative aims to test navigator models that: (1) identify and test components of family navigator models that drive clinical improvements in mental health care; (2) detect and interrogate tailoring variables that optimize the ‘personalized match’ between the unique mental health needs of youth to the appropriate level of intensity and frequency of mental health services; (3) utilize emerging novel technologies to track and monitor the trajectory of clinical, functional and behavioral progress toward achieving intended services outcomes; (4) rapidly engage and work closely with youth and family members over an extended period of time to ensure that therapeutic gains (e.g., reduction in symptoms, improved family, peer and school functioning and improved behavioral outcomes) are maintained and sustained; and (5) increase our understanding about how navigator models reduce health disparities.
This FOA is intended to support applications that test personalized navigation approaches that deliver the appropriate amount, intensity and frequency of needed treatment and services as symptoms wax and wane over time. NIMH requires applications to utilize innovative technology (e.g., dashboards, therapeutic milestone measurement, mobile assessment, sensory processing, digital tools, real-time analytics) to assist navigators in engaging, facilitating and optimizing personalized mental health care for each child and adolescent. When possible, applications should incorporate health information technology (HIT) and embed technologies in electronic health records (EHR) to coordinate care across delivery settings and enhance sustainability.
Navigator models to be tested may include but are not limited to the following: (a) mental health clinicians who provide evidence-based treatment directly to the youth and family and also serve as family navigators by monitoring coordinated care and communication with the other involved treatment and service providers; (b) health care professionals with mental health expertise (e.g., nurses, social workers, counselors) who are not responsible for providing the primary mental health treatment, yet serve as family navigators; or (c) paraprofessionals trained in mental health education and in the application of proven engagement approaches (e.g., motivational interviewing) who serve as family navigators. Each model will develop and test a set of strategies deployed by the navigator designed to promote early access, engagement, coordination and optimization the following components: (a) reducing systemic barriers to care (e.g., coordination of screening, diagnosis and ongoing care from a range of treatment providers); (b) delivering mental health information, education, and psychosocial support to caregivers and youth; (c) utilizing engagement strategies to increase treatment adherence; (d) utilizing novel and emerging technological approaches (e.g., mobile assessment, sensory processing, digital tools, real-time analytics) to match the unique mental health needs of youth to community resources and/or telehealth services; and (e) problem-solving challenges in accessing mental health resources (e.g., healthcare coverage, telehealth services, transportation, childcare).
A variety of rigorous methodological approaches are possible for testing the impact of the proposed navigator model. These approaches may include randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental designs with non-randomized comparison groups, time series designs, and other designs of equivalent rigor and relevance. NIMH strongly encourages the utilization of optimization research designs such as Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) adaptive designs or Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) factorial designs to identify and test components of navigator models that drive improvements in care. Considerations for selecting a research design for the proposed study include the scientific question that the study is designed to answer, practical constraints, ethical issues, and the tradeoff between maximizing internal and external validity.
Navigator training needs will vary among different models and applicants are required.
Responsive Areas of Research
Consistent with the NIMH experimental therapeutics approach, applications are required to provide a strong theoretical rationale for the selected targets or mechanisms of action hypothesized to lead to the intended outcomes of the proposed navigator model, measure whether those targets are engaged during the navigator intervention delivery, and design the study to test whether target engagement mediates the outcome of the navigator intervention (see Support for Clinical Trials at NIMH). PAR-21-130, "Clinical Trials to Test the Effectiveness of Treatment, Preventive, and Services Interventions (R01)".
Applicants are required to propose a navigator model that:
Identifies factors that facilitate sustainability (e.g., utilization of existing navigator programs, shared public and private funding, enhanced economic strategies), scalability and generalizability to other settings;
Utilizes innovative technology (e.g., dashboards, therapeutic milestone measurement, mobile assessment, sensory processing, digital tools, real-time analytics) to assist navigators in engaging, facilitating and optimizing personalized mental health care for each child and adolescent.
NIMH anticipates that studies funded by this FOA will substantially contribute to the development of the following:
A body of generalizable knowledge regarding effective mental health navigation models;
Identification of a set of research-informed strategies to improve care coordination;
Enhance our understanding of the impact of navigator models on reducing mental health disparities among underserved populations.

Applications Not Responsive to this FOA
Applications proposing the following will be considered non-responsive to this FOA and will not be reviewed:
Applications that propose to test the effectiveness of traditional therapeutic or preventive interventions, rather than testing navigator models that aim to identify components to improve access, engagement, coordination and optimization of services;
Studies that propose testing task-shifting or other approaches to deliver traditional therapeutic or preventive interventions by paraprofessionals or other non-traditional therapists – without testing navigator components to improve care;
Studies that do not propose testing emerging technologies to assist navigators to optimize the ‘personalized match’ between the unique mental health needs of youth to the appropriate level of intensity and frequency of mental health services.
Potential applicants are strongly encouraged to contact Scientific/Research contacts as far in advance as possible to discuss the match between potential research applications and current NIMH priorities.
NIMH is committed to supporting research that reduces disparities and advances equity in mental health interventions, services, and outcomes. Accordingly, this FOA encourages research to identify opportunities to reduce disparities in access, engagement, coordination and optimization of mental health treatment and services among youth from racial and ethnic minority groups, sexual and gender minority groups, or other underserved groups including individuals limited by language or cultural barriers, individuals living in rural areas, or socioeconomically disadvantaged persons.-19-027)..

Approach
To advance the goal of advancing research through widespread data sharing among researchers, investigators funded under this FOA are expected to share those data via the National Institute of Mental Health Data Archive (NDA; see NOT-MH-19-033). Established by the NIH, NDA is a secure informatics platform for scientific collaboration and data-sharing that enables the effective communication of detailed research data, tools, and supporting documentation. NDA links data across research projects through its Global Unique Identifier (GUID) and Data Dictionary technology. Investigators funded under this FOA are expected to use these technologies to submit data to NDA.
To accomplish this objective, it will be important to formulate a) an enrollment strategy that will obtain the information necessary to generate a GUID for each participant, and b) a budget strategy that will cover the costs of data submission. The NDA web site provides two tools to help investigators develop appropriate strategies: 1) the NDA Data Submission Cost Model which offers a customizable Excel worksheet that includes tasks and hours for the Program Director/Principal Investigator and Data Manager to budget for data sharing; and 2) plain language text to be considered in your informed consent available from the NDA's Data Contribution page. Investigators are expected to certify the quality of all data generated by grants funded under this FOA prior to submission to NDA and review their data for accuracy after submission. Submission of descriptive/raw data is expected semi-annually (every January 15 and July 15); submission of all other data is expected at the time of publication, or prior to the end of the grant, whichever occurs first (see NDA Sharing Regimen for more information); Investigators are expected to share results, positive and negative, specific to the cohorts and outcome measures studied. The NDA Data Sharing Plan is available for review on the NDA website. NDA staff will work with investigators to help them submit data types not yet defined in the NDA Data Dictionary..
NIMH has released expectations for collecting common data elements when an application involves human research participants. Details can be found at NOT-MH-20-067 and the NIMH webpage on Data Sharing for Applicants and Awardees. the Senior/Key Personnel proposed, is there appropriate evidence of their experience and expertise at collaborating with community practice partners/providers, consumers, and relevant entities? description of the sites justify their selection for involvement in the research?.
The NIMH has published policies and guidance for investigators regarding human research protection, data and safety monitoring, Independent Safety Monitors and Data and Safety Monitoring Boards, reportable events, and participant recruitment monitoring (NOT-MH-19-027). The application’s PHS Human Subjects and Clinical Trials Information should reflect the manner in which these policies will be implemented for each study record. These plans will be reviewed by the NIMH for consistency with NIMH and NIH policies and federal regulations. The NIMH will expect clinical trials to be conducted in accordance with these policies including, but not limited to: timely registration to ClinicalTrials.gov, submission of review determinations from the clinical trial’s data and safety monitoring entity (at least annually), timely submission of reportable events as prescribed, and establishment of recruitment milestones and progress reporting. investigators applicants

November 25, 2020 – The sharp increase in telehealth use during the pandemic is giving healthcare providers new opportunities to expand their reach. But how can they make patients – both potential and existing – aware of their new services?
The answer lies in marketing, a discipline not entirely familiar to solo and small practices and clinics that have relied on referrals, word of mouth and perhaps one big sign out front to build business. And at a time when budgets are stretched thin and competition is coming from all sides, a plan for promoting one’s services could be the key to staying in the black.
mHealthIntelligence recently sat down – virtually – with Jonathan Treiber, a digital marketing and technology expert and co-founder of RevTrax, to talk about how small providers should be marketing their connected health capabilities.
Q. What factors must a clinic or small practice consider when creating a plan to market new telehealth services?
A. “Some factors to include are how to streamline the paper-intensive new patient or patient data entry. This process automation or streamlining effort will pay off in spaces for both telehealth (and) in-office patient experience. Another key back office item is ensuring the proper processes for patient and insurance billing and reimbursement. One other critical component is revisiting the patient experience to ensure a professional, streamlined and efficient approach while ensuring the appropriate level of personalization and bedside manner, which is harder to translate into virtual telehealth.”

Treiber’s point is that telehealth isn’t just about connecting the patient to the provider for a virtual visit. The back end of the platform has to be as efficient as the front end, and it’s that part of the business that is often overlooked in the switch to digital. The result is a complicated billing or charting process that turns off staff as well as patients.
As well, the virtual front door has to be easy to open – patients have to be able to connect with staff, ask questions and make appointments quickly and smoothly, with a minimum of effort. A practice or clinic that advertises an efficient telehealth experience but provides too many hoops to jump through won’t see a lot of activity.
Q. Are there certain strategies to take into consideration when marketing to potential new patients as opposed to existing patients?
A. “The strategies that might work better in a digital arena involve digital marketing to attract new patients, such as Google ads for potential patients looking for solutions in a given market. Telehealth can be delivered anywhere, so healthcare delivery isn’t limited to the geography around a physical office location. Second, there are various programs (some gimmicky and some less so) with regard to social referral marketing and enabling a community online to foster patient affinity and capture word of mouth marketing, which is any physician’s best source of new patients.”
Today’s marketing goes far beyond the sign out front or on kiosks in the local shopping center. It has to be as virtual as the care offered, and connected to information channels that consumers use to find answers to their healthcare questions. Likewise, Treiber says, providers should take advantage of social media to build a presence – though those platforms should be carefully managed to avoid misuse.

Q. What aspects of a telehealth platform (cost, convenience, quality) should be emphasized in marketing?
A. “The goal is to market the service by offering the same quality of care with added convenience and lower cost/time. Some people will sacrifice quality for cost and convenience but the winning recipe is to ensure same or better quality while reducing friction for patients, such as travel time/costs and paperwork.”
Again, the experience has to be as advertised, so the practice has to be efficient with running a virtual office. And be sure to point out the advantages to virtual care – on-demand access from one’s own home, car or office, less time off from work or school, no need to travel, spend time in traffic, pay for gas and parking and sit in a waiting room.
Q. What should providers NOT do in marketing their telehealth programs (what are the common mistakes being made)?
A. “Providers should take a crawl/walk/run approach to marketing their digital platform. That means going out small at first to a small group of existing patients who will be beta users. Work out the kinks, as there will be plenty. Then launch with the current base of patients. It’s always better to test a new offering within the existing base. Next would be take the learnings around the patient value proposition and build a new marketing campaign focused on new patients. Start small, focusing at first on the current geographic market before venturing into other areas with the offering.”
READ MORE: Picking The Right Telehealth Platform For a Small or Solo Practice
A tried-and-true business plan, Treiber says, comes in small and easy stages. Hospitals and health systems will often test out their new telehealth capabilities by offering them first to a small group of employees or patients – that’s no different with a marketing plan. And be prepared to receive lots of feedback, and to act on those recommendations. The most important advice may well come from the first person coming through the virtual door.
Q. How should a provider measure the success of a marketing program?
A. “Success should be measured in terms of digital metrics such as conversion, sign-ups and repeat patients. Cost of new patient acquisition and, over time, an understanding of lifetime value of a patient – how much revenue can be generated in average from a new patient for as long as that patient is active.”
This is tricky, as a retail operation can’t always be measured with the same metrics as a healthcare system. But business rules do apply, and so it’s important to measure volume and activity in a virtual setting as compared to who’s coming through the actual front door. And while the bottom line may be improved clinical outcomes and convenience for the patient (and provider), one has to make sure a marketing plan is positively affecting those outcomes.
Q. How should a clinic or practice advertise its telehealth services against direct-to-consumer telehealth services? Against larger health systems?
A. “Individual practices need to focus on the experience and that practice’s own brand and personal touch. More diverse platforms that offer thousands of choices for practices will have to compete on breadth of offering. Individual practices need to focus on their niche to provide helpful and specific content to patients and offer a better experience.”
Treiber’s point is that competition is fierce. Large hospitals and health systems are using telehealth to reach into new communities, while retail clinics, pharmacies, community centers, and even online channels like Amazon are offering healthcare services. To survive in this new market, solo and small clinics have to focus on what makes them unique and preferable – such as a long-standing community presence and reputation, specialty services and feedback from patients – and develop marketing that stresses those advantages.
Q. How much should a small clinic or practice invest in marketing?
A. “This takes some testing and learning depending on how much it costs to acquire a new patient for a telehealth platform. The benchmarks out there vary wildly. A practice should be willing to spend about 10 percent to 20 percent of potential revenue on marketing. For example, if a practice generates $100,000 annually from telehealth, a marketing budget of $10,000 to $20,000 would likely be required to sustain and grow the practice.”
Again, this is tricky, and each practice or office will likely come up with a different business model. Most doctors have very little experience – and perhaps little interest – in selling themselves, so the advice here is to trust the business models in place and seek help from the experts.Even if you know Swiss Moraira already you will be surprised.

Norma L. Shapiro Memorial Tribute by Michael H. Reed
On August 8, 2016, Michael H. Reed of Pepper Hamilton LLP, as Pennsylvania State Delegate, delivered a memorial tribute to the late Norma L. Shapiro, former U. S. District Judge for the E.D. of PA, in the House of Delegates during the Annual Meeting of the American Bar Association in San Francisco. The following tribute is the full version of the abridged presentation by Mr. Reed…
Madam Chair, honored guests and fellow Delegates, I am truly honored to present memorial remarks for the Honorable Norma L. Shapiro, a great American, a great member of our profession and this Association and a dear personal friend. Judge Shapiro died peacefully in the presence of her three sons and other close family and friends on July 22, 2016 at the age of 87.
On learning of Judge Shapiro's passing, one former colleague on the federal bench stated that she was "passionately dedicated to the highest ideals of justice for all; resolutely entrenched as a fearless spokesperson and standard bearer in the legal profession; firmly respected and honored for her keen intellect; but most of all, greatly cherished and remembered as a dear, dear friend."
In 2003, former ABA President Jerome J. Shestack, wrote a tribute to Judge Shapiro in which he borrowed from Judged Learned Hand, who, speaking of Justice Brandeis, once said that a person's life "like a piece of tapestry, is made up of many strands which interwoven make a pattern;" to separate a single strand risks an injustice to the beauty of the whole. Jerry went on to say that his brief tribute to Judge Shapiro could hardly do justice to the content of so full and rich a life. It is impossible to do justice to Judge Shapiro in a short tribute.
Norma Sondra Levy was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on July 27, 1928. Her father sold furniture and her mother was a teacher. She received a BA from Michigan in 1948 and a J.D. from Penn Law School in 1951. While in law school, Norma married Bernard Shapiro, a doctor of nuclear medicine, who was her constant and beloved companion until his death in 2007. They had 3 sons, Finley, Neil and Aaron, and 7 grandchildren. After law school, Norma clerked for the Honorable Horace Stern of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. She then served a fellowship in criminal law at Penn and was in private practice in Philadelphia from 1956 to 1978.
On the nomination of President Jimmy Carter, Norma was confirmed by the United States Senate on August 11, 1978 as a member of the United States District for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. She assumed senior status on December 31, 1998 and served faithfully and diligently on that Court until her death.
Her career was marked by many firsts. She was the first woman to serve as a law clerk on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court; the first woman partner at the Dechert firm; the first woman to serve as a member, and later as chair, of the Board of Governors of the Philadelphia Bar Association; and the first woman to serve as a judge on any federal court in the Third Circuit.
In reviewing her life, it is hard to believe that a single person could have done so many things and excelled at all of them.
The most important roles in her life were those of wife to her best friend Bernie, mother to her 3 sons and grandmother to her 7 grandchildren. Judge Shapiro interrupted her career for 9 years to be a full-time homemaker. One of her grandsons noted at her funeral that Judge Shapiro kept track of the record and schedule of the basketball team on which he played and frequently attended games.
Judge Shapiro chaired the board of directors of an arts foundation; served as president of a local school board; served as an overseer of Penn Law School; and served as an officer or trustee of various other charities.
As a judge, she handled many important cases, including Harris v. City of Philadelphia, a dispute regarding overcrowded prison conditions that lasted for 18 years, resulted in a prison cap and ended with a consent decree that included the construction of new prison facilities. She was tough but fair. Famous boxing promoter Don King, in explaining his refusal to violate a gag order issued by Judge Shapiro, explained "What Judge Norma wants, Judge Norma gets."
Judge Shapiro loved her work and performed it diligently. In October, 2014, a study conducted by Syracuse University reported that Senior Judge Norma L. Shapiro, then 85, had ranked 10 on the list of nearly 1,000 federal district judges for the number of cases closed in the year ending June 30, 2014. While in the hospital and in rehab prior to her death, Judge Shapiro, assisted by her loyal and dedicated assistant Madeline Ward, continued to perform judicial functions.
Judge Shapiro's loyalty and dedication to this Association is well known. One former colleague stated that "she loved the ABA because she saw it as a means by which we could collaborate on important projects and work to right many social ills." Among other recognitions, she received the ABA's John Marshall Award, in recognition of her dedication to the improvement of the administration of justice; the Meador-Rosenberg Award for her outstanding work in support of the judiciary and judicial independence; the Margaret Brent Women Lawyers of Achievement Award; and an ABA Presidential Citation.
She served with distinction on the Board of Governors and served as a member of this House for 15 years, representing the Judicial Division, the National Conference of Federal Trial Judges and the National Association of Women Judges. She also chaired various entities of this Association, including the Judicial Division and the former Standing Committee on Federal Judicial Improvements. She was part of the institutional memory and DNA of the ABA.
When Judge Shapiro received the Philadelphia Bar Association's first Sandra Day O'Connor Award in 2003, Justice O'Connor noted that "As her career progressed, Judge Shapiro's light continued to shine in dark corners where women never before had traveled." Another former judicial colleague said that Judge Shapiro "broke through many glass ceilings" and was a "great role model."
In May of this year, Judge Shapiro received the Anne X. Alpern Award from the Pennsylvania Bar Association, which is presented to a female lawyer or judge who demonstrates excellence in the legal profession and who makes a significant professional impact on woman in the law. This award was named for a Pennsylvania lawyer who became the first woman state attorney general in the nation. In her acceptance remarks, Judge Shapiro noted that Anne Alpern had been one of her mentors.
It was, therefore, very fitting that Judge Shapiro, herself a legendary mentor and role model for many people, especially women lawyers, should receive an award named after one of her mentors.
In conclusion, Judge Norma L. Shapiro was a trailblazing lawyer and judge; a leader in our profession and in this Association; a mentor and role model for many; and a beloved wife, mother, grandmother, friend and colleague. She will be greatly missed. Thank you.Many professional sectors have been severely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic since early 2020. Moreover, law enforcement officers and health professionals such as medical doctors, nurses, emergency response teams, other health technicians, etc. -who are the backbone of any ‘efficient response’ during this COVID-19 outbreak worldwide-, have been progressively hit.
The upcoming Epiwrist activity smart device should monitor the user’s cough, body temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and co-oximeter smoke detector. Additionally, heart rate, sleep, steps activity will be synchronized with HEpiTracker which monitors pandemic-related symptoms. Artificial intelligence algorithms generate daily automatic reports by center, service and job category.
The device settings generate grouped key daily symptom ratings and individual summary results. Additionally, pooled data are sent to a server which, through artificial intelligence algorithms, manage easy-to-understand infographic reports, that should enable hospital directors to periodically monitor the spread of infectious diseases in nearly real-time within each hospital/clinical center and determine any interventions. Epiwrist includes a movement gyroscope sensor and spatial data, synchronized with our HEpiTracker App which obtains further information from users to design and implement clinical measures and strategies with a critical objective: to contain the spread of any infectious disease.
Our SOLUTION: Efficient response to track symptoms of COVID-19, other diseases, and epidemics with artificial intelligence and R&D tools.
What is it and what does it? The combined Epiwrist activity smart device and the HEpiTracker App -both synchronized- are aimed to collect in nearly real-time, and in a daily basis data to thoroughly assess any pandemic and other infectious diseases health risks, depending on the user’s health profile by implementing intuitive clinical questionnaires and several other external tools and actions to identify the spread of COVID-19 and/or upcoming epidemics and better design effective health interventions tailored to suit the needs of the user and/or patients to be reviewed.
Processes and technology: As a proof of concept, HEpiTracker App is a mobile app to help monitor the spread of COVID-19 within hospitals. Following initial discussions and ethical approval, a stepwise approach has been carried out by software developers to create a unique version of an innovative app and then to enhance its functionalities regularly. After several iterations, a minimum set of variables to include in the HEpiTracker App were identified, including demographic and occupational data, symptoms, previous comorbidities, and lab testing variables.
Type of data (synopsis): Epiwrist has a variety of sensors suitable for collecting data such as coughing, body temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation/oximeter, cough covering method and number of times the user is washing his/her hands on a daily basis. The data can be used to predict numerous health conditions.
Final goal and targets: The ultimate goal of this innovative initiative is to assist those in critical need to control COVID-19 and upcoming infectious diseases to address challenges in nearly real-time as well as to find effective solutions for tackling growing global health threats. It constitutes a sustainable project with a powerful impact in the global health system with a complementary business channel while developing international clinical trials. A percentage of the benefits from the global commercialization of the final product should be transferred to cooperation and development actions aligned with the Agenda 2030 in developing countries most affected with COVID-19.
Target audience / beneficiaries: in a first stage, our beneficiaries are the hospital workforce, health centers’ professionals as well as the law enforcement officers. In further stages, beneficiaries could include specific personnel providing public services (primary care, educational centres) and vulnerable populations (migrant centres, inmates, etc.).

I love that movie, and the whole genre of science-fiction as a whole. It had a big influence on me developing a love of science as a kid. Though, it was not The Thing that I was watching as a kid. Movies like Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and Back to the Future were what I was watching.
All that said, this site is me posting on what’s really grabbing me about science and science-fiction, but probably more science most of the time. My name is Patrick K. Taylor and I’m a PhD student in microbiology. I have a particular fascination with the molecular machinery of cells and how that microscopic world ticks away to determine our macro world. Being a scientist, I have a desire to talk about and communicate science with others and that’s what this blog will be about.What a scandal. Bloated material costs, bloated construction costs, dull designs, obstructive and inefficient consenting, obstructive financing, wrong-headed urban planning, neglected infrastructure, neglected trade training, fear of innovation, environmental idiocy – and we’ve been building the wrong houses: expensive houses, when we needed them good and cheap.
The government abandoned fit-for-purpose housing policies 35 years ago and the result has been social vandalism on a massive scale.
We built more homes per year in the 1970s. Not more per capita. More fullstop. If we’d kept up, especially with state houses, now called social housing, families today would routinely live in warm, dry homes. We would think of it, proudly, as a bedrock of citizenship and every other social measure would be vastly improved because of it.
Now, finally, there is change. Statistics NZ says more than 13,000 new homes were consented in Auckland last year, up 25 per cent up on the year before and four times as many as in 2009: a low point bequeathed to us by the last Labour Government.
The new Government is now building at “pace and scale”, as Housing and Urban Development Minister Phil Twyford likes to say.
But his mantra does not include innovation, quality, community-led or future-focused. Twyford does talk about these other values, but there’s a real risk “pace and scale” will drive them out.
The barriers to comprehensive change are immense.
It can easily cost a headache-inducing $5000sq m to build a house in Auckland. That will include an eye-bleeding amount for the land and compliance costs that will probably make you want to scream.
The problems are not being ignored. Many firms – architects, designers, builders, inventors, social innovators – are working on new design-and-build solutions. Council pre-consenting now allows developers to avoid some compliance demands if they can show their big project is just like another big project.
Good to know. But at the same time, the council is turning down inner-city projects for lack of carparking, even though the prospective residents don’t want to own a car.
Is it any wonder the Government’s new Housing and Urban Development Authority (HUDA) will take consenting for the big projects away from the council?
Still, more doesn’t mean better and we are not really talking transformation yet. Here’s my quick and dirty eight-point plan to kick that along.
1. Enable the not-for-profits.
Housing groups, iwi, urban Māori authorities, community services groups and others need better financing and more help with capacity and compliance issues. They are at the heart of the communities the Government wants to help.
John Tamihere at Te Whānau o Waipareira in Henderson has been saying it and so have many others. There’s some great work being done, but they’re desperate to do more.
2. Build more social houses.
The Government is committed to mixed development: if they remove 50 decrepit old state houses they might build 300 new homes, with 60 of them social housing, and you can’t always tell by looking.
That’s a good plan, because it minimises the risk that you’re building the slums of the future. But it slows down the provision of social housing where the need is greatest. Perhaps a higher proportion of social housing should be mandated.
3. Raise the enviro standards.
The Government was supposed to have the environmental shortcomings of the Building Code sorted by the end of the year, but it hasn’t happened. Tens of thousands of homes, including KiwiBuild homes, are not being built to the standards of energy efficiency and sustainability we all know will be needed in the years ahead.
A framework for fixing this – the Green Building Council’s Green Star system – is available. The delay is ridiculous. Please tell us we won’t have to wait another year while HUDA is set up.
4. Implement universal design.
This is the phrase for designs that cater for everyone, young and old, however able or disabled you are. Usually, it’s an add-on and it just adds costs. But if you address the issue from the start, with your basic design, the construction cost implications are low and the long-term savings are high.
Addressing those four issues well could disrupt the housing sector. But there’s more, and it’s much bigger.
5. Fabulous prefabs.
New construction technologies and materials are here now and more are on their way: prefab homes will profoundly change the way we build. But horror stories abound of the obfuscation and timidity shown by regulators who are not keeping up and often don’t seem to want to.
That’s one of the biggest jobs for HUDA, right there: changing the officials’ culture so we can have the construction revolution.
6. Small homes.
Same story: regulators have just not kept up. Did you know the easiest way to put a small house on a section is to put it on wheels? Technically, that makes it a housetruck. What nonsense.
7. The apartment block is a village.
Families, the elderly, single people, groups of friends, all living in the same building with health services, communal areas for recreation and maybe dining, maybe a school, definitely a garden on the roof.
It’s the village model, now being re-established at hapū level by some iwi, and it’s definitely relevant to the inner city.
8. More girls.
How transformative, for the better, for the whole of society, would it be to turn construction into an industry dominated by women? We could be starting that in schools right now.
By the way, Phil Twyford says his new HUDA needs a better name. True that. It’s going to oversee all of this and it should not become a bureaucratic megalith like some government departments we could all name.
HUDA has to provide the actively engaged framework within which communities can grow strong and proud. How about calling it Wharenui?

6/20/2017
HARRISBURG – The state House of Representatives has unanimously approved Rep. Frank Ryan’s (R-Lebanon) measure recognizing the founding of the United States Marine Corps.
A retired Marine Reserve colonel, Ryan reminded his colleagues that the Corps was founded as the Continental Marines by a resolution passed by the Second Continental Congress on Nov. 10, 1775.
“The birth of the Marine Corps was to augment naval forces and the Tun Tavern on Water Street in Philadelphia, which was the original recruiting headquarters and is considered the Marine Corps’ birthplace,” Ryan said. “The Marine Corps has fought with great courage on six continents and in every conflict in American history. They have fought valiantly in defense of the United States and its citizens and principles. The Corps also supports peacekeeping missions and humanitarian operations in numerous countries.”
The passage of Ryan’s resolution establishes Nov. 10, 2017, as “Marine Corps Day” in Pennsylvania in honor of the United States Marine Corps’ birthday.
As a Marine Reserve officer, Ryan was recalled to active duty in December 2004 and served with Multi-National Force-Iraq until June 2005. Prior to his initial retirement in 2002, Ryan served as the Central Command Special Operations Officer during Operation Enduring Freedom.

,bengali pronAs discussed in the previous article about the “b2b marketplace pricing strategy“.We are going to discuss supplier registration and onboarding into a b2b marketplace.
What is B2B Marketplace Supplier Onboarding?
In b2b marketplaces, there are a couple of requirements that need to be fulfilled by the supplier. Those facts are critical for the b2b marketplaces. Example-
- Tax information,
- Supplier identity documents,
- Various certifications,
- Capital investment,
- Company/ Factory size,
- Trade capacity,
- Production capacity,
and many other factors. As an example screenshot from alibaba.com.
As you can see supplier have various attributes and information. Hence, which is critical for the supplier onboarding into the b2b marketplaces like Alibaba.
So If you are creating a b2b multi-vendor marketplace then it is highly required that your supplier registration should be super smooth.
B2b Marketplace supplier Registration and Microsite
Thus, every b2b business is unique in nature. It is highly recommended that seller signup should be highly customizable. However, a unique registration form for all the vendors may not work in b2b eCommerce.
Example –
Supplier A / Vendor A – who is working in the garment industry
Supplier B/ Vendor B – Who is working in Auto parts industry
So, as you can understand that both the industries are very different so their business information may vary a lot as well.
B2b Ecommerce – Private and Public Information
This is also possible that some of the information. However, it is only available for the marketplace. Whereas, not for the public users.
So this is highly critical that your supplier information attributes must have those configurations.
Webkul is the largest supplier of b2b marketplaces in the world. Hence, let us know if you have any further queries for b2b marketplaces.
Support
That’s all for B2B Marketplace Supplier Onboarding still have any issues feel free to add a ticket and let us know your views to make the module better contact us.Onaka woman with kidney, ovarian cancer reluctantly asks for help
“I’ve been worse.”
It’s an answer you don’t typically expect from someone undergoing chemotherapy for Stage IV cancer, but for Renee Morgan of Onaka, it’s pretty standard.
“If you sit and mope around about something the rest of your life you’re not going to get anywhere,” she said by phone March 29. “I’d rather look at what I have and what I’ve been through and see how far I’ve come. And not look back unless it’s to learn from something.”
“This was a huge shock,” her husband Richard Morgan said. “She said the only thing we can do about it is to face it head on, and that everybody eventually passes away. And I said, ‘But you’re so young yet and I want us to have many more quality years together.’”
Stage IV cancer has spread from where it started to another organ.
At 61, Renee Morgan never expected to be in her current position. She was given the bad news about her cancer in November 2018, after going to the doctor for a pain in her stomach. She was diagnosed with kidney and ovarian cancer, had three rounds of chemotherapy, then prepared for surgery on Jan. 23. One kidney, her appendix, her omentum and all of her female organs were removed.
To top it all off, the couple is now more than $42,000 in the hole. Bills don’t stop coming even when they’re not payable.
“I don’t know what we’re going to do if we don’t get the money,” Richard Morgan said.
The good news is that Renee Morgan’s cancer is not life-threatening, and she’s been steadily improving with treatment. She was even dubbed a “rockstar” by her doctors in Sioux Falls. Still, the black cloud of debt looms profoundly over the Morgans, making it hard to process even the happiest of news.
Even with solid insurance, Richard Morgan said, his wife’s lost wages and medical bills are weighing heavily on the couple.
Reluctantly, the couple set up a GoFundMe account for support.
“I’m not someone who likes to ask for help,” Renee Morgan said. “In the beginning, I kept saying, ‘No, we don’t really need it, we’ll manage, we’ll manage.’ ... After the bills started pouring in, we really didn’t have much of a choice.”
As of Thursday afternoon, the Morgans had raised $855. But that doesn’t pay many medical bills.
Until her diagnosis, Morgan was working in the production area at American Milk Producers Inc., pulling nine- to 12-hour shifts and lifting blocks of cheese as heavy as 25 pounds. She’s used to manual labor, but the treatments have been both physically and mentally difficult.
“I get tired and I still want to do everything that I’d do before,” she said. “I would love to be able to get up and be able to carry on a normal life.”
Part of wanting to go back to work has to do with the money, of course. But mostly, the Morgans would like to get back to their normal, which doesn’t include having to ask for help from neighbors.
“I don’t want to come off as needy or demanding,” Morgan said. “I’d rather people be aware of things that can happen, like cancer, that they don’t know anything about. Nobody ever expects to get cancer, and when it happens there’s not a lot you can do about it. So if you think there might be something wrong, get it checked out.”
A GoFundMe account has been set up to help with Renee Morgan's medical bills. To contribute, visit gofundme.com/cancer-surgery-patient.A little Fresno, Frisco, Flooding and Fever threw me off my game this week. Wheeee!
Some interesting, interesting stuff happening on the boards. Obviously, the folks who say there are no upsets in women’s basketball are looking more and more like the uniformed idjits they are. That being said, if some of the upsets aren’t setting of alarm bells in the Athletic Director’s offices, I’d be disappointed… but not surprised.
Let us count the upsets – and note how many unranked teams were involved:
Indiana over #18 Michigan State, 81-65. Lesson: It would be nice if local papers paid attention to Moren’s team:
“As I expressed to our players tonight, I hope this win gives them a dose of confidence,” head coach Teri Moren said. “And they believe when they communicate, when they stay connected defensively, when they hit shots—they’re going to be in the game and win a lot of ball games. That’s my hope that this win gives our kids a shot in the arm that they can play with the best teams in the Big Ten…I’m just really, really proud.”
Northwestern over #5 Ohio State, 86-82. Lesson: You’ve got to play four quarter, youngsters.
Northwestern brought Ohio State back to earth on Thursday night in Evanston, Ill., with a thud that sent ripples around Lake Michigan.
The Wildcats jumped to a 48-30 halftime lead and withstood a late comeback by the fifth-ranked Buckeyes to hand them an 86-82 defeat at Welsh-Ryan Arena.
The loss snapped an eight-game winning streak for the Buckeyes (12-4, 4-1) and knocked them out of a tie with Purdue for the Big Ten lead.
Arkansas over #13 Tennessee, 64-59. Lesson: Whatever the upheavals outlined by Mechelle, it’s fair to point a finger at Holly.
Let’s be clear…this was a bad team at 7-10.
And with the No. 146 ranked defense, No. 155 in field goal percentage defense, Tennessee responded with another atrocious shooting night.
The Vols shot worse than 35 percent from the field and below 30 percent from beyond the arc. In general women’s basketball, that’s okay.
But it’s not okay when you’re Tennessee and you have the talent. While there’s only one senior starter, there are two three-year players and another four-year player in the lineup. So the excuses are running thin, and Warlick’s misuse of her team’s strengths is evident.
Georgia over #20 Florida, 71-61. Lesson: Nice time to get your first SEC win, coach Taylor. (Gotta fix the Georgia page, though. A.nnoy.ing!
NC State over #22 Duke, 65-62. Lesson: There may be some changes in the ACC: The win improved the Wolfpack to 13-5 and more importantly 4-1 in ACC play, while Duke fell to 12-6 and 1-3.
2015-16 has been a record-setting season to date for Duke Women’s Basketball, in all the worst possible ways. Duke lost to an unranked opponent at home for the first time since 2002 (when an Iciss Tillis flub at the end of the Duke Classic championship game led to an overtime loss to South Carolina). Tonight the Blue Devils lost to the Wolfpack Women in Cameron for the first time since 1996, when Chasity Melvin led her team to a win. In this contest, NC State rode a 30-11 edge in points off turnovers to edge Duke, 65-62. This loss will no doubt drop #22 Duke (12-6, 1-3 ACC) out of the rankings for the first time since the 1999-2000 season.
Washington over #17 UCLA, 64-56. Lesson: The Pac12 teams are like the Old Big East teams: Not to be dismissed.
[Talia] Walton’s performance Friday night — 22 points and six rebounds in 39 minutes — went a long way toward helping legitimize the Huskies’ hopes of reaching the NCAA tournament for a second consecutive season. The win was the first for UW (13-4, 4-2 Pac-12) against a ranked opponent this season.
“When she plays like this,” Plum said, “we can beat anyone.”
Washington State over #25 USC, 73-61. Lesson: Pac12 means No. games. off.
“We just lost our focus,” head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke said. “We didn’t come out ready to play and they outplayed us. They hustled more and just played better than us.”
Oklahoma State over #14 Oklahoma, 73-42. Lesson: Who knows WHAT is going on in Stillwater? The Cowgirls just came off a 47-44 loss to Kansas. Perhaps all games should be listed as “Bedlam” games?
#24 Missouri over #7 Mississippi State, 88-54. Lesson: Get out fast.
Missouri’s hot start was a stark contrast compared to its two other games this season against ranked opponents. The Tigers trailed Tennessee 24-11 less than 10 minutes into a 71-55 loss on Jan. 4 and trailed South Carolina 25-10 just more than 13 minutes into Sunday’s 83-58 loss.
Thursday’s result could prove to be a big one for a Missouri team seeking its first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2006.
With conference play in full swing, here are some teams deserving of your attention:
Albany (45-0) sits atop the America East and Shereesha Richards broke the 2,000-point milestone. They play Stony Brook (4-0) on the 21st. When is someone going to poach coach Abrahamson-Henderson?
Bucknell is making a run at the Patriot League title. With their win over Colgate, the Bison start 6-0 in league play for the first time since the 1999-2000 season, remain all alone in first place in the Patriot League, win its sixth straight game, the longest streak of the Roussell era and the program’s longest streak since 2006-07 and Improve to 61-47 in Aaron Roussell’s four years as head coach. I’ve got my eyes looking forward to their game against Army, Jan 30th.
St. Bonaventure (5-0). Couple of years ago they were darlings, then they had a tough year. Now, hello!
This year’s Atlantic 10 preseason polls didn’t think much of St. Bonaventure University. The guys picked 8th.
“Eighth is the second highest we’ve been picked in my nine years here so we looked at it as a compliment,” said St. Bonaventure Head Men’s Basketball Coach Mark Schmidt.
The ladies’ team picked 9th.
Senior forward Katie Healy said, “Nobody saw what we put in this summer, all the work, all the hours we put in. Both teams, now in first place and combined, are 25-5 to start the year. That’s never happened before.”
While it might be the guys’ best start in 16 years, for the ladies, it’s their best start ever.
The Bonnies other A-10 compatriots are no slouches. Duquesne who, for the first time in program history, was ranked in the USA Today/Coaches Top 25 Poll, will take their 15-game winning to ESPNU (Sue Bird & Melissa Lee on the call) on Sunday. They’ll face George Washington, who has won nine in a row. (Speaking of poachable coaches…Tsipis)
Ohio – the 3-time MAC champs are looking for a fourth title. In a matchup of two poachable coaches (Bolden & Verdi), the Bobcats defeated their 2015 MAC Tournament Championship game opponent, Eastern Michigan, 71-64.
Abilene Christian (4-0) continues to win in the Southland.
Colorado State (4-0) has already defeated San Jose State. Fresno State (4-0) defeated them today. They don’t play each other until March 1st. Who scheduled only one regular season game between these two teams?
Swoopes, there it is: Chicago (Loyola) is 4-0 in the MVC.
Purdue (5-0). We’ve been calling their name. Let’s see what they’ve got: OSU tomorrow.
Green Bay (5-0) faces Wright State (4-0) on the 23rd. Winner stays #1 in the Horizon. Loser may have to wait for the rematch end of February.
Montana State (5-0). Maybe John Stockton is a good assistant coach, huh? They play 4-0 Eastern Washington on the 21st.
Sienna (7-0) in the MAAC and its best start in 14 years. But, don’t get to cocky – and never count the Foxes out. Marist they held on to give Iona its first conference loss, 62-61.
Western Kentucky (5-0) continues its resurgence under coach Michelle Clark-Heard (poachable!).
The WCC!!! 5-1, 5-1, 5-1, 4-2. ’nuff said.
I’m keeping an eye on the NBE. While it’s been tough times for Seton Hall, St. John’s and Xavier are on a roll.
Is it too early to suggest Muffet McGraw as COY? Her competition, if the continue to improve, would be Louisville’s Walz. Both are, is sports-speak, “coachin’ their team up.”
Just sayin’ – Utah is 4-1 in the PAC 12.
Upcoming games to keep an eye on:
The aforementioned George Washington v. Duquesne.
The oft mentioned #4 Texas v. #6 Baylor, 3:30 on ESPN2.
South Carolina is 4-0 in the wacky SEC. They’ll face TAMU at 1:30 on ESPN2
Purdue at #5 Ohio State, 2pm.
#23 Louisville v. North Carolina State – who keeps up their momentum?
#24 Missouri v. Arkansas…. see above.
#17 UCLA v. Washington State. Does WSU continue to show how dicey the Pac12 is?
Speaking of: #11 Stanford v. #10 Oregon State.
#22 Duke v. Boston College. How do the Blue Devils react?
#10 Arizona v. Utah. How legit are the Utes?
MLK Day
#13 Tennessee v. #3 Notre Dame, 7pm ESPN2. Will the Vols’ good game-bad game-good game pattern continue?

Iconic Hollywood actress Meryl Streep is one of the company’s biggest clients, and they helped her land an incredible Mansion back in 2013.
Meryl bought a huge four-bed property deep in the Hollywood Hills for a reported $4.5 million at the time, and the company has even shown off the property on their website.
However, the property was sold on by the star only a year later, to none other than J-Lo’s ex-partner, Alex Rodriguez.
Orlando Bloom
If you’ve been listening closely when watching the show, you will have picked up on the fact they’ve mentioned actor Orlando Bloom’s name a fair few times.
The Pirates of the Caribbean star bought a stunning $7 million property from the agents back in 2017, from a street known as ‘Billionaire’s Row’ – nice.
In the space of only two years the star managed to flip the mansion, gaining a nice $2m profit as a result.
Dakota Johnson
Back in 2016, 50 Shades of Grey star Dakota decided to enlist the help of Jason Oppenheim to find her dream LA home.
The gorgeous mansion was profiled by luxury home magazine Architectural Digest in 2020, as the star told them “I’ll never want to sell this place”.
Nicole Scherzinger
Pussycat Dolls lead singer Nicole also worked alongside Jason Oppenheim to land her Hollywood Hills mansion.
She bought the home – which has an unbeatable view – back in 2016, and it’s thought to have set her back $3.75 million.
Spread over four floors, it boasts a huge home cinema, an outdoor spa and even its own wine cellar.
Ellen DeGeneres
The talk show host’s infamous home was turned into the set of The Ellen Show during the pandemic, as the star broadcast live from her Los Angeles mansion.
The Oppenheim Group’s own website couldn’t resist bragging about their incredible sale, as it states she bought “the best house in Los Angeles” for a tidy sum of $40 million.
The site also goes on to say that Ellen’s home: “sits on two and a quarter acres on one of the most coveted streets in coveted Holmby Hills, right next door to the Playboy Mansion (!), and the architecture and its surroundings are truly breathtakingly lovely.”

As always, good work !
You have awesome hands ;-)
A little CNC never hurts… thanks!
Awesome! I’ve always been interested in motor dynos… but have not spent much time experimenting with them. One thing I’ve always wanted to do is to put a shaft encoder on the motor and measure the phase between when the step signal was sent to the motor drive and when it actually moved. My thought is you can see how close you are to loosing sync, or getting an idea of how much the motor is loaded with respect to what it can put out.
Just thought I’d try planting an idea to see if anyone (who might have more time than me at the moment) might take it and run with it…. :-)
– Steven Ciciora
You’d need a pretty fine encoder to pull that off, but it’s not unreasonable. Maybe some day …
Hmm, maybe you misunderstand…. For example, most of my drives are 10 uStep. 200 steps/rev * 10 uStep/step = 2,000 uStep/rev. Put a 500 line encoder, measure every transition, and you get 2,000 pulses/rev. Interestingly, one pulse in for every pulse out. Nice, but not necessary. Anyway, you measure the _phase_ difference between the input pulse and output pulse by measuring the time difference and knowing the frequency. They don’t have to line up at no load; just an offset you calibrate out.
This is just an example. I bet you could get useable data with just a single pulse per rev (the index pulse on any resolution encoder). A little more complicated, as in would require more than just a 2 channel scope.
Drat, I was hoping that someone _else_ would take this idea and run with it. Now you are going to make me try it to _prove_ that it works… darn you!! :-)
Earlier (weeks ago?) I cut and pasted a procedure where you load the stepper until it stalls while measuring the peak current (and voltage at that time). The person who came up with that compared it to results found on a calibrated dyno and unbelievably found them to agree within a few percent. Should be simpler than what you came up with (nothing to build).
I also gave some thought to a rotational inertia dyno, but didn’t spend much more time thinking about it because it couldn’t measure the mid-band resonance (the flywheel would dampen it out). Not sure why I really wanted to measure mid-band resonance anyway; as soon as you hook your stepper to a different load (like a mill or Thing-o-matic or whatever…) the mid-band resonance of the system will likely change.
– Steven Ciciora
Alas! My devilish plan has been exposed!
That would work better with an actual encoder than the printed wheel & optical interrupter switch I’m using. The pulse transitions are way too slow for any meaningful results compared with a microstep.
That technique was applied to a DC motor, where it will work fine.
Remember that microstepping stepper drivers do active current control, so the winding current is pretty much the same even after the motor stalls and the voltage across the winding is pretty much the power supply voltage all the time. Steppers are constant power devices, so the input doesn’t tell you a lot about what the output is doing…
Take a look at the austrian microsystems AS5045. You stick a magnet on the end of the shaft, and put the AS5045 up close, and it’ll tell you the angle of the shaft to 1/4096 of a circle. It’s good up to somewhere near 30,000 rpm. I’ve written arduino code for reading the digital output from the chip. (I sell dev boards for the chip and its 1/1024 cousin, but the code’s free.)
I’ve been messing about with the same thing you’re talking about, trying to measure current flow through the motor and the lag between sending a pulse and getting the stage to move to the commanded position to try to detect incipient stall or crash. I haven’t gotten anything really grat yet, but I’m hopeful.
It seems like the load motor would be highly non-linear. I do not have math to back that up, but when spinning one by hand there seem to be distinct discontinuities. I would think a brake would leave much less to guesswork.
How are you going to get torque for your torque vs speed plot? Infer it from electrical?
Breathtakingly so, but some rough-and-ready measurements beat nothing at all…
For a given output resistor (or pair of ’em), the power varies roughly as the square of the rotational speed: voltage is linear with speed (a plot coming soon), power in the resistor varies as the square of the voltage.
Torque is power/speed, so basically you (well, I) measure the total power (including that in the winding resistance) and divide by speed. Some fiddling with RMS and peak values will be useful, because torque varies as the peak current, but the two windings give juice in quadrature and need the Pythagorean / vector sum; measure RMS power, add together, divide, get peak torque.
I’m not convinced I can do one justice, if only because getting any friction load is easy, but setting and getting a constant load while reading off voltage and force and current seems iffy… particularly when the motor is about to stall in the middle of the festivities.
That’s the detent torque, which is a few percent of the maximum torque. As nearly as I can tell, it’ll be lost in the roundoff with all the other errors in this thing. I’ll be doing the measurements close to the maximum torque anyway, soooo…
I’d use a DC motor, but then I’d have to figure out how to mount it and measure the internal resistances and work with pulsating DC output and all that seems even messier.
I haven’t thought this through, but would an inertial dynamometer work for your purposes? Basically it would be just a flywheel with a position encoder. Torque is proportional to angular acceleration.
Hadn’t thought of that one. The only catch I can think of is that it would require many pulses per revolution with correspondingly high-resolution time measurement to get good velocity resolution. Computing acceleration from noisy velocity is ugly, but I don’t see anything inherently impossible. Heck, maybe it could even benefit from an Arduino! [grin]
Assuming good-enough accuracy for the flywheel’s moment of inertia, then the acceleration falls directly out: a nice touch!
Another thought: you’d need high-resolution control of the motor drive pulse timing, too.
That CC column just went read-only, but I’ll doodle up some numbers in a while. I like it!
Thanks…
From left field – Not having enough knowledge and just needing to learn.
Would a brushed/brushless DC motor be a match to run your steppers against? The output would not be stepped (digital) but smooth (analog)? This would then transfer the entire motion of the stepper to create a closely associated voltage/current output for measurements?
Ed, keep the language simple. This is stretching the brain already. I don’t want to fry brain cells on this question. I just want to stretch them for growth. ;-)
Part of what I wanted to do here is Keep It Simple: a permanent magnet motor can serve as a perfectly good alternator, but anything more complex than that probably isn’t worth the effort.
In particular, driving the load motor (the generator / alternator) with a current introduces all manner of calibration issues. Believe it or not, I really didn’t want this thing to turn into a career… [grin]Roughly 70 percent of Americans believe there is “solid evidence” the earth is warming, according to new Pew poll numbers. Just under half think that warming is caused by human activity. That’s disappointing — we’ve got more work to do, Mother Jones! — but not that surprising. On the other hand, try explaining this:
Over the last year and a half, the number of Americans who believe the Earth is warming has dropped. The decline is especially precipitous among Republicans: in January 2007, 62 percent accepted global warming, compared to just 49 percent now.
Or this!
…among college-educated poll respondents, 19 percent of Republicans believe that human activities are causing global warming, compared to 75 percent of Democrats. But take that college education away and Republican believers rise to 31 percent while Democrats drop to 52 percent.

Has your health changed over the past 12 months? Or will your health influence the financial plan we are providing? Now, financial planners are not health experts; however, it is important that these questions are explored and is not just treated as a tick box exercise. In my opinion there is no wealth without health, so we must ensure that the financial plans provide a springboard to better health for our clients.
Create a Plan
One of the ways that we can help our client’s individual mental health is through creating a financial plan. Stressful situations will arise in our lives; however, one way to alleviate stress is to create a plan of action. This could be what we do in the event of the death of a loved one, deteriorating health, or changes in financial circumstances. Once we are clear on what we need to do and the steps we need to take, we tend to see a path in front of us, rather than a load of tasks above our heads, weighing us down. At Wingate, part of the core element of our service is to provide a financial plan that is reviewed on an ongoing basis, that provides peace of mind and will ultimately reduce stress and improve mental health. Spotting problems is the first step to finding a solution and often the first stage is to find out whether your current circumstances are helping you reach your goals. If they are not, we amend the plan to ensure you stay on the right track.
Implement a Phased Retirement Strategy
What is phased retirement? It is taking a staged approach to retirement by relinquishing employment responsibilities over an extended period, if moving to part time work is an option open to you. If this is not something you had considered before, we can look to create a financial plan for you that implements a phased retirement strategy to confirm whether this is a viable option for you and your circumstances. Phased retirement can often be the bridge between where you are and where you want to go without the trauma of stopping everything all at once. Having an immediate retirement may work for some; however, phasing into retirement can help in many ways. The first is not stopping all your income at once, which will take pressure off your retirement savings, as you will have employment income to supplement you as you wind down. The second is not relinquishing all your responsibilities at once. Whilst you may feel like you will enjoy having your time back, you may miss some of the purpose that work provided if you gave it all up. Thirdly, it allows you to adjust from 40 years of employment into another phase of life and gives you time to figure out a new routine that you will have in retirement, which could be introducing additional physical activities in your day-to-day life, or volunteering if additional income is not a priority.
Do I have enough?
Thinking you might have enough money for your retirement can still leave an element of doubt. Knowing you have a robust financial plan that is reviewed on an ongoing basis, should reduce stress on any future financial decisions, as you will be making them from an informed position. These decisions can range from the quality of holiday you choose to have, the level of generosity that you have with your loved ones, or even the quality and speed of healthcare that you can afford. Certainty in these situations increases confidence, reduces stress, and therefore improves your overall health.
It is important to understand that financial planning is more than annualised investment returns, it is about being in an informed position with your finances and having a financial plan in place to help you live your best lifestyle and improve the lifestyle of those around you. If you would like to understand how financial planning can help you, please get in touch with a dedicated financial adviser at Wingate.< Back Digital Marketing Specialist ~ up a solution that’s making a real difference.

On 14 June, the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter reported that a total of 111 failed Iraqi asylum seekers have now been deported to Iraq from Sweden. The summary below of Sweden’s forced returns policy is based on the Dagens Nyheter report as well as a news item broadcast on the Konflikt programme on Sveriges Radio on 15 May 2009. Journalists, Julia Lundberg and Randi Mossige Norheim, managed to make contact with some of the deportees after they were removed.
The Minister of Migration has designated 2009 the ‘Year of Return’ and Sweden has now reached an agreement with the Iraqi government to take back failed asylum seekers. This means that the government in the Kurdish region, which previously refused to take back deportees from Sweden, will now be forced to abide by the new Swedish-Iraqi agreement.
On 23 February, forty-five Iraqis were deported from Sweden to Baghdad on a specially chartered plane in what police codenamed operation ‘G Baghdad 2’. In order to fill the chartered flight, the police carried out searches for Iraqis and then took those arrested to different deportation centres throughout Sweden. Once on board the flight, the forty-five asylum seekers (men, women and children) were accompanied by 107 Swedish officials, eighty-eight from the Prison Board (which has main responsibility for deportations) and sixteen from the police. There was also one doctor, one nurse and an interpreter on board. The cost of the charter flight was estimated at 1,728,662 Kronor (around £135,500).
At least nine of the Iraqis, whom the radio journalists managed to talk to afterwards, said they were handcuffed throughout the whole process, from the time that they were arrested in the morning, during the journey, and until they landed in Baghdad (a total of at least nine and a half hours). Six of those interviewed said that they were physically restrained throughout the journey by being ‘locked’ onto their aeroplane seats through the use of a special belt. The police’s internal report claims that all handcuffs were removed once the Iraqis were placed on the chartered flight. One of the men the authorities sought to deport was partially paralysed and in a wheelchair. In order to remove him, the police had entered his apartment by using the keys of his care workers, who had just visited him. The disabled man was so desperate to prevent his removal, that he started to break off pieces from his wheelchair, to throw the parts at the police.
Six out of the thirty-four Iraqi deportees, whom the reporters managed to interview, said that they experienced feelings of drowsiness and sickness after taking food or drink during their time in the custody of the Swedish authorities. They believe the kind of sensations they experienced were due to some sort of sedative. Although the administration of sedatives during deportation is illegal, the suspicion is that drugs were secretly placed into the food. The authorities, however, report the atmosphere on board the flight was calm and people who were aggressive before getting on the plane had come to terms with their removal. In the official report, produced by the authorities, all names of officials have been blanked out.
One man interviewed by the journalists was an elderly Iraqi who has permanent residence status in Sweden. He spoke of his despair, because his 32-year-old son, who has such severe learning difficulties that he has the mental age of a young child, was one of the deportees. In one case, involving the deportation of a family, the children had to be put into the care of social services the day before the deportation flight, after the mother suffered a nervous breakdown. The family were only reunited on the deportation flight.
The Swedish government dispute the facts as reported on the programme.

A positive review of an RMM software does impact a user's mind. It can bend a person's decision. There are true reviews as well as fake reviews. Since reviews play a major influence on a user's decision to purchase a product, there are thousands of fake reviews versus true, genuine reviews. So, how to identify and make use of good, genuine reviews. How to identify the reviews that can be believed.
There will be good and bad reviews about the same RMM software product. If a review sounds good then it is fine. But if it sounds too good to be true, then it probably is so and it is a fake. You must try to read in between the lines to spot fake reviews. If the review sounds promotional then you need no other identification.
Some pointers to spot fake reviews.
First, get to know all the features of the RMM software product. Read about the features of RMM software from a couple of popular vendors. Then, make a list of the features you would require in your ideal RMM software. Important: You must do all this without getting influenced by any of the reviews. If you can, then do a comparative study of the features offered by the different RMM software products. This would be worth the effort, as it will help you identify a product that would best suit your business requirements – you could be an MSP or an enterprise.
There are paid as well as free RMM softwares. There are plenty of both types. You must study the pros and cons of both types of offerings.
A paid RMM software definitely requires investment. It clearly states its monetary requirements. In this you will have to analyze how the licenses are being charged – user-wise, or device-wise, etc..., For a large enterprise this may require considerable investment. If you are an MSP, then the license structure must be viable for you to provide the services to your clients. The license fees must not bite a chunk of what you charge your clients. You must make a reasonable profit to continue staying in the business, or you will close shop shortly.
Analyse all the features offered by the paid RMM software. There may be features that you do not require (bloatware features), but would still be charged for the same. Check out if you can negotiate a package where you have to pay only for the features that you require. This would be much better than being made to pay for features that you will not be using at all. Watch out for the useless frills and don't pay for them. Another important factor is the hidden charges. The initial price displayed or quoted may only be just for the basic features, which would not meet your requirements. A package with all your requirements may actually cost pretty high. Software vendors pack plenty of punch in the fine print; so, check out and work out the actual charges that you will end up paying when you purchase licenses.
Remember as an MSP, you just can't survive with RMM alone. You also need a service desk and a patch management system to provide MSP service. And these must work in harmony with the RMM solution. Usually, integration would be better when all these three products are from the same vendor.
Evaluate Free RMM softwares. Check out the features they offer. Rate them. Check out if the RMM software is really free, or if there are hidden charges. Find out – where's the catch. Free offerings are hard to come by, and good free products are hard to sustain. Check the compatibility of the free RMM software with patch management and service desk solutions. And if the same vendor is offering all the three products for free, then that's even the better. The integration between the solutions would be great.
Free RMM software may be limited to a certain number of devices or users. Check out the charges beyond the free offering. If you provide services to many clients, then the licensing costs may be substantial. The core issues to watch out for with free RMM software would be support and hidden charges.
Now that you have a good understanding of the RMM software product, about required associated products such as – patch management and service desk, and free and paid RMM softwares, and your own requirements, you are in a better position to read RMM software reviews. You would now be able to read in between the lines.
With your enlightenment of your requirements of the RMM software that would best suit your MSP business, you would be able to gauge honest reviews. Remember, that reviews are opinions. Each MSP administrator may face a different experience. Read the reviews carefully, judge the true reviews and form your own opinion.
Managed IT services require a great deal of hardware and software in addition to a lot of knowledge on network security issues. You could be searching a while and sifting through a maze of rmm reviews, trying to find what you need and wondering which software will work best for your msp company. Before you do this, how about taking a look at Comodo One open source psa rmm platform? We just might be able to save you a great deal of time, money and headaches.
The Comodo RMM Software is a totally free software that is offered along with service desk and patch management solutions under the name of Comodo ONE. It is a well-integrated software that is completely free. Check out reviews of this prod to take an informed decision to purchase your desired RMM software.

According to the police, 54 year-old Michael Rosalia is accused of killing 19 women and 2 men, he seemed to regularly feel the urge to kill and would attack anyone he saw as vulnerable to satisfy his thirst for blood.
“He have literally been addicted to killing,” said police Captain Kerry Woods. “He says he heard voices telling him to kill people, and that they would sometimes become unbearable, until he finally killed someone. Like many serial killers, he visibly suffers from mental problems.”
His ex-wife, coincides with Mr Rosalia’s heart transplant operation. She says that his personality changed dramatically after he got his new heart.
“He was a peaceful and charming man before his transplant,” claims Korry Shalom,  discovered that the organ donor was a convicted serial killer named Derick Emery, who was executed by the state in 2013.
Mr Rosalia’ crimes could be linked to a strange secondary effect of organ transplants, called the cell memory phenomenon. percent of patients of heart transplants did not feel that their personality changed post-surgery, while 15 percent experienced a moderate change change in personality, and six percent did confirm a drastic change in their personality due to their newDear Editor,
I write to you today to express serious concern over an issue that has recently come to light regarding the Canada Summer Jobs Program (CSJ). For years, the CSJ Program has provided funding to employers across Canada to hire young Canadians for summer job placements. This has always been done in a non-partisan fashion. However, I have learned that the Government is attempting to politicize this process by forcing employers to agree with the Government's own ideology and priorities and will therefore be punishing those who do not.
I have learned that the Liberals have tried to quietly, without any consultation with Members of Parliament or Canadian employers, change the process through which employers apply for funding through the CSJ Program. The Government is now requiring those who apply for funding to sign an "attestation" that the employer agrees to uphold certain "values"—values that align with the Liberal Party's own ideology. This is unacceptable and, I would argue, is inconsistent with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Essentially, what the Government is doing through this process is requiring businesses to swear an oath to the Government. It is unnecessary and unthinkable. There should be absolutely no requirement for a business to be subjected to this. In my mind it's simple – employers that follow the law and meet the non-partisan requirements should be eligible. There is no room for politics in this process. Apparently, that is not how it works in the mind of this Government. According to this Government, only those that agree with their priorities and ideology should be eligible for funding.
This change was quietly introduced in response to a situation that unfolded earlier this year that involved a Liberal MP allocating about $50,000 in CSJ funding to a pro-life association. This organization met all of the requirements to receive funding but because they do not agree with the Prime Minister, they are now being punished. They did not break any laws. They are just simply pro-life. These new changes will certainly ensure that this group will be ineligible for funding this year.
Plain and simple, this is an attack on Canadians' freedoms. Throughout Bruce-Grey-Owen Sound, there are numerous churches and religiously motivated organizations that receive annual funding through the CSJ Program and have received this funding for years. Typically, these funds are used to run summer camps and programs etc. I know that many young people who work at these programs gain valuable work experience over the course of the summer, particularly those who have chosen to enter into Early Childhood Education.
In no way are the funds used for any unlawful purpose as this Government seems to suggest. This new requirement for an attestation would leave these institutions two options. Option 1 would be to sign the attestation against their own beliefs and religion – which for most is not an option. Option 2 would be to lose the funding and cancel their programs. Religious institutions should never be treated this way by their own Government. This Government is bullying these groups to conform to the Government's wishes and way of thinking.
This runs counter to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in so many ways. The Charter explicitly protects the freedom of conscience and religion, freedom of belief, freedom of expression, and freedom of opinion. To punish employers applying for non-partisan funding simply because they have different views and ideology than the Government of the day is unacceptable and runs counter to the freedoms that I just listed.
I am frankly beyond disappointed, but not surprised, that this Government has sunk to this level. To politicize something as simple as funding to ensure young people in Canada have jobs for the summer truly shows what this Government is capable of. I do not always agree with the Prime Minister on a number of things both at a policy and ideological level. I do not believe in liberalism, I do not believe in socialism or communism. However, disagreeing with the government in no way should affect my ability to access Government services. For example, if the Prime Minister were to apply this same process to eligibility for Old Age Security (OAS), I am sure that there would be a number of seniors that would either be forced to lie on their "attestation" or be forced to live without benefits that they are entitled to. Simply because they disagree with this Government.
In the coming weeks I will be pressuring the Government to remove this ridiculous requirement in the application process for the CSJ program and will be watching closely to ensure that employers in my riding are not rejected for refusing to swear to abide by this Government's priorities.
Furthermore, I urge any business or other organization that applies for funding under CSJ to contact my office in the event that you have been turned down because of the partisan changes spelled out above.
Sincerely,
Larry Miller, MP Bruce-Grey-Owen SoundThe whole Forex advertise is engrossed with the million Dollar question of how to foresee the following developments of the market. While that is obviously a significant part of Forex, there are different inquiries that ought to be on the psyches of brokers, for example, how to make a beneficial Forex exit with a Forex exchanging plan.
Numerous individuals around the globe have a negative impression of Forex. They like to contrast it with club betting. Their fundamental explanation behind this affiliation is that simply like in a gambling club, no one can tell what cards you will get, so to in Forex, no one can really tell where the Forex advertise is going straightaway. In any case, there is one little contrast and it’s known as a Forex exchanging plan.
While gambling clubs are commonly utilized for entertainment and not occupation, a great many individuals around the globe fill in as full time merchants and feed their families with their Forex leave benefits.
Things being what they are, what is the essential distinction between Forex exchanging and a club? The appropriate response is straightforward. When exchanging Forex appropriately, you need an expert exchanging plan, which can be made utilizing your broad research or all the more frequently, by a genuine Forex master.
A decent Forex plan will let you know precisely when to get into the market, with which cash, what exchange, and in particular, how to make a strong Forex exit.
Without a genuine Forex plan set up, merchants will in general settle on choices about their passageway and Forex exit dependent on their own feelings and hunches. This could be the greatest misstep a merchant can make.
An expert exchanging plan will incorporate Stop Losses and Take Profits, which are only two instances of Forex apparatuses used to direct the broker about when and how to make a Forex exit.
While the compulsion to hop into the Forex waters immediately is an extraordinary one, on the off chance that you do that, you make certain to suffocate quick. Assuming, in any case, you invest the energy and assets learning and building up an expert exchanging plan, it may take somewhat more time before you start profiting, yet once you make your absolute first Forex leave, you will comprehend that it was all justified, despite all the trouble.Our large wooden soup ladle is hand-carved from local Pennsylvania black cherry trees.

Now, car seat covers are made out of a wide range of materials including cloth, vinyl, leather, and even flannel. They can be more expensive than traditional seat covers, however you get what you pay for. If you want your seats to stay looking good for years to come, then you should spend the money.
When shopping for car seat covers, there are a few things that you’ll want to consider before making a purchase. For instance, do you want a cloth seat cover, or vinyl or leather? Do you want it to fit tight, or loose? Are you going to want a custom fit, meaning that you will have to order the exact size? These are only a few questions to ask, as there are an endless number of options to choose from.
If you are looking for a custom fit, you can often get them custom made. It’s important to note, however, that some car seat covers are already made to fit specific makes and models. For instance, a Ford seat cover will fit a Ford Focus or Fusion. This doesn’t mean that you can’t find a generic seat covers, though. These can be fitted to almost any car, although you’ll usually find that they fit much tighter than a custom-made option would be.
The next thing to think about is whether you want interior spills protected, or just the fabric of the car seat covers. Seats can soak up spills fairly quickly. Whether you have vinyl or cloth, both can be very susceptible to stains and odors. Vinyl is usually easier to deal with because the stains can simply be wiped off. Sometimes, it is necessary to actually wash the seats in order to get rid of the stain.
Some people prefer the installation of car seat covers to the removal. While the installation of the material is generally straightforward, the removal can be messy and difficult to do on your own. If the seat cover itself isn’t installed properly, then you might need to remove it and cut it to size, and install it again. The installation process is a lot simpler if you install it according to the instructions that come with it. On the other hand, if you do decide to install it yourself, make sure that you do it correctly and follow the step-by-step installation directions.
When looking for car seat covers, there are many things to consider. Do you want the seats to be completely covered, or are you more concerned about the headrests? Some seats have headrests, and you will need to cover those as well. If you are using cloth covers, you will also want to consider the type of fabric and the quality of the fabric. Some materials are better for hot days, while others are better at preventing sunlight from hitting your skin.
The best thing to do when shopping for car seat covers is to take your time. There are so many options that you will be surprised. You will have to consider exactly what type of material you want your seats to be made from. You can choose to go with fabrics that repel water, or you can opt for waterproof or washable options.
No matter which type of vehicle seat protection you opt for, it is important that you select the best car seat cover possible. Not only will you want to protect your child’s precious cargo, you will want to do whatever you can to protect your vehicle. Seats can be a breeding ground for everything from dust to bugs and germs. Car seats are prone to spills, and it is your responsibility to keep them clean and protected. Take your time in choosing the right cover, and your child will thank you for it.The Boise State Broncos were able to edge BYU this past Thursday winning 28-27 and with their efforts they have moved up in the rankings in both the Coaches and AP poll.

Yes he does have medication that he takes. Sometimes I can tell when he is off them or when he has not renewed them in time.

better hope is one option as our other online companies I was discussing previously that there are things that I personally believe that online therapy is better for or offline therapy is more appropriate for and I’ve really I’ve actually discussed this in other settings due to the fact that it is something I feel pretty passionate about and I have to state that my opinion has been well-received by business like better help in regards to ideally how they how they deal with individuals that present for care so I just wanted to spend a couple of minutes speaking about my own is my own individual viewpoint about the important things that are most proper for offline versus online treatment so in my view I see online treatment as a fantastic place for individuals who are battling with tough life transitions for situations where they’re experiencing more tension than regular for circumstances where you understand they have a very precise problem with anxiety or social anxiety and a treatment like cognitive behavior modification which is extremely structured can can benefit them and that therapy due to the fact that it’s not as interpersonal as others is perfect for online counseling since it involves a great deal of homework it includes worksheets it involves finding out particular skills and techniques so moderate milder disorders like mild anxiety mild depression modification disorders even PTSD as long as like the individual has actually received care initially elsewhere these are all things that can be dealt with through online counseling you know think of someone who has a agoraphobia and perhaps they connect to a therapist from their house since they can’t leave their home and just simply to clarify agoraphobia is a disorder where individuals are actually horrified of being trapped and trapped in a location where they may have a panic attack and so basically they start to limit their activities and limit their activities until a number of them can’t leave their home without actually feeling substantial distress so if someone like that is at house and they can reach out through their computer and link to a therapist that’s a fantastic primary step is that going to cure them absolutely not because agoraphobia to be successfully dealt with needs that individual to be able to go outside and to resume typical activities and sometimes that includes a therapist going to their home to help them with that procedure undoubtedly online counselors are going to be able to do that however could they be the bridge that got that individual who hesitates to leave their home from that preliminary encouraging approach to counseling fully from where I stand as an expert psychologist and more significantly due to the fact that I don’t believe that and so you can always expect to hear my honest viewpoint on what I believe from my own experience and knowledge base as a licensed psychologist I hope you found this video fascinating and helpful if you did please like it below and do not hesitate to register for our YouTube channel where we’re going to be producing more and more videos on a range of various mental health topics and please reach out if there’s something particular you would like us to cover or attend to in an upcoming videoMata-ni-Pachedi: Durga Mata, Vahanvati Mata, Bahuchara Mata

In 2016, hackers attacked Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Los Angeles. While systems critical to patient care weren’t affected, for two weeks, employees were locked out of email and other forms of electronic communications.
Ultimately, hospital administrators decided that the most cost-effective way to regain control was to pay the $17,000 ransom. Last year, a similar but more devastating attack hit three Alabama hospitals, forcing them to turn away all but the most critical patients. They, too, paid an undisclosed ransom, but were hardly the only victims of targeted ransomware attacks.
Recent news stories celebrating a drop in ransomware cases last year on the heels of 2018’s record may cause some to wonder whether ransomware is on its way out. But as we noted in the 2020 SonicWall Cyber Threat Report, ransomware isn’t going away, it’s just getting more efficient. “Spray and pray,” the report concluded, is over—but for big-game hunting, the season is just beginning.
Today, ransomware operators have one guiding principle: The bigger the potential disruption caused by an attack, the bigger the chance of a payday. According to the report, 2019 saw widespread attacks of K-12 schools, public utilities, and state and local governments. 2020 looks to be more of the same, with one crucial difference: Amid a global pandemic, already wildly disruptive in and of itself, many attackers who once targeted a wide swath of businesses and organizations that kept our lives running are now targeting the businesses and organizations that keep us alive.
Data presented in the 2020 SonicWall Cyber Threat Report suggests that in 2019, many medical companies had security insufficient for threats they faced then. Out of the year’s top 40 data exposures, roughly 18% were organizations in the medical/healthcare industry; these incidents resulted in compromised data for 42 million people.
But now, as future healthcare workers are being offered early graduation and retired ones are being called back into the field — as ailing patients are being doubled up on ventilators and facilities begin to reach, and then surpass, capacity — the more predatory hackers are seeing an opportunity to turn a nation’s suffering into some of the easiest money they’ll ever make. “You can keep the money you’ll need to ensure care later,” their bargain implies, “or lose access to the data that’s allowing you to offer care now.”
Either way, healthcare providers lose.
In 2019, SonicWall Capture Labs researchers uncovered 187.9 million ransomware attacks globally. If that number doesn’t rise — which seems increasingly unlikely — and just 20% more of those cyberattacks targeted the healthcare industry, the results would be devastating.
“In a modern, citizen-centric environment, successful ransomware attacks are highly disruptive,” SonicWall President and CEO Bill Conner wrote for Forbes. “Networks from city hall, law enforcement agencies, sanitation, courthouses, or the DMV could be compromised in minutes and everyday operations held for ransom, often at exorbitant costs.”
Like the virus itself, this situation has arrived in some places far sooner than expected. Medical labs, doctors’ offices, and hospitals are already seeing an increase in attacks, with one group even targeting a lab that was actively working on a COVID-19 vaccine.
As increasingly desperate hospitals quickly and reliably pay ransomware demands to ensure minimal disruption during a situation in which there’s no room for error, hackers are becoming more audacious in their demands — according to Bloomberg News, there has been not only an increase in the quantity of attacks on healthcare organizations, but also the amount of ransom requested.
The old adage about planting trees could just as easily apply to cybersecurity: The best time to develop a crisis continuity plan and put appropriate security measures into place was 20 years ago. The second-best time is right now.
While it’s of utmost importance to ensure the doctors, nurses and staffers currently risking their lives to save others have access to enough ventilators, beds and hospital gear to adequately care for their patients, it is equally important that doctors have access to the patient data — such as health conditions, current medications, and allergies — that guides care and ultimately helps save lives.Mazatlan.

Be First to CommentAre you wanting to buy some blue chip ASX 200 shares for your portfolio? If you are, then you may want to check out the ones listed below.
These quality companies have been tipped as blue chips to buy. Here’s why analysts are so positive on them:
Rio Tinto Limited (ASX: RIO)
If you’re not averse to investing in the resources sector, then it could be worth considering this mining giant.
The recent collapse in iron ore prices has weighed heavily on the Rio Tinto share price, but it is worth remembering that the company is far from a one-trick pony. Rio Tinto is one of the world’s largest miners with a portfolio of world class operations across a number of commodities.
Goldman Sachs is very positive on Rio Tinto and has just retained its buy rating and $121.00 price target on the mining giant’s shares. This compares favourably to the latest Rio Tinto share price of $95.07.
The broker is bullish on Rio Tinto due to its attractive valuation, strong free cash flow, production growth potential, and its exposure to low emission aluminium.
In respect to the latter, Goldman commented: “In addition to copper production growth, RIO has one of the highest margin, lowest carbon emission aluminium businesses in the world, with over 2.2Mt of Ali production powered by hydro, and we think ELYSIS inert anode technology could be worth billions.”
Suncorp Group Ltd (ASX: SUN)
Another ASX 200 blue chip share to look at is Suncorp. It is one of Australia’s leading banking and insurance companies with a collection of popular brands. These include AAMI, Apia, Bingle, GIO, Shannons, Vero, and the eponymous Suncorp brand.
Citi is very positive on Suncorp and recently reaffirmed its buy rating and $12.80 price target on the company’s shares. This compares to the current Suncorp share price of $11.09.
While the broker suspects that the company’s near term performance could be subdued, it remains very positive on the longer term and believes now would be a good time to start buying shares.
Citi said: “While we still see SUN as more of a medium term than shorter term story, our analysis suggests the current share price is a reasonable entry point even so. Largely to reflect lower impairment charges, we nudge up our FY22E EPS by 1% and retain our Buy call and A$12.80 TP.”

Bee Community
In term one, we studied the 'bee community.' Mr Smith came to our school and spoke about his job as a bee keeper. We got to taste some honey, make some candles and blow smoke outside. We learnt a lot about the jobs within the bee hive. Here a just a few photos of that day.

Subscription Awareness Meets Rendezvous Routing
Authors:Fatemeh RahimianSarunas GirdzijauskasAmir H. PayberahSeif Haridi
Keywords: content-based pub/sub; load balancing; P2P;
Abstract:Publish/subscribe communication model has become an indispensable part of the Web 2.0 applications, such as social networks and news syndication. Although there exist a few systems that provide a genuinely scalable service for topic-based publish/subscribe model, the content-based solutions are still suffering from restricted subscription schemes, heavy and unbalanced load on the participating nodes, or excessively high matching complexity. We address these problems by constructing a distributed content-based publish/subscribe system by using only those components that are proven to be scalable and can withstand the workloads of massive sizes. Our publish/subscribe solution, Vinifera, requires only a bounded node degree and as we show, through simulations, it scales well to large network sizes and remains efficient under various subscription patterns and loads.

Via Goldman Sachs’ Jan Hatzius,
1. Growth seems to have picked up a bit in August, and our current activity indicator (CAI) is now just shy of 3%. It is true that the August employment report was not great, with a slightly lower-than-expected gain in nonfarm payrolls and a decline in the employment/population ratio. But we recently showed that the outsized market response to the preliminary nonfarm payroll number each month bears little relationship to its limited actual value for figuring out the growth of the economy. In contrast, the jobless claims and ISM numbers have been quite good, and they are more useful indicators than payrolls in our view.
2. Our baseline forecast is a gradual improvement in growth as the drag from fiscal policy declines late this year and in 2014. One downside risk to this is the tightening in financial conditions, and specifically the 100bp increase in mortgage rates. Our GSFCI stands about 30bp tighter than prior to Chairman Bernanke’s May 22 testimony, a number that, if sustained, could potentially shave ¼-½pp off growth over the next year, with most of that impact coming from housing.
3. But we are not yet too concerned. Admittedly, the recent housing numbers have been on the weaker side but over the medium term our confidence in the basic math of recovery remains high. We believe that the trend rate of household formation will average at least 1.2 million over the next few years. Add to this an estimated 300,000 demolitions of existing homes per year, and the homebuilding industry will need to produce 1.5 million new homes per year to keep excess supply stable. In the near term, some further reductions in excess supply are likely, but the 2-3 year outlook is still a big increase in housing starts from the current 900k level.
4. The reduction in various measures of uncertainty since late 2012 is another reason for a measure of optimism. We remain skeptical of the view that the weakness of the recovery from the 2007-2009 recession was primarily due to policy uncertainty because we believe that much of the increase in uncertainty over that period was more the result than the cause of economic weakness. But the recent broad-based drop in uncertainty looks more clearly exogenous, and therefore deserves more weight in an economic forecast. Our analysis suggests that the reduction in uncertainty has the potential to offset the tightening in financial conditions, barring another major outbreak of DC strife in the run up to the debt ceiling in late October/early November.
5. Although growth may be starting to improve, we still see a strong case for accommodative monetary policy as core PCE inflation stands at 1.2% and employment remains far below potential. Admittedly, the renewed drop in labor force participation over the past two months is a challenge to our expectation of a flattening out of the participation rate in coming years. But the case for looking beyond the unemployment rate does not rest on the cyclical/structural decomposition of the participation rate alone. Even if we focus on more observable measures such as U6—the Labor Department’s broadest definition of underemployment, which also includes marginally attached workers and involuntary part-timers—we find that there is substantially more slack in the labor market than suggested by the unemployment rate alone.
6. Fed officials will take all of this disparate information into account when they announce their September 18 decision. Our baseline assumption remains a tapering of QE, although we have shaved the amount to just $10bn—probably all in Treasuries—in view of the mixed labor market data and recent signals that Fed officials are uncomfortable with a large step (although $15bn is certainly possible). More importantly, we expect them to offset the potential impact of tapering via a strengthening of the forward guidance. Our baseline is that the statement will make the 6.5% unemployment threshold conditional on a return of inflation to the 2% target and will indicate even more explicitly that continued below-target inflation would translate into a longer lag between reaching the 6.5% threshold and the first hike. We also expect Fed officials to further increase their emphasis on the importance of broad labor market improvement. This may involve an outright statement that they would only consider the threshold to be met if the decline in unemployment reflects an increase in employment as opposed a drop in participation.
7. A more aggressive approach would be to simply reduce the unemployment threshold from 6.5% to 6%. We believe the probability of such a move is significant. The rationale is that the July FOMC minutes indicate a widespread view that the drop in unemployment since they adopted the 6.5% target overstates the improvement in broad labor market conditions, which may call for a recalibration of the 6.5% number. Moreover, from a more tactical perspective an outright reduction in the threshold is a very “crisp” way of pushing back against market expectations of an early hike. Nevertheless, such a move is not quite our baseline. Especially if the taper is small, a reduction in the threshold would not only constitute a change in the mix of instruments but an outright easing. This may be more aggressive than the committee is willing to be at a time of generally slightly better economic data, uncertainty about the identity of the next Fed chair, and the inevitable concerns about the credibility of forward guidance associated with that uncertainty. However, if they decide to taper QE by more than $10bn, the probability for an outright threshold reduction would be higher in our view.
8. The other big question is how Chairman Bernanke will revise his forward guidance for the path of asset purchases in the press conference. In June, he said that purchases would likely end around mid-2014, a time when the FOMC expected the unemployment rate to be around 7%. Assuming the committee’s unemployment forecast has come down—after all, the unemployment rate stood at 7.28% in the August report—he will have to revise either the mid-2014 date or the 7% unemployment rate. Our expectation is the latter, although this may take the form of increased wiggle room as opposed to a new number.
9. Stepping back, we believe that Fed officials probably suffer from some degree of “buyer’s remorse” with respect to the unemployment thresholds that they introduced formally for the first rate hike in December 2012 and informally for the end of QE in June 2013. Although the conceptual argument for guiding expectations in terms of economic outcomes as opposed to the calendar is sound, we noted at the time that this only works well in practice if the unemployment rate is a good catch-all indicator of broad economic and labor market performance. Unfortunately, this has not been the case recently, and Fed officials are likely to respond by trying to loosen the shackles that they have imposed on themselves.

SEXY SPANKINGSIsn’t she beautiful? She is busily taking nectar from these milkweed flowers. My experience has been that milkweed and teasel flowers are their most prized food providers.
Great spangled fritillary females are larger than males. They spend less time flying than the males do. Males fly for long, long periods of time, looking, looking for a mate.
The sugars and other foods in the nectar must provide the energy for 20 to 30 minutes of flying. Very impressive.
Those of you lucky enough to have large lots can easily attract lots of butterflies if you support a small stand of milkweed and teasel.
Those of you who don’t have large lots, make some time and go on a butterfly spotting hike in your local city, county, state or national refuge/park. You’ll see fantastic stuff guaranteed. April, May and June are the best = no nasty biters are about.

Martin Brampton tops the poll!
Martin Brampton's campaign was supported by Kirkbymoorside electors, who turned out in impressive numbers despite wet and windy November weather on the 11th. Now to put the promised policies into effect! There is a council meeting on Monday 15 November, just 4 days after the poll. That is too short a time for new councillors to put items on the agenda, but there are some points already on the agenda where decisions could be made that will enhance openness and democracy. The hope is that the council will respond to the public mood, as expressed in the way votes were cast.
The Policies
Many people are feeling that Kirkbymoorside needs more for less. More benefits from the town council for less cost. The tax imposed by the town council has risen in leaps and bounds, and is now 200% higher than it was just six years ago. As a result, council tax in Kirkbymoorside is higher than anywhere else in Ryedale.
The latest increase is largely attributable to the expensive building project for the Old Library. The only clearly identified benefit is an improved town council office. Over the next 20 years, the council plans for the citizens of Kirkbymoorside to spend around a quarter of a million pounds in loan repayments. No wonder people are up in arms!
More
- Democracy – the town needs a council that actively represents local opinions
- Listening – councillors need to be making an effort to keep in contact with citizens and to take account of their views
- Active – the town council ought to take a lead in local matters, while remaining responsive to citizens
Less
- Cost – the town council is spending more and more money with little to show for it; spending should be reduced
- Bureaucracy – well over half what the council spends is administration and ways must be found to reduce this burden
- Legalism – all councils must work within the law, but a common sense approach is needed that doesn't use the law to browbeat citizens
- Formality – necessary business needs to be dispatched quickly and efficiently so that more important matters can be discussed, and the involvement of local people can be encouraged
How do we achieve this? The immediate step is to elect two new council members who are ready to advocate more for less. The election will be on Thursday 11 November 2010 from 7 am to 10 pm at the Memorial Hall. You should receive a poll card, but you do not need any document to be able to vote. Make sure your vote counts!Airscript supports arithmetic on numbers and provides a large library of functions for dealing with numbers..

Displaying Numbers in Text
When displaying a number such as 100001 it is more readable to the user to denote where the thousands place is. In the United States, there will be a comma to denote the thousandth's place: 100,001. However, in Europe, there will be a period to denote the thousandth's place: 100.001. Displaying a number with the wrong formatting for your user can cause confusion. The FORMAT_NUMBER number function will convert a number into a string with a given format. To display a number using thousandths separators use the format string ",", the correct locale will be selected for the user by default.
FORMAT_NUMBER(100001, ",") => "100,001"
When displaying decimal numbers there are two options, fixed precision, or significant digits. Fixed precision will always display the same number of digits after the decimal point.
FORMAT_NUMBER(100001, ".2f") => "100001.00"
FORMAT_NUMBER(3.1459, ".2f") => "3.14"
To format a number using significant digits omit the f in the format string.
FORMAT_NUMBER(100001, "") => "1e+5"
FORMAT_NUMBER(3.1459, ".2") => "3.1"
Thousandths separators can be combined with precision.
FORMAT_NUMBER(100001, ",.2f") => "100,001.00"
Finally, there are occasions where a number should not be formatted at all, these cases usually involve a number that is meant to be read by a computer or external system. Use an empty string for these cases.
FORMAT_NUMBER(100001, "") => "100001"
Parsing Numbers from Text
To parse a number from a string use the PARSE_NUMBER function.
PARSE_NUMBER("100,001") => 100001
PARSE_NUMBER("3.14159") => 3.14159
Working with Currency
While currency is measured using a number, it also requires a unit. One U.S. dollar ("USD") is different from one Canadian dollar ("CAD")
CURRENCY(1, "USD", 0)
CURRENCY(1, "CAD", 0)
However, one U.S. dollar is the same as one-hundred U.S. pennies.
CURRENCY(1, "USD", 0)
CURRENCY(100, "USD", 2)
To represent this, in addition to an amount, the Currency type has a code that represents which currency it is (U.S. vs Canadian dollars), and a precision to represent the denomination (dollars vs pennies).
It is important to pick the smallest denomination possible for a given currency because when working with decimal numbers small errors can be introduced. For this reason, when working with "USD" it is recommended to use at least a precision of 2 to represent pennies to avoid having to use decimal numbers like 0.01.
When displaying a currency to a user use the FORMAT_CURRENCY function, it will create a string that displays the currency to the user while taking into account the user's locale. For a user with a U.S. locale
FORMAT_CURRENCY(one_hundred_us_pennies) => "$1.00"
while for a user with a Canadian locale
FORMAT_CURRENCY(one_hundred_us_pennies) => "US$1.00"
The PARSE_CURRENCY function will go in the opposite direction, it will parse a string like "$1.00" into a currency representing 100 cents.

Eva Maria Pabon’s Extension efforts reach as far as Puerto Rico. There, she trained five University of Puerto Rico Extension faculty and administrators to bring the Master Gardener Volunteer program to their community. These trainings resulted in 17 volunteers being inducted into the first class of Master Gardeners in Puerto Rico.
For those efforts and more, the UF/IFAS Extension Osceola County Master Gardener Volunteer Coordinator Eva Maria Pabon was awarded the Extension Master Gardener Coordinator National Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Award honoring her reaching efforts to bring Master Gardener programming and support to people of all backgrounds.
“Eva’s leadership in diversity and inclusion has been recognized at the highest level and we are extremely proud,” said Wendy Wilber, UF/IFAS Extension Florida Master Gardener Volunteer Statewide Coordinator. “Eva exemplifies a caring, dedicated, innovative and scholarly Extension Master Gardener Volunteer Coordinator professional that serves to inspire all those around her and across Extension.”
She is an active participant in the UF/IFAS Café Latino program designed to teach cultural competency at the state and local level to Extension faculty. She has served on this team since the program’s inception. In doing so, she provides support in reaching diverse audiences through sensitivity training. She also understands how to reach people where they are.
Eva Pabon with University of Puerto Rico Extension Master Gardener Volunteer program faculty and administrators.
Pabon also serves on the national Extension Master Gardeners diversity subcommittee and advocates for continued diversity in the program.
In her local community, Pabon serves at the Osceola County Emergency Management Office (EOC) during times of crisis such as hurricanes and health emergencies, including during the COVID-19 crisis. As a bilingual speaker, she helps community members that call the crisis line in need of assistance and through her efforts, has risen to serve as the intel situation branch director of the EOC.
Her efforts in diversity show among Osceola County Master Gardener Volunteer program members as well, with volunteers that differ in culture, race and age that reflect the diversity of Osceola County.
“Eva is a consummate Extension professional and team player,” Wilber said. “She serves as mentor to new agents and provides leadership in her professional associations. All of Florida Extension considers it an honor to call Eva their friend and colleague because she makes sure all voices are heard and all people have a place at the table.”Diana is third wheel in Harry and Meghan’s marriage, claims a royal biographer.
Andrew Morton, author of the bombshell biography Diana: In Her Own Words, has said that for both Harry and Meghan, “all roads lead back to Diana” and “every camera click and whirr” reminds them of their “terrible fate”.
He continued to say that: “As the Sussexes embarked on their own journey together through Royal life, not a day went by without a reference, a memory or a decision that related in some way to Harry’s late mother. Diana was the third wheel in their marriage.”
There are also concerns that Harry delving into Diana’s life and divorce will paint Prince Charles and Camilla as the bad guys in his book.
Harry is understood to have been contacting Princess Diana’s old friends. It had been thought he would leave most of the work to a ghostwriter.
Now, Palace sources are “surprised” at how involved he has become.

It allows you to post up a snapshot of your career and connect with relevant professionals plus a whole bunch of other cool stuff. If you don’t have an account, you should get one today.
There are many different ways LinkedIn can be used to further your business or career. This post focuses on recommendations.
What are LinkedIn Recommendations?
LinkedIn has a recommendation system that allows someone to send you a recommendation and have it displayed on your profile to the public world. This system is great and can be used in the same manner as either a reference check or a testimonial only better.
The reason this system is better than traditional testimonials plastered over your website or a letter from a former boss is the reference is connected to that person’s profile. So whoever is interested in your recommendations can track them back instantly and see who recommended you and how respectable they are.
Another great thing about LinkedIn recommendations (as with other benefits of LinkedIn) is that they will last your whole life. A little work now will go a long way later.
What about Fake Recommendations?
When I talk to people about LinkedIn recommendations, a constant response I get is “don’t people just make them up or get their buddies to recommend them? How valuable are they really?”. To this I answer, “yes, they probably do”.
Here’s the catch. The recommendation system of LinkedIn reconciles itself. If I recommend you, it is displayed on my profile that I recommended you. If I’m trying to build my personal brand and you’re a total douche bag, I’m not going to recommend you. Yes, some people may get recommendations that are illegitimate, but you can usually sus them out. Here are some situations that may raise suspicion:
– 5 people in similar positions, all recommended by the other 4.
– Recommendations from people with inactive or incomplete profiles.
– All recommendations on the same or close dates
If you have recommendations from over 20 people, most who work in respectable jobs and who have something to loose from a negative personal brand, chances are they are going to be legitimate recommendations. Even if all those 20 people are your friends, you still must be a decent person to have 20 respectable people like you enough as friends to recommend you. And in that alone I believe there is merit.
Now if you can get recommendations from super valuable people, even better. How do you think traceable recommendations from Warren Buffet, Bill Gates and Donald Trump would look?
P.S. If anybody knows them, tell them to hit me up!
How do I Get People to Recommend Me?
There are two key ways I have gotten recommendations.
The first, is basically working with the buddy system I talked about above. These are people I had a good working relationship with at some point and asked them if we could swap recommendations. I knew I was good at my job, I also knew they were good at theirs so it was mutually beneficial to swap recommendations. A cheeky message of “write me a recommendation and ill write you one back” is easy to do and is win-win. But remember, you’re putting your personal brand on the line, so don’t ask people who you genuinely don’t think are good at whatever they do.
The second way, and the more effective way is to ask someone for a recommendation as soon as you deliver some sort of value to them. For example, if you are a designer or freelancer and you deliver a good project to a client and they are happy with it, ask them for a recommendation. Make sure you do this straight after you deliver the work as it will still be fresh in their mind.
For me, I was a head-hunter, so every time I placed someone in a job or found a client their perfect candidate, I would ask for a recommendation. You won’t get them every time you ask, but if you have done a good job, and they are happy, it’s not a big favour to ask.
Here is the structure I use to build my connections and ask for recommendations.
When I first interacted with someone new for work, whether on the phone, in person or via email I would send them an invitation to connect on LinkedIn.
(Quick tip: you can send a message to someone with a free account by sending them an invitation with a short note attached. This saves you from having to pay to upgrade your account to send ‘inmails’ to people who you are not connected with)
“Hi xxx
It was great meeting you / speaking with you today.
I would like to add you to my professional network on LinkedIn.
Look forward to working with you in the future.
Regards,
Vinay”
Keep it simple, and non-specific. But making sure you have everyone you’re working with on your network, the ones you do add value to are already there so asking for the recommendation down the line easier.
Once you have delivered value of some sort, bring up a recommendation in a meeting. Here is an example of a conversation I’ve had after delivering value:
XYZ: Vinay, I just want to say thanks for finding me this job. It’s working out really well.
Me: No problems, XYZ, glad to hear you’re happy there. I want you to make sure you call me if there are any problems or if there is anything I can do to help.
XYZ: Ok no problems, I will talk to you soon.
Me: Oh, XYZ, there is one thing I thought of just before you go
XYZ: Oh what’s that?
Me: Well… I’ve done a pretty good job helping you out right?
XYZ: Yes of course!
Me: Well I was wondering if you could do me a small favour. It will only take a few minutes.
XYZ: Sure
Me: I was wondering if you could write me a recommendation on LinkedIn. We are already connected and it would really mean a lot.
XYZ: Sure Vinay, no problems. Give me a few days and I will send one out.
Give them 1-2 days to write the recommendation. If they haven’t done it after 2 days, go into your LinkedIn account, into recommendations and send them a “request for recommendation” message. A default template will come up, just use that. If they still don’t do it after a few days, you will need to use your judgement to decide how much you will chase them. If they are a super busy important high value person, probably best to give them a significant amount of time. Like I said, use your judgement.
The “request for recommendation” message will stay highlighted in their account until they action it. I have had recommendations come through months after I sent the message, so it really is a case by case basis.
So I have recommendations, now what?
Recommendations are the most powerful tool LinkedIn has to offer if you chose to use your profile for sales pitches or as your central web profile. One you have obtained recommendations from respectable people, your profile becomes a powerful tool to give people a positive first impression of you. This is useful for job interviews, sales pitches basically any-time you meet a stranger you want to get something out of.
As an example, I recently applied and was accepted to attend TEDxBKK. Unfortunately I couldn’t attend due to a last minute schedule change, but in the application process they asked for an online profile that would teach them something more about me. This was before I had my blog up and running so I used my LinkedIn profile. I’m almost certain this is what got me the invite to the oversubscribed event.
So what are you waiting for? Recommend me for my recommendation to get recommendations!- Summary

This text is intended for courses on community services and programmes for the elderly, typically found in gerontology departments and departments of social work. Rather than simply focusing on building awareness of the various programmes and services available, the authors stress the importance of the theoretical knowledge that will assist in understanding the social and psychological dynamics of help-seeking behaviour. By understanding the social and psychological needs of the elderly and their families, as well as the services available to them, students will be better able to take advantage of resources available to help their clients. This new edition will update the key policy updates affecting older adults as well as the census data offered throughout the text. It will also update the many unique pedagogical features such as the sections titled FYI, best practices, case studies and the web and national resources. Increased attention will be focused on aging and diverse populations and the idea of cultural competency than previous editions, as this area has continued to become a critical part of delivering effective care. Also, international issues, faith-based services, services for LGBT elders, rural elders, immigrants, and other special populations will also be covered or expanded in the new edition.
Chapter 10: Nutrition and Meal Programs
Nutrition and Meal ProgramsA few years ago, your only choice for CBD was the full-spectrum oil that went through a single process to remove excess plant matter. Through advancements in technology, medical research, and patient reviews, hemp extract formulas have greatly expanded. The four primary blends on the market are full-spectrum CBD, broad-spectrum, CBD isolate, and a distillate.
What is a Full-Spectrum CBD Formula?
A full-spectrum CBD oil contains trace amounts of many of the 545 naturally occurring compounds found in the hemp plant. Nature’s formula includes phytocannabinoids (cannabinoids), terpenes, flavonoids, alkanes, sugars, non-cannabinoid phenols, fatty acids, nitrogenous compounds, steroids, and phenylpropanoids. The majority of the phytochemicals are cannabinoids and terpenes. Choose the whole plant organic blend to boost the total wellness factor of hemp extracts.
What is a Broad-Spectrum CBD Blend?
The broad-spectrum CBD has all the compounds found in the full-spectrum formula except for one, THC. Some consumers prefer a THC-free formulation. Experts believe that one cannabinoid doesn’t make much of a difference in the potent blend’s overall benefits.
The CBD Isolate
An isolate is a single compound formula that’s 99.9% pure. It goes through an extraction and refinement process to remove everything except for CBD. An isolate is odourless and tasteless. The final product is a crystalline powder, but manufacturers often infuse it in CBD tinctures and other products.
Why Choose a CBD Distillate?
A distillate contains many of the compounds found in hemp, but it can remove the THC. Consumers can purchase a full-spectrum or broad-spectrum CBD distillate. It goes through a different refining process that produces a translucent amber colour and is thicker than traditional oils. These are often used for vaping but also work for dabbing and infusing into edibles.
Which is the Best Option?
Deciding on the right formula for you is a personal decision. Each one comes with it’s own uniqueness. But now that you understand the difference between each one you may choose what you think you will like best.
A key thing to remember if you are a CBD newbie is that it may take a bit of trial and error to find that optimal dose. Start off slow and low, taking a little bit each and every day and working your way up to that sweet spot.
Provacan offers a wide range of products that vary from supplements to cosmetics and topicals. Each category has products that have been developed with a lot of thought and care and utilising some of the best quality CBD available in Europe.Blonde guetto babe hard anal

The red’s been calling to me. The scrawl on the front cover, meant to look like some rotten student wrote on my book, says: “Baby the first thing I need to know from you is do you believe I killed my father?”
Today I while searching for book trailers to show my kids on Friday, I came across this Audiobook excerpt. Take the time to listen. You’ll feel the chill, too, and you’ll think VOICE. Oh, my, gosh, what a great way to get my students to think about voice.
I am forever searching for books that will engage my reluctant readers, especially my boys. Maybe part of the problem with getting them to give a book a try is because they cannot hear the narrator’s voice. I doubt–for those of us who are readers–we think about that much, but imagine you struggle with fluency. Your reading is slow and laborious, so the meaning gets muddied. Honestly, I haven’t thought about that much. I need to do a better job at helping my struggling kiddos understand that the voice in the book can be as real as someone reading in their ear.
So, it’s Monday, and I want to read this book before I get it into a student’s hand. I’m reading: UPSTATE by Kalisha Buckhanon. Do you know of other titles that might appeal to my reluctant boy readers?

Definition
A set of numerical expressions used to define levels of safety. (EUROCONTROL ESARR 3)
Objective
Wherever practicable, quantitative safety levels should be derived and maintained for all aviation services, systems and products under the managerial control of the operator/services provider.
Description
Quantitative safety levels are data presented in numerical terms in order to help estimate target levels of safety and measure the degree of their achievement in quantitative terms.
According to ICAO Doc 9859 - Safety Management Manual, “Whenever quantitative safety performance targets are set, it must be possible to measure, or estimate, the achieved level of safety in quantitative terms. Use of quantitative data helps clarify most decisions and should be used where available.”
Provisions in Annex II of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1035/2011 of 17 October 2011 (see further reading), and EUROCONTROL ESARR 3 place a requirement on ATS providers in Europe to “...ensure that, whenever practicable, quantitative safety levels are derived and are maintained for all functional systems”.
Consistent with ICAO standards and recommended practices the Group of Aerodrome Safety Regulators (GASR), has established safety management requirements for aerodrome operators, including: “Whenever practicable, quantitative safety levels shall be derived, maintained and improved for all aviation products and services delivered by the Aerodrome. When quantitative safety levels cannot be derived a qualitative reasoning shall be performed in order to meet the safety objectives”.
Quantitative safety data is also extensively used in aircraft manufacturing industry. It is essential for determining the airworthiness of aircraft structures and employs a vast amount of mathematically derived expressions. Examples of quantitative expressions of such information are: the airframe life cycles expectancy, the results of analysis of a composite materials used in airframe and engine manufacturing, analytical fatigue estimation of the aircraft components and systems, and many more.
Quantitative Safety Levels and Safety Performance Targets
Setting up quantitative expressions for the safety performance targets enables the organisation to better measure and monitor the achieved levels of safety. The usage of reliable quantitative data will also provide a sound basis for management decision making.
The desired safety outcome (target) may be presented either in absolute or relative terms. It is common practice to use mathematical models for the definition of quantitative safety performance targets, for example to define (estimate) a target rate of safety occurrences of a given severity. However, it is impossible or impractical to quantify some factors.
Based on quantitative risk assessment, EUROCONTROL has established in ESARR 4 an overall safety performance target for ATM in the ECAC region - the maximum tolerable probability of ATM directly contributing to an accident of a commercial air transport aircraft shall not be greater than 1.55 x 10 -8 per flight hour. This overall safety performance target is used by ECAC states and air navigation service providers in the definition of the national and the service provider’s safety performance targets.
Quantified Risk Based Approach
The explanatory material of ESARR 4 requirements, published by EUROCONTROL, lists some important benefits of using quantitative approach in estimating and measuring safety levels:
- There is an added value in using quantitative objectives, as it avoids diverging understandings by the various organisations and States on the range of frequencies of occurrences included in a risk classification scheme;
- Quantitative criteria provide a clear target and, when derived and applied to lower level events, allow manufacturers to get on designing their equipment without having to analyse the entire system;
- The safety performance measurement of actual safety occurrences may enable the verification a posteriori of whether or not allocated quantitative objectives are being met;
- In addition to the measurement of accidents and serious incidents rates, the feedback from experience on events of a lower level would enable measurement of the effectiveness of the qualitative risk assessment processes and the identification of related appropriate “good working practices” to be used as acceptable measures to show compliance with quantified objectives.
Quantitative vs. Qualitative
In case the acceptable level of safety cannot be presented in quantitative terms, the decisions often rely on operational judgment, i.e. qualitative arguments are used. The combination of both sorts of arguments - the quantitative (absolute values, mathematical models, statistical analysis etc.) and the qualitative (e.g. work experience, professional judgement etc.) can be used to provide a solid level of assurance that all identified safety objectives and requirements are met. ICAO Doc. 4444 (PANS ATM) contains a note on safety assessment of changes, which advises that in case, where “… due to the nature of the change, the acceptable level of safety cannot be expressed in quantitative terms, the safety assessments may rely on operational judgment.”

Frank Leroy "Bud" Athon Jr. was a United States Marine was killed in action during during the Battle of Tarawa on Betio Island of the Gilbert Islands, now part of Kiribati. His remains were identified on July 27, 2020.
Early Life
Frank Athon Jr. was born on June 12, 1914 to Frank and Ida Athon in Cincinnati, Ohio. Nicknamed "Bud," he and his younger brother, Joseph, joined the United States Marine Corps Reserves on October 27, 1942 from their hometown. By then he was working for the Butcher's Hide Association and was married to a woman named Marcella Ballard. Together, the brothers served in Alpha Company, 1st Battalion of the 6th Marines (A-1/6) of the 2nd Marine Division. Bud's rank at the time of his death was Private First Class.
Battle of Tarawa
The 2nd Marine Division landed on Betio Island on November 20, 1943 as part of Operation Galvanic, the U.S. Invasion of the Gilbert Islands. The mission was to take control of the airfield on the Tarawa Atoll so that Japanese Imperial Army would be less close to the United States and the United States would be closer to Japan. Most of the fighting would occur on Betio Island as it was the largest of the islands on Tarawa Atoll. This battle would prove critical for the American offensive and the first time they faced serious Japanese opposition as they were well-supplied and prepared and fought to the last man standing. On November 22, 1943, the third day of the battle, Athon was killed in action.
The day after Athon was killed in action, U.S. Forces would take over the island. Overall, 1,696 U.S. Marines were killed and 2,101 were wounded and 4,690 Imperial Japanese Army soldiers and construction laborers were killed and 146 were captured.
Aftermath
After his death, Athon was awarded the following medals: the Purple Heart, the Combat Action Ribbon, the World War II Victory Medal, the American Campaign Medal, the Marine Corps Presidential Unit Citation, the Asiatic-Pacific Theater Campaign Medal, the Marine Corp Expeditionary Medal, and the Gold Star Lapel Button. The awards were presumably accepted by his family who were informed of his death by the Navy Department.
Athon's brother Joseph survived the Battle of Tarawa and passed away on February 10, 1977. Athon's wife, Marcella, passed away on August 14, 2003.
Athon's remains were recovered and buried in Row D of Cemetery 33 on Betio Island. However, they were not recovered when the 604th Quartermaster Graves Registration Company conducted remains recovery operations between 1946 and 1947. In 1949, a military review board declared him non-recoverable.
His name is inscribed within the Courts of Missing at the Honolulu Memorial in Honolulu, Hawaii in Row 2.
Identification
On March 2019, History Flight Inc. discovered what is thought of as Cemetery 33 on Betio Island. The remains of U.S. Marines found were sent to a DPAA laboratory and identified based on historical records, circumstances, dental analysis, and DNA evidence. Using these techniques, Frank "Bud" Athon Jr.'s remains were identified on July 27, 2020. His family received "The Call" shortly after his identification.
Athon will be buried in his hometown of Cincinnati, Ohio and his funeral service will be conducted on November 11, 2020 at 9:00 AM.

Computers are a Recognized Infection Control Problem for Dentists
Traditional keyboards and mice are not designed to address the challenges of use in a dental operatory, presenting infection control problems and actually costing money when used on an ongoing basis.
An ABC News report found that there are 5 times more bacterial colonies on the average office keyboard than on a toilet seat and more can be expected on a keyboard in a dental operatory.
Current solutions include using barrier tape, a minor improvement at the cost of inhibiting the use of the keyboard. Anyone who has used this method knows that it is not ideal. Other solutions include having an assistant with clean hands use the keyboard, a method requiring an hourly wage. These methods cost time and money and don’t work.
What can we do about it?
The LeaderBoard keyboard was designed to efficiently address these issues. The LeaderBoard is a membrane-style keyboard completely sealed in silicone, making it grade IP6 waterproof. This means that you can wipe it down quickly between patients with a standard wipe as if it were the countertop. It has a built-in mouse that is usable with gloves, unlike a touchpad. The LeaderBoard takes up 1/3 the footprint of a standard keyboard and mouse, saving countertop space, and can be used in an assistant’s lap at chairside. The LeaderBoard saves time when setting up and breaking down a room, increasing efficiency. See what the leaders in dentistry have already discovered:.The brown marmorated stinkbug (Halyomorpha halys) is a relatively common insect pest found throughout most of the United States and especially in the west and northeast. Previously known only as an agricultural pest, it has now begun to infest residential homes throughout the country. Here are just two things to know about this ubiquitous and problematic creature:
They Really Don’t Smell – The term “stinkbug” is a bit of a misnomer as the bugs are not really noisome to humans. Instead, the chemicals they release make them “smelly” to predators and thus less appetizing.
They’re Not a Native – A relative newcomer to the scene, the bug was only introduced by accident in the late 1990s when a few specimens were accidentally allowed to stowaway on shipping crates from the Far East. Apparently, the new environment was well-received by the first few stinkbugs as they were soon ubiquitous in the peaches,apples, and pears orchards of California as well as in their green beans and soybeans fields.
They Are Unusually Prolific – In its native environment in Asia, the stinkbug will usually produce four generations of offspring. While this may seem unusually high, the4 native predators are more than happy to feast on the stinkbug young and keep the population in check. In the U.S. however, there are no natural predators and the bugs can produce six or more generations in a season.

The Egyptians were specially skilled in it (Isa. Textiles before 1800The history of the textile trade between 1450 and 1800 must be told in terms of three interlocking developments: the gradual emergence of a world market for textiles; the changing demand for textiles; and innovations in production. Some notable tapestries were made there but the factory was discontinued in 1859. As a modern, scientifically managed factory, one of the preserved sections is … p.82. The so-called zephyr wool, a fine dyed worsted, gave the best results, but silk, chenille and beads were also used. CORDUROY: A ribbed cotton material. Black was increasingly worn for the most formal occasions. Some of these consisted of large tapestry maps of English counties. They often created new forms with bold images that were intricate in their subtle nuances. A distinct class of embroidery consists of applique or cut-work, in which designs of different materials and colors are cut out and sewed down on the surface of the fabric to be ornamented. Trade on the Silk Road was a significant factor in the development of the great civilizations of China, Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, the Indian subcontinent, and Rome, and helped to lay the foundations for the modern world. J. It afterwards was applied to the glazed hand-printed call, coes of European and American manu' facture. Later in the twentieth century, the industry had expanded to such a degree that such educational institutions as UC Davis established a Division of Textiles and Clothing, The University of Nebraska-Lincoln also created a Department of Textiles, Clothing and Design that offers a Masters of Arts in Textile History, and Iowa State University established a Department of Textiles and Clothing that featurs a History of costume collection, 1865–1948. Some of the most important needlework panels were those designed for wall-hangings in imitation of woven tapestry. Spinning evolved from twisting the fibers by hand, to using a drop spindle, to using a spinning wheel. Thirdly, also in 1830, Richard Roberts patented the first self-acting mule. One extant fragment from the Neolithic was found in >Fayum , at a site dated to about 5000 BCE. Bangladesh was expected to suffer the most from the ending of the MFA, as it was expected to face more competition, particularly from China. Flax cultivation is evidenced from c. 8000 BC in the Near East, but the breeding of sheep with a wooly fleece rather than hair occurs much later, c.3000 BC in Turkey has also been claimed as the site of the oldest known cloth, a piece of woven linen wrapped around an antler and reported to be from around 7000 BC.

In one sense Tsujigahana textile can be seen as a reflection of Japanese historical changes. In Iran, during the spring month of Ardibehest (late April), the process of spinning silk thread starts with silkworm breeders buying boxes of eggs of the silk moth, Bombyx mori (Latin for 'silkworm of the mulberry tree'). No mention of the loom is found in Scripture, but we read of the "shuttle" (Job 7:6), "the pin" of the beam (Judg. Moreover, in West Cameroon, Kings are dressed with finely woven clothing made by the best weavers of the kingdom embellished with beads. Cameroon has a long history of cloth made from the bark of trees, with some fabric particularly made from the obom. In the Tudor period chairs, upholstered with satin or velvet, were frequently enriched with applied needlework. Developments in the transport infrastructure; that is the canals and after 1831 the railways facilitated the import of raw materials and export of finished cloth. Carpet-making was first established at Kidderminster, England, during first half of the 18th century. DUCAPE: A stout silk fabric of soft texture, sometimes woven with a stripe. In the following century they added to their dyework a tapestry manufactory. Spinning techniques included the drop spindle, hand-to-hand spinning,and rolling on the thigh; yarn was also spliced. Scholarship of textile history, especially its earlier stages, is part of material culture studies. Evidence suggests that humans may have begun wearing clothing as far back as 100,000 to 500,000 years ago. . BROCADE: The term, derived from the Spanish broche, meaning the pointed bobbin of the high-warp loom, originally meant the combination of bobbin and shuttle effects. In the past, simpler fabrics were woven on dobby looms, while the Jacquard harness adaptation was reserved for more complex patterns. The weaver plied his loom during a part of the day, the remainder being employed in gardening or other affairs." However, success in power-weaving also required improvements by others, including H. Horrocks of Stockport. The history of Medieval European clothing and textiles has inspired a good deal of scholarly interest in the twenty-first century. Made with heavy wool yarn drawn through rather coarse homespun blanketing. These were made on a quilting frame.

The term ‘Textile’ is a Latin word originated from the word ‘texere’ which means ‘to weave’. Nor are workers protected by trade unions, which are prohibited in industrial export zones. Science, 325(5946):1359. Fragments of primitive looms are also seen from the sites of Hemudu culture in Yuyao, Zhejiang, dated to about 4000 BC. The larvae's cocoon is built up from about 300 to 900 metres (1,000 to 3,000 feet) of silk filament. Those from western Europe were adorned with basket hats or caps, belts worn at the waist, and a strap of cloth that wrapped around the body right above the breast. Medieval craft guilds were concerned with maintaining high quality standards, and later textile mills established rigid systems of inspection, realizing that a reputation for supplying fault-free goods encouraged repeat orders. The English patterns were largely Oriental and average much better than those of Brussels. With 547 labour inspectors in Pakistan supervising the country's 300,000 factories, the textile industry is out of control. PERSIAN SILK TEXTILE HISTORY • During the 17thcentury, the Persian aristocracy wore their social status on their sleeves. Looms might be broad or narrow; broad looms were those too wide for the weaver to pass the shuttle through the shed, so that the weaver needed an assistant (often an apprentice). BROCATEL: A coarse brocade of linen, chiefly used for tapestry effects in wall hangings. Fashion?! Away from the palace workshops, weavers, dyers and neeedleworkers added to local traditions by adapting foreign techniques, revitalizing patterns by absorbing exotic motifs and creating innovative design. Humans have made and worn textiles since prehistoric times. Citation search. Some of the later pictures were a combination of needlework and paint. Little cotton cloth was imported to England before the 15th cent., although small amounts were obtained chiefly for candlewicks. He built a factory at Doncaster and obtained a series of patents between 1785 and 1792. Some of the cloth was made into clothes for people living in the same area, and a large amount of cloth was exported. Technological advances meant that cottons, wools, silks and dyestuffs could be produced at unprecedented rates, and the results were exported around the Empire. Students must also complete art history electives and courses in the research focus "History of Textile Arts" (30 credits). Factories do not comply with safety standards, leading to accidents: in 2012, 255 workers died in a fire at a Karachi factory. American cotton prints were at first done in simple colors from rectangular wooden blocks on which the design was either raised, or cut intaglio. the East India Company was bringing rare fabrics from India. 864 pages. But embroidered decoration was probably very widespread, though not usually detectable in art. Within this setting, master weavers could improve their craft and pass skills along to apprentices. In 1768, Hammond modified the stocking frame to weave weft-knitted openworks or nets by crossing over the loops, using a mobile tickler bar- this led in 1781 to Thomas Frost's square net. Archaeologists and anthropologists suppose that prehistoric peoples produced and wove clothing based on evidence from archaeological digs. New advances such as steamboats, canals, and railroads lowered shipping costs which caused people to buy cheap goods that were produced in other places instead of more expensive goods that were produced locally. engraveth and printeth Copper Plates, likewise cuts neatly in wood and Painteth Calicoes." While these events certainly enfeebled the weaving industry, not to mention the entire Kyoto economy, the Nishijin weavers showed an amazing resilience and spirit in preserving their craft. The factory here produced tapestries for the general public, while the Gobelin factory was devoted to work for state purposes. Spindles or parts of them have been found in archaeological sites and may represent one of the first pieces of technology available. The process, in one form or another, can be traced back to remote times. Textile weaving, using cotton dyed with pigments, was a dominant craft among pre-contact tribes of the American southwest, including various Pueblo peoples, the Zuni, and the Utetribes. By the 1700s the Navajo had begun to import yarn with their favorite color, Bayeta red. Employees of Ethiopian garment factories, who work for brands such as Guess, H&M or Calvin Klein, receive a monthly salary of 26 dollars per month. Asian art. The flying shuttle increased the width of cotton cloth and speed of production of a single weaver at a loom. The earliest evidence of weaving comes from impressions of textiles and basketry and nets on little pieces of hard clay, dating from 27,000 years ago and found in Dolni Vestonice in the Czech Republic. It dates from the earliest times, and arrived in Europe from the nations of the East. Those tapestries that survive well deserve the care and admiration now bestowed upon them. Spanish Tapestries. At its inception, it was not focused on looks, but for practical purposes—such as clothing or blankets to keep warm. Fink, August: Die Schwarzschen Trachtenbücher, Berlin 1963. The lower classes, working within the strictly regulated feudal guidelines for clothing material, patterns and colors were not stagnant during this period. In 1761, the Duke of Bridgewater's canal connected Manchester to the coal fields of Worsley and in 1762, Matthew Boulton opened the Soho Foundry engineering works in Handsworth, Birmingham. It was so expensive that only the very rich could afford it and by the Middle Ages the dye had been lost to commerce. One of the earliest used in this country was at the Northrup Woolen Mill at Roanoke, New York, in 1820.

There is a garden at the back of the hotel that is large enough to be considered a park by most urban standards. There is a feeling of space and serenity and there is no chance that any of the other guests could overhear your clandestine conversations over a glass of wine in the sunshine.
The hotel opened in 1925 and was recently classed as a ‘Palace’ by the French Ministry of Tourism’s rating system for exceptional luxury hotels.
The staff are impeccably professional and take immense pride in the hotel, from guest relations who greet guests as they arrive to uniformed maids who plump the cushions of the sofas as soon as you leave your seat to hit the shops and museums which lie just outside the front doors of the hotel.
The rooms are decorated in a traditional style with chintz and silk curtains to match the chairs, crystal chandeliers and Persian carpets. Bathrooms are spacious with Hermes and Anne Semonin products and each room has a distinct entrance area, separate from the main room, which is a great benefit for those with exploding suitcases.
While the rooms have satellite flat screen TVs, we would have appreciated a separate music player or iPod dock, and the daily charge for internet access is something I hope all hotels will soon abolish.
The hotel has a resident white cat that roams the hallways and keeps a watchful eye over the staff and the guests, although he wasn’t to be seen on our visit.
Le Bristol Paris is a self-contained wonderland in which you can spend days without ever getting bored. There is an opulent La Prairie spa where the treatment rooms look out into the peaceful garden, and a rooftop pool designed in the style of boat with views of the Paris rooftops, which also includes a rooftop sundeck and a hammam.
There is a bar serving cocktails, light meals and afternoon tea to a backdrop of a live harpist and if that isn’t enough amusement, the hotel is located on Paris’s finest shopping street – rue Faubourg Saint-Honore – and a stone’s throw from the Louvre and the Champs Elysee for those inclined to engage in some old fashioned tourism.
Le Bristol Paris’s crowning jewel is its culinary offerings: Those with time and calories to spare are invited for a gastronomic feast at ‘Epicure’ from chef Eric Frechon, where the dining room is formal but inviting with views of the inner courtyard, with a 19th century marble fireplace and large French doors leading out into the trellised garden.
We opted for dinner at the less formal ‘114 Faubourg’, which opened in 2009, where the surroundings of the restaurant were playful and there was a buzz of an upscale brasserie in the air. Somewhat unexpectedly for the hotel’s second restaurant, plates of exquisitely prepared food kept appearing, with all the tastes one would expect in a Michelin-starred restaurant but served with none of the fuss or pretence.
Of particular note was a cote de boeuf Normande for two, which was served on a bed of smouldering herbs alongside the creamiest mashed potatoes. The wine list is heavily French but covers a wide variety of regions and price points. Breakfast is served in the dining room, in the garden (weather permitting), and most decadently, in bed.
I opted for the third option and had the basket of delicacies crafted by the in-house pastry chef delivered to my room in the morning. Just when you thought life couldn’t get any better, it did.

The Douglas school board on Aug. 23 decided that masking protocols would become mandatory if the number of active cases among students and staff reached 1.5% of the population. As of Sept. 8, the District’s active cases reached that threshold, and Douglas is encouraging all staff and students to wear masks until they become mandatory on Sept. 13. The District asks everyone to provide their own masks.
As of Sept. 9, when the Douglas administration decided to make masks a requirement, there were around 50 cases throughout the District. The threshold to move to masking protocol is 48 cases.
The Douglas Board of Education will meet Monday night to make revisions to its back-to-school plan, namely the parameters to move between phases. The board will also approve how long the mask mandate will last. Douglas Superintendent Kevin Case said he anticipates re-evaluating mask protocols every two weeks.
Case said the District has been evaluating the situation based on the internal population’s rate of infection rather than Pennington County at large.
“We’re looking at how [COVID] impacts the operations of the District and how we can go about keeping students and staff safe. It’s a fluid situation; it looks different than last year,” Case told the Journal. “We’re making the best decisions we can to keep students and staff safe. Our main goal is to keep learning face to face. We’re going to do everything we can to keep school in-person.”

One of the operational metrics the District is keeping tabs on is the number of available substitutes. While Douglas is not currently experiencing a substitute shortage like Rapid City Area Schools, Case said it could become an issue if cases in the Douglas district continue to climb.
On Thursday, when masks were encouraged but not yet mandated, Case said he noticed more people wearing masks than last week. The numbers varied by building, but he said there was an overall noticeable increase in masking. He estimated around 95% of staff is masked up.
Elsewhere in South Dakota, both Mitchell and Huron school boards implemented mask mandates for their districts due to increasing infection rates in those communities.- Alf_99 5 years agoDamir, thank zamodel! a fire, why not a pro!+1

Despite the long absence of Kyrie Irving’s season, the Nets can be considered a pre-season favorite, but they have progressed year on year.
“There are expectations and pressures, and honestly, we have a long way to go,” head coach Steve Nash said after Saturday’s practice in Brooklyn. “I feel like we’re on the court [together]Like, practices and games, maybe 15 times. This is a very time consuming thing to become a finished product.
“But can we get a decent start? Can we play well enough to get started? Can we handle some of the shortcomings of a small camp and a lot of new players? Is the boys still trying to go into conditioning? That’s fine.”
The team that the Nets finished last season in June was very different from the team that took the court on Tuesday against the Bucks to open this season. Irving, because he refused to comply with New York City’s orders and get the Kovid-19 vaccine, may not set foot on the ground at all times. LaMarcus Aldridge, Paul Millsap and Patty Mills are the most notable additions to the Nets.
The depth of the list certainly seems to have improved behind superstars Kevin Durant and James Harden, but new pieces may take time to mesh. Very new and the early schedule is challenging, starting with the opening week and featuring games against the pre-conference powers Milwaukee and Philadelphia.
The biggest adjustment is how to change Irving’s irreplaceable production. Some of that could fall on Mills, a 33-year veteran who signed a two-year, $ 12 million deal in the off-season and was initially considered a super-sub. You can hear more of Joe Harris or newcomer Jevon Carter, who was impressed in the preseason, in which he averaged 10.8 points. However, no player can replicate Irving with his superior shot making, creativity and overall offensive prowess.
“Kevin is Kevin and James is James and Joe is Joe,” forward Blake Griffin said. “But the people who support them, including me, we must do our job and do it better.”
One positive aspect of this dynamic is that the Nets have a good portion of training camp to prepare for, as the organization decided on Monday that they will not be part of the franchise until they become a full-time member of the team. . The overwhelming story of the past few weeks has been whether the Nets allow Irving to play alone on the road or take the tough route like him. Controversy can adversely affect a less experienced team.
“I think somebody younger might be more distracted, but the boys are tied up,” Aldridge said.
The uncertainty surrounding Irving and the novelty of this roster has not stopped experts from establishing the Nets as early favorites to win the NBA title. Hall of Fame player and Turner Sports Analyst Reggie Miller and former NBA head coach Stan Van Gundy on Friday are Durant and Harden healthy. And as the season approaches, the Nets are in good health, with a lot of players still working at a high level, Nash said.
“[We’re in a] Privileged position. I have good players. People think highly of us, but we must earn it, ”Nash said. “We have to prove it every day. Obviously we’re under the man, so everybody has to step up.
“We have had our whole year, we have to find solutions to our shortcomings, find solutions to our weaknesses and continue to grow, and at the end of the year we are in a position to compete for the championship.”

Demand is so high that suppliers are struggling to keep up, Dick Sullivan, CEO of PGA Tour Superstore, said on CNBC’s “The Exchange” on Friday.
“We are hearing that factories are purchasing additional factories overseas to keep up with this incredible demand,” Sullivan said.
“The demand has been unprecedented,” he said — and unexpected.
“There’s no factories anywhere around the world that predicted this kind of growth,” Sullivan said.
“In a lot of cases the assumptions were that once we were vaccinated, once people were able to go back inside, that less people would be outside, and we’re not seeing that,” he said. “We’re continuing to see people want to be outside.”
PGA Tour Superstore is also facing the same supply-chain challenges as others in the retail industry, with congested ports, container shortages and Covid-19 outbreaks slowing shipments.
“We’re not immune to what we are seeing everywhere across all industries, but we are working with all our suppliers, and, you know, what may have been just a few days of lead time unfortunately is turning into weeks,” Sullivan said. “But I was in California this week working with suppliers to see how we can accelerate the lead times to make sure we satisfy this demand.”Log into Coacha and head to ‘Broadcasts’ and ‘SMS Integration’ in the main navigation.

The VAEE would like to extend its heart-felt thanks to the volunteers who serve on the Certification Advisory Board (CAB) for their dedication to carrying the dream of a Virginia EE Certification program forward. Certification program development was begun by the Virginia Office of Environmental Education, but when it was closed in 2016, the VAEE chose to continue this work. A couple of intrepid volunteers kept the process going, and soon the CAB was formed and started on the path to making Virginia EE Certification a reality.The world of Horror Hosting, as you readers know, is made up of all types from broadcast giants to online superstars and sometimes even direct to home media warriors…and our subject for this update is one of the latter as this host went direct to DVD and as far as I know only lasted one episode and made a very tiny splash. The host I am talking about is Captain Jolly Roger and his show was Hell’s Drive-In, a quirky silly show. This update will be super fast paced as Captain Jolly Roger has a very short history of being a Horror Host, and while he was a blink and he was gone kind of Host, he still had his fans who enjoyed his antics. So while he might not be a full Icon, I feel he should at least get his time in the Horror Host spotlight so get ready as I bring you Horror Host Icon: Captain Jolly Roger, sit back relax and let’s go to the Drive-In with The Captain.
Captain Jolly Roger is pirate who wears eyeglasses, has long black hair, rocks a skull & crossbones bandanna and wears a pirate coat. He has a very dry delivery of his jokes and is slightly egotistical as he feels his viewers owe him respect for sailing and finding these movies he hosts. When not in his dungeon room hosting cheesy movies Captain Jolly Roger is sailing around the world to find more films to host. Jolly Roger also has a catchphrase that has him make his hand into a hook and he says “Arrr” like a true pirate. It’s also very clear that Jolly Roger enjoys Hosting movies and loves his show. Speaking of the show, Hell’s Drive-In started in 2006 and had one episode that went direct to DVD making the show also end in 2006. I like how Jolly Roger throughout his episode would try to con his viewers with a business scam as well as would try and get them to buy the products by his sponsors. While Jolly Roger was a Captain, he seems to only have one crew member that was a female voice who announced things for him a small amount of time. So while Captain Jolly Roger might have been a very short lived host, those that saw his episode enjoyed his Hell’s Drive-In presentation.
The man behind the Pirate Captain was J.D. Fugate, who was the director of independent horror movie “Brokeback Zombie” that was produced by his wife. In fact J.D. has worked on many different indie Horror Movies over the years and was a main stay at Cinema Wasteland Convention. Sadly I cannot find much more about J.D. Fugate, but I do believe he is based out of Indiana when he made Hell’s Drive In.
I am sure you’re asking, “How did you discover Captain Jolly Roger, Matt?” Well let me tell you – back in 2007, I was 28 and was always at Cinema Wasteland in Strongsville, Ohio selling Independent B Movie films at Andy Copp’s table and helping Dr. Creep film interviews for his show that sadly many never made it to air. And while at the convention on one of my breaks, I went shopping and stopped by the Hell’s Orphans Production table and found a DVD copy of the show thrown in their cheap bin, and seeing it I knew I had to watch it! One thing I have always loved is finding new Horror Hosts that I have never seen before and ones that flew under the radar of the mass viewing fans, and Captain Jolly Roger and his Hell’s Drive-In fit that bill. I laughed my butt off at the good old Captain’s dry and awkward delivery and over all really enjoyed the episode, and to me it’s a shame the show only lasted one episode as I would have liked to see what Jolly Roger had in store for us in further ones and what films he would have selected to bring to viewers. Plus I think that with more episodes Jolly Roger would have found his pacing as well as the true nature of himself. The Hell’s Drive-In DVD in 2020 is going to be super hard to find, but if you ever do find a copy on DVD or on a trade list, give it a watch. It’s far from amazing…but it’s still a part of Horror Host history.
So while writing this update I searched the seven seas as well as every abandoned drive-in theater I came across, and I found Captain Jolly Roger at one in parts unknown and lucky for us, he is willing to answer a quick 4 Questions! So sit back and relax, and let’s chat with the Captain!
Me: Welcome to Rotten Ink, Captain Jolly Roger. The first question for you is what Horror Host, if any, inspired you to become a Horror Host?
CJR: Arrrr when I was just a wee little boy there was no time for TV. I spend my days looking for gold. Only thing was I was landlocked in Indiana. How could a young lad like myself learn to be a pirate? It was the drive-in theaters that showed me what I really wanted to do. But by the time I grew to a man all the drive-in theaters were gone. Arrrrrr
Me: Very cool so it was the old drive-in theaters of Indiana that inspired you. Well my next question is how did Hell’s Drive-In come about?
CJR: Arrrr Hells’s Drive-In came about when I saw there was no pirates for a host at all. Arrr make me seasick. I had to do something or my name wasn’t captain Jolly Roger. So I busted open my chest of gold which was about $85 and went out and bought me a camera and set up to start filming Hell’s Drive-In.
Me: In 2006, the world did need a pirate Horror Host! So my next question for you Captain, is if you could pick any movie to host, what would it be?
CJR: Arrr more questions. When do I get me gold and ship is my question. Aye, but to host Ed Wood’s plan 9 From Outer Space would be a true dream come true. That Ed Wood knew a thing or two about making movies. Arrr He sleeps in Davy Jones locker now.
Me: Ed Wood is fantastic as is his cheesy classic film Plan 9! But my final question is what advice do you have for any future Horror Hosts reading this?
CJR: Arrr So you want to be a horror host also. Arrr No one could be a horror host like Captain Jolly Roger. You do better stay in below deck. Aye but if you did venture into it you need to look at what everybody else was doing and not do it. You need to do something completely different. Come up with a plan and set sail to it. There will be plenty that will say you can’t do it. You may have to start it alone but others will come when they see what you have created. Arrr that be the best I can do for your land lovers.
Me: Thanks for your time Captain Jolly Roger!
Arrr! Let’s now get to the part of this Horror Host Icon review where I will take a look at the first and only episode of Hell’s Drive-In. I want to remind you all that I will not be giving this episode a star rating and will be taking the film’s write up from our friends at IMDB, and I will write about what happens in the host segments. So if you are ready, let’s get to spending some movie time with Captain Jolly Roger.
Hell’s Drive In: Brain That Wouldn’t Die
Starring – Jason Evers & Virginia Leith Not Rated 1962
Host: Captain Jolly Roger starts the show off telling a Michael Moore joke and then welcomes the viewers to his drive-in. We next see the Captain planning out his next sea adventure to find another movie to show for a future episode and then he answers his mail from fans. He later talks about his sponsor M.P. Water, a very nasty product but he does his best to promote them. Next we join Jolly Roger as he tries to get you to go to his hospital and shows how he works on patients by removing things from their stomach that include all his guts! In the final segment, Captain Jolly Roger does a little dance about making it through the movie and once more brags on himself.
Movie:.
Hell’s Drive-In is not a classic show nor is Captain Jolly Roger an amazing Horror Host, but one thing I can truly say is that they both had heart and you can tell everyone involved had a blast making it. I also have to say that I really like the fact that Jolly Roger was on quests to sail around the world including past Skull Island to find not only buried treasure but also cheesy movies that he could share with his viewers. For our next update, we will leave Captain Jolly Roger behind and will be passing Rotten Ink over to Juliet who will be writing about M! So until next time, read a Horror Comic or three, watch a Horror Movie or two and as always support you local Horror Host. See you next update for a Fritz Lang good time!Join Our Newsletter

It’s good to know that the officers working at the Canadian/American border make great choices and stand for the right thing. They were all action and no talk when they encountered a group of eight women headed to an event in protest of Donald Trump.
Eight anti-Trump women, traveling from Quebec to the Women’s March in D.C. were DENIED entrance to America! There was a two hour search, fingerprints, photos taken, warnings were given and the eight traveling protesters were sent home!
THAT’S AWESOME!

The Guardian reported –.”
Great job to the border patrol agents for refusing their entry. They were headed to a terrible event that excluded pro-life women, left tons of trash on the ground and seemingly accomplished absolutely nothing. Should the women have been admitted? Probably, but they’re French and Canadian, so our Presidency doesn’t matter to them anyway. They were just being useless snotty women protesters and I think we had enough of them at the Women’s March. You know, the place where pro-life women weren’t allowed to go?
How’s it feel not being allowed to go somewhere?
Not only did the Women’s March not accomplish anything, it was also filled with protest signs that made no sense. If you could make less than no sense, then the Women’s March of 2017 did accomplish something. Although nothing admirable, that’s for sure.
This sign, for example, makes less than zero sense. We all know men’s razors have been overpriced for years. Maybe if this person was a little more in touch with reality and took a peek outside of her self-entitled little bubble, then maybe she would notice that we’ve been paying a lot for razors. What planet do these women live on that they don’t know men’s razors are one of the most overpriced items in their precious stores?
These delusional women must be out of touch with reality. I can buy a lobster for less than the cost of a pack of razors!

Nicole Battefeld
Germany
Röststätte Berlin
Please tell us a little about yourself:
Born in the city of Görlitz, I was already very interested in coffee in a very young age.
After I graduated high school I started working in an espresso bar and fell in love with the area.
After a short excursion, living the life of a student at university, it was clear that all I ever wanted to do revolved around gastronomy, so I decided to learn the trade of a chef, to learn as much as possible about taste and craft. This apprenticeship brought me to Berlin where once I finished my exams, I started working at the restaurant 3 minutes sur mer, under the head chef Christoph Hauser. The passionate team around the well known chef taught me about taste, texture, technique, and how to combine them. At the same time my longing to work as a barista again grew.
4 years ago I came to Röststätte Berlin and found my so called “jackpot”.I’m not only the head barista behind the bar, but I also roast coffee, sell equipment, work for Victoria Arduino at international conventions, give courses, and take part in barista championships. In 2016, I took 2nd place at the German Barista Championship, and in February 2018, I won the title. This year I placed 3rd in the Barista Championship and won CIGS.
Coffee isn’t a drink for me, it’s my life.
How did you get started in coffee?:
After school to pay for my driver’s licence.
Please list the coffee competitions you have participated in, what year they took place, and your results:
2016 German Barista Championship 2nd Place
2018 German Barista Championship 1st Place
2019 German Barista Championship 3rd Place
2019 German CIGS Championship 1st Place
What are you excited to do in Berlin?:
To host many coffee friends in my city.
What was your first amazing experience with coffee?:
There isn’t just one. If you fall in love with a person, you don’t just fall in love with one feature.
It’s many things; the people, the taste, the techniques, the emotions, laughing, crying, everything.
Besides your own competition drink, do you have a favorite cocktail?:
Margaritaaaaaa.
What coffee-producing country interests or excites you most?:
Colombia.
What are your interests outside of coffee?:
Bouldering.
Where do you see yourself in five years?:
I’m happy when I know where I see myself tomorrow…
Is there anyone you would like to thank or recognize, or who helped you to prepare for the WCIGS?:
The whole Röststätte team, and Jordan Montgomery.

Carousell user “girlnextdoor” had a “Brand New LV Montaigne M41048” for sale in early May 2015.
A fellow Carousell user enquired about the item by asking some questions via the Chat function, and made a $300 bid (albeit ridiculously low) . “girlnextdoor” got offended by the potential buyer’s questions and low bid, and started to insult her race, “you malay people are pure retarded”, “cant read at least have some brains”.
“girlnextdoor” furthered her seditious rant by stating that “Its a known fact that everyone in sg looks to malays as second class citizens”, and that Malays on carousell are “absolute retards”.
Even if the bid was not what the seller wanted, there is NO NEED to insult the entire Malay community over a bag. “girlnextdoor” comments violates the Sedition Act, Section “3.—(1) A seditious tendency is a tendency (e) to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes of the population of Singapore.”, and have indeed caused ill-will and hostility to the Malays.
We hope the relevant authorities will look into this matter.

In today’s fast paced world, people have favored using their mobile devices to access the internet. But, that doesn’t mean people only access the internet from them. People start with their cell phones while getting ready for their day, transition to desktops and tablets during their daily tasks, and always have their cell phones with them to check on the most important items. That’s why it’s essential for any business to have a website that is accessible from any of these devices. This type of design is called responsive website design, and is intended to meet the needs of every user on any device 24/7/365.
AWG VIEWS MOBILE ECOMMERCE FROM A DIFFERENT VANTAGE POINT
Active Web Group knows that consumers are technology-driven, also that these changes create opportunities for our clients and their demographics alike. Even if your site has few mobile users, there are compelling reasons why your website should be a mobile-friendly web design.
At AWG we look at mobile traffic metrics differently. Maybe the reason you are drawing a small percentage of mobile users is that your website is too difficult for smartphone and tablet users to navigate. In fact, you could be losing business and not even knowing it.
Given Google’s statistic that more goods and services are being purchased while their users are on the go, shouldn’t your online business be as mobile-friendly as possible? If you think you cannot afford to address mobile commerce users via a responsive web design, you are definitely missing an opportunity to edge out your competition. The longer online business owners wait to acknowledge mobile eCommerce, the greater likelihood their enterprises will lose market share to competitors who recognize the advantage to having an omni-channel website.
Speak with our knowledgeable Internet Marketing Specialists to determine your best course of action. They’ll help you and your business to tap into the exponentially growing mobile commerce market. We will be glad to create a mobile-centric strategy that is a good fit for your business and budget.

Joyce Beebe, fellow in public finance, explains how the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) plans on cracking down on cryptocurrency tax avoidance. She is available to speak to the news media about the issue.
The IRS has started to address cryptocurrency tax noncompliance during the last couple of years..”
Beebe’s research focuses on tax reforms in the U.S. and computable general equilibrium modeling of the effects of tax reforms. Her other research interests include wealth accumulation over a person’s lifetime and how public policies influence decision-making.
To schedule an interview with Beebe, or for more information, contact Avery Franklin, media relations specialist at Rice, at averyrf@rice.edu or 713-348-6327.

Colleges and universities face a sudden and major disruption with the outbreak of the coronavirus. The COVID19 pandemic triggered not only a global health crisis but also economic and social challenges, as well as deep psycho-spiritual anxiety and despair. Today, Christian educational institutions are pressed to organize new resources and find the resolve to weather the storm, thus opening some pathways to a shelter in which creative and constructive initiatives can be explored.Due to the pandemic, colleges and universities must resort to cancelling in-person classes and moving to alternative learning systems. Within higher education, programs for flexible learning are fast-tracked, while extensive retooling and capacity building are undertaken in the areas of human and physical resources related to information technology. Partnerships with public and private agencies are being pursued in the acquisition of skills and equipment, and the enhancement of goodwill in the communities we serve.Today’s students will have a different school experience – social distancing restrictions will cause alternative forms of instruction, staggered days on which students attend classes, virtual counseling services and psychosocial support interventions, creative internships and remote graduations, to mention some. Given the disruptions caused by the pandemic, existing management and operational processes must be given rigorous review, and new approaches must be explored that address both continuity issues as well as the challenges of a not-so-certain future.
As a Christian institution of higher learning, Silliman University remains committed to carry on its ministry of teaching, healing and witness, especially at this time of the pandemic. As a teaching-learning community, we ask ourselves:
•What immediate challenges are we facing due to Covid19 and what preventive as well as proactive measures can we take?
•What will the new realities for our own university look like?
•What can we do within our own institution to prepare for the post-Covid19 scenarios that are likely to emerge?
There will always be answers that look good on paper. We must sift through these to find realistic strategies to help us through the rough-and-tumble times. We will find ways to catapult us into new situations, on the lookout for innovations that will not allow us to slide back to our not-so-relevant old ways of doing things.
These are trying times that will test our resolve: to hope more than despair, to advance more than retreat, to have courage more than fear, and to trust more in the capacity of people to work together towards a common goal.
It is important for us to focus on a sense of the future, and to remind ourselves that we are in this with others. The Association of Christian Universities and Colleges in Asia (ACUCA), inspired by the grace and peace of our Lord Jesus Christ, has demonstrated the efficacy of working together towards a common purpose. Our special charge is to reflect the Christian character of our institutions through cooperation, mutual support, and encouragement. How can we fulfill this charge during this Covid19 crisis? Let not the pandemic defeat us; let our faith and Christian character define us.

She served as the Vice President for Programs of the United Board for Christian Higher Education (UBCHEA) from 2007 until her optional retirement in 2013 where she had general oversight of grant programs and special projects to over 100 universities and colleges in Asia.

Acts 17:26 …and He made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their habitation…
God is the one who determines or sets the boundaries and times for the nations, which ‘He created from one man’ (Acts 17:26).
Acts 17:27 that they would seek God, if perhaps they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us;
And He is at work in culture, nations and ethnicities ‘that they should seek Him and find Him’ (Acts 17:27).
It was my experience and became a personal value to see the intentionality and unique ways the LORD works in culture & ethnicities (nations) to reveal and draw men to Himself. As I walked life & worshipped with my African American brothers and sisters, I saw our LORD and Savior in ways that were new, broader and more glorious. I saw Him from new facets of perspective and how He meets us in our life circumstance (which flow from our upbringing, culturally, socioeconomically, etc.) that I could not see from my own limited experiences and circumstance or even the way in which my own cultural background ‘fashioned’ Him.
Revelation 21:24-26 The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it. In the daytime (for there will be no night there) its gates will never be closed; and they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it…
Based, not only on Revelation 5:9 & 7:9 but also Revelation 21:24-26, the ‘nations’ are still identifiable and noteworthy in the ‘new man’ (Ephesians 2:15-22) that will move into Eternity with our LORD.
Ephesians 2:15-22 believe this is significant, even though we are unified into one new identity in our Lord Jesus. We will also still retain our identifiable ‘ethnicity’ to be an eternal glory for the LORD to His redemptive purpose and the unconditional reach of His love. These ‘secondary identities’ of ethnicity become the ‘song of the Redeemed’ to the Lamb of God in Revelation 5:9 “…for You were slain, and purchased for God with Your blood men from every tribe and tongue and people and nation.”
Consider, God raises His redeemed to be imperishable, immortal, spiritual, heavenly, etc. (as described in 1 Corinthians 15:42-57), AND YET chooses to retain the ethnicities of each forever and ever…. If it is important to the Father to maintain these distinctives as a glory to Son in eternity, it should be one that I need to embrace and seek to see in the Church this side of Eternity. Understanding our ‘secondary’ ethnic identities as an eternal value and priority of the LORD with respect to expressing the redemptive work of Christ, should lead us to value AND pursue diversity within the Body, desiring to see our local bodies reflect the eternal glory scripture has revealed to us.

Amen, hallelujah! We are all one to Yeshua!I’d like to inform about Compare top refinance lenders
Refine outcomes by loan kind:
10. Am I going to be asked to spend price lock extension costs?
Rate locks for a conventional 30-year home loan are typically beneficial to 30 or 45 times, while some loan providers is certainly going as much as 60 times.
In case your price lock has to be extended beyond that, costs could be passed along for you.

ENJOYING ALL THINGS RICHLY BY SUFFERING 2
(week 07/10)
OLUBI JOHNSON
In our last article we saw that God wants us to enjoy all things richly after we have learned obedience by the things which we suffer: self-denial, persecutions and afflictions. After we have suffered a while, God then perfects, establishes, strengthens and settles us (1 Pet. 5:10). God wants our years of glory to out-number our years of sufferings.
Job 36:11-12 AMP: If they obey and serve Him, they shall spend their days in prosperity and their years in pleasantness and joy. (12) But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword [of God’s destructive judgments], and they shall die in ignorance of true knowledge.
We will see how to do this in this article.
Joseph’s life exemplifies this truth: He suffered slavery and imprisonment for only about 13 years and enjoyed all things richly for about 80 years (age 30 (Gen. 41:46) to 110 (Gen. 50:26)).
Generally, we are promised 70-80 years (Ps. 90:10). Years of training into spiritual maturity should take about 20 years (using Christ as a pattern from 12-30 years (Lk. 2:42, 3:23); So you can have about 40 years of glory and enjoying all things richly if you start walking with God in your late teens or early twenties, like Joseph, David, Daniel and Jesus did.
This is why the scripture says in
Ecclesiastes 12:1 ESV: Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth, before the evil days come and the years draw near of which you will say, “I have no pleasure in them”;
And
Psalms 91:16 ESV: With long life I will satisfy him and show him my salvation.”
So, we should not die until we are satisfiedthat we have seen the fullness of our salvation: the perfection and fullness of Christ while enjoying all things richly!
So, we should get born-again as quickly as possible and then grow spiritually as quickly as possible by, like the Lord Jesus, learning obedience by the things we suffer.
Furthermore, we can even start experiencing years of glory much earlier by operating a borrowed anointing under covering before we come into full spiritual maturity and so increase the number of our years of glory!
This will be particularly useful for those who did not get born-again during their youth (say from about 12-21) or have wasted many years not growing up spiritually: God will use these extra years of glory by the borrowed anointing under covering to restore the wasted years the cankerworm has eaten (Joel 2:25).
Now, this is not to say we will not experience attacks of persecution and affliction even during our years of glory, but we would have been sufficiently trained and empowered to easily overcome them and shorten their duration.
We see this exemplified in Daniel in the lion’s den (Dan. 6:1-28); Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego (Dan. 2:48-49; 3:1-30) in the furnace of fire: they suffered great attacks of persecution and affliction even during their years of glory and enjoying all things richly but the persecutions and afflictions were easily and speedily overcome.
This is God’s pattern of how we should enjoy all things richly by suffering self-denial, persecutions and afflictions during our lifetime on earth in Christ Jesus!Why, we may wonder, why God does not just remove every obstacle and resistance to our faith? Why in this journey must we fight? Why must we strive against adversity in reaching where we are aiming to be?
Can a faith that is not exercised truly be called faith? For if the road traveled is always smooth and the pathways are always leveled plains, how then will we ever learn to climb? How will we learn to exert our muscles and pull our weight to mount upon the top?
More strength only comes by using more strength. More faith only comes by being forced to use more faith. We can only learn to climb by experience. We can only learn to push ahead by continuing to push ahead. We can only learn to fight by being made to fight.
There are things that God knows His people will only learn by going through them. That’s why Judges 3:2 says, “Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof;”.
When we are choosing multiple services in life we tend to want to choose those with experience. Take getting a simple hair cut for example. We want those who have had plenty of practice perfecting their skill before attempting to put scissors near our head that could alter the way we look for good or for bad.
God has many plans and purposes for His people but what we fail to see or have the patience for is the seasoning of the saint, the molding and perfecting that goes on behind the scenes.
I guarantee no one whom you have read about or see, who is doing great exploits for the Lord, just fell into that role ready to go. There was some teaching. There was some humbling. There was some learning along the way. It may have been behind closed doors and away from the eyes of the public, but God takes the time to make sure His vessels are properly prepared to go forth and hold all the potential and purposes He has for them.
The children of Israel might have been concerned as to why certain enemies were left in the neighboring surroundings. By them, God was testing His people. By them, God was teaching those to war who had never known war before. God was causing faith muscles to be exercised. He was training hearts to not focus on what they see in the enemy but on what they know about their God.
“Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:” (1 Peter 4:12). There is no struggle or contention that does not come without a purpose. Though it may not be pleasant it is plentifully seasoning your walk with the Lord. Like the children of Israel, it is teaching your hands to war.
One can never be a good soldier without ever facing contentions. One can never learn to fight unless they have been made to fight. One can never learn to pray in earnest if they never had that petition that would draw them to the knee with fervency. And one could never learn to seek and lean on Him if their heart were never stirred to do so through the challenges faced.
). It may not always feel like it, and it may not always feel good, but there is purpose in the hardships we face, especially when it comes to our faith which is found more praiseworthy in the eyes of Christ than gold that will perish.
Sometimes we may not understand everything and we may ask, “Why?” But as we journey, may our eyes never leave Him who promised and is faithful (Hebrews 10:23). Take heart, dear friend. Through it all, at the end of our Christian race, we may look back and see the fruit those hard times produced, and we may see the purpose in the struggles.
“But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.” (Job 23:10).
“For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;” (2 Corinthians 4:17).

We do send flowers to funerals and we care about everything being well communicated. Even, if you hold an intimate service with several friends you should respect the memory of every person with flowers.
Alison March 21, 2021 at 12:08 am
Is it wrong to not have a funeral 😕 I look back and wish I would have had a furneal for my love one. The chose wasn’t thought through and now I ponder with that sadness among me. The state of life the person pass away might give you the knowing if you should have a public furneal or family. The end matter the most the life of the dead. Have they made a change in their life and they should been remembered in their last days in life not the life before. I ‘m very sad I didn’t have the furneal just for love ones. Family and Friend
Millie Smith September 24, 2020 at 9:39 am
Members of families are making me feel guilty. He didn’t want a service.so I wasn’t going to do anything.
IsabelleS September 25, 2020 at 11:56 am
Hi Millie, I am so sorry for your loss and that you are feeling this way. As difficult as it may be, you may want to communicate these feelings to your family members.

I had a funeral for my mom I worked 2years as a pca and saved money to buy a car so I could see my son more and I have one older sister and one younger and both my older brother died and we had the wakes there too.But my mom got a settlement in 2018 and she got 19000$ and my sister amy the older one scammed her into giving the check to her and her wife kim and they stole 7500 from her that’s what she was missing when she wanted her money back and my younger sister is on drugs and stole my dead brothers wedding rings that cost alot and guess what I end up paying for the whole funeral and the director put the obituary in late so we told everyone it was on Thursday but he said since he messed up he would do another showing well no one showed up I think 1 person and he’s giving me a refund but my sisters didnt pay anything and my older sister works at home depot and I wanted to do donations she said no because before all this my id got stolen someone got into my debit card and savings account and I had to spend all the money I was saving for a car for my son and my sister amy said I would get the refund back from the homerfund well the director never got it and I’m out 4600 but he gave me a discount cause most of my family had wakes there alot and I think he should go after my sister and refund me my money for obituary and the 2000 that she said to us she put in for but nothing and I have to move out of her apartment with no money unemployment is a joke so idk what to do this is crazy

If I was dead today
I am in a coffin; I want to be cremated but what I want does not matter because I am dead. what I want didn’t really matter when I was alive anyway.
You are probably be sad but your tears can not change the fact that I am dead. irreversibly and inevitably dead. your tears mean nothing to me, I don’t even know that they are there. I don’t hear your thoughts or see your pain, I am dead.
We all must die.
We live as though life goes on, it does, just not for the dead.
Is it really such a blessing? Such a great gift to have this brief glimpse of an existence so unextraordinary and mundane? Laugh, eat, sleep, shit, shave and on and on and on.
It is all meaningless. There is no reason. Existence is perpetual futility.
Everything happens for a reason?
A child was drowned in boiling water. It happened for a reason? The greater scheme of things? His mother found religion and lived a righteous life and helped many others. She will still die. Her name and the name of her son will be drowned in an infinite ocean of past lives of every race, religion and opinion that only existed for someone else’s “everything happens for a reason”.
Which am I? The means to an end or a purpose? Doesn’t matter now because I am no more, I am dead. It didn’t matter when I was alive either because I was destined to die.
The unnecessary cruelty of it all baffles me. To live with purpose is as futile as the air in my decaying lungs.
It is all for nothing, we can not grasp the vastness of this statement, so we grasp at straws trying to make sense of it all. We search for deeper meanings creating religions, goals, superstitions, purposes and reasons and there really isn’t any. It is all made up and the void cannot be filled, it just sucks it in and it all boils down to: nothing matters. Even the extremities of our emotions are all just a conjuring of the mind, erotic, neurotic, fading and in the end as empty as my lifeless eyes.
To imagine that anything I did in my life to be remembered, added any meaning is just idiocy. I cannot claim fame or riches and my name is just as pointless as all the good things that I have done, I am dead.
All my plans, dreams, intentions and wishes remain just that. Did they ever really matter when I was alive? Their only purpose was to distract me from the undeniable facts.
I am a speck of dust in a multiverse of dunes, inconsequential and in-distinctive, almost non-existent.
What does matter? nothing
What is matter? nothing
Antimatter.
Mary March 25, 2020 at 2:50 am
My husband died last week. Because of Corona virus nobody is willing to attend a funeral so I have opted for a direct cremation perhaps with a memorial service when life gets back to normal. Now I’m being critised for not having a “proper funeral”!! Did I do the right thing?
Brian March 25, 2020 at 10:04 pm
I know this reply is a little late, however as a funeral director and part owner of a funeral business in Australia I will tell you that you have done is the best thing you could have. And it is not uncommon in general, not just because of Covid 19, where only a few people can attend an actual funeral service at present. There is even a trend now to having maybe a small family service, and larger memorial service at a later date. Some families now opt for a no attendance cremation at a crematorium, then organise a memorial service later with no coffin/casket. (And dare I say it..some people are even opting for burials with no attendance).
Fortunately these days people are more practical in their thinking. Sure there will always be those who want the traditional service with church/chapel services then a funeral cortege, (procession) to final resting place, but those types of services are becoming less frequent, and are also more expensive than the modern day options.
And it is not disrespectful to opt for a memorial service later, with no coffin or casket.
The funeral is actually for the living, to celebrate the life of the person who has died, and it is not necessary to always have a coffin or casket present. some people get a bit anxious about that, but there is nothing wrong to even have final committal prayers done privately at a funeral home by a clergy person or celebrant, or even anyone of your choice, then the casket is removed to final place of rest, so to speak.
it is not a full on funeral by choice, because you can have the memorial service later, without the grief of looking at a casket throughout the service. No matter which way people decide, it is personal choice. There is no right or wrong way these days. The people who criticise others for taking other options, even though they mean well, are often in fear of their own mortality, with respect, and to be frank, it is none of their business.
The next of kin or the executor, (often the same person), calls the shots. The only issue is if someone has left specific WRITTEN instructions as to what they want done at the time of their death, however there is no legal requirement to follow even some instructions as written. the main one is cremation versus burial, but usually that is not an issue, because normally, the executor has a legal responsibility to ensure those particular orders are carried out.
But do not feel ashamed or apprehensive for what you have done in your case. You will find that most people would agree and support you. The main focus now should be on yourself. You need to be “selfish” (in a nice way), and put yourself first and slowly adjust, in your own time, to life without your husband. yes it is a great loss, but you will emotionally “improve”, for want of a better word. People do not “get over” losses such as yours, and nor should they in reality. it is not something you simply “get over”. But you will “readjust” in time, you will have a joke or remember the positive things you had. Like I said, you know what is best for you. Those who cannot accept your decisions have the problem, not you. Take care.

You have your reasons, and the are valid, they are not heartless, they are not cruel, and they do not impact on anyone else no matter what anyone else says. My monther died 4th March this year also. I was there for the family wake and the funeral, but the public wake (which i KNOW my very shy, private mother would not have wanted) i just couldn’t face. My two faced sister said it was fine, and tasked me with minding my nephew, her son for the day and their dog, and told me it was fine and that i was doing her a favour because my nephew, who was very close to his nana, didnt want to be there either. Well, i found out from a close friend who was there that she complained behind my back for ‘leaving it all to her’, even though the wake was at her house! i lived with my mother and was her carer, i was there all the time yet she judged me for not helping her the one day she was given any responsibility. I also feel like i was judged by co-workers for not being there, and judged for returning to work 10 days later instead of what, taking 6 months off like one woman at work did when she lost her father? Public wakes are a strange thing; people want to pay their respects, but also go out of nosiness.
Kathryn February 18, 2020 at 2:07 am
My father was well thought of in the community. Life at home was another matter entirely. Two of my siblings and I ended up completely estranged from him. I did attempt to make contact the last 3 months of his life; very unpleasant visits, but I did make the effort. He died a year ago at the age of 91, on his birthday. At his insistence, there was no obituary, no funeral, no memorial service- nothing at all. He was cremated- I’m not even sure where the ashes are. In my early adulthood, he and I had a conversation about how the funeral is for the living, for comfort from others, and closure. His dying wish was completely fulfilled; it was his last effort to inflict pain on the people he supposedly loved.
Jennifer Underwood February 21, 2020 at 5:42 pm
I know this was posted awhile ago, but I never had a funeral for my mother because she said she didn’t want one and my siblings abandoned her years ago. I always felt guilty about not having a funeral . I did have a memorial lunch with her friends , but until I read all of your posts, I thought I was the only person that did not have a funeral. Thank you all, you have helped me more than you will ever know.
Emma Tylor November 13, 2019 at 2:54 am
Great article and very helpful
Kathy Small November 12, 2019 at 2:53 pm
My husband passed April 2018. I did not have a funeral. I had him cremated. He is in an urn on his clothes chest where I see him everyday. I could not accept his death, still can’t. He was suppose to come right home after an endoscopy. Things went wrong and I lost him. I was devastated. I still am today. His death has been an everyday struggle. I still can’t believe it. I was never in a good place to plan a funeral. I have finally been able to plan a memorial service for him. My son, I believe, begrudges me for waiting so long to have this memorial. I cannot help my feelings. It has taken me a long time to get to this point. I don’t believe people can understand how you feel after losing your spouse of 40 years. I feel so empty. Anyway, how do I make my son understand why I waited so long?
BB January 2, 2020 at 10:54 am
I’m so sorry about your husband’s death. I too have been married a long time, and I can’t imagine how awful and empty you must feel. Maybe it would help if you write a letter to your son and explain your feelings the way you did here. Though some people will never understand our pain and what we’re going through in times of loss, such a letter may give your your son a better understanding of the depth of your grief.
I wish I was there to give you a hug. Please take good care of yourself.
Jenny Funeral Flowers November 10, 2019 at 6:51 am
I foI agree with all of you 100%! If you really care for someone, while they are a live, spend some time with them! Time passes so fast, just like the blink of an eye.. I want my flowers while I am alive!
Joanne Boyton November 2, 2019 at 3:29 am
I am in the process of trying to find a medical university in NSW Australia which will accept my body for medical science when I die. For all, I am out of their ‘catchment’ area. Yes, that is their word for it! I too was raised by a narcissistic mother as stated by other’s in this form. Perhaps I do not feel important enough to be celebrated.
Cissy November 11, 2019 at 9:47 pm
I have looked into this as well, but I am morbidly obese, and they don’t accept morbidly obese bodies.
Emma Tylor September 24, 2019 at 4:11 am
everyone has there own way of expressing there feeling when they lost someone. One of them is having Funerals which gives opportunities to the Family and friends to express the there deepest feeling, thoughts, love, respect and the precious moments that they shared with someone who is important and lost.
Margaret Quinn September 9, 2019 at 1:13 am
My children never come to visit or phone me although I was the one who raised them their father walked out with a younger woman when my 4 kids were small .I was a very good mother to them and gave them plenty of love and affection but when the boys got married I was cast aside one of the daughter in laws is a trouble maker but my son refuses to see that . I don’t have sister brothers auntie or uncles the only family I have are my 4 kids .I feel so left out of their lives I am just downright depressed. I want to sort my affairs out very soon but like that what’s the point in a mass and funeral all that stuff when they don’t give a dame about me I don’t know what to do all advice would be appreciated
Debbie September 11, 2019 at 10:22 pm
Dear Margaret,
I felt like I wanted to reach out to you -your message on here really got my attention. I’m terribly sorry that you are feeling like this. Let them know that you love them and be there for them (as they will come back you will see) but in the meantime, please I encourage you to live your life to the fullest. I’m not sure if counseling could be an option, but it would be helpful to have someone to talk this over with. Perhaps try and join a group or something that you would enjoy. You deserve happiness and sound like such a sweet and loving person. Sending my prayers from over the internet for peace for you.
Dennis February 16, 2020 at 10:01 am
Dear Margaret, your kids gave you the best opportunity for self-love. Love yourself so much that it does not matter who calls you.
Kelly Barner October 14, 2020 at 10:15 pm
Dear Margaret,I am so very sorry that your children have made you feel this way,bringing them up on your own must’ve been extremely difficult on you and you deserve their eternal love and gratitude. I am a disabled wife and mother of two teenage daughters and I cannot even begin to understand how much this must’ve hurt you,the abandonment of their father would’ve been bad enough but because you had children you stuck in there and did the best job you could,I so desperately hope this gets fixed,I know this will be hard but I’m positive you have what it takes,but you might have to be the one that initiates this,I honestly think you deserve them in your life as soon as possible so that no more time gets lost,I am sending you a huge hug and support,never forget how you could’ve given up on them but you did your best every day,take care,kelly
Gail Crutcher August 31, 2019 at 6:21 pm
My disdain for funerals only grows as years go by, and I do not want to attend another one, nor do I want one for my husband or myself. When others choose to attend them, that it their choice, but they need not feel the need to criticize others for their choice to not attend them. Tho a funeral is a long standing tradition in many or most places, I have never come away from one being glad for it. I understand that this kind of tradition is hard to die, excuse me please, the viewing of a body is totally unnecessary as far as I’m concerned. You may save you time and money on mine, and just get on without me! My grandfather was a casket salesman, and I’m well aware of the huge profit in funerals. Funeral homes would be non existent, and how sad would that be? I have no doubt that this tradition will continue long after my demise, but you can let yourself off the hook in regard to attending mine.
Sheryl September 27, 2019 at 8:21 am
I feel the same.No funeral for me.
mary December 3, 2019 at 4:36 am
i like your comment..and it makes sense to me.
I now have a profoundly disabled spouse- he rarely gets friends visit him- and sometimes when i think about him passing i think if there was a funeral and these friends turned up i would actually want to hurt them- how dare people who haven’t come see us in life think they can show their respects all the hard stuff is over!! my spouse said they don’t want a funeral so i might be quite happy to respect this if not just for the reason i might be arrested at it.
BB January 2, 2020 at 3:43 pm
I feel the same. Funerals are certainly on the decline as they’re so expensive. Most people that I know can’t afford one.

We were fortunate to have both my parents (until recently) when my father passed in February 2019 at the early age of 90 and my mother in June 2019 (4 months to the day) at the early age of 88. My mother opted to have a breakfast in honor of my Dad with us just getting together and talking about him. While everyone attended, I heard nothing of complaints from my sisters (who don’t go to church on a regular basis ) that they could not believe she did not have a memorial service. She and Dad prearranged cremation and handling of the remains to be disposed of in the Gulf of Mexico as they loved the beach so much. She wanted the same for her when her time came.
Now my sisters have opted to take her remains and dispose of her themselves AND have a memorial service which she did not want with flowers and a priest. Additionally, they are waiting a month past when she died and are having it during the week when my family and I cannot attend. They then accused me of not wanting to attend a family get together (I am 500 miles from everyone else).
First, I am livid that they are not abiding by her wishes. I lost my best friend and parent too and I am trying to abide by her wishes..
Am I wrong to be angry at them for doing exactly what she did not want. In my opinion, it is not their choice.

my husband died in august 2018 after a long illness. we both decided that we wished to donate our bodies for scientific research. his body was taken for this purpose and cremated quietly once the research was completed. there was no ceremony, ritual or religious service as my husband wished. my daughter wanted me to go to any memorial service that was organised for him by the research people. i told her that if that was what she wanted then i would go with her but she must respect her dad’s wishes and understand how he felt. i am not religious and agree with the idea that religious ceremonies and funerals are pure money grabbers. the funeral company who took my husband to the research place supplied a coffin costing 900euro before consulting me. i was furious and complained that i should have been given a chance to choose. all my memories of 58 years with this lovely man are available to me at any time without the help of a memorial service.

Hubby and I have already decided on no service of any kind. If you love and care about us you share our life! Those who have abandoned us will not get the chance to be the “victim” aka center of attention at a funeral. You walked away from us!!
We have instructions for our closest friends and family to take a vacation in our name. We love travel so this is the best way to honour us.

My mother just died, a few hours ago in the early morning. We were not close, in fact, she had a narcissistic personality disorder and was very toxic. don’t feel much, even the relief I expected, just yet. There will be no funeral. I am an only child, she was as well. My dad died a few years ago. I am waiting for the shit to hit the fan from the other relatives, as they are catholic. Just an aunt and cousins. But I refuse to celebrate her life. Nothing to celebrate. I would feel like a hypocrite. She didn’t suffer, after a massive stroke a month ago. She will be buried alongside my dad.
Kris June 27, 2019 at 11:27 pm
I feel the same way. My mother is 80. She’s said and done some horrific things you don’t do to your own child. It wasn’t physical abuse but mental which is constantly stuck in my head day in and day out. I don’t want to hear people tell me how wonderful she was. I didn’t get any of that. I know her SIL will be pissed with no memorial but she doesn’t like me anyway. I often wonder why I was born to the people who are my parents. I can’t call it a family.
Josie July 20, 2019 at 5:13 am
My mother-in-law recently died a month after her only child (my husband) died. She was a super-narcissist and treated him terribly as a child. He had lasting memories of the emotional abuse he endured. She never liked me even though I was always there for any help she needed. She treated me terribly too , but I grew accustomed to the nasty remarks. She had a church community that saw only a sweet little old lady who was completely different from the person we dealt with on a daily basis. I am really torn as to her funeral, memorial, and burial. My husband wanted no funeral for her, just cremation. Now that he is gone it is up to me and my two grown children to decide what to do. There are only three of us living relatives. We all agree about wanting no ceremony or gathering but I know her church people expect this big event to happen. Do we do what we want or do something they expect? She would have wanted “the-bigger-the-better” event….all show.
Joe Keaton April 3, 2019 at 10:33 am
I’m 57, single, come from an Irish Catholic family and I don’t want a wake or funeral. I have a couple of brothers with families, a few cousins and a handful of friends so there’s not much point to having a wake where maybe 20-25 people will show up, and since I’m not religious I don’t see the point of a formal funeral. I’d rather have whatever money I leave behind go to the people in my will rather than to a funeral home and a church. And besides, I’ve made nothing of my life nor have I accomplished anything so what is there to memorialize? I just want to be cremated, scattered and forgotten.
Marie April 28, 2019 at 1:42 pm
I totally agree with you Joe…I am going to do exactly the same. No funeral just some letters to individuals to let them know.
If nieces, nephews can’t make the effort to visit while I’m alive, what’s the point of them travelling miles to see me off!
My husbands funeral was traditional and people arrived for his funeral, even two of his sons, they didn’t bother making any attempt to visit while he was poorly
So that’s my plan and I will organise soon, just in case
I have some very good friends and they are very important to me but they will be made aware and I’ll just leave £500 for them to have a few drinks if they wish. Seems more logical and way cheaper. Cost of my husbands funeral was £4000 not including the memorial stone
Debbie September 11, 2019 at 10:26 pm
Joe, sending a note to let you know that you have impacted this world more than you’ll probably ever know. You matter dearly and I just wanted to send a reply here to reach out.
Sam February 22, 2019 at 4:12 am
I want neither a funeral nor memorial service. It may be selfish but I don’t want to still be burden to others after I’m dead. I don’t want people to cry or spend their money on coming out to say goodbye, nor do Iwant people to blame each other because they didn’t know I passed and saying, “Why didn’t you tell me?”
Same way I feel about receiving gifts and presents. I don’t deserve or desire any acknowledgement to anything I’ve done to help people or be there for others in time of need. I just feel that when I go, it should go unnoticed and quietly buried.
Shaleria Davis January 23, 2019 at 11:25 pm
My father passed away and I was just getting to know him but I don’t anyone on his side of the family. They’re having a funeral but I don’t feel like “Family” to them. I just want to tell my dad goodbye but I don’t want to be apart of the ceremony……I was thinking I could be there before the ceremony starts and leave before his family gets there. I’m so confused but I don’t want to be uncomfortable either….. RIP to my dad, I’ll miss you.
Ashwell Jonas November 15, 2018 at 3:58 am
I feel, if you weren’t there for me in Life, i dont want you there for me in death! When you make a choice, you have to be able to bare all consequences of that choice, and if you chose to not share my life, you cant hold any grudges and would have to live with the regret of not getting a chance to say goodbye, and in that hopefully future relationships will be improved as to avoid such an experience with those still alive!
Nadine Brazel September 16, 2018 at 7:17 pm
My mother died on February 10 th 2018 at 9:37 am. My twin brother, wife to be and I were there with her. She died quietly and we sat with her for hours went and ate and that was it. He got the card board box a few day later with her ashes. We are estranged I have not spoken to him since. He is not ok in my book he had problems with my mother. He wanted me to arrange the funeral yet I am in an impossible situation and have absolutely no means to accomplish arranging any funeral. He is in the position and has many people who could support him with arranging it. He is getting married in on aSeptember 27 th , and I think it is absurd and an affront to my mother’s memory. To celebrate a new beginning while never honoring where you began life. I was thinking of wearing black to his wedding. I’m not a big fan of him or his wife to be I think he is a monster: My question what do you think of what I may do in rebellion of his wedding , aside from my immature stance and statement -I’d be making by wearing black to his wedding. Thank you Nadine
Polly Etymology December 17, 2018 at 3:01 pm
I hope you did not attend his wedding.
Mary June 7, 2018 at 4:54 am
I do not want a funeral when I die. I simply want to be taken from the place of my death and buried. Funerals are nothing more than money making scams for those in the business, and performance centers for the phony, crocodile tear bearing relatives. If you love and respect a person, you show them that while they are alive to know about it and appreciate it. I have a relative who has sold off land that belonged to all of his siblings, yet, my mom was the only one excluded from reaping any benefits of her parents land out of all the siblings. My mom had been sick a long time with dementia and has now passed on. This same relative, only visited my mom when he happened to be in town for another reason, but never specifically for her. He only did it to save face in case someone should find out he in town. Mom spent the last week of her life in the hospital. He did not show up because he had decided that she was going to die anyway, so why make two trips, just wait for her to die then show up at the funeral pretending to care. However, he and all of the other phonies ended up being disappointed. Never caring to put money in the ground and knowing the phonies who would show up, I had long decided that a funeral of performance art would not take place. Now, the whole “family” is upset because they were not given the opportunity to travel from afar, put on their performances, show off their clothes, and brag about their lives. They are the same ones who disrespected her, sponged off her, and didn’t bother to visit. Now they’re so-called upset. This same relative who waited for her death thinking he’d show up at the funeral, has shown his true colors. Since her passing, he has told lies on me and to me. This only proves that I was right to not have a funeral.
MC February 9, 2019 at 1:05 pm
I want this too. I want to go from mortuary to the ground without ceremony. I had a small family and a few friends and now live alone. My closest friends are out of state. My only grown daughter, bipolar, has become an enemy; not spoken TO me in 3 years now, she only speaks bad ABOUT me. She has taken away and brainwashed against me my sweet and innocent granddaughter who I practically raised. My daughter is now almost 40, and has had another baby whom I am not supposed to know about. She said nothing when my brother died, and he had wanted to pay for the granddaughter to go to college. I expect she will say nothing when my elderly parents pass, tho they sent her gifts every Christmas and birthday. I certainly do not want her at my funeral or in charge of any arrangements. I can’t imagine anyone else having to do this either. I would like to pre arrange to be buried in a plot next to my brother and parents, all 4 plots and headstones already purchased, without any ceremony or services or words spoken. By people who do not know me. If anyone wishes to come and look at our headstones after all is said and done, or not, that is up to them, fine with me. Estate will go to charity, where it will do some good for someone(s) more deserving who appreciate receiving it. Maybe some for my granddaughter……..?.
Jennifer November 9, 2017 at 10:31 pm
My heart breaks reading about your mom’s passing & the way your brothers have handled this situation. Shame on them! Your mother sounds like a very wonderful & sweet lady and it’s too bad that you were not given the God given privilege to mourn her death in the way in which you do needed & deserved. Bless you??.
MARY DOYLE July 22, 2017 at 4:54 pm
IF YOU’VE OUTLIVED YOUR FRIENDS & YOUR SON HAS INFORMED HIS WIFE THAT HE NEVER HAD A GOOD DAY IN HIS LIFE WITH ME, WHY WOULD YOU HAVE A MEMORIAL MASS ?
Jan July 19, 2017 at 10:12 pm
My husband just died 2 days ago after a short but devastating illness at age 78. My children are grown and like me, don’t want a big funeral. Just a private scattering of ashes. My husband was well liked, family on both sides all get along. His family is catholic and want a funeral and mass. They are willing to travel across the country to attend. Friends and past co-workers want to come. I don’t want a public service because I don’t want to deal with the attention and interactions. Also it is expensive. My husband and I talked about lots of things but not the funeral ideas. With his religious background he probably would like a funeral. The kids and I dread it big time. I’m wondering if I am being too selfish.
l June 22, 2017 at 11:10 pm
What a great topic. My mom was clear she did not want a funeral. Her words were something to the effect of not wanting a “pity party.” Instead I waited until there was a date when we could have a celebration of life gathering in her state where her friends were. It was difficult planning everything long distance but everything was so wonderful and I felt it would have made her happy. No pity party. People sharing good memories and i was able to hear stories from her peers that I didn’t know. So glad i knew what she wanted.
Laurie Lane June 3, 2017 at 8:09 am
I’m not having a funeral for my mother. Because I truly believe that we should love and celebrate people while they are alive. Who needs people coming from every where pretending to care when a person is dead but while they were sick for years no one shows up or even calls. Now I’m suppose to put myself under extra stress planning and putting together a funeral for people who acted like my mother didn’t exist when she was alive. The devil is a lie. I don’t want to hear all those fake people make untrue statements like, “If you need anything let me know?” Hell the person is dead now. People if someone means something to you don’t wait until they are dead to show up and act like you care. Show the person while they are alive. It’s insane to pop up at a funeral and you haven’t even talked to the person in 30 years talking bout, “I’ m sure gone miss Sally.” Get out of hear. Show love while they’re alive and you’ll never need to say it.
Kay November 14, 2017 at 11:42 am
I agree with you 100%! If you really care for someone, while they are a live, spend some time with them! I want my flowers while I am alive!
Fatina Moore Weston February 9, 2018 at 7:23 am
All the right
Work I’ve been saying and looking for in this post .
I don’t want a funeral Sorry not Sorry. Like you said people be sick for years and not one phone call. Some people go to funerals to even judge .. it’s a show for many. When I was younger I thought ? if I die. I want a grand funeral. Will keep a big insurance policy just for this occasion . I’m glad I didn’t die young. I want to live my life and when I live this earth ?. I Don’t want a funeral period !!!!!! I don’t want a viewing of my body !!!!! I want to go straight from Morgue to Buied at grave site . I do however love ❤️ flowers ?. They are more than welcome to have a honorable celebration in my name. All the pictures and people can talk about me Have a program paper ?
Julie May 4, 2017 at 10:43 pm
My dad passed away recently. Nobody gave a eulogy at the funeral. I thought the pastor was going to talk more about my dad. He hardly mentioned him. This has bothered me ever since. We had a photo slide show during visitation. But I feel like without having a eulogy we didn’t tell that my dad’s life mattered. I feel tremendous guilt.
Cshen September 23, 2017 at 11:47 am
Hi, just wanted to say that I can relate. We didn’t give dad a funeral. Now his ashes are at home. Though mom’s actually telling me we should keep him not at home since it’s bad to have the dead in your house.
What I’m trying to say is, it’s okay. You know what’s important is that you shared his life with him. And you loved him. And when you remember him, you think of the good things, memories that brings a smile to your face (even if they also make you cry sometimes). We loved our dad because they loved us. Once upon a time, when they were alive, they loved us and we loved them back.
I’m sure our dads wouldn’t want us guilty. If anything, because we are their daughters, they would tell us to screw the judgers and just let ourselves be happy. We are the living. And right now, it’s our chance to live and be happy 🙂
Francis Clarke May 3, 2017 at 2:11 pm
My wife is dying. She has little time left. Her family will be furious they realise that we’ve opted for ‘no funeral’. However, given that no-one from her clan has ever been to visit or show any concern then the whole ceremony would be nothing more than a ridiculous circus. The only possible reason for a family to attend the funeral would be to keep up appearances. So, I shall deal with the formalities without fuss or celebration. I intend to gather a few friends and dine in the warmth of beautiful memories and gentle conversation. After forty years of marriage and years of caring for her without support, there can be no other way.
Janet April 21, 2017 at 12:31 pm
My personal opinion is: funerals, memorial services, etc. are for the living. I will be gone. I want my children to do whatever they feel they need to do. If they want to cremate me and split me up – that’s fine. If they want a viewing and burial – that’s fine. It is up to them and they know it. It will paid for by my life insurance so they will know what they have available financially. That’s just how I feel; I’m not pushing my opinion on anyone else.
marie graham April 16, 2017 at 8:06 am
Totally agree with no funeral or service,im not keen on religion or tradition either,so why woud I participate in either,and its a waste of good money as well,just keeping the funeral business going,id rather leave the small amount I have to my family,so they can maybe get a holiday or something after I’m gone,a more fitting memorial to me,id rather they sat with a few glasses of champagne on holiday than watch my body get lowered to the ground,x
Maggie January 17, 2017 at 8:52 am
I want to leave my body for whatever spare parts may be useful to others or to medical science. I really don’t see the point in any sort of memorial service, though there are a few pieces of music I’d like to have my loved ones take time listen to and hopefully appreciate. I’ll be compiling these onto a CD, and setting aside what a funeral would have cost, so they can all go off to a villa in Spain for a week and have a jolly good holiday, possibly (their choice) with a few fond memories of me thrown in.
Jesse G May 12, 2017 at 1:06 pm
I like your thoughts….I have no money to offer….I’m just looking to get out of all the silliness…no matter what they will have to deal with their demons. No matter where they go. I’m not sure how to die without dealing with the funeral and all the nonsense…I wish I knew a serial killer so I could just dissapear.
Z. November 29, 2016 at 3:50 pm
I’m single and retired. The only family I have are my brother’s 2 ex-wives that hate each other. Through the years they have put me in the middle forcing me to choose them and my nephews. Whenever one find out I visited the other one, they go out of their way to punish me by mean and hurting me. Although I love my nieces and nephews, these women pulled them to their side and I’m left alone. There is no pleasing them and I have just learned to stay away. I’m almost 70 and in good health but do think about when I die. All I want is to be cremated and have my ashes spread at sea. Who will do it? I have friends but in other states.
W June 6, 2016 at 4:16 am
I am 55 old mother of 3 and not happily married. I love my children to bits and they know the circumstances of my marriage. My parents got divorced when I was 8 and we ended up in boarding schools all our lives. I always wanted to be happily married but it was never mend to be. At this stage I feel hopeless and alone and life does not have any meaning. I am thinking of committing suicide and wish not to have a funeral. I want to spare my kids explaining to family members the married life I had.
Litsa June 6, 2016 at 9:59 am
W, If you are having any thoughts of hurting yourself. It is so common to feel as if there is no way out other and suicide but please know there are ALWAYS other ways. You are not alone – you have children you love and, though being stuck in an unhappy marriage can feel helpless, hopeless, and consuming suicide is not the only option. I would encourage you to connect with a therapist right away as well, which a suicide hotline or emergency room can help with. When we are so stuck in the midst of a life situation it can feel impossible to find hope or any way out. A therapist may be able to help you consider how to move forward. If you have experienced or are experiencing abuse/domestic violence in your relationship please know there is a tremendous amount of support. Beyond just counselors and support groups there are domestic violence shelters that can provide you safe transitional housing. This website has a locator for services.. Please take care and seek help and support right away – the world and your kids deserve to have you here. I know it may not feel like it, but there is life beyond your current situation. Please tell us what other support you feel like you might need and we will see if we can connect you with the services you need.
jifjoan August 23, 2016 at 3:23 am
suicide would really hurt your kids this is not the way put them first please
Pauline September 25, 2016 at 9:35 pm
To W. (and anyone else who may be thinking about ending their life): Please don’t do it. Your children love you, and more importantly, God loves you. You are precious to him. Don’t let the circumstances of your life dictate your value. You are infinitely valuable to God and to this world. He has a purpose and a plan for your life. You are not here by accident. There is help and there is hope.
Jeremiah 29:11 “For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil..”
Whatever difficulties you may be going through, suicide is not the answer. It is just a lie from Satan, who has come to kill, steal, and destroy. Jesus has come to give you life more abundantly (John 10:10)
Please make use of the resources mentioned above, but more importantly, ask God to make himself real to you and to surround you with his love. I prayed for you today.
John 3:16 “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, so that whosoever believes in him, shall not perish but have everlasting life.” God loves you so much that he gave his only son for you. All you have to do is believe, ask him to forgive your sins,and trust in Him. He is our only true hope.
My family and I have experienced this recently, when my Dad suddenly passed away in March of this year. We miss him a lot and we are grieving, but we have hope. We know that the separation is temporary and that we will see him again. We are experiencing the Lord’s amazing comfort, provision, and peace throughout this difficult time. My hope is that this testimony is an encouragement for those of you who are dealing with grief. The pain is real, but God is much more real. He is more than willing to give you comfort, peace and healing. All you have to do is turn to him. If anyone has questions or you just want to talk, please let me know.
Brandi May 26, 2016 at 12:55 am
My daughter passed away at two months old from a blood clot in her heart. She was born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and many more heart defects. Had surgeries and more surgeries to find out she declined from a blood clot. Anyway, we chose to have her cremated, the funeral home offered free services but we declined them. Instead we had a celebration of life sort of gathering for all of her supporters, and family. We didn’t bury her, we kept her ashes in a little urn and some in urn necklaces and she will be buried with us when the time comes.
Sonia May 28, 2017 at 5:48 am
I think that’s lovely you’ve kept your wee daughters ashes to bury with yourselves when the time comes. X.
Liz Cornish May 11, 2016 at 9:26 am
I’m Catholic and I’m not having a wake, funeral Mass, or committal service. I’m having a direct cremation with no services of any type. There will be no obituary. There will be no newspaper announcements. My son will be responsible for getting my ashes to my niche. This is all set up legally so my wishes have to be followed. Why? This is what I want. In this case it IS all about me. I consider funerals to be a total waste of everyone’s time and in this case, my money. What I consider a much better use of my money is to make sure as much of it as possible goes to my son. He’ll need it more than I will. He’s the only family I have. Yes, my parish priests aren’t happy with me but they’ll respect my wishes. Friends aren’t happy but agree that it is my choice and they’ll respect my wishes. To each his or her own. If having a service helped you that’s great. Funerals have never been important in my family. They’re not at all important to me and as I said earlier, they’re just a waste of time and money.
GreyBull May 4, 2016 at 4:44 pm
As a funeral Director I will say this… A ritual to mark the end of a life need not be traditionally religious at all but a ritual is the way cultures in all times and places have marked significant events in their communities. Religious holidays like Christmas and Hanukkah carry traditions that have been around for generations. Babies are often christened or dedicated. We gather to celebrate the marriage of friends. Birthdays call for cake and candles. Why would we allow the death of a loved one to pass without ceremony? Rituals are not optional to a healthy culture: they tell us where we’ve been, they bind us together and they give us courage for the journey ahead.
The ritual of the funeral or the memorial service has several purposes. First of all, it helps mourners recognize the loss as real and to acknowledge the death not just in fact but also in feeling and even for just the short time of the service we give ourselves permission to experience the loss and grieve.
We also gather to celebrate the life that is now gone from us, to recollect and to remember, as in “to make whole again”. I have to remind families all of the time THE SERVICE IS NOT FOR THE DEAD, IT IS FOR THE LIVING. If the service is done well, the service will bring at least a partial sense of closure to the void that one feels at these times. The purpose of all ritual is transformation; we come to the service in one state and we leave in another. ( we come as “bereaved” and leave as mourners” there is a transformation that takes place. So again, the service is not for the deceased it is for the living. I do not feel as though it is fit for someone to tell their family they do not want a service, it is not for them it is for their family and to make a family member feel guilty about having a service because they need it to heal is not just wrong, but immoral. Allow your friends and family a chance to say their peace whether they were there for you in life or not. Furthermore in my experience professionally and personally, problematic people are the most difficult for survivors to release in death. These mourners who must now give up hope that the loved one will ever change or the relationship will ever be better. These brokenhearted ones are the ones who need to grasp a larger picture of the deceased in order to forgive and move on. A service can sometimes help them move in the direction of healing.
Now speaking personally as a griever I am 29 years old and lost my mother November 16, 2014 and then my father January 26, 2016… I will say this.. I found the planning of my mothers service to be very therapeutic. It forced me to address the fact that my mother was gone… it was very real for me. I got to hear stories from her friends that I had never met, I got to see her estranged best friend weep over the loss of a wonderful woman there was forgiveness in that. I found healing in a service for her.
I’m not saying you must, must, must have a funeral but i am saying you must, must, must do something to recognize that person and acknowledge your grief. whether it be a full fledged funeral or a beer in the park. You have to do something for your own grief.
suzie April 11, 2019 at 4:05 am
My mum chose a direct cremation amd although this concept was challenging for some of her family, we honoured it and had a private “service” where we got together and I delivered a eulogy of a kind. This marked her passing and will allow us all to start the grieving process. I agree that a funeral/service is for the living. However. I also think that we had to follow her wishes. Had we decided to have a funeral or more formal service, then thr living close to her may have wanted differemt things and that may have led to tensions shich was the last thing she would have wanted. Funerals are constructs, they can take many forms!
Jimmy April 29, 2016 at 11:37 am
Please comment on a situation whereby a few key members in a family decided to not have a funeral for their mother because in life she embarrassed them due to her excessive drinking. This decision left the remainder of the family without any chance to begin closure.
Josephine Yates April 22, 2016 at 9:38 am
My kids know I don’t want a funeral, but if I talk about it they just say ‘don’t be daft. I am the only one of my generation, so I’ve been to all the funerals for all the grandparents, parents and relations.. I DO NOT WANT A FUNERAL! If they want my body for experiments or spare parts, they can take them, I’m not going to need them!
Margo April 21, 2016 at 12:38 pm
When my dad dies I want to give him a private, immediate family only funeral. Because his family (my extended family, likes my uncles, aunts, cousins) are complete jerks and have treated my mother and I like crap for many years. I don’t even speak to them so why would I want them there??? Also his church “family” are awful too, real “christians” and I want no part of them. He is not going to be there, he’ll be dead. Maybe he wants a huge funeral, but honestly, isn’t the funeral more for the surviving family members than the deceased? And if that’s the case why on earth would I want horrible people around me at a time like this??? I don’t think you “owe” it to anyone to have a big public funeral. Maybe people should learn to be a little more kind then things like this wouldn’t have to happen.

To Angelalala,
I tried to reply and couldn’t, but thank you for your post. I took care of my husband for three years with very very little help from friends or family. When he was nearing death they got very pushy about what I should do and not do. Not only was I emotionally devastated, but I was physically exhausted. I wanted just to bury him by myself. They pushed for everyone ro be there, even his “friends” who were being mean to me, and trying to take advantage. OK, made it through that. Now, six months on, they’ve all decided to have a big memorial for him. Great. Do it. Cool. But am I going? No, thank you.

I am sorta autistic, when people die it is sad but life is so hard for me it fills like a load will be lifted when we die and all feelings Will be expressed with out anymore difficulty, so what is the big deal.

Janey… I agree that funerals are for the living. So… I’d only attend for myself, or my brother, or my children, my mother… or heck I might even go for my father’s neighbor’s great nephew… but I’d never go just because “etiquette’ seemed to demand it.
Janey Dowe November 22, 2015 at 9:53 pm
(sorry, posted too quickly, so to continue…)
…I want a private viewing, quick cremation, and a private intermnet. Nothing more”. Dad was very very insistent on that. I put the words in capital letters above because that’s how he sounded, it was that emphatic. Well, Dad passed 3 weeks later and sure enough, the first question was “do we enbalm Dad?”. I said “NO” and related the above to both siblings. All was understood. We had a private family viewing, then a cremation. The day afterwards, my brother said, and I’ll quote as best as I can “Well, funerals are for the living and Mom wants a funeral so we’re having a funeral”. I said that I wouldn’t be part of a funeral as that isn’t what Dad wanted. This was at the beginning of September. I’ve had no word on where Dad’s remains are nor their disposition until 20 minutes ago, when I got an email saying “Dad’s funeral service and memorial service are on x day at x time at x location”. Less than a week away. I really don’t think it would be right to attend a funeral as this is not what Dad wanted. Mom has Alzheimer’s, has no recollection of the family viewing nor cremation, and is very confused about the upcoming events. I have no idea what a funeral service and a memorial service will be on the same day at the same time. I don’t want to call Brother as he has psychiatric issues and no good ever comes from calling Brother (there is alot more going on with respect to Dad’s estate and his refusal to acknowledge that my Sister and I have legal responsibility for Mom’s health and not him, but that’s another story for another day). Bottom line is this: Dad did not want what is being planned. I’m torn, as I really don’t believe I should go, but on the other hand, it would seem etiquette wise out of place not to be there. Husband is all for honoring Dad’s wishes. I don’t need the “closure” as I spent the last 12 weeks of his life caretaking for him and Mom and had a chance to say my goodbyes and we parted on exceptionally close and loving terms. Any thoughts out there?
Janey Dowe November 22, 2015 at 9:44 pm
Currently in a bind about this exact topic. Before my Dad passed, he specifically and expressly told me, point-blank, that Mom had a certain view of what would happen when he passed. He said and I’ll quote as best as I can “Your mother thinks that when I go, she’ll have a big funeral with a priest saying nice words at St. Joe’s Church. I DON’T WANT THAT.
MinaRibeiro September 23, 2015 at 1:08 am
I too do not want a funeral. I have be unwell for a long time.
I do not get any support from my friends or family.
What is the point of a funeral, when all they will do when I am gone is to shed crocodile tears and enjoy themselves at the reception. It is a total waste of funds.
Vicki August 25, 2015 at 2:29 pm
Wow. I thought a funeral was explicitly for viewing a body; and that a memorial was for a cremation but also a confirmed death. Even though you don’t see the remains in a cremated person, you know that at least someone did before the rite took place and the information comforts you, especially in light of knowing someone who never had any confirmation. That’s why my family didn’t have a funeral right away for Eric, who died in the World Trade Center. We had to wait and wait and wait to have ANY kind of service bc we were expecting the arrival of “evidence to confirm a physical death.”
It’s coroner talk. There are also unconfirmed deaths and that’s what ours eventually became; none of the DNA samples we gave to them ever matched any of their evidence.
I learned of other people who had loved ones who died on September 11 and they went through similar experiences. One person’s son’s remains were identified on Valentine’s Day 2002 but his daughter-in-law was still missing so they didn’t do the service until they found her remains (along with her unborn child.)
When we finally decided to go ahead with a service anyway, bc it didn’t look like they were going to find anything by 2004, my daughter and I tried to give the eulogy. I say attempted bc we dried up in the middle of the service even though I’m such a talkative head on every other occasion. Nobody in my family would believe I could run to a trickle of words and then dry up but I did.
I wish I would have read that post about how to write a eulogy before this happened. Then we wouldn’t have needed his brother to fill in the silence by saying “There’s a suite of fiery rooms in hell waiting for Osama bin Laden.” Whatever else it did, at least it broke my daughter’s silence and she started talking again. I was too surprised to say anything at first.
My daughter ended the speech by making a quote: No weapon formed against us shall prosper.
I don’t know if that qualifies as a funeral but it was a service and I’ve found nothing even remotely like “closure,” “integration,” or a feeling of “goodbye” in any of this grief work but I haven’t done the full workbook I got from Grief Recovery Method either.
I feel like I’m still waiting for him to return and say there was no body bc he isn’t dead. That must sound silly to most people (it sounds odd to ME at times) but the feeling persists with a singular discomforting relentlessness.
I still have nightmares about him too. After they found Osama bin Laden my night horrors disappeared for over 4 years. A week ago all of it returned. No idea why but it’s given me a feeling of desperation bc I worry it’ll never end. The dreams are hideous. Stephen King couldn’t think up the horrors that visit me in my sleep.
I did the only thing I knew and asked for prayers, although I don’t believe in such a thing anymore.
Seth May 19, 2015 at 4:26 pm
Hey Tracie I am still really broken over loosing my wife in Jan 12 accidental overdose (probably) then her cousin our lover and I struggled to hold each other together but she had 6 children that her ex took from her with a unrelenting series of dhs calls over one hundred attempts at custody till she who whas disabled phisicly and mentality and fought Ss disability for 8 yrs before winning.( to late) her children had been poisoned against her by there father who couldn’t stand seeing her happy. She was at 26 drug Free her ex was using steroids and was out of control. She had us and we were all at times very very happy and totally in love. Lyd was bi- polar( unmedicated for first 10 yrs) I according to her was her rock and could never show emotion or it made her uneasy. Heather was very depressed and would go manic in bed with me not the three of us. She would get out of control wanting to feel and give pain. I had to try to keep control several times I had to take her to Dr afraid I had hurt her but I guess a baby causes more damage. Well around December she told me she was suicidal and had a plan that was failproof when she couldn’t do it anymore she would n gone. We had an agreement because the girls were the way they were and after I found lyd did CPR for 45 min till the ambulance came. Fought the sheriff cause he wouldn’t do CPR and I thought he should. I am trained in first aid CPR and should have known it was way to late. Somehow expected a mirical I guess. The local police attempted to charge me for murder which on top of everything else is the worst feeling in the world to have this whole area of corn and CSI addicts gossiped about me killing my soul mate. Heather n I spiraled out of control went thru all my savings and lyds life insurance all on heroin close to 400,000 cash on dope in 3 yrs. A pretty intense binge. All the dealers wanted me bad enuf to suck my dick.lol. I didn’t leave heather alone for 3 months and we were clean for two weeks. Not sick she seemed happy I swore all danger was past I was asked to so some family a favor the next morning I asked her again if it were okay if I left for a bit she said she was going back k to bed to wake her later. Left came home in I think 4 hours she was under the table dead for they said 2 he’s I struggled thru her vomit and gave her CPR to no avail I got vomit in my lungs and in my attempt to overdose the next two months I got punmonia and as every other time was not successful in overdosing using 4 to 10 times enuf to kill a basketball team. Now I’m in a methadone clinic seeing if I can do the world some good to make up for my girls. If u want hit me up with a text swisner36@gmail.net I’ll send u my number. Maybe we could help eachother somehow. I’m just a broken miserable mess who knows a Lil about hurt. I’m so desperate for something anything to make a difference in someway. Seth. Hey one thing to consider. You don’t want anyone u give two fucks about to find you its something they will be fucked up forever over and mad as hell at u. You would deserve it too. Its just inconsiderate of anyone who took time to plan something out and was to lazy to drive across town and let some other poor asshole have nightmares over your purple face he can’t forget. I don’t believe in much so praying would be pointless. I wish u luck honey
Tori April 29, 2015 at 12:31 pm
It’s no one concern or business. It’s all just conventional tradition.Do what you need to do and what the person you knew and loved would understand.
S Chek January 23, 2015 at 1:37 pm
Litsa, I am putting it in my Will that I want no funeral service. My family isn’t here for me now and the thought of crocodile tears at some funeral circus is extremely unpleasant. I have been to funerals for several family members and friends and those events only made the situation worse for me. Seeing my Dad looking like a wax figure in a box is something that haunts me to this day. I think funerals with the sad music, the rituals, the hokey ham sandwiches in the church basement and the expense only makes people feel worse. Funny how we lasted thousands of years as a people without the word “closure”. Memories are there for us. Going through some odd man-made farce isn’t necessary for all of us.
Litsa February 3, 2015 at 11:01 pm
S Check, I think it is great that you are making your specific wishes known in your will. I am sure you are well aware of this, but do make sure you make your legal next of kin or POA aware in advance, as many times a will isn’t referred to until after funeral decisions are made unless family is aware there are funeral wishes expressed in the document. I absolutely agree that the standard funeral ritual just isn’t right for everyone. I have completely blocked out seeing my dad in the casket at his service, though I know I did. Unfortunately I have ‘wax figure in a box’ images burned in my brain from several other funerals of family and friends. I have told my husband many times, donate whatever someone can use, cremate the rest, and find a really nice picture to remember me by 🙂
Tracey January 7, 2015 at 7:53 pm
I am going to be committing suicide in the near future. I am leaving the decision to have a funeral to my children, my boyfriend, my sisters and my Mother.
I have made it known that I want to be cremated. I would then like my ashes to be buried and a marker with a vase so my family will have a physical place to visit. I’m terribly narcissistic and self centered. Can urns be buried at a cemetery?
Thank you.
Litsa January 8, 2015 at 8:59 am
Tracey, I am so unbelievably sorry for whatever circumstances have made you feel that your only option is suicide. As hard as it is to believe, there are many people here on this page, and well beyond, who have been through the times where they felt their only option was suicide and managed to, slowly but surely, work though to a place where they could find some hope again. If you plan to hurt yourself in anyway, we beg that you please seek professional help right away. You can always just walk into your local emergency room, or you can call the suicide prevention hotline (1-800-273-8255). If you have a counselor, call them.
In terms of your question, yes, urns can be buried in a cemetary. For some families having a place to visit is important, so this is a way someone’s wishes to be cremated can be honored while also offering a shared place to come visit.
I know you did not post this comment asking for help regarding you thoughts of suicide, but please remember that you’re not alone in the feelings that you’re going through and, as hard as it is to believe, it can get better. I wish we had a magic answer to the pain – we don’t. But we do know that with time and help things can and do get better, even when it feels impossible. And, in the words of To Write Love On Her Arms, you cannot be replaced!! Please consider seeking help. I am going to also send you an email – please email us directly if we can help you find help.
Victoria White January 3, 2015 at 3:40 pm
I just found WYG .My husband Jim died very suddenly on January 18,2014. I am still trying to wrap my heart,soul and brain around it. I could not have a conventional funeral as I knew my Jimmie very well. He did tell me he wanted to be cremated. I have a very private shrine of my own in our home which I keep adding to as I continually keep finding important memories and items of his and those we shared together.Yet , still I feel that some type of memorial for Jim’s friends,family and those who I do not even know he knew can say goodbye and honor his amazing presence in their life and mine.The one year anniversary of his death is on my heels,January 18,2015. I do not feel I can do it on this date.His 68th birthday is February 9,2015. Then it is Valentines Day. Why am I having such a pull with this ? Jimmie and I were together for 27 years and I still think he is going to walk through the door. I have seen a therapist once a week since his death and also a physiatrist .Any thoughts or ideas for me out there in “grief land”? Jim and I are/were very unconventional,into nature and never any type of organized religion.I feel I am still Jimmie’s wife and not a widow. I hate that word “widow”.
I am just 59 and it just does not suite me or my personality. My Jimmie would definitely agree with me. I have tried to speak with his two older brothers and they will have nothing to do with me,even though Jim spoke with them several times a week. They said they had to go to Florida last January when I asked if they could make it to a memorial for him.This makes me very sad for my Jim,he adored his two older brothers.
Many heartfelt thanks,
Victoria
Litsa January 4, 2015 at 11:49 am
Victoria, I am so sorry for the loss of your husband. I am sure the holidays must have been incredibly tough, especially so close to the anniversary of losing Jimmie. If you feel like you need some sort of memorial then I think you should absolutely do something. I have a good friend who does an annual dinner on her mom’s birthday at a restaurant that was one of her mom’s favorites. It is nothing overly formal, but just a simple way to get people together to remember her mom. It is typically not extended family, but just a handful of her friends and her moms friends. It is a beautiful but totally low-stress tradition. I suggest this not because it will be right for you, but just to say that a memorial doesn’t have to be something super formal and it doesn’t always have to involve a huge number of people or extended family. Everyone grieves differently, so what works for you may not be right for his brothers. Sometimes we have to focus on doing what works for us and realize it won’t work for everyone and that’s okay.
What you describe about thinking he will walk through the door is so common. If you haven’t read it already, I would recommend the book The Year of Magical Thinking by Joan Didion. It is an incredible memoir on her experience after the loss of her husband. It is one of the few grief memoirs I recommend to people who have lost anyone, but especially someone who has lost a spouse.
Take care and I hope you do spend some time on our site and find some support here!

My husband died after a four year steady decline. He’d been a robust military office who became a thin profoundly disabled quadriplegic who could only move enough muscles to… blink. When he was first diagnosed with Lou Gehrig’s Disease (ALS) we moved to his hometown. He wanted to be surrounded by his childhood friends, his brother, sisters, parents, aunts and uncles. They were all so close he said. They’d be a huge help he thought. He had a family who knew what love meant. His parents came to our house once a week. On Sunday. For an hour. His siblings might have come twice each. In four years. And that includes the day he died because the hospice nurse insisted. Aunts, uncles, friends… not once. In FOUR years. There were never any falling outs, no harsh words, no issues at all. They were just all busy. Jobs, lives, Saturday nights out, Fridays to the movies. Places to go, people to see. Etc. When he died… they were all shocked when I refused to have a funeral. They needed closure. They said. They needed to show their respects. They claimed. But for me… the wife who had loved that man, held his hand, cared for him, faced his coming eternity with him… there was no way I could stand at a funeral and watch ONE of them file past his casket, wiping their eyes, wringing their hands… and exclaiming “what a good man he was” or “how much he’ll be missed.” He’d spent four years learning things about all of them a dying man should never have to learn. I walked away from that grave without a funeral… with my head held high. I didn’t always have everything he needed… he got EVERYTHING I did have… and that was enough closure for me.
Eleanor September 16, 2014 at 1:24 pm
Angela,
I’m so sorry about your husband’s illness and death. Being a caretaker and watching someone you love slowly lose their health is such a stressful and painful thing, I’m sorry it sounds like you went through all this with very little support. Your story is heartbreaking and I understand your rationale for not wanting a funeral.
Eleanor
Gwen April 20, 2016 at 5:02 pm
I agree. Have told my husband I do not want a funeral service etc. Folk do not bother with me now while I am alive, so guess what, I don’t want then around pretending to be sad when I am gone.
Tina May 24, 2016 at 1:49 am
Gwen, I am in agreement with you. I do not want a service and hope that my request will be honored by my spouse. I do not want any of his family members involved with my decision and hope that my wishes are honored.
mary December 3, 2019 at 4:46 am
oh my God – thankyou for writing this.. i was feeling so bad for my anger at not wanting a funeral just to hold an expected service for all the friends and family who have not helped or visited or texted for the past many years of absolute hell for me and my profoundly disabled- paralysed spouse.

Morgan Stewart Wiki Biography
Morgan Stewart was born on 22 May 1988, in Beverly Hills, California USA, and is a blogger and reality television star, best known for being part of the E! reality television series “Rich Kids Of Beverly Hills”. She’s also well known for her blog Boobs and Loubs, which has a high number of followers and visitors. The various endeavors she’s been involved in have helped increase her net worth to where it is now.
How rich is Morgan Stewart? As of early-2016, sources estimate that her net worth is at $5 million, mostly earned through the success of her blog and television show. She’s said to own 200 pairs of Louboutin as a collection, which is the inspiration for her blog name. She also owns a yacht, and a collection of clothes from various luxury designers, which are often showcased in the show, her blog and her Instagram account. However, like many of the cast members of the show, her wealth is mostly a reflection of the success of her parents and family.
Morgan Stewart Net Worth $5 Million
Stewart was born into a rich family, being the daughter of Herb Stewart an internationally renowned architect and owner of H Construct Inc, which focuses on historical restoration and high-end retail. She once tried her hand at a college education, but it did not work out. She studied communications in New York and even contemplated going to medical school but she wasn’t very inclined to pass school. She then established the blog BoobsandLoubs.com, chronicling her luxurious lifestyle. According to her the blog’s title comes from her collection and how she enjoys her own assets. The blog features various posts and is still regularly updated despite various opportunities that Morgan is now engaged in. She previews possible collaborations and opportunities that may be coming soon, and also details her fashion interests, ads, sponsorships, and her daily life.
Eventually she was approached by E! to be part of a new series entitled “Rich Kids Of Beverly Hills”. The show follows a few wealthy people in their twenties and how they go about their lives. The show is currently in its fourth season so has obviously been popular, and so airing and shooting continues. The series started in 2014, and has since had a few changes in cast. Other members of the show have included Taylor Ann Hasselhoff the daughter of David Hasselhoff, Dorothy Wang who is a real-estate mogul heiress, and many others. Since her debut in the show, she’s also made appearances in E!’s various other shows.
For her personal life, it is known that she is engaged to Brendan Fitzpatrick who also stars in “Rich Kids Of Beverly Hills”, and the wedding planning is extensively covered by the television series. The couple is also travelling around the world as a celebration of their engagement. Aside from these, she’s also been featured in publications in interviews especially for the upcoming luxury wedding. Morgan is also known to party excessively and admits that she is a dropout that just lives off her parent’s money. Despite that, her wealth that has been shared through the family’s success has been very high.IbizaPocholo

Trevor was great to work with ... his car was detailed, perfectly clean, and was exactly what we needed. This was my first experience on Turo, so I was concerned about how well it would go. Trevor made it a FANTASTIC experience. I may never use a rental car company again. Thanks Trevor!!!

If there was 10 stars Victor would get it every single fat star available! Victor made this the easiest most enjoyable car rental I’ve ever had! I don’t think I will ever go back to enterprise budget or any of the old school rental agencies. He was professional, he was courteous, he was there when we needed him and he was there when we didn’t! 5 stars X 5 stars! Thank you, Mr. Wang for your superb customer service & excellent hosting skills! The car was clean, the car ran like new, inside and out the car was spotless. I didn’t have to worry about anything, at all! It was my first rental with the app and he walked me through the entire process like a real professionalI ! We had trouble with our itinerary and were able to extended the rental after Chatting with him for just a few seconds! His response time was unbelievable I wondered if he had his phone glued to his hand whenever I had a question he was there immediately! If you’ve ever had to extend your rental with a company like enterprise or budget you know what I mean when I say, “wow this is like night and day!” I can’t thank you enough. I will see you next time & I will share your profile with anyone asking me how my rental went with Turo! Magnificent!!
Gautam was a great trip host. The vehicle was clean and as described. The pickup was painless. He was prompt and accommodating throughout as my plans changed due to bad weather.
I was in town on a family emergency for 5 days. It was smooth sailing from pick up to drop off. The car rode like a dream. It was super clean and Leslie was wonderful to communicate with 5 stars for me!!!
This was a wonderful experience, And Leslie really gave us the best experience I’ve ever had..
Great trip! Super clean upon trip start and very comfy ride - highly recommend!
Shannon was an extremely grateful host. She was very responsive and even when there was a terrible accident on the road which made me late she was so kind to tell me not to worry about it and was more concerned for our traveling safety. I would definitely rent again.
Great car, even greater service! David’s communication was amazing throughout the course of my weekend rental. Car came in immaculate condition. Will be looking forward to using David again in the future!

Sarah was amazing to rent from. She was very accommodating and answered any questions I had quickly. She made my first time using Turo amazing
Tim and his wife did a great job. They responded quickly to all of my questions. The car was an excellent addition to our trip.
The car was very clean, got over twice the mpg of my mercury grand marquis 2008 while it was being repaired, and I had no issues with the vehicle, the seats are also moderately comfortable a little more so then most cars, lower back support could have been better like with most cars, the car was originally filled about 3/8ths of the way with gasoline visually judging by the analog gas meter on the dash at the start of my trip
Tim is very flexible and understanding. Real review from a real person. If I need a rental again I’m checking with Tim 1st!
This was my introduction into the Turo app and it absolutely exceeded my expectations! Victor was such a gracious and personable host. He greeted me upon arrival and was very communicative throughout the entire process. The vehicle was in pristine condition and I had no issues at all. I will definitely be using this app again and if I'm ever back in the neighborhood, I'll be reaching out to Victor as well!
Great car, Chris was there if i needed him for anything just had to call or text.
Easy pickup, reliable and accommodating vehicle. I would recommend and do.Researchers on the Heart for Computational Imaging and Customized Diagnostics (CCIPD) at Case Western Reserve College have used synthetic intelligence (AI) to establish patterns on computed tomography (CT) scans that supply new promise for treating patients with small cell lung cancer.
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) represents about 13% of all lung cancers, however grows quicker and is extra more likely to unfold than non-small cell lung cancer, in response to the American Cancer Society.
And whereas lots of AI analysis has been carried out on non-small cell lung cancer, little work has been completed on SCLC, mentioned CCIPD Director Anant Madabhushi, the Donnell Institute Professor of Biomedical Engineering at Case Western Reserve.
Small cell lung cancer patients could be difficult to deal with, Madabhushi mentioned. His lab labored with oncologists at College Hospitals in Cleveland to assist confirm which SCLC patients would reply to treatment.
The researchers recognized a set of radiomic patterns from CT scans taken earlier than treatment that enable them to foretell a affected person’s response to chemotherapy. In addition they examined the affiliation between AI-derived picture options with longer-term outcomes.
Particularly, the researchers famous that computationally extracted textural patterns of the tumor itself—in addition to the area surrounding it—had been discovered to be totally different in SCLC patients who responded nicely to a sure chemotherapy, in comparison with those that didn’t.
Additional, patterns had been revealed by the AI that corresponded to patients who ended up dwelling longer after treatment in comparison with those that didn’t.
Lastly, the AI revealed that there was notably extra heterogeneity, or variability, in the scanned pictures of patients who didn’t reply to chemo and had poorer probabilities of survival, Madabhushi mentioned.
What’s subsequent: Potential human trials
These findings from a retrospective study now units the stage for potential AI pushed medical trials for treatment administration of SCLC patients, Madabhushi mentioned.
Outcomes from the analysis had been revealed in Frontiers in Oncology in October.
Their findings are important as a result of chemotherapy stays the spine of systemic treatment, the researchers mentioned.
“Regardless that most patients reply to preliminary treatment, relapse is widespread and a subset of patients are chemo-resistant,” mentioned Prantesh Jain, co-lead writer of the research whereas with the Division of Hematology and Oncology at College Hospitals. He is now an assistant professor of oncology at Roswell Park Complete Cancer Heart in Buffalo.
“Presently,” Jain mentioned, “there are not any clinically validated predictive biomarkers to pick a subpopulation of patients with main chemoresistance or early recurrence.”
Broader AI initiative
The research is a part of broader analysis performed at CCIPD to develop and apply novel AI and machine-learning approaches to diagnose and predict remedy responses for numerous illnesses and indications of cancer, together with breast, prostate, head and neck, mind, colorectal, gynecologic and pores and skin cancer.
“Our efforts are geared toward decreasing pointless chemotherapeutic therapies and thus decreasing affected person struggling,” mentioned the research’s co-lead writer Mohammadhadi Khorrami, a CCIPD researcher and Ph.D. scholar in biomedical engineering at Case Western Reserve.
“By understanding which patients will profit from remedy, we are able to lower ineffective therapies and improve extra aggressive remedy in patients who’ve suboptimal or no response to the first-line remedy.”

Matadors win second straight NCS title
Miramonte High girls basketball players celebrated their second consecutive North Coast Section Division III championship after beating Bishop O”Dowd 72-66 in the title game on March 7 at Saint Mary”s College. The Matadors got off to a fast start and led 23-7 after a quarter and 44-24 at halftime. But O”Dowd came roaring back in the second half, getting as close as a point with under four minutes to play. Sabrina Ionescu and freshman Clair Steele answered with baskets for Miramonte, and the duo then made free throws to seal the win. Ionescu finished with 26 points and Steele had 20. Miramonte earned the No. 2 seed in the Northern California Open Division regional playoffs and hosts Pinewood-Los Altos Hills in the first round on March 13.Aerial Yoga Classes
What is Aerial Yoga?
Aerial yoga is a relatively new discipline, bringing two traditions together to form a practice which is both fun and incredibly healing.
In aerial yoga, we use a hammock to support the body, both from the floor and suspended in the air!
Whether you are an aerialist looking to bring a yogic aspect to your practice or you are a yogi wanting to lift your practice off the ground, our aerial yoga classes will provide you with a supportive space to explore the playful nature within you.
There are endless ways we can use this hammock to our benefit, from variations of traditional yoga postures and sequences to full body inversions. The sky is the limit!
The many benefits
* Deepens stretches
* Relieves joint pressure and spinal compression
* Releases tension
* Increases balance and bodily awareness
* Enhances core strength
* Improves breath awareness
* Easier access to inverted postures
* Releases endorphins
* Improves circulation, digestion and respiration
* Boosts confidence!
Relaxation
Relaxation is an important part of aerial, as with any yoga practice. Here, you will find your very own cocoon to support and hold you in weightless bliss.
What should I expect for my first time?
If it’s your first time trying aerial yoga, it’s normal to feel a little apprehensive! Try to arrive a little early so that you can ease into the space and start your class with a relaxed and calm energy.
Our teachers will support you however they can. As with all our classes, there are always modifications of postures to help you work with your body in a safe and comfortable way.
You never know, you might just surprise yourself!
What do I need to wear?
Aerial Yoga can cause friction and rubbing on bare parts of the skin so it is advised to wear leggings below the knee and a long sleeved top - at least covering the arm pits. It is also useful to avoid loose, baggy clothing as this can get caught in the fabric.
You will be asked to remove all jewellery, watches etc.
*** Jewellery can easily snag in the fabric which can cause pain and injury to the student if this tears the skin. It can also damage the material causing weakening of the equipment.
I started aerial yoga as I was looking for ways to help my sciatica and back pain
After a couple of months my sciatica has completely calmed down and I have no more pain.
Aerial yoga has realigned my whole body and strengthened my core muscles so I no longer have any back issues.
I can’t recommend it enough!
Is Aerial Yoga suitable for me?
Our aerial yoga classes are suitable for all levels of experience. There are however, some contraindications for practicing aerial yoga, specifically for inverting the body.
These include but are not limited to:-
* Glaucoma
* Heart Disease
* Vertigo sufferers
* Extreme high or low blood pressure
* Recent Concussion, head injury
* Herniated discs
* Osteoporosis
* Sinusitis
* Recent experience of stroke
* Epilepsy
* Pregnancy
If any of these apply, this practice will not be for you. Please approach aerial yoga with care and consult your doctor if you have any doubts.?
- If you’re locked out of your car and have a roadside assistance service, call them first. These services sometimes are included with the purchase of a car, as an add-on through your insurance company or through a membership club such as AAA.
- Ask for referrals. When I needed a locksmith last month to install a dead bolt, I asked for referrals from a neighbor and my condo association manager. I received two similar quotes, checked out reviews online and ensured the company I selected had a physical location. In situations where you have the time, check out locksmiths with the Better Business Bureau () to make sure there are no unresolved complaints on file.
- Use a locksmith with a shop. A physical location or shop ensures that you have a way to contact the business in case of a problem, but of course you’ll need to confirm the address. There are good mobile-only locksmiths out there, and if you received their name through a reference, by all means use them.
- Dial a local number and listen to how the person answers the phone. If a company answers the phone with a generic phrase like "locksmith," rather than a company-specific name, be wary. Ask for the legal name of the business. If the person refuses, call another locksmith.
- Get an estimate for all work and replacement parts from the locksmith before work begins. In cases of a lock-out, most legitimate locksmiths will give you an estimate on the phone for the total cost of the work. After the work is completed, demand an invoice.
- Ask for ID, including a business card. Expect the locksmith to ask you for identification, as well. A legitimate locksmith should confirm your identity and make sure you’re the property owner before doing any work. Some legitimate locksmiths will work out of a car for quick or emergency jobs, but most will arrive in a service vehicle that is clearly marked with the name of the business.
- Remember, this person has the keys to your car or home. So if you’re not comfortable with the service provider, refuse service..”
Biblical justice. The Founding Fathers would be quite happy.
As my 90 yr. old grandma from the Ozarks would say – Beck is "crazy as a bed bug." Personally, I don't take anything he says at face value. While I hope he isn't losing his eyesight, it may be nothing but a ploy for sympathy. He certainly misrepresents the truth on a very regular basis.
Joebob, So you call liberals "clowns" and yet decry their supposed "personal attacks"? Can't say that demonstrates much logical thinking on your part. Lol.
Boo-frickin'-hoo
Wait... you're attacking them as "liberal clowns."
I, for one, enjoy the hypocrisy at play there.
Psalm 37:v1,2 ...Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity, for they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb.v35,36..I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree...Yet,he passed away and lo, he was not;yea I sought him, but he could not be found.....Need I say more?..Mr. Beck, God's mercy has run out..He now has the last word....
So you're on par with God and can make that determination, Gwenie, by quoting scripture? Don't be too sure of yourself...
I think it's brown-eye syndrome- he's so full of excrement that it's clouding not only his thinking (actually lack of), and now his vision.
Maybe this disease can effect the vocal cords
I may disagree with him on most things, and I think that his show makes people feel scared and angry for the sake of Fox News Corp's ratings...but he's a human being too with his own family, and for that reason my heart goes out to him and the rest of the Becks.
*hug*
Going blind from spewing so much hate! God must be punishing him for all the acid tears he has cried. Rupert Murdoch and His Muslim Money that backs Beck? Wonder he if will take care of his lies in the end? He has been trying to create a racial rift among whites and blacks in America every since Obama was elected. I wonder why Glenn Beck is such a Racist. Is it his Mormon beliefs that no black can hold the priesthood and they carry the mark of Cain brother and killer of Able as a curse. He and Rush live to create fear and hatred among the white middle class. I believe the blindness is a curse from God as Pat Robertson would say for his sins and his lies! Why does Glenn Beck continue to make up such lies, what is so scarry is the man has begun to believe them himself!
Quote: "Is it his Mormon beliefs that no black can hold the priesthood." – I doubt it, seeing as how that is not a Mormon belief, as evidenced by the hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of black Mormon priesthood holders.
I hope Glenn Beck goes blind, as G-D intended him to, for all the hate and bile he spews in the name of the almighty dollar!
Um.... in this instance, I'll just take a pass. No comment.
I'm fairly conservative but have never really liked listening to Glen Beck. I don't like some of his extreme views, but mostly the way he presents his points. It sounds to me rather mocking of people or opinions he disagrees with. But I looked across some of the comments on here just to see what people were saying. And I have to admit that there are so many hateful comments, it's embarrassing. I wouldn't wish blindness on any other human being whether I liked them or not. Shame on some of you people who have said such terrible things.
Well said Ken, not only embarrassing but scary that there is so much hate.
I think your words should have been said the many times glen spewed filth hate and lies from his mouth, just like the bush crowd you are blind when you want to be deaf when you need to be and just plain ignorant all the time
@Dave-I tell my children that their behavior cannot be justified by the fact their sibling did the same. How old are you?
I may not agree with his viewpoints but I feel very sad for Mr. Beck. I am hoping and praying that he will get many years of sight regardless of his diagnosis! Mr. Beck I wish you and your family well. All the best take care!
Well, anyone who spends that much time with their head up their own ass is bound to catch *something* eventually...
The blind leading the blind hahahaha
So Rush Limbaugh loses his hearing so that he can hear no evil. Now Glenn Beck loses his eyesight so that he can see no evil. I guess Sean Hannity better get his voice checked ASAP.
His ass has been struck with a plague,
The more they try the more they die, since the beginning of time, and yet there are many so many more to go. it cannot be anymore clear to the fools, you follow a blind man.
You're not immune to death either, friend. It's waiting for everyone, including you.
Wow, the intellectual left has taken over CNN. There is so much irony in the majority of these posts. The claim Beck spews hate and then go on to wish him ill. Our progressive run educational system has failed a generation, at least.
Spot on.
One word...Karma
Yes, and it's coming your way.
I mean really, looking at some of the statements - wishing this person goes blind, wishing his head rots off, wishing all sorts of terrible things. Are some of you actually human? Apparently not.
He lost his sight on life long ago when he sold his soul, for years this man has lived blind, as many of you are and will soon to be.
Mind your own porch and keeping it swept clean, before going after mine, DAVE. Thanks.
Poor Glenn. I need to go get my vicks vaporub. Seriously, why not mute and paralyzed from the face down?
they should do him as they do lame dogs,
I want soooooooooooooooooooo bad to say bad things about this man but GOD prevents it.I wish that GOD will come upon him during this weak moment and help him to see not just by the flesh but spiritually also.GOD BLESS GLENN
He has his own god, the grand wizard.
Glenn Beck isn't the enemy, he's just an idiot. If you follow this guy, you've got serious problems..
What makes this fool thinks god wants his eyes, thats almost like offering god sarah palins brains, i give him credit he is a true ignorant fool
I feel bad for the guy, if only because no one deserves to go blind. If he had adult onset muteness I would be OK with it.
You and I are not going to agree on issues political. . . . . . but your post was way funny. Give you that.
Many of you haters are going malevolent on this great guy. To you: the wicked take the truth to be a hard thing. . . . . don't you?
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH. Putting the word "truth" together with "Beck" is an oxymoron.
Brent..I am a christian and I don't know what religion you are, but I know that God can't approve of Glen Beck preaching hate and causing divison among people...that doesn't sound very Christ like to me...When I hear people calling the President of the United States a monkey,a muslim, and all kinds of ugly names, walk around with guns strapped on their hips when Jesus said, "blessed are the peace makers for they are the children of God"...yet the same people call them selves christians...Yes, there may be a lot of negative comments on here about Beck, but these people aren't calling themselves christians..Beck claim he's one but If you are going to be a christian, then you need to live and show it...some of these people on this blog talk as if Beck is some type of God or prophet...that's a form of idoltry...Glen Beck can't save them...God said in his word, "My people perish for the lack of knowledge".....A lot of these Glen Beck, Rush Limbaugh followers are going to be really suprise on judgement day....
Although I don't believe a word that comes out of this clown's mouth...if he's really facing blindness, I am sorry for him. Maybe this is a good time for him to do a soul search and stop keeping a segment of Americans ignorant and stupid. Ask for forgiveness...and PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE stop the fake crying. Maybe those contaminated tears caused the disease. It's called environmental pollution for the brainless.
Glenn Beck is going blind and Rush Limbaugh is already deaf (okay, caused by his own chronic drug abuse, but still). What's next Sean Hannity losing his sense of taste for hating anyone not just like him and Bill O'Reilly finding out his "balance" is all out of whack? I swear, God is punishing all these awful people who instill such anger, hatred and meanness in the world.
Only after a fool is struck down, does he then call of god. when god called on him, he was busy selling his soul to fox and the rednecks that listened,
There is nothing so much wrong with his eye as there is with his sense of logic. How can people adore this man who is so greedy, self serving, and incapable of relating with reality.
I wonder how many people that bitch about Beck actually watch his show or listen to his radio show. I bet very few...hmmm two people bitching about a program that neither has watched. Too funny!!!
I'm with Nancy and the other faithful followers of Glenn Beck. And, organized religion is not what Jesus was about, nor is religion the way we should be brought together, but through truth (which the Holy Spirit brings) in Christ. And, anyone, regardless of political convictions, can be a follower of Christ. God help us all...
yeah but jesus mentioned it is easier for a camel to go thru the eye of a needle than for some to enter the kingdom, dont quote part of the bible be sure to quote all that applies
Last time I checked, God was not a republican, tea partier, birther, and much less a conservative. When the so called "christians" dragged him into politics, this country was sunk into the ground. Please leave GOD alone. And by the way, let me know when "hell" has a job opening, I'll certainly apply to be an escort for all those self-rightious, sanctimonious haters who will be in line and "sooooo surprised" as to how the heck they got there. LOL.
Hey Rush, its about time for your big fat ass to have a big mac attack, with all them drugs in your system,
Glenn should know God works in mysterious ways 🙂
I pray his head rots off.
Wow, that's really vicious. And very bad Karma...
Why couldn't he loose the power of speech? What good does his loosing his sight do us?
I pray his head rots off and then he dies a horible death. POS
I think it's great that he is going blind. Couldn't happen to a bigger tool. THANK YOU GOD!
All I can say is I am truly sad to have to live through this time in American history. We have become nothing but a mob filled with venom, hate and intolerance. We once were a melting pot but we have become warring factions breaking on racial, religious and political lines. I sincerely hope we quickly grow beyond this dark age. If we do not we deserve the fate that awaits us.
Agree or disagree with Mr. Becks politics or opinions the comments of most in this chain are an shameful.
No need to worry folks. Beck will either say he went blind because of a bad doctor courtesy of Obama care, or he'll say he was misdiagnosed by a bad doctor.. .coutresy of Obama care. Either way... he's got the Obama care angle covered. Maybe breitbart will hire him on as an undercover journalist. Beck will pretend he can't see and go into offices breitbart wants to attack. Now there's a scary duo for ya.
Obama should bail out glen eyes, how i wish i could be in a room with obama when he heard, i am sure he wish he could do so much to help poor glen as much as glen helped him, its time for the fox fools to start dying off slow death not a fast but a slow painful nasty death, and I like a large percent of the usa will laugh at these fools in their death beds, and spit on the graves of each.
Please seek immediate help before you hurt someone. I hope you did not procreate (that means breed).
Good for him!
Now his hatred will truly be blind
Blind AND dumb. WOW! what a concept. Great idea. Why didn't he think of that? Too stupid I guess.

Citing a revenue hit from the COVID-19 pandemic, Cincinnati-based Bon Secours Mercy Health will furlough 700 employees and freeze wages of all nonclinical personnel, according to The Cincinnati Business Journal.
The furloughs will affect workers in the system's shared services business office, which includes entry-level workers and those who are senior vice presidents. No caregiver, pharmacy or supply chain jobs will be affected.
The furloughs are expected to begin next week and last 30 to 90 days, depending on how long the pandemic lasts, according to Bon Secours Mercy Health CEO John Starcher.
The cost-cutting measures are a result of an anticipated decline in revenue due to government-imposed bans on elective procedures. Bon Secours Mercy Health estimates it will see an operating loss of at least $100 million per month while the pandemic lasts.
In addition to the furloughs and wage freeze, the health system is freezing hiring for all noncritical care positions.
"We don’t shy away from making the difficult decisions, and this certainly is one of those, because we always have a mind’s eye on what the long-term ramifications and implications are," Mr. Starcher told the Business Journal. "We’re laser-focused on making sure this ministry is as successful and vibrant for the next 150 years as it’s been for the last 150."Factory Customized Flexible Mobile Screw Conveyor for Grain Corn Wheat

Having shot Time Traveller on the Gold Coast in Queensland in 2010, Louthan was keen to return: making Reef Break in the state was a no-brainer, he says.
“Ultimately our story, set in an unnamed Pacific Island paradise, would fit anywhere but while we were developing the series we knew that what we needed was readily available on the Gold Coast.
“We had a familiarity with Queensland as I had worked there and [star and Co-producer] Poppy Montgomery is Australian. With a show like Reef Break, we knew Queensland would provide us with everything we needed,” says Louthan, adding he loved the locations and had a great experience at Village Roadshow Studios.
“We briefly considered Hawaii but it’s technically difficult. Locations within the islands are difficult and more remote and there were restrictions about where we could shoot on private land. We can get the same look and feel here more cost effectively.
“The nature of series TV is that it’s months and months of continuous shooting. We had two units running all the time. You have to all get along, as it’s very hard work and a lot of work to achieve in a short frame. The people we had on set were great and I can’t say enough about the quality and experience of the Australian crews. They are brilliant.”
While Reef Break is able to showcase the beach scene and surf culture that Queensland is known for, Australia is not all golden sands and clear tropical waters.
“What’s great about Queensland is that there are a lot of choices as far as locations go and everything is there within a short space physically and in terms of time,” says Louthan. “We used built-up urban downtown areas, with the Gold Coast having a unique urban look which is a great counterpoint to the holiday feel of the beaches, which are right there as well.
“Then you can be up in the mountains and the rainforest in 40 minutes so it’s all incredibly convenient. The experience of the crews and the film-friendly local government make a hard job that much easier.”

Bob Stark loves vintage Indian motorcycles.
He loves them so much, he will sometimes spend months to years restoring them from scratch. He loves them so much, he has written a short story about his favorite one, a 1948 Chief that Stark purchased barely used for $325. That bike has about 240,000 miles on it, and Stark still rides it today.
And he has even created a museum, the Stage Depot, as the centerpiece of his 15-acre Gavilan Hills property devoted to showing off Indian motorcycles and historical memorabilia associated with them.
It would not be a stretch to call Stark, 71, the world’s foremost expert on Indians.
“Bob has a wealth of information in his background,” said Chuck Myles, who owns and operates an Indian parts business in New York state. “I think Bob has the greatest volume of knowledge. I certainly appreciate his dedication.”
Visitors have come from all over the United States and from foreign countries in Europe, Asia and Oceania to see Stark’s impressive collection. In the museum, there are about 100 motorcycles dating back to 1933 and they still run. To make sure they stay operational, Stark rides each of them once every six months.
The pieces include a 1940 California High-way Patrol motorcycle and two U.S. Army World War II-era bikes, one of which was specially made for the North African campaign, Stark said.
Perhaps the most impressive bike is a 1953 model, from the last year the motorcycles were produced, that Stark built himself. It took Stark 37 years to construct it, he said. Guests can see it all for no charge.
“I just love the bikes,” Stark said. “If you take all the bikes I’ve restored through the years, threw everything together, I think I’ve broken even. I don’t think I’ve made any money on them, I don’t think I’ve lost any. I do this because I love it, not to make a whole bunch of money on it.”
Stark rode his first motorcycle when he was just 9 years old and has been working on Indians for six decades. He picked up his love of Indians from his father, who from 1918 to 1952 distributed the bikes in the Akron, Ohio region.
Stark then passed on his love and some of his encyclopedia like knowledge to his son, Gary, who rode his first motorcycle when he was 4 — a 50cc Mini-Mini — and had five bikes by the time he was 16. In fact, Bob allowed Gary to ride with him on the freeway by the time he was 10.
“I’ve never ridden a cycle that has handled any better than they do for the size of the bike,” Stark explained. “They’re just enjoyable to ride. I can take my hands off and ride for miles without touching the handlebars.”
Today, the two run Starklite Cycle out of the Gavilan Hills property, which is likely the largest supplier of Indian parts in the United States. There are 12 buildings used to store millions of motorcycle parts dating back to the 1930s on the property, and Gary runs the mail-order parts business out of Riverside.
For years, the Starks had a monopoly on the parts business for Indian motorcycles. That’s no longer the case, but the business appears to be doing decently based on the Stark’s property, which at its summit has a clear view of both Lake Perris to the east and Lake Matthews to the west.
“Most of the people that do it today don’t even know what half the parts are; they just do it as a money-making proposition,” Stark said. “I’ve got that advantage, that I know exactly what every piece is.”The Best Projectors For Home Use of 2021 – Top 10 and Rankings

- Identification and Characterization of the Zinc Uptake Regulator (Zur) of Corynebacterium diphtheriaeRegulation of metal ion homeostasis is essential to bacterial cell survival and in most species is controlled by metal-dependent transcriptional regulators. In this study, we describe a Corynebacterium diphtheriae ferric uptake regulator-family protein, Zur, that controls expression of genes in response to available zinc. Although no growth phenotype was observed in differential metal conditions, a C. diphtheriae zur mutant was more sensitive to peroxide stress, suggesting that Zur has a role in protecting the bacterium from oxidative damage. By measuring promoter activities and mRNA levels, we demonstrated that Zur represses transcription of three genes, zrg, cmrA, and troA, in zinc replete conditions. Zrg and TroA have similarity to other proteins involved in zinc uptake such as Bacillus subtilis YciC and Treponema pallidium TroA, respectively. CmrA has the highest similarity to C. diphtheriae TroA. Transcription of zrg and cmrA was also regulated in response to iron and manganese, respectively, by mechanisms that are independent of Zur. In addition to these three genes, 74 genes were shown to be affected by the absence of Zur and zinc via microarray analysis of transcript levels. The microarray results were confirmed via qRT-PCR for six of these genes, including one that is seemingly activated by Zur. An adjacent gene to zur, predicted to encode a metal-dependent transcriptional regulator in the ArsR/SmtB family, is transcribed from a separate promoter whose activity is unaffected by Zur. In contrast, Zur represses the activity of the zur promoter under low zinc conditions. The observed unique regulation of zur transcription has not been described for any other Zur ortholog. In addition, Zur bound the upstream region of multiple genes with varying affinity and this binding was metal dependent. A Zur binding site was determined on the upstream region of zur, cmrA, and sidA using a Dnase I protection assay. Our studies provide the first evidence of a zinc-specific transcriptional regulator in C. diphtheriae and give new insights into the intricate regulatory network responsible for regulating metal ion concentrations in this toxigenic human pathogen.?

Kinbaku and Art-American Bakushi Part Six –
Rigging for “The Neon Demon”
by Master “ K”
This page is best viewed on Google Chrome.
Please join me next time as we continue our exploration into the fascinating subject of “
Kinbaku and Art!”
While Mr. Ho completely understood my insistence on a skilled and experienced model to do the work, both for safety and efficiency, he was anxious that I consider the proposal because it would cut down on the budget since the volunteer was already on salary. “Has this person ever done anything like this?” I asked with some temerity. “Never,” came Mr. Ho's curt reply.
On the other hand, I quickly realized that if I didn't at least consider the suggestion the production manager would question my own professionalism.
Tall, bespectacled and with the air of an intellectual, Refn seemed very tired when he came into the studio office for our meeting. When I asked if he had been working for many days he surprised me by saying he and his crew had just begun. When he noticed my sympathetic and quizzical look, he simply said, “
Making a movie is a tough job.”
The Kinbaku scene under discussion takes place early in the film when the naïve young model is taken to an after-hours club by her newfound “friends” where a “different” kind of show is the main attraction.
It seemed that word had gotten around the crew about the suspension scene and he had received a visit from one of the women working on the film asking if she might volunteer to do the stunt!
Imagine my surprise when, instead of a starry eyed wannabe, the young woman I met (let's call her “G”) was intelligent, serious minded, very professional and down to earth in attitude and quickly understood all the risks and challenges involved in doing the scene. She added that she had a personal interest in rope bondage and was intrigued by the art of Kinbaku. She was also extremely attractive, lithe and athletic and absolutely filled the bill as far as the body type that director Refn wanted for his suspension.
Which is why, before I knew it, instead of turning her down outright, I had agreed to do a rehearsal with “G” to at least give her a chance to prove whether she could or could not do the stunt.
I hurried over to check on “G” and was delighted to see that she was doing just great. However, as I walked back to my position near the camera I overheard director Refn ask the man in charge of the pulley if he couldn’t “pull her higher?” It was then that I remembered the director’s twinkle in the eye during the presentation!
We also checked and rechecked “G’s”
costume for fit and comfort and, of course, thoroughly checked the suspension point and pulley rigging that would take the bound model up into the air. All seemed perfect.
With that the director and most of his crew departed to get back to work and I was left with production manager Victor Ho to complete the negotiations.
Of course, all this was months in the future as I made my way on a windy March day down to LA Center Studios to meet the Danish director whose only other film I had heard of was the well received “Drive” (2011).
We quickly agreed upon a fee, a shoot date and discussed some possible rope bottom/models who could do the scene. Mr. Refn had made it pretty clear that he wanted a tall, statuesque woman, one that matched the film’s
fashion model milieu, to do the suspension. I wasn't sure if the model that I had worked with on the music video would fit that bill but I told him that I would give the matter some serious thought and that I was sure that from my contacts I could find the right person. If only I had known what was coming next!
The rehearsal was held at my good friend and student Yzen’s
residence where a professional suspension point was available. I had asked “G” to bring the costume that was required so that we could not only rehearse the suspension but all of the difficulties of doing the scene in costume.
Director Refn seemed even more exhausted when the presentation was held for him and his crew at the end of a long day of filming. “G” seemed especially nervous but was very relieved when the director and everyone else gave an enthusiastic “thumbs up” to our efforts.
The next step was to show the results of the rehearsal to the director, the director of photography and the designer to get their input and approval. Gulp!
I had gotten only a few miles down Interstate 10 when my phone rang. It was Mr. Ho and what he asked me was so surprising that I had to pull off the highway to concentrate on the call!
To say my heart sank would be an understatement. The scene to be filmed was definitely dangerous because, unlike the typical BDSM stage show, the model would not be able to move from pose to pose to relieve the stresses on the body that most rope suspensions create. On top of that, the model would be essentially blind due to the full body suit which would cover her naked form from head to toe. This meant that only a very strong, courageous and athletic model would do.
The plot then follows Fanning on her adventures in LA where her beauty and youth place her in significant danger amongst the women she becomes associated with in the cut-throat fashion industry; women rivals who are both jealous and murderous.
It was clear time was of the essence and when we were joined by the film’
s cinematographer, Argentinean born Natasha Braier, the designer Elliott Hostetter and the production manager Victor Ho, Refn quickly got down to business.
Refn quickly made it clear he wanted his scene to be exactly like that, right down to the full, white body suit that made it look like a glistening living mannequin was helplessly suspended in mid air. It was also clear he was concerned about how long such a suspension would take to do. He seemed relieved when I told him that with the right setting, secure suspension point and skilled model it could be done expediently whenever his lights and camera were ready.
Someone in the team had apparently seen the music video “Come Unwound” by the talented group The Bulls that I had done the Kinbaku for. That video had involved a ballet like reverse Gyaku-ebi suspension with a model clothed in a full body suit.
Which is why a few days later I nervously awaited a quickly arranged coffee meeting with what I was sure would be a starry eyed, youthful volunteer who I was almost 100% certain would not fill the bill. In fact, I was so certain the arrangement would never work that I had already begun rehearsing a polite speech listing all the logical, safety oriented reasons why, despite the volunteer's brave, if foolhardy offer, I simply couldn't take the risk of using someone so inexperienced.
Few movies at this year’s Cannes Film Festival were as controversial as director Nicolas Winding Refn’s visually stylish “The Neon Demon,” starring Elle Fanning and Keanu Reeves; an unconventional take on the horror genre that mixes the glamour of high fashion with murder and necrophilia.
Praised by Time magazine and Vanity Fair, panned by Variety and The Hollywood Reporter and loudly booed and applauded by fans and critics alike at its Cannes film Festival premiere, the film has divided opinion wherever it has been shown.
Poster – “The Neon Demon” (2016).
It seems Mr. Refn was interested in including a scene of Kinbaku in the new movie he was making, had heard of my work and wanted to ask me some questions about doing such a scene. Naturally, I was very flattered!

Imagine my amazement when the young volunteer proved to be a complete natural! Not only could she handle the suspension pose effortlessly but she had no problem with the costume, no sense of claustrophobia and thoroughly enjoyed the rehearsal.
Since all the body weight for this particular tsuri (suspension) is supported by the hip harness I was able to do something a little different with “G’s”
upper body. I used a classic Tasuki (crisscross) tie on the model's front but I did a simple hexagram design on her back which showed off quite nicely on the white bodysuit. The designer seemed especially pleased with this since the hexagram seemed to go with some of the devilish sets and decorative elements he had created for the film.
I was then asked if the rope could be colored for the suspension and we quickly agreed that red asanawa would be the rope of choice.
There is an old joke in the film business that goes, “The most exciting day of your life is your first day on a movie set and the most boring day of your life is your second day on a movie set.” This is because, as Mr. Refn had said, movie making is indeed hard work with early starts, long days and lots and lots of waiting.
The only thing that concerned me occurred at the close of the presentation when the director, with a sly look in his eye, asked if the model could be pulled up, “A little higher” than the five or 6 feet we had shown him in our rehearsal. “What height are you looking for?” I asked. “I'm not sure, just higher,” he replied. I began to wonder.
The start time or “call” for my little team of rope specialists was 6 AM and it was with blurry eyes that I made my way down in light early morning traffic to South Spring Street in downtown LA.
The set for today's shoot was one of those magnificent theater and film palaces that were built in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in Los Angeles.
Huge, with ornate decorations, they once held thousands of spectators and it was one of these newly restored architectural wonders that was to be the location for Elle Fanning's visit to a “hip after hours club.”
After a quick and delicious breakfast off the catering truck, my team and I were ready to go to work but our hopes were dashed when we were told by a busy assistant director that we wouldn't be needed “for at least a few hours.” It seems that director Refn was shooting with Elle Fanning in the ornate dressing rooms downstairs and it would be quite a while before he and his crew moved to the club set on the main stage. On the main stage?
The “set” for the scene we were going to shoot was not an actual club set but was rather only the main stage of the theater where colored curtains and fabrics had been hung to simulate an exotic club space and where one of the main sources of light would be coming through one of the stage's trap doors that had been covered with thick, frosted glass. This produced a dramatic shaft of light that would shoot up many feet in the air above the stage floor and provide much of the lighting for the suspension. Ingenious!
Quickly moving upstairs to the vast auditorium I was quite surprised to see that instead of using some of the beautifully decorated spaces in the old theater the director and designer had decided to do something inventive.
The whole space was bathed in many different shades of colored light, predominately red, and it was marvelous to see how a club could be created out of virtually nothing! Which didn't mean that details weren't important.
As the minutes ticked away and we drew closer to doing our scene, I was glad for distractions to ward off the nerves. I worked with the young and enthusiastic Japanese extra who was to play the stage rope master and helped polish his hand movements with the red asanawa so that he looked reasonably expert.
Production Designer Hostetter spotted me on stage and came running up with a big smile. Out of his bag he produced two carabineers which I was to use for the suspension. To my astonishment they had been beautifully repainted in a shiny, lacquered red finish which perfectly matched the lighting scheme on stage. During the presentation he had noticed that my carabineers, like most used for suspensions, were silver in color but that wouldn't do for his design concept!
Finally, the word came that the crew would be on stage and prepared to shoot within a half hour. It was time to begin the serious rigging.
The first step was to carefully tie the hip harness that would be the main support for “G’s” graceful, back bending suspension. For this I decided to use a Nagoya style hip harness which I have found generally provides the best stability for larger sized western models when doing anything intricate in the air. The decorative upper body tie quickly followed and I’m happy to say we were completely ready just as Refn and his crew appeared on stage ready to shoot.
The action for the scene was relatively simple. The model for the “performance” would already be bound on stage and the extra playing the rope master would simply step away from the model, raise his hands and the model would be lifted by the pulley into the back bend and up and into the air.
As the camera was being set up, the assistant directors hurriedly placed other costumed extras into the scene around “G” to give the appearance of a very busy after hours club. I was amazed at how beautiful all of these people were but they all faded into the background when Elle Fanning appeared on set. The word “stunning” really doesn’t do her justice.
The first take went smoothly and “G” was gracefully lifted into her suspension position about six feet off the ground. Refn called “Cut” after about 2 minutes of photographing the model’s motionless, air bourne form and asked for another take. To my surprise, he didn’t change his camera position but seemed content to shoot the scene from one angle, perhaps to approximate Elle Fanning’s character’s point of view?
As the takes proceeded one after the other, “G” kept being pulled higher and higher until somewhere around take 10 she was actually three stories in the air!

I was sweating bullets as I rushed over to “G”
but to my relief she was smiling broadly, the hip harness had rema
ined perfectly in place and the only things she reported were a tiny amount of back strain and “the most wonderful feeling of euphoria.” I took a deep breath at last.
I lost track of how many times “G” was gamely pulled into the air but it must’ve been around 17 when the director finally pronounced himself satisfied and “G” was lowered to the ground for the last time to appreciative and enthusiastic applause from the rest of the crew.
Months later, from an interview Refn gave to the English paper The Guardian, I learned that the director liked to do a lot of takes. “I do very few setups,” he said. “But once I have them, I can do what I enjoy, which is the same thing over and over.” This was certainly the case here.
As everyone who has ever been in a film knows, just because a scene is shot doesn’t mean it will appear in the final “cut.” As the months went by between the filming and the announced release of “The Neon Demon,” I began to worry that our modest little scene might end up “on the cutting room floor.” However, as the first sneak trailers began to appear, I was astonished and delighted to see that portions of our suspension scene were included in more than a few of them!
I finally saw the film myself at a screening sponsored by the New York Times and held at the Los Angeles County Museum of art a few weeks after the film’s controversial premier at Cannes.
It was quite a thrill. Most of what we had shot had been used, with only the Japanese extra having been removed from the scene. In addition, the footage had been cut in such a way as to make it a very intense and visually eye-popping sequence as Fanning’s character watches the suspension from the fringes of the crowd with her predatory girlfriends.
Of course, this meant that the suspension isn’t shown in the documentary way that people who love rope bondage have come to expect. Instead, the scene is used symbolically and dramatically and as a flashy and stylish visual effect to help pace up the first half hour of the film and to introduce important characters, their motivations and the ambience of the world that the main character will inhabit; which is what I suspect the director was after artistically.
Whether the reader will enjoy the film or not is, of course, a matter of individual taste. However, my own feeling is that Nicolas Winding Refn should be given some credit for attempting to reinvent the horror genre with this sly, visually sumptuous, if blood soaked, effort.

As for me, I was truly honored to have been asked to collaborate on the film, delighted to work with such exceptionally talented people (especially the very lovely, gracious and courageous “G”) and thrilled to have a credit on the screen.
And it goes without saying that it gives me great pleasure to know that a scene of classical Kinbaku that I had something to do with is now in a major, mainstream and stylish film that will be seen by millions of people around the globe.

Starting tonight through Saturday night starts Yom Kippur. When we started to investigate these festivals they BLEW US AWAY! We both had absolutely no idea that they were some of the greatest prophetic guide points in all of history!
This is a video Michael posted on the Jim Bakker show a year ago. He walks through Yom Kippur…. (It is 30 minutes long)…
If you want to participate in this festival, it is a sorrowful day. It is not a celebration because war happens on this day some day in the future.
It is traditional to wear white, and that is rather interesting, because we return with Yeshua Jesus wearing white. It is also a FAST day from sunset to sunset. So no food should be eaten on this day for adults.
Picture Credit –
But let me give you a quick run down from the last chapter in Michael Snyder’s Rapture book about this event:….
The “last trumpet” will be blown on Rosh Hashanah (the Feast of Trumpets) on the day after the end of the Tribulation period during some future year..
In Revelation chapter 16, the seven vials of God’s wrath are poured out. These judgments come in rapid fire succession, and none of them require an extended period of time.).
In Revelation 19, we find the marriage of the Lamb just where we would expect it to be. It comes after the rapture in Revelation 14 but before the return of Jesus for the battle of Armageddon later on in Revelation 19.
The victorious return of Jesus Christ with His army on Yom Kippur is described in vivid detail in Revelation 19, Joel 2 and other places throughout Scripture..
In the end, the Antichrist will be totally defeated, and the Lord Jesus Christ will reign from Jerusalem over the whole planet for 1000 years. (Revelation 20)

The name arose from the volcanic activity present on all the islands.[1]
History
Though home to the Minoan civilization in the past, it was demolished by a volcanic eruption,[1] and by the 5th century BCE only ruins of them remained on the islands of Thera and Anaphi.[2] Even older ruins littered the landscape of Nisyros.[2]
At some point, the Samian Pythagoras explored the islands[3], as did the historian Herodotos.[2] During the Peloponnesian War, also the Spartan misthios Kassandra ended up visiting the islands, as both Herodotos[2] as well as Myrrine, Kassandra's mother, suggested she do so.[4]
Hundreds of years later, Layla Hassan visited the islands as well, as her experiences via Kassandra's memories led her there.[2]
Economy
Rich in sulfur due to the volcanic activity, the yellow mineral was especially mined on Anaphi. It stained the landscape of all of the Volcanic Islands, and turned the waters in and around them green.[2]
Behind the scenes
In Assassin's Creed: Odyssey, the Volcanic Islands are never given an epithet unlike almost all other regions. However, on Ubisoft's own site], the island is named "Forge of the World", referencing how the world itself is 'created' by volcanic activity.[1]

In other cases, the fund's assets are not invested in public companies. As such, the market values of the holdings are unknown, and so investors often punish the market value of the fund, creating a discount, since the fund's holdings are illiquid and of relatively unknown value.
Value investors may appreciate the fact that they can buy assets for a discount in the form of closed-end funds, but they should always do their homework (i.e. read the fund's quarterly reports) to ensure they understand what they are buying.

As winter closes in and the global political climate grows harsher, wealthy countries must meet their obligations and take in a significantly greater and fairer share of the world’s refugeesGiorgos Kosmopoulous
Whilst the welcome given to refugees by so many ordinary Greek people has been extraordinary, paradoxically the further one gets from the beaches of Lesvos and Kos, the more attitudes towards refugees calcify. Indeed, amongst ISIS in Syria. “After a car bomb explosion shuttered the windows of our home I decided over a week in detention in Turkey, the family were given temporary protection registration documents and were left to their own devices.
Whilst the Greek authorities and the European Union have repeatedly insisted that all Syrian refugees arriving in Greece are.
My son has respiratory problems. I cannot find work in Turkey and we do not feel safe. I do not know where to turnHaji Mohamad Lound
Despite Greek authority’s claims of no foul play, there is a raft of evidence, including the signed copies of documents that prove that those on board the flight to Adana had formally expressed their intention to seek international protection in Greece.
Whilst Haji and his family are stranded in Turkey, a further 62,000 refugees and migrants are stranded in Greece, living in a state of constant fear and uncertainty. This is the result of the EU-Turkey migration deal and the failure of European leaders to relocate the promised numbers of refugees from Greece.
Whilst in Athens President Barack Obama should shine the spotlight not only on often abysmal conditions for the tens of thousands of refugees stranded in Greece, but also on the failure of world leaders to adequately address the wider global refugee crisis..”

Planning permission has been sought for the construction of a new educational facility in Teesside.
The facility will support the work of the Teesworks Skills Academy, launched by Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen and delivered by several regional colleges and institutes including Darlington College and Teesside University to help local people take advantage of job opportunities being made available at the Teesworks site.
The £2.1m development is being delivered by UK contractor Graham, which recently rolled on to site to also start work on the deep-water heavy-lift South Bank Quay to support ambitions to become the UK’s premier offshore wind hub.
The two-floor, 5,400 sq ft academy will include three classrooms, plus office space and meeting and interview rooms will be used to house the Teesworks Skills Academy team as well as a base for hotdesking for companies looking to come on site, internal training events, information sessions, networking.
The majority of the construction will take place in January ahead of its opening in March 2022. It will be based in the Dorman Point area of Teesworks, with access to the building being unlocked via the Eston Road roundabout being built close by.
To date, the Academy has had around 3,760 enquiries, leading to more than 1,532 people registering with their CVs and almost 500 people undergoing training.
Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen said: “The redevelopment of the Teesworks site is creating thousands of good-quality well paid jobs and putting Teesside at the heart of the Government’s plans for the UK to be net zero by 2050.
“With so many jobs being created it’s essential that local workers have the skills needed to take advantage of the opportunities and that’s where the Teesworks Academy comes in.”
Leader of Redcar & Cleveland Borough Council, Mary Lanigan said: “This is a vital step to ensure people in our borough are able to access the quality jobs that are being created, and which they deserve. The level of uptake is fantastic.
“People want opportunities but, also, to be provided with the means to actually grasp them - which is exactly what this facility is enabling.”

Even the simple act of completely exposing your patient in the trauma room facilitates it. How do trauma professionals balance the need to see everything with the equally important need to keep the patient warm?
The natural reaction is to cover them up. Sheets and warm blankets are the usual tools. But I always marvel that, as soon as the blanket goes on, there’s always a need to examine something or do some procedure. Look at a wound. Insert a urinary catheter. And every time this happens, the blanket comes off.
Here’s a clever way to deal with this problem. Don’t use just one sheet or blanket. Use two! Fold each one in half, so they are each half-length. Place one on the top half of the patient, the other at the bottom, overlapping slightly at the waist. If you need to look at an extremity, fold the blanket that covers it over from right to left (or left to right) to uncover just the area of interest. To insert a urinary catheter, just open the area at the waist, moving the top sheet up a little, the bottom down a little.
Bottom line: Keep your patient toasty! Use the two-sheet (or warm blanket) trick to avoid hypothermia. Remember, patient temperature begins to drop as soon as the clothes come off! And I don’t recommend the use of one-piece inflatable warming blankets (e.g. Bair Hugger) until the work in the ED is complete, because the whole thing has to be removed every time you need meaningful access to the patient.

Written by OUC's Senior Research Associate, Dr Steve Clarke, the book is published by Wiley-Blackwell and will be available from April 2014.
• The first book specifically devoted to examining the logical structure of justifications of religious violence
• Seeks to understand how justifications for religious violence are developed and how or if they differ from ordinary secular justifications of violence
• Examines 3 widely employed premises used in religious justifications of violence – ‘cosmic war’, the importance of the afterlife, and ‘sacred values’
• Considers to what extent liberal democratic societies should tolerate who hold that their religion justifies violent acts
• Reflects on the possibility of effective policy measures to persuade those who believe that violent action is justified by religion, to refrain from acting violently
• Informed by recent work in psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience and evolutionary biology..
Religion, Intolerance, and Conflict

On their latest full-length album, Nosebleed Weekend (2016), the band communicates these sentiments but shows their growth and maturity as a band–from its slow-burning opener “Perfume,” to its fuzzy stand-out single, “Make it Right.”
More than a decade into their career and in anticipation for their Austin show tonight, we talked with the band via email to gain insight on where they are now as a trio and where they think they’ll be headed.
ANON: What genre of music do you consider your work to be? Who are your major influences?
The Coathangers: we have coined our sound as psycho-pop or yes-wave. we are influenced by any artist who is honest and authentic. we draw inspiration from raw expression.
ANON: How long have you all known each other? How did you first meet?
CH: we’ve know each other since high school age. our meeting was a cosmic gift of friendship. the stars brought us together.
ANON: What inspired you to make music together?
CH: we had a lot to say and felt safe around each other. and margaritas.
ANON: Over the last twelve years, how would you say your music has changed? What could you attribute to the band’s growing success?
CH: our skill level has evolved for sure since we started pretty raw. we attribute our success to never quitting.
ANON: What has been your biggest challenge as a band?
CH: being gluten/dairy free on tour.
ANON: Your music is capable of transcending a vast array of genres — can you describe your music-making process?
CH: we always write from the heart. we draw from personal experience hence the variation in mood in our songs. we don’t consider genre too much when we write.
ANON: What can your audience expect in the future from The Coathangers? Is there a style you’re wanting to explore?
CH: ya we are making an edm record next! JK. no we are working on a new full length right now!! and we’re really excited about it!! we feel very socially aware and want to tell the stories of others as well as our own. it’s still definitely coathangers style… the style we are always exploring.

Described by the business as a first for the UK foodservice industry, the card has an upper limit of £25,000 and up to 37 days’ interest-free credit, which JJ Food Service said would help to support caterers’ cash flow.
“We understand how hard it can be for independent caterers to manage cash flow,” said JJ Food Service CEO Mustafa Kiamil. “The Mastercard can be used to pay for anything from petrol and utilities to food and drink supplies. We invite all our customer to apply for the card.”
Opening a trade account can be difficult if you have minimal trading history, added the company’s group general manager Terry Larkin.
“That’s why the online application process considers many other unique factors,” he said, adding that 90% of customers would get a decision within 30 seconds of completing the online form.
“It’s just one of the many ways we are supporting the independent sector,” added Larkin.
Customers can add the card onto their online account or use it in-store. The interest is 0% if the account is paid in full each month and there are no annual or monthly fees.Food, Beverage and Dairy Production Water Treatment Solutions

The evaluation included 803 people from 193 pedigrees, composed of 258 complete sibling pairs and 175 half sibling pairs. Suggestive linkage (p<10?3) was observed on chromosomes 2q21-2q24 and 5p13-5q22 for PTST-, and on chromosome 7p22-7p21 for TB; these results for PTST- are book as well as the chromosome 7 area provides the gene. Furthermore, we replicated latest linkage results on chromosome 20q13 for TB (p?=?0.002). We noticed linkage on the nominal also ?=?0.05 threshold to a true number of guaranteeing candidate genes, (PTST- p?=?0.02), IL-1 organic (TB p?=?0.01), (TNF p?=?0.006), (TB p?=?0.02) and (TNF p?=?0.002). These outcomes confirm not just that hereditary factors impact the relationship between human beings and Mtb but moreover that they differ based on the outcome of this interaction: publicity but no infections, infections without development to disease, or development of infections to disease. Lots of the hereditary factors for every of these levels are area of the innate disease fighting capability. Launch Tuberculosis (TB), due to the bacterium (Mtb), is certainly a substantial, global public medical condition, in sub-Saharan Africa particularly, where in fact the prevalence of TB is increasing using the rise from the HIV pandemic dramatically. One-third from the global world is contaminated by Mtb [1]. Based on the Globe Health Organization, nearly 8 million brand-new situations of TB take place annually, with 2 million deaths related to Mmp16 the condition each full year. Uganda is among the world’s 22 highest burden countries with TB, with around annual threat of tuberculosis infections of 3% and an annual occurrence of brand-new smear positive TB situations of 9.2 per 1000 within an urban environment [2]. An elevated knowledge of the web host response to Mtb shall facilitate the introduction of new vaccines and therapeutics [3]. Since just 10% of people contaminated with Mtb continue to develop energetic disease (TB), it’s been suggested that web host genetics may impact the chance for TB. Early proof for susceptibility for TB was recommended by twin research and difference in susceptibility noticed among different individual populations. Numerous applicant gene studies have already been executed for TB; though there is certainly constant support for a job of individual genetics in disease risk, the outcomes for particular genes have already been equivocal (evaluated in [4]). Four genome-wide linkage scans have already been Pluripotin executed [5]C[8], but their outcomes didn’t replicate one another. This can be due to distinctions in TB diagnostic requirements, population hereditary distinctions (Brazilian, Gambian, Malawian and South African), little test size, or analytic strategy. The pathogenesis of TB could Pluripotin be regarded as a two-stage procedure [9]. The initial stage includes latent Mtb infections (LTBI), where Mtb establishes a successful infections but will not generate symptoms. LTBI is certainly diagnosed with a positive tuberculin epidermis check (TST) and/or positive interferon- response assay (IGRA) as well as the absence of scientific signs or symptoms of full-blown disease [10]. Oddly enough, some cultural people stay uninfected, evidenced by a poor TST and/or harmful IGRA, despite extended contact with an infectious TB case. Harmful TSTs take place in TB-endemic configurations also, where contact with Mtb may end up being persistent [10]; repeated negative TSTs over many functions are less inclined to end up being false-negatives sometimes. These individuals are usually resistant to Mtb infections, but never have been studied thoroughly because few research assess contact with an infectious TB case within a house and prospectively carry out repeat TSTs. Prior studies show ethnic distinctions in the prevalence of LTBI as well as the price of TST transformation [11] and in the comparative permissiveness of Pluripotin macrophages to Mtb infections [12]. Another scholarly research showed differences in gene expression between TST? and TST+ people [13]; however, it had been unidentified if those TST? people ever transformed their TST, which can be done since they had been connections of TB situations, therefore they can not be classified as resistant to Mtb infection definitively. A function have already been recommended by These results for individual genetics in level of resistance to Mtb infections [14], but it has not really been examined within a formal hereditary epidemiological study. The next stage is certainly TB (disease), where Mtb replication as well as the web host immune system response disrupts regular physiology and creates characteristic.MFG Global Equity Information

Contemporary Australia is multiethnic yet the lucky country has not always induced good luck for its indigenous population or for non-white settlers. More bluntly, Australia’s history of race relations can be regarded as shameful (MacLeod 2006). In relation to the United Nation’s defi nition of genocide, Colin Tatz (1999) reported that policies adopted by both state and federal governments up until the 1970s constituted genocide against the Aboriginals. Australia’s offi cial immigration policy prior to 1947 also aimed to keep its population white (MacLeod 2006) and, more recently, the so-called race riots staged on the beaches of Sydney revealed an on-going underbelly of racial tension and violence. Despite this racist legacy, Māori, the indigenous people of Aotearoa/New Zealand, have long travelled to and settled in Australia.You are reporting the following problem report for being abusive, containing personal information, or similar:

Rada al-Saran was an ancient warrior who claimed to match the gods in the way of the sword.[1] Born in Yokuda, he ventured to the bloody shores of Hammerfell to dedicate himself to perfecting his swordsmanship, and would first manifest his Shehai there. His commitment to perfection was necessary, as to gain glory back in Yokuda, where "peerless swordmasters were as common as grains of sand", he would need nothing less.[2] According to legend, to challenge himself, he dueled Leki to a standstill.[2] He would later go on to join the Gray Host in the First Era, and was responsible for the group's resurgence when he became a Vampire Lord by the title of the Ashen Lord during the Interregnum.
Biography[edit]
First Era[edit]
Long ago in the times of the Ansei, Leki was known for teaching new ways of wielding the blade.[2] This attracted a great warrior called Rada al-Saran to an oasis in the Alik'r. A proud man, he claimed to match the gods in the way of the sword. Some say that Leki herself drew him to the school to challenge and humble him.[2] When he arrived, he found Leki had taken the shape of a warrior of sand, wielding a blade of the hardest rock.[2] Rada al-Saran bowed to his opponent, and when it bowed back, he knew he found an opponent worthy of his skill.[2]
For three days and three nights they dueled with neither gaining the upper hand.[2] Rada al-Saran grew tired from fighting, so in a last ditch attempt to finish the fight, he struck the weakest point of his opponent's sword.[2] The blade broke in two, and a great sandstorm split the horizon.[2] When it cleared, Leki had erected a shrine from the sands and the surrounding oasis was said to have held the purest water in all Alik'r.[2]
As a perfectionist of his craft, the duel being settled as a draw Rada interpreted as a failure, and he ultimately lost his ability to manifest his Shehai.[3] Rada felt a deep resentment, which would led him into Molag Bal's clutches.[1]
At some point after the founding of the school, Rada Al-Saran had left the area and ended up joining the Gray Host, an army of werewolves and vampires led by King Styriche of Verkarth. Thanks to a deal Styriche made with Molag Bal for power, he and his army were sworn to serve him upon death. Following the Gray Host's defeat at the Bangkorai Garrison circa 1E 1029, many of Rada al-Saran's fellows became trapped within Coldharbour, Styriche included.[4] Rada was among the few members to survive, and spent eons of calculation looking for a way to return the twelve of his Exarch siblings who fell. The thirteenth Exarch, Verandis Ravenwatch, was loved by Rada as the greatest of his compatriots, however, his betrayal broke Rada's heart with grief to the point that he only sought to exact revenge upon him.[4]
Sometime before the death of the Red Eagle in 1E 1030, Rada met Faolan who helped him manifest his Shehai once again[3] by helping him in shedding his perfectionism. His Shehai was reforged in bitter blood.[1]
Second Era[edit]
—Rada al-Saran
Around 2E 582, Rada resurfaced as a Vampire Lord and the new leader of the Gray Host, an army of vampires, witches and were-creatures.[5] Called the Ashen Lord by his followers,[6] Rada sought to free his brothers and sisters-in-arms from the clutches of Molag Bal using the Harrowstorms,[7] supernatural storms created by the Icereach Coven which sucked the life-force from anyone caught in them, and exchanged it for the life-force of their fallen brethren.[8] Through the use of Stone Husks, he managed to resurrect Exarch Tzinghalis, who sped up his progress by working on obstacles Rada spent millennia on, and solving them within days.[9]
Rada's plan began in earnest in Skyrim. In Eastern Skyrim, he had the Icereach Coven abduct Jorunn the Skald-King in an attempt to turn him into a vampiric sleeper agent, but this plot was foiled by the intervention of the Vestige and Lyris Titanborn.[10] In Western Skyrim, Rada personally approached High King Svargrim of Solitude, offering him incredible power in exchange for his servitude. Eager for any power to finally prove his superiority to his hated rival Jorunn, Svargrim eagerly accepted Rada's offer, allowing his agents free reign across Western Skyrim.[11] Rada's ultimate goal was to unleash a massive Harrowstorm within Solitude, but this was foiled when the Vestige, with the help of Lyris, the Altmer vampire Fennorian, and Svargrim's own daughter Svana, exposed the High-King's treachery and slew him. Rada al-Saran had already left by this point, seemingly unconcerned with whether Svargrim would succeed or fail.[12]
Subsequently after, Rada al-Saran and his Gray Host encroached on the Reach looking for the Dark Heart to sever their contract with Molag Bal, slaughtering any Reach clans that stood in their path. Seeking to revitalize her Nighthollow Clan, Lady Belain, who had made a pact with Rada centuries before, joined al-Saran. She was planted as an advisor to Ard Caddach and convinced him to encourage the fearful Reach clans to take refuge in Markarth. This was, in actuality, a ploy to gather mortals to be sacrificed to fuel the reawakening of the Dark Heart.[13]. Arana, a dissident of the Ghostsong clan, aided the hero in discovering the Ghostsong's hideout, and discovered that Nathari had primed the reawakening of the Heart. Many shades came forth, and Nathari herself was transformed to a voidmother and was slain. The victory brought the Heart to a temporary stasis.[14]
House Ravenwatch then assaulted Lady Belain's Nighthollow Keep under Blackreach, and discovered the Heart deep within the keep's depths, as well as the ongoing ritual to fully reawaken it. It was too late, and the Heart was reawoken, pulling the souls of Markarth's denizens into it, and resurrecting the Nighthollow clan from its ashes.[15] Lady Belain unsealed the doors of Nchuand-Zel,.[16].[17] After intercepting a letter at the Gray Host's. Grayhaven itself is "a piece of land sundered from the Reach" during the Planemeld, and is caught in the Void "between Mundus and Oblivion". Using the Dark Heart, they could anchor their souls to this sanctuary realm, leading to their contract to be severed with Molag Bal. Additionally, "Death [would] become as much a petty inconvenience to them as to any Daedra", thus the Gray Host could potentially go on never ending conquests.[17][18]
While House Ravenwatch were at his doorstep, Rada was inside his sanctuary realm, conjuring an apocalyptic storm from within known as the Darkstorm that would consume all the souls in the Reach to complete his goals. Despite Rada's skill with the Shehai, and his mastery over his Vampire Lord form, Verandis outwitted him and turned the power of the Dark Heart against him. In Rada's final thoughts were that Leki was mocking him in the Far Shores, while Verandis comforted his old friend.[19]

The leading global human rights movement Amnesty International is pleased to be the first external client of Truly.Media, a ground-breaking new collaborative platform aimed at tackling “fake news” by using digital verification techniques to identify authentic and fraudulent posts on social media.
Truly.Media was developed by Deutsche Welle, Germany’s international public service broadcaster, and the Greek software and development company, Athens Technology Center. The web-based platform has been tailor-made for journalists and human rights investigators, allowing teams to work together across time zones to verify digital video, images and other content in real time before it gets used in research and reporting.
“When inconvenient truths prompt public officials to cry ‘fake news’, or when content posted on social media purports to show something it doesn’t, Amnesty International needs to be ready to respond, based on rigorous, methodical research and verification methods. In partnership with leading universities around the world, our Digital Verification Corps has already put us at the vanguard of the digital revolution in human rights research. We are confident that our collaboration with Truly.Media will take this crucial work to the next level ,” said Colm O’Gorman, Executive Director of Amnesty International Ireland.
Launched in October 2016, Amnesty International’s Digital Verification Corps currently includes research labs based at Cambridge University, University of California-Berkeley, University of Essex, University of Pretoria and University of Toronto. This inter-disciplinary network brings more than 100 students together with a common goal – to act as the frontline in verifying digital content for human rights research.
The DVC has played a leading support role in Amnesty International’s research on conflicts and crises, including the ethnic cleansing of Rohingya in Myanmar, the mass forced displacement of whole populations under Syria’s “surrender or starve” policy, and the Sudanese government’s scorched-earth policy, including the likely use of chemical weapons, against villages in the Jebel Marra region of Darfur.
Truly.Media will improve the DVC’s real-time collaboration across continents as well as give them access to state-of-the-art verification tools and expert assistance. Amnesty International’s Crisis Response team and journalists from several media organizations worked directly with the platform’s developers to fine-tune it for their specific needs.
“With Truly.Media we can discover false information in digital networks more efficiently and accurately. The project proves the innovation potential of Deutsche Welle in this sector as well. The fact that Amnesty International will be using the platform makes us proud and it proves that there is a real requirement for Truly.Media,” said Peter Limbourg, Deutsche Welle’s Director General.
Background
Truly.Media launched commercially in November 2017 after being used in-house by Deutsche Welle journalists for several months. Google’s Digital News Initiative Fund contributed to the development of the platform, which builds on research co-funded by the European Commission.
Representatives from Deutsche Welle and ATC outlined the possibilities of Truly.Media in Brussels on Tuesday, 21 November, at the invitation of the European Parliament’s Science and Technology Options Assessment.
Amnesty International will be Truly.Media’s first external client from 1 January 2018.River Net Computers is honored to have been mentioned in the February 2012 issues of New Jersey Cops magazine, the official publication of the New Jersey PBA!

Eight Sleep Smart MattressTEMPO.CO, Jakarta - In today's age, people often waste their time unconsciously, and they don't feel like they did. Some habits may drain their time and energy which also take away their free time.
Quoted from Times of India, here are the bad habits that are considered to be a waste time and can be avoided to obtain more free time.
1. Procrastinating
This action might be seen as a small inconvenience, but in actuality this is among the main problems why people can't get free time. Just because you don't want to start or finish something, you end up just waiting until it's close to the deadline and rushing things up. The best thing to avoid this is just try to finish your work as quickly as possible when you still have the energy to do it.
2. Social Media
Watching a few random videos might be good to distract your mind, but have you realized how much time is spent watching kitten videos? Or scroll through the feeds? Start timing your time using social media to improve your time management.
3. Doing Others Work
Helping others is nice, but will take your time away if you still have tons to do. Feel free to reject or postpone helping others to finish your own works first.
4. Being Disorganized
After using an item, put it back where you find it. Scattered items tend to create a mess, and when you're looking for something in a mess, it's going to take away your time from completing your work to look for an item that should have been easy to find.
5. Humouring Toxic People
If you've found out the person you're talking to is toxic, don't waste your time. Stop doing it because it's only increasing your negativity and drains your energy.

TEMPO.CO | GRAVEN FIKRI (INTERNSHIP)Flora co-archivist Barbara Economon and I have completed a new book—our fourth— for Fantagraphics: The High Fidelity Art of Jim Flora. It's a dual-purpose volume: 1) it replaces our long out-of-print and highly sought book from 2004, The Mischievous Art of Jim Flora, which featured the Flora album covers known to us at the time (along with a bunch of other cool stuff); and 2) it showcases the Flora album covers we knew in 2004 and others we've since discovered, along with a plethora of vintage Flora music-oriented art, most of which has not been previously published in our Flora anthologies. It rocks, it bops, and swings from the chandeliers. Projected publication: August or September. The book, which can be pre-ordered at Amazon.com, includes cheeky back cover blurbs from Gary Panter, Arnold Roth, James Lileks, Georgia Hubley, and Joost Swarte.
The Double-E Company (Eva and Elsa) have teamed with Astek to create several designs of Jim Flora wall coverings. Above is an example (piano not included). Here's another. And another. And here's the entire collection. Our books and website are attempting to spread Flora across the planet. You can do your part by spreading it across your home.
Enchanted Lion has reprinted two early Flora children's books, The Day the Cow Sneezed (1957) and Kangaroo for Christmas (1962). English is our favorite language, but editions of these books have now been reprinted in Italian, French, and Spanish.
Artifact Puzzles has produced a 302-piece wooden jigsaw puzzle of Flora's mid-1960s painting Big Bank Robbery (above). It comes packaged in a pine wood box, which (when you complete the puzzle) can be re-purposed as a parakeet coffin.
And finally, next year marks the Flora (born January 25, 1914) centennial. We're exploring several exhibition locales, with a strong possibility at Silvermine Arts Center in the historic Silvermine district of Norwalk CT. Flora and his wife Jane were members of the Silvermine Arts Guild, so it would mark a homecoming of sorts for the artist's works. Details forthcoming.
That's TMI Part 1. We'll post more updates in a day or two.It's done

Interesting stuffHi, I′m Puncho, and this is my 3rd Crossing Void Guide.
I have found out that not many people have reached Psyche Level 6, and even less have been able to get the Alice Psyche featured there when you get three SS. So this Guide is made to help you all.
Apart from the Rewards for each Season (resetting at Sundays and Wednesdays) :
And for your Progress :
There is one HIDDEN reward, the Psyche Border (Icon), which you can get if 100 people complete the Psyche Level 6 (only the first 100 people to complete the Psyche 6 will get the Frame) :
All this said, i′m one of those 100 people who got the frame, since I reached level 6 as soon as it was available, so you can fully trust this guide. Here we go.
TYPE OF ENEMIES (the 7 possible levels you can find).
Let's start having a look at the different levels we have on Psyche, because each level has a “win condition” or something that stands out and makes that level unique.
Also take in account that on Psyche Level 5 and Level 6 there are 3 stages (on 3 and 4 there are two stages), so for 5 and 6 there will be a point where 3 AoE ones can happen at the same time. Also, the stage rotation is random, but for example you can't have Psyche V-2 two times in a row.
Also take into account that you CAN LEAVE the REAL TRY (not the Practice one).
If you don't have good crits you can leave the try by just clicking on top right and directly leaving, which is cool.
Psyche Zone Number 2 : Psyche Weakness on FRONT .
Psyche Zone Number 3 : Survive Stage – Medium .
Psyche Zone Number 4 : SHIELD BOT .
Psyche Zone Number 5 : Psyche Weakness on MID .
Psyche Zone Number 6 : Single Target Bot .
Psyche Zone Number 7 : Survive Stage – Easy .
Psyche Zone Number 8 : Psyche Weakness on REAR .
General Advices :
Use WOUND users like Shana Support or KAsuna/Leafa cross skill for AOE plus A5 Olive IMP to increase your score.
If it's not A5 does not guarantee to proceed.
Use FRAIL users like Mikoto Support for AoE or Yuuki, Kirino or Haruyuki for ST plus A5 Muramasa IMP to increase your score.
If it's not A5 does not guarantee to proceed.
SS Mikoto : Swimsuit Mikoto (VE Expedition)
BG Mikoto : Summer Mikoto
KAsuna : Kimono Asuna
KiShana : Kimono Shana
KYH : Kuroyukihime
Stat Stick Slow : Zero/Miyuki/Boogiepop/Touma/Accelerator/Twins
Twins : Vocaloid Lin/Ren
PSYCHE ZONE NUMBER 2 –
Psyche Weakness on FRONT .
The Hound Level, Psyche 2, has two ways to face it.
Using an AoE team to ensure high score but taking into account there can be more AoE stages on this rotation.
Using a ST team to get a good score and leaving your good AoE fighters open for another stage.
And now you may be wondering, which is worthier Puncho?
Obviously, using a ST team.
I will leave some recommendations below (team compositions with their rotations), but is literally way worthier because sometimes you get rotations like (Psyche 2 + Psyche 4 [Shield Bot] + Psyche 8 [Rear Weak]) and that is really troublesome.
With this ST strat you can leave characters such as Alice, Kimono Asuna, Kimono Shana, Summer Mikoto, Yukina, SS Mikoto or Selvaria for another stage.
Misaki/Touma + Mikoto/Accel + Taiga/Miyuki-stat stick slow
Tomoka/Yuuki + Misaki/Touma + Taiga/Miyuki-stat stick slow
Summer Mikoto/Yuuki + Misaki/Touma + Taiga/Miyuki-stat stick slow
Anybody/Yuuki + Misaki/Touma + Asuna/Miyuki-stat stick slow
Someone to poke front + Selvaria/Alicia + Asuna/Taiga plus Miyuki-stat stick slow
Basically those are some recommendations. You can vary them if you have one character or another. Also you can change Misaki/Touma for something like Mikoto/Touma or something that can hit front with 4sp or similars.
Here I leave some rotations with specific combos :
(best one)
Misaki-Touma : 0sp , 0sp , 4sp , 0sp , 8cp , 4sp , 8cp (only with Misaki A1)
Mikoto-Accelerator : 0sp , 5sp , 5sp , 5sp , 5sp , 5sp , 5sp
Taiga-Miyuki : 0sp , 0sp , 0sp , 0sp , 10cp , 0sp , (jargn) 10cp
Tomoka-Yuuki : 0sp , 3sp , 3sp , 3sp , 3sp , 3sp , 3sp
Misaki-Touma : 0sp , 4sp , 4sp , 8cp , 4sp , 4sp , 8cp
Taiga-Miyuki : 0sp , 0sp , 3sp , 10cp , 3sp , 3sp , 10cp (3sp of Taiga, not Miyuki)
Tomoka-Yuuki : 0sp , 3sp , 3sp , 6cp , 3sp , 3sp , 3sp
Mikoto-Accelerator : 0sp , 5sp , 5sp , 5sp , 5sp , 5sp , 8cp/10cp (climax of Miko/Acc)
Taiga-Miyuki : 0sp , 0sp , 0sp , 10cp , 0sp , 0sp , 10cp
Tomoka-Yuuki : 0sp , 3sp , 3sp , 3sp , 6cp , 3sp , 3sp
Taiga-Miyuki : 0sp , 0sp , 3sp , 3sp , 3sp , 10cp , 3sp , 10cp
MaidKuroko-Touma : 1sp , 4sp , 4cp (climax) , 4sp , 4sp , 4sp ,4sp
Basically I highly recommend to use Taiga for Front Climaxes and resetting with Jargnéipr for another use, plus pairs like Mikoto-Touma, Maid Kuroko + stat stick (high attack Support) or even Summer Kirino-Leafa for a 4sp “nuke” or hard hit skill.
You can add Tomoka-Yuuki to get free sp each turn and frail occasionally with Yuuki, but probably you want to use Tomoka for another stage, so first composition would be the ideal. You can experiment putting Asuna+Someone instead of Tomoka just to poke Front.
For finishing, I need to tell you that PSYCHES are HUGE on this stage and this mode in general (is called Psyche Zone, so makes sense).
Misaki+Touma both with their Psyche, Accelerator Support with his Psyche to power Mikoto-Accel cross skill, Asuna Psyche… Every Psyche MATTERS.
As last advice, use Indra (IMP Weapon, if you have it) on turn 3 or 4 to maximize effects.
PSYCHE ZONE NUMBER 3
– Survive Stage . Medium
This stage is basically one of the two “free” ones, as you only have to literally survive, which is easy.
Soooo there is not much trouble here, just throw your least important characters (or just not the ones who have more weight on damage terms like Kimono Asuna, Alice, Mikoto etc).
All to be said, on level 6 of Psyche Zone this stage is pretty harder than it is on level 5 or lower, getting S or SS actually requires a decent team setup.
Surviving won′t be a problem, but you need some damage to get at least S.
So if this stage appears with Shield Bot (hardest) or Psyche Weakness ones, make sure not to go all-in onto it (unless you are on Psyche Level 6, when you can go with your best setup since getting S or SS on Level 6 is pretty hard).
To summarize : If this stage appears on Psyche Zone 1,2,3,4 or 5, use your characters left and you are OK on it.
If it appears on level 6, you will need some damage to make it work, so don't lack on it.
PSYCHE ZONE NUMBER 4 – SHIELD BOT
Well, this is basically the hardest stage of all, the Nightmare of Shield Bot.
You may be wondering : W H Y , but it's just three bots who perma-shield from turn 3 to the end of the battle.
That means, you will need a DISPEL to make those Shields disappear, plus probably Tomoka to make a setup that allows you to make enough damage thanks to the SP generation.
And now is my time to shine! I was able to create one team that fits perfectly with these Bots, but requires Kimono Asuna as Limited Character and Selvaria+Emi, but as I say even with 200 talent characters is a bomb.
Rotation is the following :
Tomoka-Kuroneko : 0sp , 0sp , 3sp , 3sp , 3sp , 3sp , 3sp
KAsuna-KYH : 0sp, 3sp, 12cp, 0sp, 8cp, (jargn) 8cp, 12cp
Selvaria-Emi : 4sp, 4sp, 4sp, 4sp, 4sp, 4sp, 4sp (basically spam the cross)
You can also use some of these LineUps, they also work:
DBK-Fast character/Kuroneko + Mikoto/Shana + KiShana/KYH
Accel/Kuroneko + KAsuna/KYH + Selvaria/Emi
Mikoto/Kuroneko + KAsuna/Leafa + Alice/KYH
SS Mikoto/Accel + Miyuki/KYH + KiShana/Kuroko
BG Mikoto/Zero + KAsuna/Leafa + Tomoka/Kuroneko
As last advice, use Indra (IMP Weapon, if you have it) on turn 3 or 4 to maximize effects. 4 would be the best here.
PSYCHE ZONE NUMBER 5 –
Psyche Weakness on MID .
As it happens with Number 2, Number 5 offers two possibilities :
Using an AoE team to ensure high score but taking in account there can be more AoE stages on this rotation.
Using a ST team to get a good score and leaving your good AoE fighters open for another stage.
So again, we have a dilemma over here, and is even worse cause it does require MID CLIMAX, which is harder to find than Front.
Another problem is that usually for Mid “Nuke” you have Kimono Asuna + KYH, but those units use to be better for other stages, as both are useful on their own, even individually.
So Puncho, what can i do here? Let me introduce you to the AOE GREAT TEAMS.
After some research, I am happy to bring you a lot of rotations and compositions (most of them actually very f2p friendly, so win win) which will help you even if the characters doesn′t have a ridiculously high talent, even 250 can do the trick.
Here you have my compo suggestions plus their rotations:
Mikoto/Kuroko + SS Mikoto/Stat Stick Slow +
Tomoka/Mashiro + BG Mikoto/Kuroko + Kasuna/Stat Stick
KAsuna/Leafa + Selv/Emi + Alice/Accel (#1 DD AOE rotation)
Mikoto/Kuroko + SS Mikoto/Miyuki-Twins-Zero-Touma + Yukina/Accel
Mikoto/Kuroko + SS Mikoto/Miyuki + Yukina/Zero
Tomoka/Kuroneko + Selv/Emi + KAsuna/KYH (shield bot compo if there is not shield bot, still useful here)
KAsuna/Leafa + Yukina/Tomo + Alice/Accel
Alice/Miyuki + Butterfly KYH/Zero + Kojou/Yukina
Top AoE DD compos (dont have rotation but you can ask for it or find videos with it – also will put them if you really need them)
KAsuna/Leafa + KShana+KYH + Alice/Accel
KAsuna/KYH + Misaki/Shana + Alice/Accel
Kirito/RUSSIAN + Alice/Accel + KAsuna/Zero
Tomoka/Mashiro + KAsuna/KYH + Miyuki/Zero
Tomoka/Mikoto + KAsuna/Accel + Miyuki/Zero
Tomoka/Mikoto + KShana/KYH + Alice/Accel
Tomoka/Mikoto + KAsuna/Leafa + Alice/Accel
Tomoka/Mikoto + KAsuna/KYH + KShana/Accel
Mikoto/Kuroko + SS Mikoto/Miyuki + (my AoE DD compo)
Tomoka/Mashiro + BG Mikoto/Kuroko + Kasuna/Stat Stick
PSYCHE ZONE NUMBER 6 –
Single Target Bot
If this stage appears you are probably saved.
There are lots of compositions that can be used as Single Target, especially when the rest of the stages are AoE focused or basically have 3 bots instead of one.
If you score more than 150.000 on Decrepit Dream Single Target, you shouldn't have a problem on this one (unless it is level 6 again), but I will just leave some compos that can help (rotation is probably different than your regular ST because that bot is slower than DD bot).
Also, take into account that, for a higher score, A5 Nightingale (Lamp/Healing IMP) is pretty much the key, since it removes 2 Debuffs (gimmick on this Stage is removing debuffs from your LineUp and removing buffs from enemy Bot, but is only worth removing debuffs instantly with A5 Lamp)
Frailers : Yuuki support 3sp , Haruyuki 3sp , Kirino support 3sp , Izaya support 3sp
Rotations :
Since this ST robot is different from Decrepit Dream one, I only got that rotation, and so far so good, but here are some combinations that work well still:
Tomoka/Yuuki + Misaki/Touma + Taiga/Miyuki/Zero etc
Tomoka/Yuuki + Kasuna/KYH + Taiga/Miyuki/Zero etc
Tomoka/Yuuki + KAsuna/KYH + Taiga/Tomo
Tomoka/Yuuki + KAsuna/KYH + Tatsuya/Miyuki/Zero etc
Tomoka/Yuuki + Misaki/Touma + Taiga/Tomo
As last advice, use Indra (IMP Weapon, if you have it) on turn 3 or 4 to maximize effects. 4 would be the best here.
PSYCHE ZONE NUMBER 7 –
Survive Stage . Easy
The other “free” stage, and this is actually VERY free.
Before facing this stage, do the other 2 (or 1 if you are on Level 4 or 3), and then use the rest of your best characters for this, DON′T PUT YOUR BEST ONES HERE!
As this is the freebie, you can throw here the characters you want, as you literally have to survive (and whatnot deal some damage).
PSYCHE ZONE NUMBER 8 – Psyche Weakness on REAR
Basically pick one of the STAGE 5 compositions, since it's basically the same but Psyche Weakness is now on Rear.
Then again is not viable using REAR ULTS or similar like on Psyche Stage 2, where Front is literally the best option. Maybe when Emi Main and Sadao Psyches come it could change, but at the moment I strongly suggest not to wear a rear focused team.
So yeah, again pick compositions from the list above (the long list on Stage 5) and you should be good.
PSYCHE ZONE NUMBER 9
– Front and Rear Shield Switch
New Psyche Stage introduced recently.
About this one, it consists of a Permanent Shield that rotates between the Front enemy and the Rear enemy. With that Shield the enemy doesn′t take any damage, except Psyche Damage, but is NOT worth attacking to the user with Shield.
What′s best on this Stage, is attacking the enemy that does not have the Shield. For references, these are the turns and the respective Shields:
Round 1 – Shield on Front
Round 2 – Shield on Front
Round 3 – Shield on Rear
Round 4 – Shield on Rear
Round 5 – Shield on Front
Round 6 – Shield on Front
Round 7 – Shield on Rear
Round 8 – Shield on Rear
Round 9 – NO Shield
Round 10 – NO Shield
Also there are only 10 Rounds for this level on Psyche Zone 5 and 6. For Psyche Zone 3 and 4 there are 8 Rounds, and dont know exactly where the Shields place, but you can try Practice Mode and see the enemy buffs to see where the Shields place each turn.
So the best teams on this mode, are basically:
FOR REAR –
Tatsuya + Tomo/Other: Since this Stage seems made for him, as he can rotate between Front and Rear and Climaxing the position marked.
Tomo cross makes him more viable.
Emi + Sadao : Really useful to deal high damage to Rear enemy.
Emi Support : Her 3sp Skill is actually strong, so you can generate CP with it. Viable.
Kino : Yes, Kino (lol). As Wound user, you can use his skill to apply Wound on the Rear enemy, and so that Climax to the Rear with Olive to deal more damage.
Sadao : Sadao himself can deal good damage to Rear with his Skill, and it can′t change form, since you are not attacked, the bots won′t make you go under 60% HP.
Kuroko Support : If needed, Kuroko Support herself gives a Rear Skill, but is not the best option. Can be used for CP generation though.
Climaxers
DBK (Dual Blades Kirito) : Used to proceed his Climax, he does well on this mode. So make sure to boost him if you need it.
Emi Main : Can be used as Climax user, but with 8CP cost.
Maid Taiga : Her 3sp skill to Rear enemy makes her a suitable character on this Stage, since she can even Climax full power to that position having used the 3sp previously.
Kuroko + Tomo : You can use their cross and Kuroko herself to deal good damage to Rear enemy. And also, the Climax(es) Skill.
FOR FRONT –
Misaki + Touma : Probably the most recommended pair along with Emi Sadao, since the 4sp damage to Front enemy is high.
Summer Mikoto : Her 3sp Skill to Front enemy is really good, so you can as well proceed it if you have SMikoto raised.
Shizuo Support : Along with SMikoto, his 3sp skill is good for damage, but he is more of a tank. Can be used tho.
Boogie / Wilhemeina : As Kuroko Support, their skills are Seals, but can be used for generating CP.
Yuuki Support : Can be used as Frail user, to make more damage with a Climax + Muramasa IMP.
Havia : Can be used as Wound user, to make more damage with a Climax + Wound IMP.
MHCR-Drei : Don′t ask. Does damage.
Climaxers
Misaki : Her 8CP Climax can be used to insert Wound and Frail on the enemy, and proceed Muramasa/Olive for more damage input.
Taiga : Undoubtfully the best Climax you can use, so if you have Taiga make sure to include her on the rotation. Also her skill are mostly Front focused, and can cross with Holo to make more Front damage.
Asuna : Is also viable, since her Climax after Skill 2 can make full crits easily, so wouldn′t be bad damage.
Maid Kuroko : For cheap 4 cost Climax, plus 5/4sp skill, is another one to take into account.
HP LEFT to pass on A/S Rank (Psyche Zone 6)
For Psyche Zone 7 (Easy) :
Just survive. As long as you do some climaxes and crosses, you shouldn't have problem on getting S/SS rank
For Psyche Zone (Semi-Easy) : (S rank)
9.431.000
9.256.000
9.300.000
(The 3 Enemies have Psyche Weakness, so is easier to score higher. You only need A-rank to mantain yourself on Psyche Zone 6 but only have requirements for S-rank)
For Psyche Zone 5 / 8 (Mid and Rear Weak.) : (A rank)
9.409.000
9.207.000 (this for the MARKED with Psyche Weakness)
9.521.000
(S rank)
9.418.000
9.394.000
9.277.000 (this for the MARKED with Psyche Weakness)
(SS rank)
9.247.000
9.060.000 (this for the MARKED with Psyche Weakness)
9.415.000
For Psyche Zone 6 (ST Bot) : (A rank)
8.460.000
(S rank)
8.140.000
For Psyche Zone 2 (Front Weak.) : (A rank)
7.996.000
10.025.000
10.200.000
(S rank)
7.768.000 (Front enemy obviously)
9.968.000
10.200.000
For Psyche Zone 4 (Shield Bot) : (A rank)
9.511.000
9.218.000
9.359.000
I hope you guys like the Guide, I tried to make it as full as possible.

Depth of Pond?
Shannon1 replied to Shukura's topic in Goldfish and Ponds.Well, you've all convinced me. I already have a hole and two layers of bricks (for a semi-raised pond with a liner), but now I think I'll move the pond to another location and use a stock tank. This way the pond can be bigger too. : ) Shukura, I look forward to seeing your pond. : )
- Oh, I see it. Nice.
i have a new betta. no name yet :)

Sculptures for sale/trade. (picture heavy!)
Shannon1 replied to Drowsy's topic in For Sale or TradeNice! When I'm ready, I'll be contacting you. I saw a picture once of a raised koi pond with a couple tiles that had koi sculptures on them. I'm working on a raised pond, and one of your sculptures would look beautiful on it. When I'm done, I'll have a better idea about where it could go, and I can show it to you for ideas too.

Example of what goldfish do to plants
Shannon1 posted a topic in Goldfish & Plants.I give up. I've tried many plants, and the Anubias are the only ones with leaves too thick for my goldfish to eat. They still pick at the roots and will often get them unglued or untied from the rocks though. Little rascals.

Sharing a video of my latest tank setup
Shannon1 replied to Shannon1's topic in Goldfish Photos / VideosI used to have all the Pothos in plastic "sponge caddies" and the Lucky Bamboo in pots inside the tank (with the leaves extending outside the tank). But then I read that most people had success with Nitrate reduction when their plants were inside the filters. I had moved the plants to the filters, added Purigen, and began feeding my goldfish less when I noticed a reduction in Nitrates, so I'm not sure if a combination helped or if one thing helped the most. (I learned that I was feeding my fish way too much.) I'm looking forward to when all the Pothos trail down the outside back of the tank. : ) PS Ms. Jenny: The big Lucky Bamboo came from Green Acres Nursery in Folsom. They had a bunch of pretty bamboo at great prices in their "home decor" section.
Sharing a video of my latest tank setup
Shannon1 replied to Shannon1's topic in Goldfish Photos / VideosThanks! It's fun to share here. Since I've become interested in goldfish, I haven't met anybody in person yet who has goldfish. : ) We just got our goldfish about five months ago. I'm guessing they were a month old because they were about an inch and a half, and one of them was still silver.Meet Isabelle: a Regional Training Coordinator Extraordinnaire
My name is Isabelle and I’m the Regional Training Coordinator for the BC Office of the Seniors Advocate’s Residential Care Project and am responsible for covering the Interior Health region. I was drawn to this project because of my passion for the wellbeing of our older population. My background is in social psychology but I like to say that I’m a people person. I’ve been volunteering and involved with the senior’s population for several years. My first experience was living with my grand-mother who had Alzheimer’s. I learned the hard way how to communicate with people with cognitive impairments. I was also part of a team who helped develop the Better at Home program in BC. My volunteering with older adults includes teaching a Fire and Fall Prevention Program for Older Adults called Remembering When, Snow Angels and I also teach a fall prevention exercise class at the Kamloops YMCA/YWCA.
As a Regional Training Coordinator, I believe in leading by example. Therefore, I have the privilege of conducting interviews with residents across the Interior Health region.
My experience has been richly blessed with compassion, empathy and love for that population.
I recently read a quote from Henri Nouwen that’m honored and privileged to be part of a project that allows us to hear and capture the voice of residents in long term care facilities across BC.
As for the volunteers I come across in my training, I’m fortunate to spend time with like-minded human beings. I have great respect and truly feel grateful for the commitment and time you chose to spend doing this project.
I’m always pleasantly surprised by the quality of people I meet in my training. Please hear from my heart, Thank You volunteers! You all make a BIG difference!NAS Worldwide Acceptance and shipbuilding.
Product integrity is carefully maintained. Aerospace design, manufacturing and operation have always been accomplished in an environment that is centered on an awesome responsibility for human life. NAS have a long history of successfully meeting the challenges of safe, reliable operation in severe environments. NAS comply with MIL-STD-480, MIL-STD-483 and other requirements for interchangeability, traceability and configuration control specified in FAA, DoD and NASA regulations. Anyone using an NAS part knows that it has been repeatedly tested and evaluated by users all over the world. This continual attention to the standards, together with the dedication of AIA committees that develop and maintain them are reasons for their reputation for integrity and reliability.
“The NAS series is best known for its state-of-the-art, high strength, precision fasteners.”
Former U.S. Military specifications maintained by AIA. In cooperation with the Department of Defense, the NASC has converted over 500 MIL-spec’s to NAS. These converted documents carry a NASM (for inch based) or NAM (for Metric based) prefix, followed by the same numbering used in the MIL-spec.Many NAS have been adopted by the Department of Defense so a contractor does not need to obtain special authorization to use them. DoD-adopted NAS parts can be used just like MIL-spec and MS parts. Approximately 35 percent of the active NAS are listed in the DoD Index of Specifications and Standards (DODISS) and MIL-BUL 147, Specifications and Standards of Non-Government Organizations Released for Flight Vehicle Construction. The trend of DoD adoption of NAS documents is expected to increase due to DoD’s commitment to utilize voluntary standards whenever possible. NAS parts constitute the largest stock of industry standard items in the federal inventory.
NAS Facts
The National Aerospace Standards (NAS) collection constitutes one of the largest groups of voluntary standards in the U.S. AIA’s National Aerospace Standards Committee (NASC) has been developing standards since 1941.
Parts made in accordance with NAS standards are used in aircraft ranging from DC-3’s to the 787; all types of spacecraft; nearly every major weapon system and all types of ground and airborne electronics systems. Most of the free world’s aircraft and aerospace products, including those designed and built outside the U.S., incorporate parts and components complying with NAS standards..
Approximately 100 NAS standards specify requirements for manufacturing equipment used by aerospace and other industries, including numerically controlled (NC), computer aided manufacturing (CAM) machine tools, and NC welding and fabrication equipment. One of the first standards for an industrial robot, NAS875, was developed under the auspices of
the NASC.
Anticipating the eventual need for aerospace standards for metric parts, nearly 150 metric aerospace standards have been prepared that are designated “NA” to differentiate them from those of “inch” measure.
NAS Users
The applications for National Aerospace Standards are as wide ranging as the products they define. Obviously all tiers of contractors and subcontractors which build aerospace systems and equipment are primary users. Other potential users include: Government and commercial buyers of aerospace equipment; Government and commercial overhaul and rework facilities; Manufacturers of parts and machinery defined by NAS; Distributors of NAS parts; Fixed base operators; Aeronautical technical institutes and universities; Regulatory agencies in the transportation field; Technical information centers and libraries.
“There are many reasons for the acceptance of NAS”
There are also many users of NAS standards outside the United States. NAS are being supplied to subscribers in more than 50 countries.As long as aircraft are flying, they need to be maintained. That is why there is continuing interest in NAS standards because many civil and military aircraft designed 30 years ago or more are still in regular service.
NAS Availability
NAS standards are published and copyrighted by the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA). AIA is the national trade association representing U.S. companies engaged in research, development and manufacture of such aerospace systems as aircraft, missiles, spacecraft and space launch vehicles; propulsion, guidance and control systems for flight vehicles; and a variety of airborne and ground-based equipment essential to flight operations. The industry AIA represents is one of the nation’s largest and a foremost positive contributor to the U.S. balance of trade.Autoimmune disorders are rare and difficult to diagnose.

Don’t say it’s over, because it’s not. The big win in Florida hands Romney 50 delegates, maybe, probably, unless Florida ends up doling them out proportionally as other states are. If that happens, Romney’s lead will be reduced. But winning in Florida, as the first closed GOP primary and the first state that can be said to be a microcosm of the entire US is significant.
Nevada caucuses on February 4, territory that favors Mitt Romney and Ron Paul for different reasons. Super Tuesday is coming up March 6, and includes some states friendly to Gingrich, Santorum and Romney. At this point, even if Romney had won Florida by 50 points we have still seen less than 6% of the total delegates awarded. Romney has less than 100 delegates to date, and needs more than 1100 to clinch the nomination. A lot has already happened to upend this primary several times, and a lot more can still happen.
The exit polls keep telling us that a majority of Republican voters want someone else in the race. That’s very unlikely to happen, but those numbers do tell us something important: Mitt Romney has not sealed the deal. He hasn’t sealed the deal because the base of the party distrusts him, and it has valid reasons for that distrust. He still has some time in the primary to earn that trust. Or, someone else has time to earn it instead.

These inefficiencies then trickle up to wholesalers who then have to raise costs and deadlines for deliveries.
This caught the attention of second-time entrepreneurs Bruno Ballardie and Fernando Zanatta, who started ZAX in 2019 to develop a platform that unites freight, delivery and payments tools to connect sellers and buyers in Brazil.
Prior to starting ZAX, CEO Ballardie was founder of eÓtica, a glasses e-commerce company that merged with Lema21 in 2018. CTO Zanatta was founder of Netlolo, a tool that connected clients with global experts, and was also previously CTO for Dafiti and COO for Buscapé.
They saw a direct-to-consumer market that was becoming huge thanks to technology and innovation, but a wholesale sector that wasn’t seeing the same kind of growth. Many people traveled to city centers like São Paulo to buy inventory, but were using pen and paper to write orders and WhatsApp to transact.
“We saw a huge opportunity to help people make a great business,” Ballardie told TechCrunch. “The market was lagging — there is only 7% of e-commerce penetration, and in the wholesale sector, it is 1% or lower. All of the area was underdeveloped in terms of logistics, payments and products discovery, so we created a tool for that.”
ZAX’s addressable market for B2B transactions, just in Brazil, is estimated to be BRL 2.4 trillion, or $445.6 billion, Ballardie said. ZAX’s platform was initially a clothing wholesale, but has expanded to shoes, electronics, toys, accessories and beauty items. Buyers come on the platform, choose their products, then the method of shipment and the form of payment.
Today, ZAX raised $6 million in Series A funding in a round that was led by Atlantico and included FJ Labs, Caravela Capital, GFC and Canary. GFC and Canary each led one of ZAX’s previous investment rounds. The new capital brings the company’s total funding to $8.3 million.
“ZAX has shown a great execution in a very short period,” said Julio Vasconcellos, Atlantico’s managing partner, in a written statement. “They have a lot of potential to help sellers and buyers not only in Brazil, but throughout Latin America, where wholesale and retail can grow a lot by using more technology.”
ZAX is working with over 700 suppliers — an increase from 100 prior to the pandemic — and since March 2020, its revenue has grown 10 times, Ballardie said. It has a team of 65 employees and has more than 50,000 buyers using the platform.
The new funding will enable the company to expand into two more regions in Brazil and add to its product lines in the beauty products and accessories categories. Ballardie also wants to hire additional technology and product development staff.
Next up, ZAX is investing in financial services, piloting some buy now, pay later initiatives and integrating financial partners to provide working capital for customers. The company now offers a 30-day line of capital and point-of-sale system and will follow up with a digital wallet and other payment tools in the future.Categories Andy Says Film & Television Series Spirited Away: A Look Back at the Spooky BBC Series Apparitions Post author By Andy M Post date October 8, 2017 No Comments on Spirited Away: A Look Back at the Spooky BBC Series Apparitions Martin Shaw as Father Jacob in Apparitions “God will speak!

Mutagenesis and quantitative binding assays were utilized to validate the crystallographic user interface then. Our results support a model where RPN13 recruitment towards the proteasome is normally improved by phosphorylation of RPN2 Tyr-950, possess essential implications for initiatives to develop particular inhibitors from the RPN2CRPN13 connections, and suggest the life of a unknown stress-response pathway previously. of 7.15 0.27 nm (Fig. 1, of 0.90 0.07 nm under identical conditions (Fig. 1, represent S.E. Crystal framework from the RPN2940C952,pTyr950CRPN13PRUCubiquitin complicated To look for the structural basis for AR-C117977 the excess binding energy from the phosphotyrosine-containing peptide, we crystallized a ternary RPN2940C952,pTyr950CRPN13PRUCubiquitin complicated and gathered X-ray diffraction data to at least one 1.76 ?. Crystals had been grown in circumstances identical to your previously reported RPN2940C953CRPN13PRUCubiquitin framework (31), which differs just inside the RPN2 peptide. Particularly, the RPN2940C952pTyr-950 peptide found in the current framework does not have one residue, Asp-953, that was unresolved in the last framework, and possesses the phosphate on Tyr-950. Oddly enough, crystals from the phosphorylated complicated grew within a different space group (P31 P21), indicating that both crystal structures aren’t isomorphous. The framework was dependant on molecular substitute using the binary RPN13PRUCubiquitin complicated in the unphosphorylated framework (PDB code 5V1Y) (31) as the search model and was processed to ? map ((?)99.4, 99.4, 41.7????????, , ()90.0, 90.0, 120.0????Resolution (?)40.0C1.76 (1.82C1.76)????of 18.0 0.07 nm, whereas it binds RPN2940C952,pTyr950 having a of 11.2 0.9 nm, thereby showing a modest 1.6-fold preference for the phosphorylated peptide. An even stronger effect was seen for RPN13 R104A, which bound unphosphorylated peptide slightly tighter than RPN2940C952,pTyr950, with observed ideals of 16.8 0.9 and 27.2 0.15 nm, respectively. Table 2 Binding statistics = 427.3 72.8 nm) and RPN13 R104E (= 1115 341 nm) for which binding was disrupted 500- and 1200-fold, respectively. In addition to greatly weakening binding, these mutations reverse the binding preference such that the unphosphorylated peptide bound 5C10-fold more tightly than the phosphorylated peptide (Table 2, column 6). RPN13 Lys-83 contributes to binding of pTyr-950 In addition to residues that directly coordinate RPN2 pTyr-950 in the crystal structure, we propose that Lys-83 coordinates pTyr-950 under physiological conditions that lack ethylene glycol. To test this probability, binding studies were performed using the RPN13 K83A mutant, which exposed the binding of unphosphorylated peptide is essentially unchanged (= 8.9 0.5 nm) but the phosphorylated peptide is no longer preferentially bound (= 9.4 0.7 nm) (Table 2). These observations verify that Lys-83 contributes to the additional binding energy observed upon phosphorylation of Tyr-950. Conversation Previous work mapped the RPN13-binding epitope within RPN2 (31,C34), explained the molecular determinants of binding between RPN13PRU and the RPN2 C-terminal peptide (31, 34), and explained how RPN13PRU is definitely auto-ubiquitylated and restricts degradation of ubiquitylated protein substrates in impaired proteasomes Nos1 (38). In this work, we advance the model AR-C117977 of RPN13 rules by describing a phosphorylation switch within RPN2 that might regulate recruitment of RPN13 to the proteasome. Defining the precise physiological tasks of RPN13 is definitely complicated from the practical redundancy it stocks using the proteasome ubiquitin receptors RPN1 and RPN10 (39,C42). Although losing or down-regulation of RPN13 will not influence the majority turnover of ubiquitylated protein, specific physiological substrates of RPN13 have already been identified, like the NF-B inhibitor IB (43). NF-B is most beneficial known because of its function in irritation, which fosters multiple hallmarks of cancers (44); impacts many, if not absolutely all, levels of tumorigenesis (45); and continues to be referred to as the matchmaker that connects irritation to malignancies through appearance of genes that promote success, proliferation, and metastasis (46,C49). Elevated degrees of RPN13 total bring about improved prices of IB degradation, launching inhibition from the NF-B signaling pathway thus. Furthermore, it’s been set up that increased mobile degrees of RPN13 correlate using the starting point and development of many malignancies (11,C18, 28). RPN13 is normally noticed at substoichiometric ratios in endogenously purified proteasomes (33, 35), recommending that under usual cell culture circumstances the AR-C117977 RPN13-binding epitope in RPN2 is normally unsaturated. Thus, Tyr-950 phosphorylation may serve to improve the true variety of RPN13-associated proteasomes. A related likelihood is normally that phosphorylation lowers the off-rate for RPN13 binding, which might be one factor in optimizing association with.Iceboat Swap Meets! Hard-water Season Begins….

Or do I need to use a secondary antibody to find it? 🤓Antibodies, or immunoglobulins, are little proteins that recognize specific parts of foreign proteins (or other molecules) by their “shape.” Our bodies use them to recognize and direct the immune system at things that don’t belong in our bodies (like proteins from bacteria or viruses) – things we *don’t* want to find there. And scientists use them to recognize & measure or isolate specific things – often things we *do* want to find there! When we use antibodies outside of bodies “in vitro”, there’s no immune system to alert, but the antibody can still bind. And this makes the thing you’re looking for easier to find!
Some terminology before we talk about how they work. The “thing” that an antibody recognizes is called an ANTIGEN and the “specific part” of that thing is an EPITOPE. An antigen can be *anything* perceived to be “foreign” that triggers an immune response (even something “harmless” like a peanut) whereas a pathogen is a disease-causing microorganism like a virus or a bacterium). Inside the body, antibody binding can trigger an immune response, which involves the body directing destruction machinery to attack the invader and making more of the antibody that bound.
In the lab, we take advantage of antibodies’ specificity to help us find antigens we’re interested in. One place antibodies are used in the lab are in an experiment called a Western Blot, where the antigen is a protein you’re looking for on a membrane, and the epitope is a specific site on that protein. Much more on Western Blots starting here:
But basically you separate proteins by size in an SDS-PAGE gel, transfer (blot) them onto a membrane, then use antibodies to probe the membrane to detect specific proteins.
But how do antibodies get their specificity? Organisms have to “learn” what doesn’t belong, so that they can recognize & respond to threats more effectively if the invader tries again. and this learning process is called ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY. There’s so much to learn in science it can get overwhelming – thankfully this type of learning we can let organisms do for us! We let organisms do the selection, then we isolate and use the antibodies we want.
But how does that selection occur?)
Our adaptive immune systems work by a sort of trial & error approach – immune cells recombine DNA sequences to make lots of different antibodies. Most of these won’t work, but, when one does, it gets added to your body’s “permanent collection” – the cell that has that “winning lotto ticket” specializes in making it and it makes more copies of itself. This puts the pathogen on the immune system’s “watch list.” Now, if that same pathogen tries to invade you, you’ll have antibodies that recognize it as foreign and call in the molecular assassins
A bit more detail: the “experimenters” are (in contrast to the bacterial immune system, CRISPR which I discuss below)..
Instead of messing around with the entire antibody protein, experimentation is restricted to specific “variable regions” which serve as unique parts that recognize different antigens. Throughout the experimentation, a “generic” adapter region (constant region) is kept constant – but it’s ”
Even though antibodies are pretty small proteins, they still have multiple peptide chains – antibodies have 2 copies of a heavy chain (~440 amino acids long) & 2 copies of a light chain (~ half that length) & there are different choices for how to make the chains – they can’t mess with the constant regions – the generic part that allows the unique part to be displayed, but they can “experiment” with variable regions. Both the heavy & the light chains have variable regions & they both contribute to the antigen-binding site that forms when the chains link up through disulfide bonds. for itself – if they want to coordinate, they have to rely on external cues like splicing factors that only get expressed at certain times & in certain tissues.
Now that we’ve looked at how antibodies are made, let’s look at how we can use them for “unintended” purposes in the lab. In Western Blots, we usually use 2 antibodies – a primary antibody that recognizes the specific thing we’re looking for and binds it but it doesn’t have anything “seeable” about it & a secondary antibody that recognizes the primary antibody and has something detectable about it. The secondary antibodies usually recognize the generic part (constant region) so you can use things like “goat anti-rat” which is a secondary antibody that recognizes the generic adapter part of a primary antibody made by a rat.
We use this 2-tiered strategy so that we don’t need “fancy” (detectable) antibodies for every single protein we want to look for. Plus, it increases sensitivity because multiple secondary antibodies can bind each bound primary one so it amplifies the signal
You add the primary antibody after you block the membrane with a “generic” protein like BSA or milk proteins so that antibodies don’t just stick to it nonspecifically (the same protein-stickiness that lets the proteins you want stick to the membrane can also let proteins stick to the membrane that you don’t want stuck, leading to high background signal (false alarms)). More here:
Then you wash off non-bound primary antibody & add). Then you do whatever you need to do to detect the detectable thing (e.g. shine light on it or add substrate) & see where you see signal.
Another type of adaptive immune system scientists take advantage of in the lab is the bacterial CRISPR system. Unlike our adaptive immune systems, bacterial immune systems rely on CRISPR guides, which are pieces of RNA that recognize parts of foreign DNA by their sequence.
Both systems rely on “unique parts” that recognize specific invaders and “generic parts” that allow the unique parts to be processed & displayed. In our adaptive immune systems, the unique parts are the variable regions of antibodies, and they come from “trial and error” – randomly producing antibodies and then making more of the one(s) that, by chance, match.
Instead of this random but effective approach, bacterial adaptive immune systems go straight to the source – they take a bit of the invader’s DNA and use that as the unique part. So it, by design, will bind the invader if it tries again – if it survives that initial attack. Much more on this here:

“When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them, they hated him and could not speak a kind word to him.” (v 4) He was his father’s favorite and it drove his brothers crazy (angry)! Not a recommended pattern for positive family life. Even so, the Joseph story reminds me of Jesus. The Bible says that the Lord was crucified because the Jewish leaders were envious. (Mark 15:10) Are we ever the same? When God chooses someone for a special task and gives them special gifts for the accomplishment of same, do we ever second-guess? Wonder why it wasn’t us? Unwise. The Bible says that God works all things after the counsel of His own will. He is immensely wise and magnificently good. Better for us to trust the “gifts and calling” that He puts on every life without envy or anger. No favorites here, just the unrepentant wisdom of God.

The gown is inspired by and uses motifs found in the Cupola Room of Kensington Palace because of course it does. It would be very much like Mr. Porter to deliberately choose such a gown in order to cement his bona fides as, and relationship to true royalty. THE CATEGORY IS… ROYAL REALNESS. And that’s all great and we think we are fully in love with the bodice. But the skirt is honestly kind of ugly, as are the shoes. This is a truly bold and unforgettable look and, as always, we support Billy’s mission and the way he’s carrying it out. But he’s almost always at his best when his boundary-pushing, paradigm-shattering style choices stay on the the fashion side of the line, as opposed to what’s on the other side of it: spectacle.

The Weeknd (alias Abel Tesfaye) has been making the festival rounds this year, but there’s a difference between being one blurb on the packed, eye-chart-like line-ups of Lollapalooza and Coachella and headlining the thing — which is exactly what he did with his Billboard Hot 100 Fest set on Saturday. To a stadium full of fans mostly or only there to see him, the former mixtape star proved his mainstream crossover potential. EW got a beachside seat to this coming-out party for R&B’s newest superstar. Here’s what we saw.
Asking for consent
In the grand R&B tradition, The Weeknd is pretty much always singing about sex. There are variations, of course – weird sex, pity sex, ecstatic sex – but all his songs carry an elemental sensuality. Before laying his vibes over the Billboard crowd, T performed the proper prelude and asked for consent. “Can I get sexy with you, New York??” the singer screamed. “Can I get on top of you tonight?” With a crowd-wide scream of affirmation, the show was off.
Good use of EDM tools
The Weeknd took the reins of Billboard’s main stage from Axwell^Ingrosso, who have served as EDM’s best mainstream ambassadors since their days in Swedish House Mafia. The transition made more sense than you might think. It’s 2015 and genre barriers are breaking down across the board, but The Weeknd in particular has successfully brought EDM elements into his R&B. On Saturday that went for both the sound (his performance of “Love Me Harder” had some breathtaking drops) and feel (T’s ethereal, semi-indecipherable singing became as elemental an instrument as anything in Axwell^Ingrosso’s arsenal). Plus The Weeknd’s multi-colored light show (complete with sizable amounts of fire and smoke) carried itself well even by the Swedish duo’s high bar. Of course, The Weeknd hasn’t abandoned the traditional tools of the R&B trade; his accomplished band bust out enough funky riffs to please the Dave Grohls of the world.
Expanded songs live
The Weeknd’s early mixtapes were best listened to through headphones while wallowing in terrible relationship decisions. His music since then has gotten bigger and poppier, and T has figured out how to expand all his songs for a live stadium setting. T’s voice sounded clear at the Nikon Jones Beach theater, and hits like “Can’t Feel My Face” inspired crowd singalongs.
Took what he needed from superstars
It’s pretty much inevitable that any young R&B crooner with a shot at stardom will face comparisons to previous archetypes. The Weeknd proved Saturday that he is his own strange, singular force, but willing to take what he needs from predecessors. His performance of Beyonce’s “Drunk In Love” was a definite highlight, since that song and that aspect of Beyonce fits Tesfaye perfectly. Tesfaye lacks the rapid wordplay and semi-rapping of “Crazy In Love” Beyonce, but he can sure belt out ballads about how elementally joyous and painful it feels to be in love.
Tesfaye has been most frequently compared to Michael Jackson, likely because their voices sound kind of similar (he and Tame Impala’s Kevin Parker should start a support group). While Tesfaye is not quite the supernova Jackson was (who is?), he does have a similar swagger, as he demonstrated by busting out some moonwalking footwork during “Can’t Feel My Face.”
Proved “Can’t Feel My Face” should’ve been song of the summer
At this point, the consensus about this year’s Song of the Summer seems to be that there is none. Instead of the monolithic dominance of a “Blurred Lines” or “Fancy,” we’re left with a field of has-beens and coulda-woulda-shoulda’s. But The Weeknd’s climactic performance of “Can’t Feel My Face” on Saturday, along with other new songs from upcoming album Beauty Behind the Madness, makes one wish that his album rollout had started even a month earlier. It’ll still be huge, as crowd love for songs like “Often” demonstrated, but it sure feels like he could’ve owned the summer.
Better late than never. Fall needs its soundtrack, too.

For this factor, sleeping on your side or stomachwhich smooshes your face versus your pillowcan likewise add to fine lines below your eyes. Under-eye wrinkles are most typical among people with poor flow (which tends to manifest as dark circles), extremely dry skin, and allergic reactions. preparation time.
Inflammation increases swelling and reduces blood circulation, resulting in increased rate of damage to collagen and elastin," states Dr. Heskett. "In addition, itching or scratching the eye location can cause repeated wear and tear on the skin." Is there anything you can do to avoid under-eye wrinkles? While under-eye wrinkles are basically an inescapable part of the aging procedure, there are a few things you can do to stave them off: "Utilize a moisturizer and serum that's particularly developed for the eyelids, which require a different structure of nutrients and moisture than other skin on the face and body," says Dr.

Summary What triggers wrinkles? There are numerous aspects that contribute to the beginning of wrinkles.
While old collagen is broken down and gotten rid of, new collagen is being produced and installed. Scientists have found that smoking cigarettes tobacco products causes a decrease in the production of brand-new collagen. An absence of new collagen results in the advancement of wrinkles. This may likewise be because of the absence of blood supply to the skin brought on by smoking cigarettes.
Clients who were recently treated with Accutane needs to wait on at least 6 months after their last dose before laser resurfacing. Laser resurfacing is generally better matched for fair-skinned individuals, as dark skinned people have a higher risk of hyperpigmentation (darkening of the skin) with particular treatments. Exposure to the sun after this treatment must be avoided for 3 months.
It obstructs the chemical signals that cause muscles to contract. Botox is injected into the muscles whose contractions cause wrinkles, such as between the eyebrows (frown lines) and the lines that radiate from the corner of the eyes (crow's feet) - olive oil. The effects of Botox usually last for 3 to 4 months.
The treatment would then be repeated. If you select not to duplicate the injections, your wrinkles will return to no worse than they were initially. There may be short-lived inflammation, bruising, or stinging around the Botox injection site(s). In incredibly unusual cases, there might be a minor cover droop for a number of days after the injection, however all reported side effects have actually been short-lived - patch test.
We all know that aging is unavoidable and wrinkles are natural. But if you become part of the numerous that dread the formation of deep wrinkles, there are numerous ways to resolve them - aloe vera. Wrinkles are a natural part of the aging process and tend to manifest when the skin loses elasticity.
As we age, our skin naturally loses elasticity and ends up being drier, that makes it harder for it to ward off damage. Include to that the loss of fat that occurs as we mature, and facial wrinkles end up being more pronounced. Recurring facial movements, such as smiling, frowning, and squinting, can also form wrinkles in our skin.
Smoking cigarettes and heavy drinking have a direct effect on our bodies, and our skin is no different. Smoking can speed up the aging procedure, and drinking dehydrates the skin, which leads to more noticable wrinkles. olive oil.
It's never too late to make much healthier choices stimulating cell turnover and increasing collagen production, which can reduce the look of wrinkles.
Retinoids are available in the form of prescription products, such as tretinoin or tazarotene, or in non-prescription items in the form of retinol. Retinoids are all-around crowd-pleasers, however there is a caution: they're exceptionally powerful, which suggests they can trigger inflammation, dryness, redness, and flaking, especially when used incorrectly. It is necessary to present retinoids to your skin slowly, which implies utilizing it just two to 3 times a week.
You could also attempt a technique called buffering, which implies blending your retinoid with a moisturizer to reduce its strength. Constantly utilize retinoids during the night and follow up with an excellent moisturizer - skin cells. If you utilize brought on by repetitive muscle motions such as smiling, frowning, or squinting, Botox is a great fix. Botox can be used to smoothen crow's feet, forehead lines, smile lines, and more.
Botox won't have much of a result on these kinds of wrinkles. The treatment is rather easy: the Botox supplier will utilize a needle to inject Botox into a particular muscle. Some suppliers will use topical anaesthesia prior to injecting it with Botox. It ought to only take a few minutes with just minimal pain.
Dermal fillers are great for wrinkles brought on by the loss of volume in the face. They can bring back lost volume and plump up the face for a more younger look. hyaluronic acid. Unlike Botox, dermal fillers can be used to smooth out static wrinkles brought on by the loss of collagen, elasticity, and fat, in addition to gravity and sun damage.
A topical anaesthetic will be applied to the skin (aloe vera). A tool tipped with little needles will then be used over the skin to develop micro-punctures, which will activate the body to produce more collagen and elastin.
Not only are they less reliable, but you likewise risk damaging or contaminating your skin. A go-to treatment for great lines and wrinkles, Fraxel is a microscopic laser that permeates the skin to improve the skin's collagen and elastin production.
Fraxel works by producing micro-injuries in the skin that promote the development of collagen and elastin. Your skin will initially end up being red and inflamed before beginning to flake and peel.
While numerous skin care items and medications work, few will change your skin or cause wrinkles to disappear in just a couple of days or weeks.

Still, it's regular to feel self-conscious about them, especially if you seem like they make you look older than you feel. Lots of people go to terrific lengths to avoid or deal with wrinkles consisting of complex skincare routines, injections or surgeries - fine lines. With all the info out there, it can be challenging to know what's real and what's just a tactic to get you to invest more money on skin services and products.
Here are five myths about wrinkles, debunked. Myth # 1: My moms and dads both have wrinkles and I'm bound to get them, too You may have acquired your eyes or your humor from your parents, but most likely not your wrinkles. "When it concerns wrinkles, there are other a lot more impactful elements than genes at play - facial lines.
Since when you start getting wrinkles is not entirely dependent on genetics, skin care is not a lost cause, specifically when a regimen is started early and regularly kept throughout life. There are methods to slow down the procedure of aging in your skin, consisting of: Wearing sunscreen of 50 SPF, not only every day, however with reapplication every two hours, even when it's not visibly sunny Moisturizing and utilizing protective antioxidants Preventing products that sting, burn or trigger inflammation Using products just as directed on the label or by your supplier Adjusting items to altering skin qualities with age or changes in weather condition, and so on
Nevertheless, you can keep those lines from forming earlier than regular if you look after your skin early on to prevent additional damage. Misconception # 2: There's one best anti-aging skincare routine out there Your sister, buddy, mom, next-door neighbor everybody has a various skincare regimen. The concern is: Does somebody have the secret to a perfect skin regimen that prevents wrinkles and everyone else is simply losing their time? "The short response is no; there's not one best anti-aging skin care routine you're losing out on," discusses Dr.
Skin care regimens include a lot of experimentation, and discovering what works best for you. However, there are some crucial elements and active ingredients to think about that apply to everybody. Tips on getting the most out of your anti-aging skin care routine include: Start with one item and let your skin adapt to it prior to introducing extra items (fine lines).
If you have actually found yourself spending hundreds of dollars on lots of different anti-wrinkle creams, stop over-treating and overspending. The most effective wrinkle regimens are very little, and you ought to utilize as couple of items as possible. Downsizing your programs will save you money, and it's better for your skin, anyhow. Lastly, think about medical-grade items initially, as these are usually safer, more reliable and cheaper than items cost department or charm supply shops.
However, even when the clouds are out it's necessary to use sun block and protective sun equipment such as hats and sunglasses. Not only does sunscreen decrease your opportunities of skin cancer, it's also among the most reliable anti-aging items available. Sun block secures your skin from damaging UV rays, and it likewise enables your skin to repair itself to prevent additional damage - fine lines.
To get the most out of your sunscreen, utilize a broad-spectrum sun block, which consists of protection for UVA and UVB rays as well as other sources of damage. "You must also discover a sun block that consists of antioxidants to get additional defense from light and pollution," states Dr. Percec. There's no product or procedure that can completely reverse the damage of not wearing sun block.
Take Care of Your Skin and Embrace Modification It's typical to get irritated with the fine lines that appear on your skin over time. While you must be sure to take care of your skin, try to welcomeNEW BRUNSWICK, NJ—U.S. Senator Frank Lautenberg's death came with nineteen months left in his six-year term, and a controversial decision announced by Governor Chris Christie has acclerated the schedule of a mounting electoral campaign to replace Lautenberg in the Senate.
The late senator passed away just one week ago, but candidates to replace him are required to submit 1,000 signatures from registered members of their political party by today at 4pm.
The accelerated timeline Christie called for, which places the special election on a Wednesday in October, has forced the hand of several politicians who were planning to seek the Senate seat when it up for a scheduled election in 2014.
Additionally, the Christie decision limits the impact the special election will have on his own re-election prospects. Another option would have been to hold both elections the same day.
In accordance with state law, Governor Chris Christie appointed his attorney general Jeff Chiesa, a Republican, to temporarily fill the seat on Thursday.
The special election will be held October 16, but first a primary election will give Republicans and Democrats a chance to select their respective candidates on August 13.
The US Constitution requires that candidates be 30 years of age, reside in New Jersey, and have been a US citizen for at least nine years.
FOUR-WAY RACE AMONG DEMOCRATS QUICKLY TAKES SHAPE
Until Lautenberg's death, Democrats had held both of the state's US Senate seats since 1982.
Congressman Frank Pallone, who represents New Brunswick and other sections of Middlesex and Monmouth Counties, had made statements suggesting he wanted to succeed the longtime Senator.
Lautenberg eventually announced he would not seek re-election in February, for health reasons. The fight to replace him had already been heating up, even before he announced he would not seek another term.
Pallone, a former State Senator and U.S. House of Representatives veteran of 25 years, will face at least three opponents from his own party in the August 13 primary election: Newark Mayor Booker, fellow Congressman Rush Holt, who represents Mercer County, and Sheila Oliver, the Speaker of the NJ Assembly, who hails from Essex County.
Republicans Steve Lonegan of Bogota and Arlieta Eck of Piscataway are expected to run against each other in the Republican primary. But the field won't be set for either race until today's 4pm petition deadline passes.
Pallone has planned a press conference for 1:30pm today at the Division of Elections, where he plans to submit his candidate petitions.
While Booker has a clear advantage in name recognition thanks to his national profile, Pallone accumulated a lot of campaign cash over his two decades in Congress and was expected to gain the endorsement of the incumbent Lautenberg.
But without Lautenberg vouching for Pallone, it will be much more difficult to get votes from Lautenberg’s supporters. But Pallone does lead in one important category: fundraising.
According to the Federal Election Commission database, Pallone has roughly $3.7 million ready to spend on a campaign, while Booker only has about $1.9 million on hand, and Holt has almost $800,000.
With the primary only about two months away, Pallone will likely have an opportunity to outspend his opponents. But whoever wins the August primary will have to go on to face a Republican in an equally expensive special election campaign two months later.
Robert Torricelli, the man who last occupied the Senate seat, told the Newark Star-Ledger that if the primary were scheduled for June 2014, as it was before Lautenberg's death, Booker would hold the advantage.
"Clearly, in a standard primary, Booker would be a favorite," Torricelli was quoted in the newspaper. "But in a low turnout, probably the lowest turnout in history, the advantage goes to someone with committed followers, an identifiable base, and that makes Pallone at least an equal candidate, if not more."
But early polls show Booker with a healthy lead, including a poll conducted by Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind poll.
The poll asked self-identified Democratic voters who they preferred to win the Democratic nomination. Of the 702 people polled, 50% chose Booker, 7% favored Rush Holt, an 4% chose Pallone.
Booker even beat the late Frank Lautenberg in a similar poll by FDU in January, in which 42% of self-identified Democrat voters and Democrat-leaning voters preferred Booker over Lautenberg, while only 20% preferred the late Senator.
TENSION OVER LAUTENBERG'S SEAT BEGAN LONG AGO
Some Democrats became frustrated after Booker played coy with the his party regarding future plans as Booker turned down repeated offers to run for Governor, and instead announced his intentions of running for Lautenberg's Senate seat – before Lautenberg decided to forgo re-election.
In response to the Booker anouncement, an anonymous aide for Lautenberg called it, "a classless show of disrespect by a completely self-absorbed politician."
An anonymous aide for Pallone also criticized Booker's early moves: "Congressman Pallone and Senator Lautenberg are in the fights of their lives to get $20 billion to $30 billion back to New Jersey in Hurricane aid. The last thing they need is this distraction."
State Senator Loretta Weinberg (D-Bergen) said Booker’s announcement, "distracts from the governor's race, it distracts from the aid bill and it does not give respect to Senator Lautenberg."
"It's a race that's a year and a half, two years off. We have some pretty important things between now and then," Weinberg said at the time.
Now that the election is even sooner than expected, some Democrats might not forget the slight against Lautenberg – especially now that he’s deceased.
It was in January that Booker opened a Senate fundraising account while maintaining that he was only exploring options. Not very long after, though, Booker began fundraising for his campaign, establishing himself as serious opponent to Pallone.
Last month, Booker moved in on Pallone's home turf, New Jersey's 6th congressional district.
A little more than a week before the Asbury Park's council elections held on May 14th, Booker sent a letter of endorsement to Jeff Loffredo and his Forward Asbury team, reproduced in this Asbury Park Sun article.
By hijacking the spotlight for a moment in Asbury Park and endorsing winning candidates, he stands to increase his name recognition and reputation, potentially siphoning shore votes from Pallone, who, along with the now-deceased Lautenberg, has been adamant about restoring the Jersey shores post-Hurricane Sandy.
In another instance of Booker pushing Pallone into a corner, the Brick City mayor attended an event in April with Barbara Buono, a State Senator from Middlesex County whom Pallone has strongly supported as she contends for the Democratic nomination in this year’s gubernatorial election against Chris Christie.
Booker then sent out an e-mail to Democrats announcing his endorsement of Buono and asked voters to financially contribute to her campaign, as Buono needed "rapid response funds."
Booker essentially took the spotlight from Pallone, who had emceed her first campaign kickoff event in New Brunswick while pundits speculated on Booker's absence.
DRAMATIC PALLONE MOVE MAY INDICATE A MESSY CONTEST AHEAD
Last month, Pallone sent a letter to Booker accusing his office of withholding funds for AIDS patients in Newark.
According to Pallone, the Hyacinth Foundation, a New Brunswick-based non-profit AIDS assistance program that helps house and treat HIV and AIDS patients, has been footing the bill while awaiting funds from the Newark city government
Pallone claimed the city currently owes the organization $124,000 in federal funds and will owe $147,000 by the end of May.
"This is simply unacceptable," the longtime Congressman wrote in the letter.
Booker’s team remained resilient though.
Spokesman James Allen responded that nothing was out of the ordinary: "In fact, the Hyacinth funding is on track to be approved shortly – and months earlier than last year," Allen said.
Despite the clear attack, Booker didn’t return fire. Instead his team offered Pallone an olive branch.
"We look forward to working in good faith with Representative Pallone on Hyacinth funding and the other important issues," Allen said.
Now with a primary showdown in just over two months, and tensions running high, the gloves might come off with just a little provocation.
Pallone could self-destruct his own campaign if he’s too negative towards Booker, and since Booker seems to be in the lead, he will probably be reluctant to sling mud back at Pallone.
Still, Pallone might just be able to turn the tide.
The Newark Star-Ledger revealed that that many have become disenchanted with Booker after learning he spent 119 days "out of state and the New York City area" over an eighteen-month period.
City spokeswoman Esmeralda Diaz Cameron tried to explain: "Even when Mayor Booker is not physically in Newark, he is still on the job; the vast majority of time spent outside of Newark is used to bring new resources, opportunities, jobs, ideas and innovation back to Newark."
While this could easily provide ammunition to his opponents, Booker said in an event kicking off his campaign this weekend that he intends to run a positive campaign without negative attacks.
His comments echoed those he made to a PolitickerNJ reporter, when asked about a potential campaign against Buono for Governor.
"Should [Buono]."Abstract
Layered metal sulfides (MoS2, WS2, SnS2, and SnS) offer high potential as advanced anode materials in sodium ion batteries upon integration with highly-conductive graphene materials. However, in addition to being costly and time-consuming, existing strategies for synthesizing sulfides/graphene composites often involve complicated procedures. It is therefore essential to develop a simple yet scalable pathway to construct sulfide/graphene composites for practical applications. Here, we highlight a one-step, template-free, high-throughput "self-bubbling" method for producing MoS2/graphene composites, which is suitable for large-scale production of sulfide/graphene composites. The final product featured MoS2nanoflakes distributed in three-dimensional macroporous monolithic graphene. Moreover, this unique MoS2/graphene composite achieved remarkable electrochemical performance when being applied to Na-ion battery anodes; namely, excellent cycling stability (474 mA h g-1at 0.1 A g-1after 100 cycles) and high rate capability (406 mA h g-1at 0.25 A g-1and 359 mA h g-1at 0.5 A g-1). This self-bubbling approach should be applicable to delivering other graphene-based composites for emerging applications such as energy storage, catalysis, and sensing.

Amongst others, the EU-funded project will provide new tools to combat pollution.
The EU-funded project is combined by 41 research and industrial partners across Europe. Its use is that it addresses the width of particle accelerator applications from gigantic high-energy physics facilities, such as the Large Hadron Collider, to equipment used in hospitals, factories or, even on-board ships. In the future, ARIES could provide:
- A new-gen of particle accelerators for hospitals;
- A system to decrease harmful particle emissions in the global shipping sector;
- A major expansion of particle-accelerator technologies across various industries and scientific fields.
Newer, cheaper and more efficient accelerators are needed to highlight the benefits of modern particle acceleration technology, including advanced systems that use lasers and plasmas to energise particles. The machines, which use radio and radar-type waves to accelerate the particle beams, are large, expensive and consume vast amounts of energy, limiting their use and accessibility.
Specifically, as far as the environmental field is concerned, the ARIES team is looking for particle accelerator-based systems for the solution on harmful flue gases and sewage sludge. Also, the project is exploring a technology that could place compact particle accelerators on cargo ships in order to achieve the efficient scrubbing of environmentally harmful sulphur and nitrogen oxide emissions.
Moreover, Maurizio Vretenar, project coordinator at CERN in Switzerland, highlighted that shipping plays a major role in polluting the environment, since a large container ship is estimated to produce the same amount of pollution as 50 million cars. He continued stating that this accelerator system has many potential into reducing this environmental issue, at a lower cost than other emission-reduction solutions.
Except the maritime industry, the ARIES project plays a crucial role in the medical field too. Specifically, the project investigates how to to use modern accelerator technologies to treat cancer, and the ARIES team is designing a new generation of small accelerators to be installed in hospitals for on-demand production of isotopes for medical imaging which could become commercially available in three to four years.
Finally, amongst the advantages of the project, other benefits are set to emerge from the development of new high-temperature superconductors that offer a two-fold increase in performance compared to current materials, as well as the development of carbon-based and metal-diamond composite materials with unique thermal properties for use in extreme particle accelerators.Hot Toys Avenges Age Of Ultron Hawkeye MMS289.

I.
Next thing you know, everybody started chasing and playing around with each other. We all out in the grass tackling each other down, playing tag, then 20 minutes later I got this itching sensation and I got worse and worse by the minute! It felt like if I was getting poked with little needles, but it itched, so as I was scratching myself, I went into the bathroom and washed my arms and legs off with soap and water.
Well, guess what? That didnt work because the soap had some kind of chemicals I was allergic to in it, and made my skin break out even worse. Now I was crying because I didnt want to have ugly skin because my girl friends wouldnt like me anymore. I walked up to my mom and she asked me a thousand and one questions about why I didnt put my cream on, and why I didnt do this and that. I got a whooping and had to sit in the house until we got ready to go home.
Another time when I was 10 years old, I was at my sisters house and she had this big candy bowl dish, so I looked at all the pieces of delicious candy and couldnt figure out which one I wanted so I just picked any one (forgetting I have allergies). I cant remember what the candy tasted like but I do remember my mouth started swelling up and breaking out! My mouth also got a little itchy but good thing my mother came in the house, because she picked me up and looked at my mouth, took the candy out then gave me a whooping for eating the candy she told me not to eat!
It seems like multiple things always are happening to me in the summertime, just like when I was 11 years old and I was at my uncles house helping him clean out the garage, but I kept sneezing from the dust that was all around. when we got halfway done my eyes were all red and puffy, and I could barely breathe from inhaling all the toxic dust and dirt that was in the air so he had took me home because he was worried about the way my eyes where irritated. My mom told me to not be around areas that are dirty or dusty because it would mess with my allergies.
Allergies are not fun because you cant do a lot of things that the next person can do if they dont have allergies like you. See, for me, I have to take an allergy pill called Singulair so it can prevent me from breaking out. I have to always keep an EpiPen around so just in case I eat something that makes me sick the EpiPen will fight off the allergic reaction and give the ambulance more time to come save me. I also have to take a puffer every day for my asthma because sometimes asthma can cause your allergies to get worse too. I have to take at least 5 different medications a day to help me with my outside and inside allergy problems. I cant be around cats or dogs because their hair makes me itch and break out on certain spots of my body. I remember eating a chocolate coconut candy bar, but it did not make me sick, so I think that coconut is not actually a nut. But if I eat peanuts, peanut butter, fish, or any type of seafood, it will make me itch, and my throat will swell up bad and I wont be able to breathe. Food allergies dangerous because I can die from eating the wrong stuff in life. Thats why I have to be very careful on what I eat.
There was a time when I was at home playing with some of my little cousins that was months younger than me , and my uncle brought some fish over for my mom. We went in the kitchen and I started looking at the fish in the bag and seen a tomato in there with it, too, so I told my little cousins Im going to touch the tomato with my tongue, and I did it. 10 minutes later I started to feel a small ball-like knot in my throat, and I was getting worried but I didnt say anything until 5 minutes later. It felt like it was starting to get larger so I rushed over to my parents and told them about what was going on so they called the paramedics to come quick. Meanwhile I was sitting on the porch until they arrived, but by the time they got there the ball I felt in my throat was leaving so after they checked me, I didnt want to go to the hospital no more. That day was one of the most terrifying days that I ever had so far in life, which is why I now make sure I read the ingredients on every item in the store or at home and see what it contains. I make sure I smell the foods I eat first to make sure its not any kind of seafood, and I always ask questions about my food at restaurants to make sure Im not eating anything Im allergic to or will make me sick.
Sometimes I want to taste the foods Im allergic to. I want to be able to eat fish without it harming me, I want to be able to eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with no problem, and I heard Snickers do taste good. I still cant get over the fact that I hate the smell of fish, though. It will always make my throat itch and make it hard to breathe for me when Im around the smell. Peanut butter doesnt smell too good to me, either. I kind of like the fact that Im allergic to the foods I cant eat because it helped learn more about the ingredients in packages, it helped me be safer about what I eat, and I sometimes search up words I dont know in the ingredients.
I hope people with allergies be more careful on what they eat and what activities they do because its very dangerous for us to play with allergies. I learned that I have to be careful with everything I do in life because its easily for something bad to happen if you let it occur, but proper preparation prevents poor performance. I just hope Im safe and make sure I watch the things I eat and do in life because I dont want to die young. I want to be able to do a lot of things in life. I do not want to die because I ate the wrong thing or because I was playing sports and my asthma started acting up on me and I passed out. I still have a life to live. One day I hope my allergies go away so I wont have to deal with any food problems no more.Rajouri: Department of FCS&CA Rajouri has completed hundred per cent (100%)Aadhar seeding of the Ration cards of all the NFSA and Non-NFSA beneficiaries of the district.
With this, Rajouri along with Samba has become the first district in J&K to achieve this feat.
Aadhar Seeding is important as it helps to clean out duplications and fakes and provides accurate data to enable the implementation of direct benefit programmes. The use of Aadhaar reduces the cost of identifying persons and provides increased transparency to the government in the implementation of its schemes.
Earlier, Aadhar Seeding of the ration cards in the district was low which was creating a lot of inconvenience in prompt service delivery to the public as it was difficult for the department to identify the duplications and fakes.
Understanding the gravity of the situation, the team of the FCS&CA under the guidance of the District Development Commissioner, Rajesh K Shavan and tireless efforts of AD FCS&CA, Arif Lone.
Deputy Commissioner Rajouri, Rajesh K Shavan has also lauded the efforts of the Department for achieving the feat and advised the officer and officials to keep working with the same zeal to provide smooth and hassle-free services to the general public.

Seriously, I actually do this or drag my cat or dog for a dance. 🤣 Turn up the music, kick up you heels and hit it. Yes, dance like no one is watching!
So, I looked up the definition of fun on Google because they know everything right?
WRONG!!!!!!!
But, it works for my post so I’m going with it.
You will find many more fun versions on other sites if you care to pull it up.
Fun is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as “Light-hearted pleasure, enjoyment, … An 18th century meaning (still used in Orkney and Shetland) was ” cheat, trick, hoax”, a meaning still retained in the phrase “to make fun of”. The landlady …
DOES THAT SOUND LIKE FUN TO YOU?
NOT! Well, the light hearted pleasure, enjoyment is nice but cheat, trick, hoax… not so much!
Seeing red
Riding on my new red Specialized bike just in time for Christmas. It’s fire engine red
just like my vintage Venus bike only loaded with all the bells and whistles; SCORE!
16 gears on the handles to get me up hills,
A perfect fit, adjusted specifically to a tee for my weight and height.
It rides smoothly and shifting gears is a piece of cake.
The wind is at my back, the sun shines on my face, a perfect replacement and my butt’s not sore.
My son took me to check it out on a Facebook add he saw.
He made sure that it fit my body right, examined all its parts so sweet right?!!!!!
And then he said “Ok mom that’ll be 350.00 which was an amazing price for this 1,000 bike.|
I happily handed over the money and he said “I think Kristal’s going to love this”.
WTF?!!!!!!!!
Yes, I’m Seeing Red!
Good thing I love Kristal so much and for the record, he paid for the bike but I have to say, I was pretty excited for a minute.
Have a great Friday and weekend whatever you do! It doesn’t cost anything to laugh and will lift your spirits. Thanks as always for visiting, liking (if you do, of course), commenting and or sharing.

Well, I’m pleased you got to enjoy the bike for a moment! I miss my specialised which is 1000 miles away in my dad’s home. What with covid and Brexit, it might be a while before I see it again. But we have snow so plenty of fun is being had here! Have a great weekend xxx
Yeah, I’m the suragote rider for now so I’ll get a few more in. Oh… I’ sorry you can’t ride it and see your Dad! Someday soon I hope. And oh how the kids love the snow. I imagine that to be so!!!! Drink a hot buttered rum for me.. I used to love to go but it’s gotten crazy pricey and I never want to risk falling although cross country skiing is great exercise! ❤️xoxoxo
I really want to try cross country as downhill is too scary for me! All the slopes are closed at the moment but it looked like they were preparing them today so they could be back open tomorrow…I think the restrictions are lifting slightly🤞
Yes, I agree with you! Oh I hope they open especially since it’s outdoors!! ❤️❤️❤️ fingers crossed! AND TOES!

The Organic Pharmacy is one of my all-time favourite skincare brands and I always have a number of their products on rotation in my bathroom, I am quite passionately devoted to their Detox Body Oil and Body Brush every morning and love to start my Saturdays with their Enzyme Peel Mask to refresh and rejuvenate my skin. Lately, I have added their new Radiant Day Shield after my skincare and have been loving how soft and glowy it leaves my skin! They are a brand that I admire so much for their dedication to all things organic and homeopathic.
The Organic Pharmacy was co-founded by pharmacist and pioneering herbalist Margo Marrone who opened her first store in London back in 2002, specialising in all things organic and healthy, encouraging customers to think about the ingredients they were consuming and using on their skin while promoting the benefits of homeopathy and herbal remedies. The Organic Pharmacy became a one-stop destination for health and skincare needs and the brand has grown from strength to strength over the years, and a firm favourite among beauty editors, make up artists and clean-loving celebrities such as Gwyneth Paltrow, Miranda Kerr, Emma Watson and Kylie Minogue.
All their products are formulated and manufactured in London and made in small batches to ensure strict quality control. The result is highly effective products that are beautifully packaged and feel luxurious and indulgent to use. The Organic Pharmacy can now be found in exclusive boutiques and award-winning spas around the World, as well as right here on The Clean Beauty Edit.
Recently I was lucky enough to interview Margo for our 5Qs series, about the evolution of The Organic Pharmacy over the years, homeopathy and the best advice she has ever been given.
Goodness that was over 20 years ago!!! I was studying homeopathy and came across and article that talked about toxins in cosmetics. Back then no one cared what they used on their skin and I was shocked to find out that the skin is our biggest organ and we can absorb up to 60% of what’s put on it and in those days skin care was full of toxins, cancer causing ingredients, skin irritating synthetics. I really wanted to have a place that avoided all that and the idea of The Organic Pharmacy was born.
My ethos was always health first – if the body is fit and healthy and has the right nutrients the mind will be fit and healthy. So our first step was always the supplements and Detox which became our corner so. Then we entered the world of Spa’s and are now in 40 of the top spa’s all over the world and of course the range of skin care, make up and fragrance. Getting high quality performance driven organic formulas was always my passion and the evolution over the past 18 years is to see the clinically proven performance from our skin care but also to see health now become part of everyday life.
Homeopathy is a system of medicine without side effects that is highly effective in helping heal the body, mind and emotions. I have used it for the past 25 years and still today it surprises me the results we get. From depression, anxiety, skin complaints, hormonal, digestion- the list is endless.
I start my morning with Enzyme Peel Mask- every morning as I am now at that delicate age where more help is needed. It gives my skin a fresh dewy youthful canvas to play with. I then follow with our Hyaluronic Acid Serum (a girl needs all the plumping she can get) and then I apply Antioxidant Serum and Gel and finish with Radiant Day Shield to protect my skin from pollution. For makeup I’m very minimal so I use the Hydrating Bronzer and our highlighter, our mascara and I finish with the hyaluronic acid lip pencil (it plumps and volumizes my lips beautifully) and a slick of Volumising Lip balm in Coral. I love the fact that the make up is all natural and sustainable that was very important to me.
The best piece of advice I have been given is to always follow my intuition. The times I’ve made mistakes is when I went against that. So now I take a pause- connect to myself and really feel what my gut says.

Several tourists and out-of-towners flock to the Marcus Ashley Gallery in Lake Tahoe, a great place for novice collectors and art connoisseurs who wish to expand their collections. You’ll find that the art consultants are happy to answer queries on the gallery’s exhibits, including Michael Parkes art.
Goddess Diana has often been held in awe for her hunting skills, but it is her identity with the moon that is most significant. In Latin, her name means goddess of daylight or light of the moon. Legend has it that Diana symbolized the moon since the celestial satellite had much to do with a successful hunt. The ancient people further believed that the moon’s phases determined Diana’s transitional identity from light to darkness and then life to death.
In Butterfly Moon, Parkes reimagines the goddess against a brilliant cerulean sky dotted with fluffy clouds. She tethers the moon to her wrist as if drawing energy and light from the moon. Her porcelain skin shines just as brilliantly as the crescent before her. The air is filled with butterflies, perhaps a symbolic representation of the cycle of life and death that closely represents Diana’s identity.
This pretty fine art print will add oodles of charm to a quaint or upscale room.

In stockA former Microsoft employee has been charged with stealing digital currency from the company. The incident follows the recent conviction of another former Microsoft employee who initiated a scam centered on the company’s partnership with the NFL.
In the new case, the Associated Press reports a former employee from Ukraine has been charged by the U.S. attorney’s office. He is accused of stealing digital currency during a testing phase for Microsoft’s online sales services.
Twenty-five year old Volodymyr Kvashuk is said to have stolen the digital currency and resold it to receive $2.8 million. He intended to use the money to buy a $1.7 million home and eventually planned to steal a total of $10 million.
Microsoft discovered the situation and fired Kvashuk in June, 2018. However, the following investigation into his practices took over a year and he was arrested earlier this week (July 17). He is now awaiting trial.

The new Adriana’s Restaurant & Pizzeria at 1703 South 11th Street opened a couple of weeks ago with little fanfare.
Formerly on 2nd Street in Pennsport, this well-known, award winning shop (three-time gold medal winner at the South Philly Review’s annual Pizza Olympics), sits in a very unassuming spot — 1 door in from the corner — home of the former “Friends & Family Cafe”.
When you step inside, you’re smack dab in a tiny dining room. Its a basic, cozy space. There’s no counter, so if you’re taking out, you simply tell the server your order and wait for it. Which is what I did.
There is a Risotto special and Pizza special every day.
I was also informed by the courteous server that starting today, all day, and every Monday and Wednesday is All You Can Eat Mussels for $11.95. I’m not a fan of mussels, but for those of you who are — sounds like a sweet deal!
Since pizza is a no-no for me, I opted for a Grilled Buffalo Chicken Salad with honey mustard dressing. It was sufficient and tasty.
In addition to their award-winning pizza and yummy salads, they’ve got stromboli, calzones, steak sandwiches, burgers, hot sandwiches, chicken cutlet & eggplant sandwiches, wings, pasta, chicken, veal & eggplant, and seafood dishes too.

A Welsh think tank has called on the Welsh Government to improve the support it provides to families trapped in poverty by establishing a Welsh Benefits System.
With winter 2020 set to be one of the most difficult in decades, many more people will be relying on help provided by the Welsh Governments to survive the storm, the Bevan Foundation said.
Their report shows that the Welsh Government spends more than £400m on various grants, allowances and in-kind provision for low-income households, such as the Council Tax Reduction Scheme, provision of Free School Meals and the help through the Discretionary Assistance Fund. These schemes complement the UK social security system.
Yet despite the significant investment in these schemes, the Bevan Foundation has found some weaknesses and gaps which can mean people miss out.
Dr Steffan Evans, Policy and Research at the Bevan Foundation said that too many families are currently missing out because of arbitrary eligibility criteria and complex application processes.
“Even if they do successfully apply, sometimes the value of the scheme is not always sufficient to meet people’s needs,” he said.
For example, thousands of working families are missing out on Free School Meals despite living in poverty because they don’t satisfy the eligibility criteria, he added.
The value of the Education Maintenance Allowance on the other hand has not changed since the mid-2000s, meaning that young people from low-income families who wish to continue in education are £15 a week worse off in real terms than if the benefit had kept up with inflation.
The Bevan Foundation proposed that this plethora of schemes should be reformed and pulled together into a coherent Welsh Benefits System.
“A new Welsh Benefits System would enable the Welsh Government to provide vital support to families trapped in poverty, alongside the UK social security system,” Steffan Evans said.
“Our proposals will ensure that resources reach people on the lowest incomes as well as streamlining administration.”
‘Harm’
The Bevan Foundation say there are three main schemes to their proposals:
- Help with housing costs: a new Welsh Housing Fund and reformed Council Tax Reduction Scheme would mean more people have an affordable home.
- Help with education costs: a new School Start scheme would provide free meals and help with uniform and equipment costs for children from low-income families, while a new Learning Allowance for 16-year-olds would provide enough cash to live on and help with travel, meals and equipment.
- Help in emergencies: a new Welsh Emergency Fund would provide cash when disaster, such as flooding or bereavement, strikes.
The Bevan Foundation sets out five key features of its proposed Welsh Benefits System hey say would ensure they reach people and make a difference:
- Targeted on households on low incomes, defined as being eligible for Universal Credit.
- Cash or in-kind help that makes a real difference to households’ incomes or costs.
- Single point of access, using online, phone or postal methods.
- Based on clear criteria, not discretion.
- All applicants are treated with dignity and respect.
“Establishing a Welsh Benefits System could be a game-changer. It could help to lift thousands out of poverty, ensuring people have secure homes and enough to eat,” Steffan Evans said.
“The system could be set up quickly as it is mostly within the powers already devolved to the Welsh Parliament. It will cost more but there will be savings through simplified administration and by reducing the long-term harm caused by poverty.”Bettors encounter a couple decisions worries their very own discreetness – choose to they’re able to get all of these fun-based activities over the world-wide-web along with get those things considerations these gaming den.

Jeremy Sanders developed innovative applications of NMR spectroscopy in organic and biological chemistry, and is known for his biomimetic porphyrin systems and his theory of pi–pi interactions. His early explorations of lanthanide shift reagents and NOE difference spectroscopy enhanced the power of NMR to solve organic chemical structure and conformation.
His most notable contribution to biological chemistry through NMR was to resolve many of the long-standing paradoxes between the known in situ enzymology and the apparently contradictory physical chemistry of isolated polyhydroxybutyrate storage granules in bacteria.
Since the 1990s, he has developed the concept of dynamic combinatorial chemistry as a new approach to the discovery of new structures that are capable of binding and catalysis. Using reversible reactions to connect a variety of building blocks, it is possible to use templates to amplify successful receptors. It is also possible to use self-templating, for example through donor–acceptor and hydrophobic effects in water, to generate otherwise inaccessible catenanes and molecular knots in water.

Recall? I don’t think so.
It seems every month there is another recall proposed.Nov 3rd, 2009 by Dave ReidIntentions
What are intentions?
Intentions are potential actions that a person may take, and is expressing in written content. These are commonly seen in call center logs or customer survey comments or other consumer-generated media (CGM). The identification of intentions expressed in content has been added as a new feature to the Salience API with the release of Salience 6. At release time, the set of intentions that can be identified are buy, sell, quit, and recommend.
For example:
“I’m going to go buy the New Flotsam 5000 as soon as it’s released in stores on Wednesday.”
The consumer (“I”) is expressing an intended action (“buy”) with respect to a particular item (“Flotsam 5000”).
A full intention consists of a speaker, the type of intention and the object of their intention, but Salience will also extract intentions that only have a subset of the possible pieces. In this example:
“@AcmeProducts Buy better parts for my computer or get a new mic”
The statement is being made to
"@AcmeProducts" by an unnamed speaker, as a “buy” intention and Salience will report the "(speaker)" intends to “buy” “better parts”.
Why would I use intentions?
Lead Generation
Use the "buy" intention to identify prospects who are looking to buy what you are selling.
Decrease customer churn
Use the "quit" intention to identify customers at risk of leaving and intervene before they do.
How do I extract intentions from content and what results do I get?
Salience 6 adds a new method to the document-level API, which returns a new type of results structure. The results structure identifies each intention, whatever pieces of the intention could be identified along with the actual text of the intention. See the API Reference section below for more details.
Can I customize intentions?
The feature is also configured using a handful of new datafiles in the data directory. You can configure existing intentions as well as define new intentions. See the Data Directory Reference section below for more details.
How would I tune intentions?
The tools and approaches for tuning intentions depend on what kind of tuning is needed to achieve the desired extraction.
Case 1: It’s missing an intention
Intention recall can be increased by specifying additional verb forms and verb synonyms in the datafile intention_verbs.dat.
Recall can also be increased by lowering the threshold for matching an intention.
Case 2: It’s returning intentions that it shouldn’t
Intention precision can be improved by adding restrictions in the datafile restrictions.ptn or by increasing the threshold for matching an intention.
Case 3: I want to create a new intention type
Creating a new intention type requires additions to all three of the customizable datafiles that power intentions. First, the new intention must be defined in the datafile intentions.dat. Only new intention types defined by query can be added. Next, verb forms that are common with the new intention need to be added to intention_verbs.dat. Lastly, where necessary, filtering to improve precision on the returned intentions can be employed through additions to restrictions.ptn.
API Reference
The Intentions API method
The C API, as well as each of the integration wrappers listed below return a list of SalienceIntention objects. The exact characteristics are dependent on the development language listed in the table, but the basic information returned to describe an Intention are the same across the various supported development languages. Click the development language in the table below for full API method documentation.
Note: the configuration ID is related to another new feature introduced in Salience 6, .
The SalienceIntention result structure
The structure used to return information about a detected intention will contain the following information:
Data Directory Reference
The data directory for Salience 6 contains a new subfolder for datafiles for intentions. These datafiles can be overridden within a user directory to customize intention detection.
Path: [data/salience/intentions]
Intentions.dat
This datafile defines the intention types that can be detected, as well as instructions to Salience about how the intention is detected.
buy<tab>model(0.5) sell<tab>model(0.9)
The number for model-based intentions is a threshold with a range of 0 to 1. In order for an intention to be extracted, its score must pass the defined threshold.
Intentions can also be defined via query:
buy<tab>Lexalytics OR Salience
Note that this query-based definition would be additive to any model definitions provided previously in the file.
Intention_verbs.dat
This datafile defines verb forms and synonyms to aid in intention detection.
want<tab>buy need to have<tab>buy like to have<tab>buy for sale<tab>sell
Note that by default, Salience only identifies positive intentions, not “don’t buy”. If you specifically want to find negated intentions, use the “!” character.
Why doesn’t intention_verbs.dat contain all the verb forms for the default intentions? Not all verb forms convey an intention, past tense verb forms may convey a completed intention.
Restrictions.ptn
This datafile provides additional pattern-based support for filtering detected intentions.
buy<tab>who<tab>![~products.dat] buy<tab>who<tab>I|me|us|we buy<tab>what<tab>(NNP) sell<tab>evidence<tab>have<tab>for sale sell<tab>evidence<tab>have<tab>!for lunch buy<tab>what<tab>…list of my products...
The format for restrictions.ptn is as follows:
The who or what can be any pattern or additionally: (you), (speaker) or (empty).
(you) matches no-subject imperative sentences, like "buy this product!"
(speaker) matches no-subject non-imperative sentences, like "can't wait to get one!"
(empty) matches no object sentences, like "I would return"
Updated almost 2 years agoThis vintage leather handbag was originally released in the early '70s with the code G1581. A smaller version of the original Jackie bag, the front is decorated with a gold-toned piston closure and the shoulder strap is adjustable using a gold-toned buckle. Under the shoulder strap 'Made in Italy by Gucci' is stamped in gold, the logo is accompanied by the number 66, the identification number of the bag's artisan. Light blue and red stripes have been hand-painted onto the original design, reviving it into a one-of-a-kind item. An additional shoulder strap is included. This handbag was selected by the Creative Director and Vault archivists for its particularity, character and exceptional vintage condition, and it was reconditioned to the highest standard by in-house artisans. It has been given the number 01 | 21 and will arrive in tailor-made packaging. This rare and beautiful piece should be handled with exceptional care.
In a style that epitomizes timelessness, this bag blends the formality and sophistication of recent decades with the free and dynamic nature from the year in which it was first created. Marks and little cracks decorate the surface of the leather almost like whispers, forcing one to lean in to hear the full story.
The smooth blue leather feels almost seamless as it extends around its half-moon shape. The piston closure is its most defining feature adding an almost sparkling contrast to the deeper hue of its background.

BRASíLIA - A proposal by Brazil's far-right President Jair Bolsonaro to dramatically increase welfare payments to the country's underprivileged groups a year ahead of elections shook markets Thursday and triggered resignations at the Ministry of Economy.
The program could cost the government an extra 30 billion reais ($5.3 billion dollars) at a time when inflation is already high and exceed the government spending ceiling established by law.
The government announced earlier this week that it was setting up a new social welfare program to replace the "Bolsa Familia" system created by the leftist administration of former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
The new program would start in November with a 20 percent increase in benefits paid to nearly 17 million Brazilians in need.
Coming just a year before a presidential election in which Bolsonaro is widely expected to be defeated by Lula da Silva, the move was seen by several analysts as a pre-election sweetener.
The measure rattled investors. The Sao Paulo stock market fell 2.75 percent, while the price of the US dollar rose to 5.65 reais, its highest level in six months.
Concerned by the plan, several economic officials quit their posts, including top treasury officials Bruno Funchal and Jeferson Bittencourt, authorities said.
Bolsonaro denied that his project, whose source of funding has not been specified, is against the law.
"There are around 16 million people registered with the 'Bolsa familia', and though the financial aid reaches an average of 192 reais, many people receive 40, 50, 60 reais. What we are saying is: 400 reais for all," he said Thursday.
Bolsonaro also offered to "help" 750,000 truckers with compensation for increases in the price of diesel.
The president made the announcements at a time when his popularity is at its lowest level since he took office in 2019, and amid high inflation and high unemployment.AUTHOR: Matthias Scheutz Department of Computer Science and Engineering University of Notre Dame TITLE:Behavioral States: Linking Functional and Physical Descriptions ABSTRACT: Today's most commonly held view on the "mind-body" problem is that mental states are functional states, which somehow "supervene" on physical states. An approach to understanding mind that attempts to relate functional states directly to physical states will in my view, however, not very likely reveal any interesting results about the implementing system, since the level of functional states is too high a level of description. For the same reason it does not seem very helpful in suggesting ways to build a mind (not to mention all the problems connected with the involved notion of "implementation" or "realization" that seem to be largely ignored by the philosophical community). To be of any practical importance in designing a mind at all, a level of description has to retain at least some of the relevant physical properties. I will suggest such an intermediary level, which I call the level of behavioral states. A behavioral state is a state an individual is in if it performs a particular behavior (e.g., such as wincing or looking out for prey). Note that behavioral states are not restricted to "motor actions", but include sensory actions as well as more abstract proprioceptive and reflective actions (such as monitoring inner physiological states or generating images, producing plans, etc.). Behavioral states are organized in hierarchies in the sense of the behavioral descriptions advanced by the classical ethologists (Lorenz and Leyhausen). Within each level there are clusters of mutually exclusive behavioral states, which inhibit each other to various degrees, while entertaining excitatory connections to lower and upper level states (and possibly to some behavioral states of other clusters at the same level as well). The hierarchy reflects in part the complexity of each behavior associated with these states, the lowest level corresponding to simple reflexes (note that behavior-based robotics has explored this level of behavioral states in great detail). Behavioral states are temporally extended as timing plays a crucial role in their interplay. Some of them are directly connected to sensory or motor organs, others are indirectly connected via so-called "information channels" (i.e., filtering mechanisms that select parts of one or more sensory inputs or motor outputs), again others might only be connected to other behavioral states. At any given time, individuals are in multiple behavioral states and their state space determines the individual's behavior. Note that these states are not limited to observable behavior. The behavioral level of description is intermediary, because it specifies states that could be realized in many different physical ways (in neural architectures, but possibly also in digital ones, and others), yet retains at least one crucial physical and causal aspect not retained in functional states: time! By explicitly incorporating time and thus allowing for modeling the temporally extended interactions between different states, this level might not only prove useful for constructing systems that exhibit complex causal interactions, but also for explaining how functional states are related to physical states by viewing them as (not necessarily disjoint) collections of behavioral states. ======================================================================= SHORT CV Joint Ph.D. in Cognitive Science and Computer Science Indiana University (Bloomington, IN, USA), 1999 Ph.D., Philosophy University of Vienna (Vienna), 1995 Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Notre Dame Lecturer in the Department of Philosophy of Science and Social Studies of Science, University of Vienna Organizer of the conference and workshop NTCS'99 on "Computationalismus - The Next Generation" (see) Co-founder of the Austrian Society for Cognitive Science (see) Recent Edited Books & Jourals Scheutz, Matthias (Ed.)

Google Sites is a hosted web site tool where the creation and editing is done on-line. There is no uploading to an FTP server, at least not one that is visible to the user.
I wanted to put an Articulate Storyline presentation up but the output files are designed for upload to FTP. There is; however, a page type on Google Sites called File Cabinet. When I saw that the File Cabinet pages could be arranged hierarchically, I thought I would try using those to duplicate the file structure of the Articulate Storyline web output. I simply named the upper level page the same as ...output folder and the lower level page story_content and copied in the respective files. I then copied the address from the "view" link of the story.swf file in the output folder and used it to create a link on the page from which I wanted to run the presentation. As it turned out, it works very well.

We present the first dataset of meiofauna associated with vermetid reefs (biogenic constructions of Mediterranean intertidal habitat) in two areas along the northern coast of Sicily, Italy. The vermetid reefs are characterized by a horizontal extension from the shore towards the open sea and can be divided into three zones (the inner margin, the cuvette zone and the outer margin) which differ in hydrodynamic features. We studied the spatial distribution of meiofauna along the horizontal axis of the vermetid reefs, investigating the communities inhabiting the sediment inside cuvettes (shallow pools inside the “cuvette zone”) located between the inner and the outer margins of the reefs. We observed an increase in meiofaunal abundance from the inner to the outer part of the reef (from 1808 ± 80 to 2992 ± 512 ind. 100 cm−2) in both areas. Moreover, we studied meiofaunal communities associated with the most abundant macroalgae (Cystoseira sp., Jania rubens, Palisada perforata, Dictyota sp. and Padina pavonica) living on the reefs, investigating the influence of habitat size (biomass) and identity (complexity) of macroalgae. We found that meiofauna varied in abundance (from 446 ± 51 to 1758 ± 231 ind. 100 cm−2 on P. perforata and Cystoseira sp., respectively), on different macroalgae, and that the habitat size significantly influenced these abundances, but its effect was dependent on macroalgal identity. In fact, we observed a positive correlation between meiofaunal abundance and algal complexity (fractal dimension). The high algal cover in the “cuvette zone” of the reefs could contribute to make this zone more suitable for meiofauna, in particular close to the outer margin where we found more complex macroalgae (i.e. Cystoseira sp.). These results confirm that vermetid reefs, with their structural complexity, may play an important role in structuring benthic fauna in intertidal habitats.

We grade the latest indie rock covers
Irony-steeped indie bands have always had a taste for R&B and pop jams (Bonnie Prince Billy’s live version of R. Kelly’s ”Ignition”; Adam Green’s deadpan take on the Beach Boys’ ”Kokomo”). Lately, though, many of their ilk have been turning an entirely sincere eye to their own alt-rock peers. Below, some examples:
THE WHITE STRIPES cover TEGAN AND SARA‘s ”Walking With a Ghost.” The midtempo track from the Canadian sisters’ 2004 release, So Jealous, gets a signature Stripes-y stomp makeover?but it’s not quite remarkable enough to merit this release as a single. Original: B Cover: B+
SUN KIL MOON cover MODEST MOUSE‘s ”Ocean Breathes Salty.” On last month’s Tiny Cities (Caldo Verde), Sun Kil Moon’s Mark Kozelek transforms the propulsive 2004 single (among other, older MM songs) into a dreamy, contemplative dirge; his revamp lacks mighty Mouse power but is still hypnotically lovely on its own. Original: A- Cover: B
BRIGHT EYES cover FEIST‘s ”Mushaboom.” A concert staple for Bright Eyes’ Conor Oberst that shows up on his recent live album Motion Sickness; Oberst’s take on the blog-phenomenon cult classic is sweetly countrified, but it can’t hold a candle to the effervescent twinkle and tumble of the original (from this year’s Let It Die). Original: A Cover: B
JOSé GONZALES covers THE KNIFE‘s ”Heartbeats.” Gonzales, who released his debut, Veneer, on Hidden Agenda this past fall, turns his fellow Swedes’ driving electro-pop masterpiece (from their 2004 import-only Deep Cuts) into a winsome, hauntingly spare acoustic ballad.

A blockbuster second round clash on Saturday evening sees Sloane Stephens come up against Eugenie Bouchard at the BNP Paribas Open. Interestingly, these two ladies have followed a similar path in recent years, both burst onto the scene before falling away. Stephens and Bouchard both arrive in California with good form, especially Sloane Stephens who claimed her second title of the season at Acapulco a couple of weeks ago.
It has been a somewhat strange start to the season for Sloane Stephens. The American has already won 2 International level titles, in Auckland and Acapulco. However, Sloane did suffer a very disappointing first round loss at the Australian Open. Sloane will be hoping she can translate her generally positive form into results at the bigger events, starting this week at the premier mandatory level BNP Paribas Open. Sloane’s victory over Dominika Cibulkova in the final at Acapulco a couple of weeks ago was particularly impressive, it featured some of the best tennis Sloane has ever played and some of the greatest determination we have seen from the American on route to winning an epic final in a third set tiebreaker.
Eugenie Bouchard has also had good success at the International level this year, reaching the final in Hobart and Kuala Lumpur but was unable to claim the title on either occasion. Bouchard struggled through her opening round match at the BNP Paribas Open on Thursday evening, fighting from a set down to defeat Risa Ozaki 2-6 6-4 6-2. The Canadian was far from her best in that match, nevertheless she showed a good level of maturity to come through the match despite not being anywhere near her best.
Bouchard will need to play much better on Saturday if she is to trouble Sloane Stephens.
Sloane Stephens has the slight edge in the head-to-head series having won 2 of their 3 previous encounters. The most recent match between the pair took place in Beijing back in 2013, it was Stephens who prevailed 6-1 1-6 6-4.
Sloane seems to have the edge heading into this match, the American’s recent form has been more impressive than her Canadian opponent. Sloane’s level of tennis on route to the title in Acapulco a couple of weeks ago was very high, some of the best tennis of Sloane’s career. Whilst Bouchard was very poor in her opening match against Ozaki and will need to raise her level significantly in this match. The slower, bouncy courts in California should also favour Stephens in this match-up. Sloane should win this if she brings her recent form to the court.
Yes Bouchard! I knew you can do it! I still believe in you. Come on and win this title.
Okay…Abstract
Semiclathrate hydrates are water-based host-guest compounds formed from aqueous solutions of ionic guest substances. These materials can greatly moderate formation pressures and temperatures from canonical gas hydrates. This is a significant advantage for industrial applications such as gas separation and storage. N 2 gas is a major component contained in various flue gases and is usually mixed with CO 2. Semiclathrate hydrates can separate these gases under moderate thermodynamic conditions. Tetra-n-butylammonium bromide (TBAB) is a widely used ionic guest substance. To develop the application technologies and their theoretical models, solubility data of N 2 gas in TBAB aqueous solutions are required. In this study, we report N 2 gas solubility measured by an absolute gravimetric method for the semiclathrate hydrate formation system of TBAB + H 2O + N 2. The measurement pressures, temperatures and TBAB mass fractions were 3 MPa, 5 MPa and 7 MPa, 292.15 K, 302.15 K and 307.15 K, and 0 (pure water), 0.10, 0.20, 0.32 and 0.40, respectively. The uncertainties were 0.056 MPa, 0.44 K and 0.00012 in mole fraction. Although the technical difficulty lays on measurements of small N 2 gas solubility by the absolute gravimetric method, our data implied the unique gas dissolution property of aqueous TBAB solution depending on the TBAB concentration. The aqueous TBAB solutions with mass fractions of 0.10 and 0.20 had similar N 2 gas solubility as that in pure water. With higher mass fractions, 0.32 and 0.40, the N 2 gas solubility slightly increased from that in pure water, which implies the salting-in effect of TBAB.

Maryland Gazette (Baltimore), January 1, 1788
Every form of government known to human history has been presented—on occasion—with the possibility of revolution or, perhaps euphemistically, a drastic reform of that government’s structure. While the causes may vary for a revolution or reform, the discontent that precedes it is universal: massive parts of the citizenry feel disillusioned with the government’s ability or will to act in the citizens’ best interest. It is at that point that the defects in the government are most evident, and it is at that point that citizens decide whether those defects can and should be corrected or whether fundamental change is necessary.
Luther Martin wrote in the Maryland Gazette that states and citizens would do best to correct “such errors and defects as experience should have brought to light” as it creates “a prospect at length of obtaining as perfect a system of federal government[] as the nature of things would admit.” The alternative, according to Martin, is to consider “ourselves as master-builders, too proud to amend our original government,” and to “demolish it entirely, and to erect a new system of our own” which may, after “a short time” show itself just “as defective as the old, perhaps more so.” Then, if that new system should reveal its defects, another set of master-builders may, “instead of amending and correcting” that government’s defects, “demolish that entirely, and bring forward a third system, that also might soon be found no better than either of the former.” It is at that point that “we might always remain young in government, and always suffering the inconveniences of an incorrect, imperfect system.”
Well over 200 years later, Martin’s point remains true: there are two options when government is failing or appears to be failing: reform that government or entirely reinvent it. Caution is advised before reinventing that government. As much as the faults in the system become glaring, and as much as discontent builds, those aggrieved must ask themselves where change is needed. If the structure of the government, at its most general level, remains effective and true to its purpose, then perhaps that structure need not be changed. Instead, perhaps it is more advisable that reformers target the specific components of the structure that are creating discontent. Replacing systems in their entirety only encourages power struggles—either generation by generation or ideology by ideology—whereas correcting the errors and defects in the system, or debating those errors and defects, is more likely to lead to the changes that will satisfy the aggrieved. Over a short period of time, with wise and informed people in power, the replacement of systems may be sustainable, but in the long term, the probability increases that those less wise and less informed may rise to power and implement a system of government that runs contrary to the interests of ordinary citizens.Quicken Customer Service Number

NamasteI received this book for free in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.
Published by Disney Hyperion on October 6th 2015
Pages: 336 •Good
“Good men fall to monsters every day. Clever men are tricked by their own pride or by pretty words. That is what happened to the king in the tale she tells.”
Very rarely do I find myself reading -and finishing- a book that was completely and totally not what I was expecting. Somehow, however, A Thousand Nights slipped through my bookish radar and when I finally got my hands on a much-coveted copy at ALA, I was somehow convinced it was going to be your average, run of the mill, Disney-washed Arabian folk tale retelling that was heavy on the Aladdin motifs (not that I’m knocking Disney, as the amount of time I spend at their parks should prove). However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this book had much less in common with the overly stereotyped “Arabian Nights” theme and read much more lyrical and literary, with writing that brings a refreshingly sophisticated change of pace to the fairy tale/folk tale retelling genre.
As a religious studies major in college, the first thing that resonated with me is how the book read much more like historical fiction, calling upon seemingly realistic details to build its setting (I cannot vouch for its true authenticity, as I have not done any research into the culture/archaeology of the time and place where it is set). Family traditions and history play a huge role in the plot, as well as discussing rites of passage throughout the whole novel, an integral part of religious studies theory. Funeral rites, wedding rites, birthing rites, mourning rites, and more are not only mentioned but woven into the fabric of the tale, and I was astounded about how culturally nuanced this fantasy novel was until I discovered that the author herself is a trained archaeologist. Then things started making sense- how detailed the world is, how important rites of passage and daily rituals are to the characters, and how the storytelling felt reminiscent of a biblical or other religious story. Religious Studies scholars are often anthropologists and archaeologists of the Ancient Near East, studying the time and places and people that the religions are based upon, and I wouldn’t be surprised if E.K. Johnston has done hands on research into the culture of ancient Eastern cultures herself in preparing to write this book.
Reading the Bible and other religious texts from several worldwide traditions through an anthropological and literary lens, there are certain trends that become apparent, and one of those is that of an unnamed heroine. Female biblical figures will often go unnamed yet do great actions or suffer great tragedies that are integral to a setting in motion a larger series of events. A Thousand Nights follows this pattern of ancient storytelling, keeping every single character unnamed except Lo-Melkhiin. We never even learn the protagonist’s name, yet it does not diminish her strength as a character- rather it reinforces it as something as sacred and personal as a name is never shared with the reader, and yet we come to intimately know her thoughts all the same.
A Thousand Nights also featured strong feminist themes for me as a reader. Aside from the obvious connection of the protagonist being a strong female character who holds her own against a demon-king, there were many elements to the story and society that were matriarchal and focused on the importance of the female role in the community. Examples include only females in the protagonist’s community could perform priestly rites and interact with the dead, Lo-Melkhiin’s mother’s strong association and connection with lions, and the focus on the daily household rituals, such as food making and weaving cloth, that provided stability for the caravan community and developed important bonds between caravans. I was impressed to see a story that in its description seems so problematic (a king who has killed over 300 brides) place so much importance on the female’s role in the community and the agency the domestic and priestly rites afforded to only women.
When I tear my mind away from critically analyzing this book from a literary perspective, there were definitely some aspects that did and did not work for me. Though it was lyrical and purposeful in its execution, it could be extremely slow at some parts, with many quiet moments and personal introspection and nostalgia from the narrator. The narrator’s chapters were prefaced by an all-italicized portion that was supposedly from the “demon” in possession of Lo’Melkhiin, and in my opinion that decision gave the novel a slight feeling of telling over showing. There is also very little romance in this story, although it seems to be marketed with a romantic emphasis, which ultimately didn’t bother me much but may be a disappointment to readers expecting a love-based plot.
Overall: A Thousand Nights was not what I was expecting, but mostly in a good way. Written in a literary style that foregoes several “normal” conventions like character naming, the book focuses heavily on the female role in caravan communities and the family structure, as well as the strength of bonds between females rather than in a romantic relationship. This book can drag on, and the action sequence at the end felt rushed and crammed in, but ultimately this book was a more subtle approach to the rich world of Eastern retellings, and it’s made me crave more (Any suggestions?!)

This is a fantastic review! I have been really interested in this book for a while and I’m glad to see that it sounds like an incredibly wonderful book. Your review has revealed that this novel is indeed a bit different from what I expected it to be but I can’t wait to read it!
I’m so glad you found my review helpful! While it is slow in some places, I think it’s more sophisticated and literary than a lot of YA novels, especially retellings, so if you can be patient with it, I think it’s worth it!
Great review and absolutely spot on! I felt the same way after reading this.
Thank you, Kim! I know my review was a little lengthy but I feel that this book warrants a lot of discussion!
I was hesitant to pick this up especially after reading The Wrath and the Dawn but your review may move it up the pile. The historical and cultural connections appeal to me on every level so I hope this book comes through for me.
Did the Wrath and the Dawn underwhelm you? I added it to my TBR upon finishing this one because I was craving more books with a similar setting!
The Wrath and the Dawn blew me away! It was so so good. The setting is rich with detail and the writing is wonderful. Definitely give it a shot!
This is a fantastic review! I’m always keen to read books about other cultures and the fact that this is more of a historical fiction is really appealing to me. Adding this to my TBR now. 🙂
Hi Cilla! Thank you for the lovely comment! While I don’t know too much about how authentic the historical basis is for this novel, it does seem like the author went very in depth about the cultural traditions (whether real, fabricated, or both) and it definitely has not only a “historical fiction feel,” but also feels a bit like listening to a legend being told.
I might not be calling A THOUSAND NIGHTS a new favorite, but I can certainly attest to it being a surprise! I thought it was a thoughtful, fresh take on the story, and I definitely liked the way historical and cultural elements bled into it.
Thank you, Alexa! I agree with you about it being a new take on the story, and really on the who genre of retellings itself, focusing more on the storytelling element and giving it more of an immersive, historical fiction feel!
The reviews I’ve read for this have been pretty similar to yours, most people liked it but didn’t love it. The slow pace aside, the writing and the plot sound absolutely incredible. Definitely going to have to give this a try. Thanks for sharing and, as always, fabulous review! ♥

There are no reviews yet.By Ray Cardello for May 15, 2021. Season 1 / Post 119
At 2:30 on Thursday afternoon, the CDC announced that it was now allowable for vaccinated people to remove their masks. At noon, the wearing of masks was still required to continue the fight against the Pandemic. Both of these stances were based on science. That is simply a lie. Both were based on polls and politics.
The Biden administration was having a disastrous week. When you look at the horrendous first 100 days, to say it was a bad week is going some. The Team needed a distraction, needed a win, and what better way to assuage the public than tell them to rip off their masks. He Psaki claimed in defense of the decision that they were using science as their North Star. Apparently, the skies have been cloudy over Washington because the science is changing hourly like the wind direction in New England.
This abrupt decision had nothing to do with science. The President claims he knew of the CDC decision at 9:30 on Wednesday night, yet he wore a mask to his briefing at 12:30 on Thursday afternoon. There was no mention of any change in the mask recommendations during that briefing. Just 90 minutes later, the new guidelines were announced. Amazing. Could it have had something to do with the disappointing retail sales numbers for April announced in the interim? That would make more sense, or was the change timed to mask (excuse the word usage) the decision to resume building part of the Border Wall halted on the first day of the Biden era?
I am running out of redundant adjectives to describe the performance of the President and his Team since their clock started ticking on January 20th. I do not think I have used amazing, but that is what this finely tuned orchestral act is…absolutely amazing. They are all on the same page spewing the same talking points as if they are synchronized swimmers. They do not miss a beat, and the media is wearing the same color swimsuit. They are solid members of the Team.
The bottom line is that this is all a meaningless charade. Blue states are pushing back on the new rules. Governor Whitmer is trying to find a way to shut down all communications from outside of Michigan. Mayor DeBlasio is trying to figure out what to do with all of the leftover hamburgers. Kamala Harris thinks she looks more vice presidential in a pantsuit with a matching mask. She likes kissing her husband through a mask. These people are a mess. Our local government is meeting on May 24th to decide whether to extend the town mask mandate. Do they not watch the news or believe the CDC? The mask has become their identity, and they cannot simply give them up.
I would love to burn my mask collection today, but with less than 50% of the population vaccinated, the mandate will be back. Not because the science says so, but as a requirement for the rest of the country to get the shots. This whole campaign has become a poll-driven fiasco, and with each lame decision, the credibility of the Biden team continues to erode.

Mental Health Front and Centre
AMA (ACT) President, Prof Steve Robson and ACT Chair of the Royal Australia and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists, A/Prof Jeff Looi, have met with Mental Health Minister, Shane Rattenbury, to lay out their shared concerns about the state of the psychiatry workforce and other mental health issues in the ACT.
The meeting was both cordial and constructive, with the Minister listening carefully to the issues raised and demonstrating a willingness to engage. While mental health is a new portfolio brought into existence after the last ACT election at the initiative of the ACT Greens, several other Australian jurisdictions have established specific mental health portfolio responsibilities.
Psychiatric Workforce
The major issue raised with the Minister was both the immediate and medium term future of the psychiatric workforce in the ACT.
AMA (ACT) believes there are ongoing and serious difficulties in the ACT’s public sector psychiatric workforce. The situation is currently being held together by the use of locums and the considerable goodwill and dedication of local consultants and psychiatric trainees, together with mental health service management.
Away from the immediate crisis, the use of ‘Area of Need’ appointments and locums continues to be the primary means of dealing with the shorter and medium term issues in public sector psychiatric staff recruitment – a situation AMA (ACT) would like to see rectified.
The private sector workforce, while not in a similar short-term crisis, is still deficient in consultant psychiatrists and particularly so when it comes to the child and adolescent subspecialty. As discussed with the Minister, the lack of local private sector workforce is puzzling given the many attractive features working in Canberra provides to medical practitioners.
Workforce Plan Needed
While there seems to be little alternative to the public sector’s use of Area of Need appointments and locums in the short term, AMA (ACT) believes it should be an urgent priority to draft a comprehensive workforce plan for the combined ACT public and private sector psychiatric workforce, both specialist and trainee. The workforce plan should emphasise recruitment and retention and specifically consider safety, working conditions and incentives to work and remain in the ACT.
It would make sense, given similar work previously undertaken by the RANZCP for the Victorian Government, if the College was involved in the ACT workforce plan, at least in relation to the public sector workforce.
Mental Health Advisory Council
AMA (ACT) and the RANZCP both expressed concern over the lack of either a psychiatrist or GP on the Council. The Minister responded by stating that he recognized the need for suitable input to the Council from medical practitioners.
Further discussions with the Minister are to be held in order to determine how it is – whether through co-opting or other means – input from medical practitioners can be made available to the Council.
Office of Mental Health
The Minister has recently released a ‘conversation starter’ that seeks the views of stakeholders on the role and function of the new Office of Mental Health. The ‘conversation starter’ is designed to seek the views of stakeholders on the role and function of the new Officer of Mental Health.
All in all, a constructive meeting with Minister Rattenbury. Now the hard work starts.by

The first flights between Orlando and Honolulu onboard a Hawaiian Airlines aircraft launched on Saturday, March 13th. While this inaugural was met with plenty of fanfare and celebration, the airline announced it was not all for show. High customer demand is leading the airline to increase Orlando to Honolulu service to three times per week this summer.
Hawaiian Airlines inaugurates first flights from Orlando to Honolulu
On Saturday, March 13th, Hawaiian Airlines inaugurated a brand new long-haul domestic route from Orlando International Airport (MCO) to Honolulu International Airport (HNL). The airport was abuzz, and Hawaiian celebrated in Orlando to commemorate the first flights.
Peter Ingram, CEO of Hawaiian Airlines, shared the following statement on the new route launch:
“We are excited to introduce our Florida guests to our award-winning Hawaiian hospitality so they may start their island vacation the moment they step onboard. We are just as pleased to offer Hawai‘i travelers the unmatched convenience of our nonstop service from Honolulu to Orlando, a popular destination for our kama‘āina (residents).”
The new flights from Orlando to Honolulu depart on Tuesdays and Saturdays at 08:15 and arrive at 14:05 in Hawaii; all times are local. From there, passengers can connect onwards on a Hawaiian Airlines intra-island service or otherwise terminate their Honolulu journey. This flight is numbered HA85.
HA86, which operates from Honolulu to Orlando, departs on Thursdays and Sundays at 17:15 local time and arrives in Orlando at 07:00 the next day, local time.
Hawaiian uses an Airbus A330-200 on this route. This aircraft is configured with 18 lie-flat first class seats in a 2-2-2 configuration. Behind this cabin, there are 68 extra-legroom economy seats, followed by 192 standard economy seats. This is a total of 260 seats in a 2-4-2 configuration, which is ideal for families and leisure travelers.
Hawaiian is growing services on this route
The current twice-weekly operation will grow later this year. Starting from June 1st and running through August 10th, the airline will operate between Orlando and Honolulu three times per week. The airline responded that it was doing so after seeing large customer demand for the flights.
This summer, the added flights will depart Orlando for Honolulu on Thursdays and depart Honolulu for Orlando on Tuesdays.
Florida and Hawaii are two highly sought-after tourist destinations. Especially during the pandemic, with most passengers choosing to stay domestic, Hawaii is a fantastic outdoor destination with beaches, resorts, and outdoor excursions, depending on which island passengers choose to visit. For Hawaiians, the new flight allows them to visit Orlando’s theme parks and resorts nonstop.
Hawaiians Orlando to Honolulu flights also allows the carrier to indirectly serve the Tampa-area, which is within driving distance from Orlando, without having to operate two nonstop flights to Hawaii. The large metro area around Orlando and Tampa combined have a population of over five million people, which means a fairly large origination market out of Florida for Hawaiian.
For the next few months, the airline has temporarily suspended services to Australia, New Zealand, American Samoa, and Tahiti. With most of those flights operating on Airbus A330s, the airline now has plenty of spare aircraft. Instead of letting them sit on the ground, the airline is using them to connect new destinations, including Austin in Texas and, of course, Orlando, Florida. Should these flights perform well, then the airline is likely to keep them in the long-run, and Orlando seems to be doing quite well for now.
Hawaiian’s long-haul domestic routes
This is the only nonstop service between Orlando and Hawaii and is one of Hawaiian’s longer domestic routes. However, it is not the longest in Hawaiian’s system.
The airline also operates long-haul routes to New York (JFK) and Boston (BOS), with flights to Boston being the longest regularly scheduled nonstop domestic route. This makes Orlando the airline’s third gateway from the East Coast of the US.What is Progressive National politics? The definition of progressivism as well as the ideology of progressive politics are not the same. While progressives believe in modernisation and also positive government, they additionally count on the power of government to increase freedom to much less preferred regions. (see also la progressive, laprogressive, progressive site)They additionally oppose conventional traditionalists’ idea in minimal federal government. However this does not mean that progressives must be castaways or ostracised. If you’re a political researcher, you can see why this divide exists. Progressives see their political movement as a counterweight to organized producer and consumer groups and also supporter for social justice. They likewise rely on systemic adjustment and also supporter for government reform. In addition, they intend to revive the shattered depend on of the American public in government. (see also la progressive, laprogressive, progressive site) Therefore, they need to interact to produce a solid and stable government. To be more specific, modern politics can be split right into two components: the economic and also the cultural one. The principle of progressivism is also thought about as a form of socialist or national populism. The term describes the plans that profited individuals of a country. Historically, progressives are viewed as being in favour of the interests of a country, and also the social well-being system should be improved. (see also la progressive, laprogressive, progressive site) This is why the progressives can be separated into two teams. If you want to end up being a part of modern politics, you should collaborate with a political event that will certainly put social modernisation at the heart of their agenda. A dynamic politician can easily obtain involved with a progressive group. By doing this, he or she can be a true champion of the well-being of individuals. On top of that, you can likewise come to be a participant of the company. This is a great chance for you to end up being a leader in dynamic national politics and to make a difference. (see also la progressive, laprogressive, progressive site) Simply take a min to consider this. So, if you are taking into consideration an occupation modification, it is important to discover an organization that shares your beliefs and worths. Advocates of progressive national politics think that autonomous concepts are vital to a culture’s success. Nevertheless, they likewise believe that freedom can’t function without a strong federal government. This is why they are usually referred to as ‘dynamic’. They are unable to win a general election. This results from their failure to produce a combined platform. An individual’s political celebration can not win elections unless it has a progressive viewpoint. In their quest to reform the political system, progressives have succeeded in changing it for the better. (see also la progressive, laprogressive, progressive site) They believe that social condition is a result of negative morals or absence of responsibility. This has led to the increase of the “modern” label. The term also consists of the ‘dynamic’ event. A progressive political leader is one that is willing to rock the boat. Along with reforming the political system, progressives additionally advertise the setting. (see also la progressive, laprogressive, progressive site)

This site under the main topic “2016 Bella college reunion” says Oct 21, 22, 23 are the dates of the reunion, but then says the main date of Oct 15 is secured for festivities. I assume that should say 22 instead of 15.
That is Belknap College Reunion not Bella.

Doesn't happen anywhere else. Arthur's musical taste is typically eclectic for a 21st Century Boy - songs he's picked up from Rock Band, FIFA 10, Pixar, Children In Need and the playground. He has no tribal allegiances yet. It's just music he likes, that we can sing, that feels good. 80s rock. Chumbawumba. Michael Jackson. Art Garfunkel. And - thanks to the good offices of his mother who took him to the stage production - the soundtrack to Oliver. I've never seen him so excited as when he came back from that and he immediately pronounced his intention to become an actor. (So I took him along one day to a stage school open day. We left after one glance round the door. He's clearly inherited our shyness genes.)
Consider Yourself is the peak moment of a perfect musical. Lovely sentiment. Belting tune. Best Internal Rhyme Ever in a lyric:
"Nobody tries to be lah-di-dah or uppity--
There a cuppa-tea for all"
If we didn't already have a company motto (Lorem Ipsum) I'd use that. Maybe we should have it engraved over the door as a mission statement.Who’s at risk?Mould’s dangers tend to strike at the weakest amongst us - children and the elderly. The good news is that most healthy adults don’t have much to worry about. However, those with asthma, allergies, compromised immune systems or chronic lung disease may get very sick indeed. Even if you don’t have much to worry about health wise, mould is smelly, unsightly and destructive to your home.
What should you do about mould?Your first impulse might be to reach for the bleach bottle, but cleaning mould naturally is actually more effective, as well as better for the environment. Bleach can kill mould on hard surfaces such as glass and tile, but it doesn’t work on wood and plaster. And forget about carpet and upholstery. Furthermore, bleach is corrosive and can be damaging to your skin, eyes and lungs.
How to get rid of mould naturally?Cleaning mould naturally consists of a two pronged approach - preventing mould from forming and getting rid of the mould spores that are already there. Here's how to get rid of mould.
Use a HEPA filter vacuumA vacuum cleaner with a HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filter can work wonders when it comes up cleaning up your home, including getting rid of mould. I like my Dyson. It has a variety of tools that make it easy to clean under and behind furniture - all the dark corners where mould spores like to congregate. Best of all, the filtration system makes sure the dirt it sucks up stays in the vacuum and doesn’t get blown back out into your house.
Wash the mould awayThe best way of cleaning mould naturally is to eliminate the dirt and grime that provide the nutrients for it to grow on. A simple wash will do just fine. You can use Dr Bronner’s liquid soap or dishwashing soap. Either will work. Make a solution of hot soapy water and wash the mouldy area down. It’s a good idea to use a microfibre cloth that will trap the mould particles instead of just smearing them around. Rinse the cloth regularly in another bucket of water and you’ll soon get rid of all the gunk.
Use a pre-made mould solutionYou can use a pre-made spray like the Abode Mould Control Spray or the Vrindavan Natural Mould Solution Surface Spray, both of which are natural anti-fungal and antiseptics that removes mould and kills the spores as well. They're safe to use on hard surfaces, wood, carpet and clothing. Just spray, leave on for up to 24 hours in tough cases and wipe clean with a cloth.
Clean mould with essential oilsEssential oils have natural anti-bacterial, anti-viral and anti-fungal properties that make them an excellent choice for cleaning mould naturally. Making your own anti-mould spray is easy. Just pour a few ounces of vodka (the cheaper the better) into a spray bottle, add your essential oils and then top up with water. You need the vodka to help disperse the oils – it won’t work properly otherwise. Shake vigorously before each use. Spray on, let sit and wipe off. I like these essential oils for their antifungal action:
- Tea tree oil, such as:
- Eucalyptus oil, such as:
- Clove oil
- Cinnamon oil
- Thyme oil
Prevent mould from occurring in the first placeMould thrives in warm, humid environments. Keep it dry and mould won’t be able to get a foothold.
- Use an extractor fan in bathrooms and kitchens.
- Open up your windows at least once a day. (I’ve written about the benefits of ventilation in this blog post.)
- Use a dehumidifier to remove moisture from the air.Live Blog of the 2020 Memorial Tournament: Follow Tiger Woods’ first PGA Tour round since February:
Great way to end the round for the Tigers. Find the fairway from T and then hit the green right with a sweet 9-iron that holds somewhere within 15 feet. He will have it for the closing birdie.
And … he poured it! Wow, it seemed so big. Of course, it’s just a shot different, but there’s a kind of emotional victory to finish the first round instead of finishing it. This is Tiger Woods’ 1-under 71. Stay tuned to GLF.com for more on the first day we rolled up coverage at Memorial!
Time for a rebound? Almost. After looking for a fairway bunker with 3-wood from T, the Tiger shows a perfect look but it gets stuck on the top leaf, leaving a sensitive two-put instead of a good look for birdies.PGA Memorial Tournament
After tracking his first putt about four feet from the hole, he came back dra when he closed this thing – even though it seemed like it would be the satisfying outcome of the day PGA Memorial Tournament.
Well if you believe in speed, it really stands out to this team. After a long wait at T, Tiger’s T shot found the left bunker and from there he hacked the green top on the other side of the pin. An up-down from there leaves him with a load – and goes flat again.
We saw Woods play on the tour for the first time since Ruari, and his return is a great place for him for one reason: he has won five memoirs. He will play alongside the top two in the first two rounds of Rory McLaughlin and Brooks Koepker. They are leaving 1: 1 at ET Thursday.
Although there will be no shortage of star power outside of characteristic grouping. The memorial always attracts one of the strongest fields in every season but this year the field is even stronger than usual. No. 1 in the world. Recent winners such as number one Bryson Dichambao and world number four Dustin Johnson will also reject the title. let’ go read more.Orchids are a family of monocotyledonous plants, which are distinguished by the complexity of their flowers.
The leaves are born from the rhizome or aerial stems, which are simple and with an entire margin, dark green in color. The flowers in most species grow in an elongated, erect raceme.
Orchids are one of the most appreciated decorative flowers for their , especially for their striking colors.
At the same time, they are a very delicate plant that requires specific care to stay healthy.

How to rebloom orchids?
But, don’t worry, here are some tricks that will help you make your Orchid bloom again.
Illumination
Although each type of orchid has specific lighting needs, the truth is that this element is key to flowering.
The truth is that if the plant does not receive a good number of hours of indirect light, the orchid will not bloom.
For this reason, you should place your Orchid in a place where the plant receives a good amount of lighting but not direct sun.
An indication that your Orchids are receiving an adequate amount of sun is that if the leaves are dark green, it implies that there is not enough light, while if the leaves are medium to light green, they are receiving enough light.
Now, if the leaves are yellowish, there is an excess in sunlight.
Adequate humidity
Due to its humid tropical climates’ origin, orchids require an environmental humidity of between 60 and 80%.
During the winter or if you live in an area with high humidity, avoid watering excessively, but if you live in a dry place or have very high heating in your house, you should water more frequently, but not more than once a week.
The best way to know if it’s time to water is to take a look at the substrate and see if it is wet; if so, avoid watering your plant once it dries, water again.
Fertilizers
Orchids need a good fertilizer to help them bloom; just remember that it must be a specific fertilizer for these types of plants.
The fertilizer you choose should have nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and iron.
You should fertilize between March and November, resting the rest of the year.
You can also fertilize when you notice a flower spike emerge.
Keep in mind not to overfertilize your plant since this will only cause the plant to burn.
Follow the recommendations that come on the fertilizer package.
Patience
Orchids have a resting time, which is normal for plants, so you must be patient to see your plant bloom again.
For example, Phalaenopsis orchids take one to several months to rebloom.
While the Cymbidium bloom annually.
You need to know your Orchid’s stage to provide the proper care they need, and this will help you understand more about their bloom.
Orchids have four stages:
1. Leaf Growth
2. Flowering
3. Root Growth
4. Dormancy
For example, during the period of inactivity or dormancy, it is best to stop fertilizing our plant and reduce watering.
While the orchid is still functioning during the root and leaf growth period, you need to provide it with good moisture and add a good fertilizer.
Bad genes
When the plant does not have good health, no matter how much care you give your plant, it will never flower.
So it is better to buy a specimen that already has flowers because this way, you make sure that the plant has the ability to flower.
Pruning
This tip is more specific to the Phalaenopsis orchid species (although you can apply it to other species); cut the flower stem at the node just below the last flower.
Alternatively, cut the stem from the crown of the plant; this will give the plant more time to rejuvenate.
It is also good that you maintain your plant’s health by removing leaves that are wilted or that have been attacked by some disease or plague.
All this will help the plant to be in the most optimal conditions to flourish.Stefan's Head Overview

こんにちは。
今日は絵本に関するお知らせです。
シビアな状況ながら、沢山の面白くて可笑しい動物や人物が次々に現れ、前半はワクワクする内容です。悲しいお話では有りますが、ソーンダースさんが自身との闘いの中から本当に大変な状況に置かれた時に、どのような心を持って乗り切っていったら？とそっと道を示してくれるような、多くのプレゼントが詰まっている本でも有ります。
Hi there, I’d like to make an announcement.Today I would like to make an announcement about a picture book.The people at Society of Torch , who translated and published the novel Anything But a Dog (Elizabeth and her miracle dog Riley) into Japanese, asked me if I would be interested in doing a picture book to make it more accessible to people in hospitals, libraries and schools. This time I decided to be in charge of the illustrations.The novel is based on a true story, written by Lisa Saunders, who had a child born with birth defects caused by a mother-to-child infection with cytomegalovirus.
The first half of the book is exciting, with lots of interesting and funny animals and characters, despite the grim circumstances. The first half of the book is exciting, and the second half is sad, but Saunders’ struggle with herself shows us what kind of heart to have when you are in a really tough situation. It’s a book full of gifts that will gently show you the way.
The picture book has a different approach from the original novel, and we aim to create a picture book that will remain in people’s hearts for a long time. We hope that many people will pick up the book and learn about the disease and how to prevent it from spreading, so that fewer mothers and children will suffer the same sadness, and so that we can become a kind society where everyone can help each other. This is the wish of the team.
We are looking for supporters for this project and are holding a crowdfunding campaign until 25th April. We have some great deals that are much cheaper than buying the book after it goes on sale, so please have a look. Thank you very much for your support!

PS: Thank you for your support, the book has been successfully published. We are now working on the pictures for publication in the autumn. We’ll let you know when it’s ready. Thank you very much for your support.
It’s no secret that the entertainment industry has borne the brunt of the COVID-19 pandemic as closed live spaces from cinemas, concert venues, and theaters, meant that thousands of live event workers went out of work. And despite the gradual easing of restrictions, the industry has yet to recover from one of the longest lockdowns in the world.
Ortigas Malls, understanding the plight of entertainment workers, launched a holiday campaign and a fundraising concert to help get the industry back on its feet. Titled Christmas with the Stars, the online fundraising concert will see performances from the country’s brightest stars featuring the Kilabotitos–Ogie Alcasid and Ian Veneracion—Gary Valenciano, Regine Velasquez-Alcasid, Martin Nievera, Jose Mari Chan, Maestro Ryan Cayabyab, and many more on December 11, 7 p.m.
Funds raised for the concert and accompanying programs will be in support of the Independent Production Workers Group (IPWG), an organization that seeks to professionalize the production industry in the country and represents thousands of live events workers nationwide.
The concert is in partnership with Alcasid Total Entertainment and Artist Management (ATEAM).
“These workers have been the backbone of every single live production and seeing the industry has been so badly affected makes us feel we need to help. We are thankful for Ortigas Malls for this opportunity,” said Ogie Alcasid, Founder/President of ATEAM and OPM President.
Those who want to attend the concert can donate a set amount on the Christmas with the Stars ktx.ph page to gain a ticket to the concert. Select mall-goers can also score a free ticket for a P1,000 minimum purchase (single or accumulated) at Ortigas Malls from Nov. 4-Dec. 10. They just need to log on to and upload their receipts.
“Thousands of live event workers are still grappling with the effects of the lockdowns on their incomes which remain a fraction of what it used to be. Fundraising concerts like these help workers not only through monetary benefits but also impart hope that everything will get better soon,” said Aio Hernandez, President of IPWG.
Beyond the fundraising concert, Ortigas Malls will also be holding a series of online mini concerts titled KUMUnity Nights on Nov. 20, 27, and Dec. 24 as a lead up to the main concert where viewers can watch performances with an option to support the cause online. The concerts will be streamed live on the KUMU app with recorded replays on the Ortigas Malls’ Facebook pages (Greenhills, Tiendesitas, Estancia, and Industria).
“Christmas is the season of giving and we hope that our patrons and fans can join us for several nights of good music and company all while supporting a good cause,” Arch. Bacani added.
Mall visitors can also shop freely and safely while enjoying great holiday tunes with the Community Live Sessions starting Dec. 6 in Greenhills, Tiendesitas, and Estancia. They can also support the cause onsite via donation boxes located at the live session locations and at the Greenhills Night Market.RESEARCH INTERESTS

Ask A QuestionRetail investors have taken notice of Bitcoin and are starting to make it a part of their investment plans. As Dan Calugar explains, there is good reason for this, too, as the potential gains from Bitcoin are immense.
While Bitcoin garners much of the attention in the cryptocurrency world, it’s not the only player in the market. Many other digital coins operate similarly to Bitcoin that makes for solid investment choices, too.
Today, new investors have a wide choice in cryptocurrency, with alternatives and competitors springing up all the time. Here are some of the most popular Bitcoin alternatives.
1. Ether
Ether is the most popular cryptocurrency next to Bitcoin. Still, it accounts for only one-10th of the market share that Bitcoin does.
Ether is the digital currency that’s used in the network known as Ethereum. It hosts digital media and game distributors, financial services, and other applications.
A primary advantage of Ether is there’s no intermediary necessary to verify transactions. Each transaction is done independently, with agreements put right into the code regarding whether it’s in line with terms and conditions. It also has “smart contract” technology that provides other financial transactions, and the speed of transactions is much faster than Bitcoin.
The main drawback is Ether coins aren’t accepted in as many places as Bitcoin is. Ether also doesn’t have a pre-defined end in sight to where it won’t expand anymore. This means as an investment; there may never be what’s known as a “scarcity effect.”
2. Tether
Tether can call itself the most popular of all the stable coins today. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, it’s tied to a reserve, which helps them hold a steady value. That reserve could be gold or currency. It’s connected to euros, dollars, and even the Chinese Yen.
This stability is the main advantage of Tether, but it’s also part of its disadvantage. If you’re looking to invest in a stable digital coin, this is it. If you’re looking for the potential for substantial investment returns, then Tether may not be the best fit.
Many people prefer Tether because of its quick transactions and digital form. Others are wary of it, as it underwent a financial audit by a certified accountant in the last few years to prove it had enough in reserves. While this helps its stability, it also flies in the face of the privacy that cryptocurrency stands on.
3. Monero
All digital coins pride themselves on privacy, but Monero is perhaps the leader in this field. Unique technology that the company uses keeps the amount of all transactions and the receiver and sender completely hidden. If you’re looking for ultra-privacy, then, Monero may be the one you’re looking for.
A disadvantage of Monero is that it requires powerful hardware to process it because of all that privacy. It’s also used for many purposes that aren’t above water because of this anonymity. Because of this, it’s also not accepted in as many places as other cryptocurrencies.
4. Litecoin
Litecoin was created by a developer who once worked at Google. It’s been around since 2011, giving it similar longevity to Bitcoin and, as a result, a lot of legitimacy. In its existence, it has consistently remained one of the most valuable digital coins available.
Because of its high market cap, Litecoin is valuable as an investment. It isn’t as volatile as some smaller coins because no single investor could sink it overnight.
At the same time, Dan Calugar points out that Litecoin has been on the downturn for a while now. In just the last four years, it has gone from the fifth most valuable cryptocurrency to the 10th. As such, its future value is certainly in question.

Head outside for your workout and enjoy the fall weather while it lasts.
1. Ride Your Bike
What better way to take in the fall scenery than a leisurely bike ride? Biking is a great way to build lower body strength, including your quadriceps, hamstrings and buttocks. And, it may also improve your mood. According to a 2008 study in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, biking for just 20 minutes may help to lower anxiety and increase overall well-being.
A 130lb woman could burn 236 calories during an hour-long leisurely bike ride; a 155lb woman could burn 281 calories.
2. Play Touch Football
Round up the family or a group of friends and turn your workout into a bonding experience. An hour of touch football could burn as many as 472 calories for a 130-lb woman, and 563 calories for a 155-lb woman.
3. Go Horseback Riding
Horseback riding is perhaps the perfect fall activity. It’s a light workout where you’ll get to enjoy the benefits of being outdoors before winter hits. Riding will help strengthen your leg muscles, and an hour of this sport will burn 384 calories in a 130-lb woman, and 457 calories in a 155-lb woman.
4. Play in the Leaves
Before you jump in the leaves, you’re going to have to rake your lawn, first. Raking leaves can be a heart-pumping activity, which means you’re getting many of the same benefits you would with a traditional aerobic workout. Your shoulders will feel the burn after an hour of raking, especially since you’re working muscles you wouldn’t normally use.
A 130lb woman could burn up to 254 calories in an hour of raking.
5. Go For A Run
Running outdoors is a great way to shed extra pounds. Plus, the cooler fall temperatures make it a lot more comfortable to run. Discover new trails and parks and take in the colourful scenery as the leaves begin to change. Running also improves heart health by boosting HDL (good) cholesterol and lowering blood pressure.
An hour-long run will burn about 472 calories in a 130lb woman; a 155lb woman could burn 563 calories.Video
Pharma companies in Europe face an increasing demand to prove the value of their medicines. From the proliferation of data to the declining importance of sales reps, shifts in the industry are forcing drug makers to change their approach to sales. Michael Kunst, who leads Bain's Healthcare practice in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, shares three important considerations for pharma companies rethinking their operating model.
Read the Bain Report: Front Line of Healthcare Report 2016
Read the transcript below.
MICHAEL KUNST: The pressure to lower cost and improve patient outcomes has led European healthcare providers to really take a more systematic approach when it comes to prescribing drugs. We see that procurement officers' influence grows. Yet, European physicians still remain relatively independent as compared to their US counterparts when it comes to selecting drugs.
Those are some of the findings of Bain's 2016 European Front Line of Healthcare Report, where we surveyed over 1,200 physicians across four countries and eight specialties. What that means for pharma companies is that there's an increasing demand to really prove the value of their medicines. They have to focus on patient-generated data as well as real-world data.
Another important finding is that we see that the role of the traditional sales rep is really decreasing. Only 43% of physicians named a sales rep [as] a top-three source of information, and that number's down about 10% from only two years ago. Physicians really look for more unbiased sources of information, and pharma companies have to adapt to that.
We also see that category leaders, those companies who really dominate a category or therapeutic area, enjoy higher levels of physician trust as well as advocacy. So, to conclude, this means three things for pharma companies as they think about their operating model. They really have to focus more on generating real-world data, they have to focus on providing unbiased medical information through different sources, and really develop new channels of information and interaction with physicians and other stakeholders.

It is the principal line of guard our homes have against the components yet its something we frequently neglect when we think about the fixes on our homes. With regards to fixing or supplanting rooftops you ought to never attempt to do it without anyone’s help except if you truly know precisely what you are doing.

Request to see the portfolios or a rundown of refs that are happy to give a reference about the roofers you plan to utilize. Most organizations that offer this administration will have the option to give you references that are applicable to the zone of work you require.

You don’t get captured out by both of these incident as it tends to be an awful shock to find that in the event that you don’t pay the additional you don’t complete the work. Most roofers are exceptionally reasonable with respect to the statements they give and will set everything out in a clear and justifiable way. The more transparent a statement is the more possibility there is that it will stay exact when it comes time to pay.
Learned.
Let’s face it, in the event that you realized how to fit another rooftop you would most likely do it without anyone’s help and the explanation individuals utilize proficient roofers is on the grounds that they know precisely what they are doing. Proficient roofers are likewise mindful of the most recent procedures and materials that can be utilized and the most recent guidelines that must be clung to.

[…]Personalised treatment for childhood cancers in Australia is a step closer thanks to the Zero Childhood Cancer program’s national clinical trial launched today.
ACRF is one of the founding funders of the Zero Childhood Cancer Project, a $1.5 million grant was awarded to the project in 2014.
The trial will see scientists from thirteen.
The Zero Childhood Cancer program recognises that each child’s cancer is unique, so they respond differently to anti-cancer treatment. Detailed laboratory analysis of tumour samples will help identify the drugs most likely to kill each child’s specific cancer.
Pilot study paves way for national launch.
What’s next? Tracey O’Brien, Director of the Kids Cancer Centre at Sydney Children’s Hospital, Randwick, said targeted therapies such as those identified through Zero Childhood Cancer will allow a much more sophisticated approach.
“The information we gather will benefit children on the program first and foremost but will also be incorporated into future front-line treatments. The knowledge gained is likely to unlock further scientific discoveries that will also ultimately benefit future patients. Most of all, it will bring us a step closer to our vision of one day curing all children of cancer.”
The Zero Childhood Cancer initiative will be led by Children’s Cancer Institute and The Kids Cancer Centre at Sydney Children’s Hospital Randwick, part of The Sydney Children’s Hospitals Network. Participating hospitals and research centres in this collaborative national project include a number of previous ACRF grant recipients:

Protecting Clients from the Devastating Consequences of a Federal Crime Conviction
Bank fraud is a serious charge and one that requires immediate attention. In Tennessee, bank fraud may be prosecuted on the state level, but is most often considered a federal offense. This is because banks are usually protected under a government program called Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).
If you are convicted of federal bank fraud, you could suffer severe penalties. Bank fraud cases can be extremely complex and require assistance from an experienced bank fraud lawyer. For award-winning criminal defense in Chattanooga, call Best & Brock, PLLC.
Dial (423) 829-1043 now or contact us online to schedule your free consultation with one of our criminal lawyers in Chattanooga.
Federal Defense
A felony conviction could wreak havoc on your life. If convicted, you might need to spend time away from your family in federal prison and may have to pay back any money that was allegedly taken.
Once you serve your sentence, you might find it hard to find employment and it will be difficult to obtain a loan and get into school. These issues can significantly impact the rest of your life, which is why you need a Chattanooga bank fraud lawyer to help you avoid or reduce these types of charges.
Federal Bank Fraud Charges
Fraud is intentional misrepresentation or deception with the intent to benefit. Bank fraud charges may be filed against you if you are suspected of defrauding or attempting to defraud a bank or financial institution.
Fraud is generally committed in secrecy as opposed to bank robbery, where the crime is immediately known. Fraud is a criminal act that is an attempt to obtain money from a bank or other financial institution through deception.
Bank fraud may also occur when someone fraudulently claims to be a bank to obtain personal information and for financial gain. Bank fraud is a type of white-collar crime which is considered non-violent. Although no violence or threat of violence was used in the commission of the act, bank fraud is still one of the most serious crimes with which you can be charged.
Types of Bank Fraud
There are a number of different crimes that fall under the general category of federal bank fraud. Some of these include:
- Check forgery: When someone fraudulently signs his someone else’s name to a check or writes a check that is not his own. Altering the amount of a check is also considered a form of forgery. For example, adding extra zeros to the end of a check to make it larger than intended is an act of forgery, even if the check is made out to you. Using stolen checks is another example of bank fraud. Someone may steal a check through a person’s mailbox and then open a bank account under the person’s name to make a deposit. A check fraud lawyer can help you in defending against these types of charges.
- Mortgage fraud: Obtaining a mortgage under false pretenses is a crime. For instance, it is considered a crime to take out a mortgage knowing that you are immediately going to file bankruptcy.
- Falsifying information on loan application: If you provide false information on a loan application, it is a crime. An example is when someone provides the incorrect income on an application in order to gain financially.
- Falsifying tax returns: Tax return falsification includes knowingly providing incorrect income or deduction information to reduce the amount of money owed or to obtain a larger refund.
- Loan fraud: Taking out a loan in someone else’s name is a crime. You cannot legally obtain a loan in someone else’s name, or it is considered identity theft.
- Bank impersonation: It is against the law to impersonate a bank or other institution in order to defraud others out of their money. For example, creating a fake company or utilizing an unauthorized website might be considered bank fraud.
- Internet fraud: The Internet may be used in order to swindle people out of money. For instance, someone may create a fake website or send false emails to people in order to obtain their personal banking information which is used to steal money.
These types of charges are often made in conjunction with other charges. For example, credit card fraud or mail fraud might be other charges that occur as a result of one possible crime. While these charges may sometimes be prosecuted at the state level, when they occur with federal crimes, they will be charged federally.
Let one of the bank fraud lawyers at Best & Brock, PLLC in Tennessee review your situation and help you determine how to proceed.
Penalties for Federal Bank Fraud Charges
Federal bank fraud charges are typically classified as felonies, although in some limited situations they might be misdemeanors. Misdemeanor charges of bank fraud carry less severe sentences than felony offenses. Usually, penalties for felony bank fraud include various components such as jail time, fines, restitution, and probation.
Jail Sentence
How much jail time does a bank fraud conviction impose? If convicted, your conviction may include a prison sentence that you must serve in a federal facility. Jail time can vary greatly depending on the crime that was committed.
Prison sentences generally range from 6 months to 20 years (with 30 years as the maximum), but may be outside of this variance. Many things are taken into consideration when imposing a prison sentence. In addition to the type of crime, the amount of money obtained and the exact criminal offense perpetrated are also considered.
Fines
Fines for federal crime convictions can be high. Fines are generally based on the type of crime committed and may range from hundreds of dollars to as much as a quarter million dollars or more.
It is important to keep in mind that a fine will be imposed for each fraud conviction. Therefore, if you have been convicted on several counts of bank fraud, you will face fines for each of them.
Restitution
The federal court may order restitution as part of the sentence in a bank fraud conviction. Restitution is money that must be paid back to the victim as a result of the crime. It is money repaid to compensate the victim for the losses incurred. Restitution is often made one of the conditions of probation.
Probation
Probation may be granted in lieu of serving prison time in some cases. Probation may last any length of time but is often one or two years in length.
During the probationary period, the guilty party must report to a probation officer on a regular basis and must stay out of trouble. If any additional crimes are committed, or if the person fails to follow the rules, probation may be revoked.
Probation may include a variety of terms. Some of the most common conditions of probation include:
- Not doing drugs
- Submitting reports
- Keeping away from convicted felons
- Reporting to a probation officer
Probation is sometimes ordered in addition to prison time. If so, the probationary period begins after the prison sentence has been served. There is a large variance in allowable sentencing in federal bank fraud cases. While the judge makes the final decision, an experienced bank fraud lawyer can play a significant role in the process.
Your lawyer may be able to show reasons why your sentence should be reduced or lightened. If you do not have a criminal past, have a steady work history, and good standing in the community, these things may be taken into consideration during sentencing.
Bank Fraud Investigation
Bank fraud investigations typically begin with an internal investigation by the bank or financial institution. Once it has been determined that a crime has been committed, the bank provides information to the police and the U.S. government.
The U.S. Secret Service is the governmental agency that is responsible for the investigations into acts that threaten the safety of U.S. banking systems. They have teams in place to investigate and gather evidence in bank fraud cases.
The U.S. Secret Service investigates many types of bank fraud cases, including:
- Counterfeiting
- Check fraud
- Direct deposit fraud
- Check forgery
- Identity theft
- Automatic payment systems fraud
Investigations can be lengthy and complex. Your documents and computer may need to be turned over for review. A forensic accountant along with other professionals may be utilized as part of the investigation process.
Additionally, witnesses may be deposed to make statements regarding what they know about the crime. Your bank fraud lawyer will review the evidence and provide professionals to evaluate the documents and information. These professionals may be called upon to testify for your defense if the case goes to trial.
Defending Against Federal Bank Fraud Charges
It is best not to speak with law enforcement until you discuss the matter with a Chattanooga bank fraud lawyer. Your lawyer should be present when you are questioned so as to ensure your rights are not violated. Having an experienced bank fraud lawyer during your questioning will prevent you from saying anything that could prove difficult for your defense later.
If a warrant is issued for your arrest, you must make arrangements to turn yourself over to the authorities. You can do so with help from your bank fraud lawyer.
Do not destroy anything that may be perceived or classified as evidence against you as it may leading to additional charges. Instead, consult with your lawyer as soon as possible to determine what is harmful to your defense and what should be the next step.
If you have been arrested, an attorney can advocate for a reduction of charges and a lowered amount of bail, which will allow you to remain out of jail while the case is progressing.
How a Tennessee Bank Fraud Lawyer Can Help
If you have been charged with bank fraud, you need the experience and service of a bank fraud attorney as soon as possible. These are serious charges with severe penalties if convicted. You could lose your job and be unable to find employment if you are found guilty, not to mention facing heavy fines and potentially jail time.
Your finances and your family’s well-being could be in danger if you are convicted of a felony crime. For these reasons, it is imperative to retain experienced Chattanooga bank fraud lawyer that will fight and vigorously defend the charges brought against you.
Plea Deals
After your initial consultation, your check fraud lawyer will immediately begin preparing your defense and working to resolve your case. Some of these types of cases are resolved through plea deals. A plea deal allows you to plead guilty to lesser charges in exchange for something, usually information.
If several people were arrested on charges of the same crime, all will face the same charges. Sometimes it might be beneficial to provide details to law enforcement in order to receive a lighter sentence. An experienced lawyer can help you determine what information may be useful to authorities and what could be damaging to your defense.
Trial
If negotiation does not result in a plea deal, your case will proceed to trial. Your lawyer will prepare your defense and gather the necessary documentation and information for trial.
Keep in mind that a plea arrangement may occur at any time up until the case is completely resolved. Your lawyer will help you decide whether it is in your best interest to accept a plea arrangement or take the case to trial.

I’ve been away from sewing for a while, having previously been an inspector/machinist with Playtex Uk for many years and later an instructor, teaching school leavers basic sewing skills to assist them in to finding work placements. It all comes back to you after a while, but I have to admit, I probably chose the most difficult fabric pattern to work with. Having to line up the fabric was a blast! But, I got there in the end and I have to say I’m delighted with the result. There was eve enough left over to cover an empty wine case and make a little storage box/stool.. The fabric is fantastic and at a bargain price. It’s the Candy Pink Tartan bought from Fabric Land Southampton, where I have to say you have a great bunch of helpful staff.

As on the other platforms I wanted to keep the UI identical, while optimising for the screen dimensions at hand. The main challenge was that contrary to the direct manipulation on the other platforms (with finger or mouse pointer) you are controlling focus on Apple TV with the remote.
So my round LED buttons have an additional white circle if they are in focus. That didn’t look nice for the LED digits however. So there I used the LED digits shadow to give it a white glow. While the timer is thus focussed you can adjust it by swiping horizontally on your Apple TV remote.
I wanted to avoid having the white glow being active while the timer is running, it would soon be annoying to the user. So if you start the timer via tapping on the remote, I place focus back on the currently active preset.
The second big change for the Apple TV concerned the user guide which is shown via the button with the question mark. Since there is no direct manipulation of a scroll view I experimented with having the individual paragraphs be focusable. But that didn’t work out well.
In the end I discarded the ScrollView and instead put the individual user guide sections on separate tabs. Since there was a lot of empty space around the text, I added some eye candy. Some of which is actually interactive.
Finally, the hidden bonus feature which possibly only developers would care about concerns the multiple layers of the app icon. The icons are all generated with original live user interface elements from the app. The non-TV icons were quite simple to do like that. On TV however an app icon has multiple layers which are shown three-dimensionally floating in an awesome parallax effect.
To achieve this for SpeakerClock I divided the multiple layers such that you have the inactive LED bars at the back, the active LED elements in the middle and the traffic light in the front.
Next up I’ll be looking into a Watch app. Although there it might make sense to wait for the iOS 15 feature where you can continue to update the screen every second. Also you should be able to use the watch as remote control for SpeakerClock running on any other platforms.
If you have any ideas or requests or questions, please feel free to contact me by email.

Jamie Cureton's 250th career goal helped Cheltenham to their third league win of the season at Dagenham.
The 38-year-old put the Robins ahead in the first half with a looping 25-yard effort.
Abu Ogogo levelled soon after, side-footing home after Rhys Murphy's initial effort had been beaten away by Cheltenham goalkeeper Scott Brown.
Defender Keith Lowe then met a neat Troy Brown cross after the break to head home the winner for the visitors.
Murphy, Ogogo and Zavon Hines all went close late on for Dagenham but the hosts failed to find an equaliser.
VIEW FROM THE DRESSING ROOM
Cheltenham Town manager Mark Yates speaks to BBC Radio Gloucestershire:
"I'm proud of the work that the players have put in at a tough place to come.
"I think we've worked hard in every game but sometimes it's been channelled in not quite the right areas, so the focus was on hard work, doing it for your team mates and they've done themselves proud today.
"We had to come and ruffle their feathers, try and get in their faces. We did it but it also allowed us to have an extra pass.
"It was a good solid team performance and we can now build on it for the coming games ahead."

This result was about in line with the indexes usually quoted here.
But it was a better quarter for the fund than the headline number would indicate, as the strong Canadian dollar hurt returns by $0.33 per share. Currency effects are likely to continue to play a large role in quarterly results; but over the long term they have tended to cancel out to a large extent, and that remains the expectation going forward.
Excellent returns from Alliance Aviation (as discussed here) have played a significant role in KVF's recent returns. KVF's portfolio also benefited from a now-exited small position in Triple-S Management. Detracting from recent returns was an investment in Torstar, in which KVF no longer owns any shares. Recent result were not consistent with my investment thesis, suggesting I had made a misjudgement/mistake.
Finding value in today's markets remains challenging. It's difficult for me to believe that the returns of the past few years, both for the general markets and for KVF, can be replicated over the next few years. But I have felt this way for some time and yet both KVF and the markets have continued to deliver strong results, so who knows what the future brings. In my opinion, KVF's portfolio continues to have a margin of safety, but it's not as large as it once was, at least by the crude metrics I use.

How do you measure your performance as an investor?
Do you just compare yourself to an index?
For instance, say I pick 10 stocks, 9 go to zero, 1 is a 20x like Amazon. I've doubled my money overall. 100% return, does that make me a good investor?
I mean I got 90% wrong...
Just wondering if there is a better way to judge my performance? By asking how you look at your own....
Hi Anon,
Personally I would look at the average annual return over an investor's long-term track record (10+ or even 20 years).
This has the benefit of reducing the effect of bets that were lucky/unlucky and should also outlast most fads.
The downside of course is that it takes a really long time.Magnatek was originally founded in 1984 by Lars Peter Magnussen. Up to the early 1990’th the company focused on μ-processor based electronics for special applications.

This paper proposes that BA should reclaim its image as the most reliable and experienced company by focusing on improving the perceptions of its employees and customers about the company.
Relative to this goal, this paper proposes several strategies including the adoption of an open communication policy, where the company should invite all stakeholders for an open interaction through social media and face-to-face interactions.
The objective of this strategy is to improve the level of interaction between BA, its employees, and its customers.
Through this interaction, BA should demonstrate that it genuinely cares about the welfare of its customers and employees by showing genuine interest in improving customer service and employee working conditions.
Background
A founding member of the One World Alliance, BA is the national carrier for United Kingdom. The UK government established BA in 1974, but in 1987, the same government privatized the company after nearly 13 years of state control.
Since then, British Airways has cut a niche in the aviation industry as being among the largest airline companies in the world. Indeed, only until 2008, British Airways held the reputation of being the largest airline company in the world, in terms of its fleet numbers.
The company’s main operational hub is at Heathrow airport, but its global presence spans across 150 destinations around the world.
Underlying British Airway’s success is an eroding public confidence about the airline’s reliability as a customer-focused airline company. A series of industrial strikes that nearly grounded the company’s operations in most of its key markets caused the eroded confidence.
For example, throughout most parts of the years 2007, 2008, and 2009, British Airways suffered from a string of industrial actions by its employees. The employees protested poor working conditions and low pay.
The industrial actions caused a series of flight delays and flight cancellations that inconvenienced most of BA’s customers. The disorder dented BA’s public image when stiff competition from rival global airline companies and local low-cost airlines undermined the BA’s market leadership.
BA’s management was unable to contain most of these strikes, thereby further denting the airline’s image as a reliable airline company. Since then, BA’s has had a difficult time trying to redeem its image as a reliable airline company in the eyes of the public.
Situation Analysis
This situational analysis follows four main aspects of BA’s operations: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. They outline below:
Strengths
Most of BA’s strengths stem from its past leadership in the airline industry. For example, BA’s vast global operations earned it the reputation of a respected global airline company with vast experience and operational control around the world.

The company’s expanding fleet of modern aircrafts and the success of some of the company’s loyalty programs (such as the executive club) also comprise some of the company’s key strengths
Weaknesses
Some airline customers regard some of BA’s flights as expensive because many low-cost airlines charge relatively lower prices for air travel. BA has found it difficult to compete with such low-cost airlines because it maintains several extensive global operations.
The high costs of managing and running the extensive global operations have significantly increased the company’s bottom-line costs.
BA’s has also suffered negative publicity from poor services that have culminated through a rise in the number of lost luggage and cancelled flights. These factors have led to the company’s declining profitability.
Opportunities
Since most of BA’s competition come from low-cost airlines, the biggest opportunity that exists for the company is starting a low-cost airline division for its international fleets.
This way, the company would be able to charge low fares for a big part of its core customer base, which is increasingly seeing the rival low-cost airlines as a better alternative than BA.
In addition, since most of BA’s operational costs trace to high fuel costs, the company may invest in the sourcing of alternative fuel to power its aircrafts. This initiative involves funding research and development initiatives that work to serve this purpose.
Threats
Like most airline companies around the world, BA’s greatest threat is increased competition. In addition, as mentioned in the above section of this report, high fuel costs also threaten the company’s future sustainability as it erodes most of its profitability.
for only
BA has also lost most of its cabin crew through its extensive strikes and a crumbling corporate image. This issue has made it more difficult for the company to replace its lost cabin crew, as few potential employees are willing to work with the company.
Message Statement
The emerging themes in this PR plan include customer sensitivity, employee loyalty, and brand consistency. The main idea behind the proposed PR plan is to create a positive brand image by achieving customer and employee buy-in.
In other words, the proposed PR plan singles out BA’s customers and employees as the main stakeholders that have the power to improve the company’s public image.
By achieving employee loyalty, the proposed PR plan aims to convince its customers that all is well with the company and the focus for the company now is the welfare of its customers and employees.
This message statement especially relies on BA’s past image as the leading airline company in the world. The proposed PR plan aims to reaffirm the notion that BA is more experienced, caring, and capable of meeting customer and employees’ demands, compared to other upcoming companies.
Communication Process
The aim of this communication process is to improve the interaction between BA with its employees, its customers, the public, and the media to improve the company’s image in the community. BA’s communication process should stem from a system’s perspective.
The systems perspective will help the organization to communicate with the employees and customers by establishing a stable company image of reliability and community focus. The systems theory explains this model.
Feedback will be an important part of the communication process because feedback may help BA to improve the effectiveness of its communication and PR plans. The communication process will be open to all stakeholders of the PR plan because the PR plan needs to be self-sustaining.
Stated differently, by including the inputs of the company’s main stakeholders (customers and employees), the PR plan will be able to evolve and meet the needs of the organization.
Audiences
BA’s employees and customers outline the focus of the company’s PR plan. Employees are a critical audience for the company because their dissatisfaction with the company created the public image crisis that BA faces today.
In addition, through employee strikes, BA’s customers lost confidence in the company. The employees and the customers therefore outline the main target audiences for BA because both groups stand at different ends of the PR plan.
A change of the employees’ perceptions about BA is likely to rub off on the customers because the employees may offer better customer services if BA’s management pays close attention to their welfare.
Through improved services, BA’s employees will attract more customers to the company. This situation is likely to improve the company’s image, sales, and profitability in the end.
Key Audience Messages
The key audience message of this PR plan is to convince BA’s employees and customers that the company cares for their welfares.
The PR plan should communicate to both groups of stakeholders that the company is genuinely interested in improving their welfare because it understands their importance in achieving corporate success.
Through this commitment, BA should demonstrate that it genuinely values the employees and customers by improving its customer services and rewarding its employees for positive work.
These initiatives should culminate in a “BA open day” program where the managers, employees, and customers meet and share insights regarding the company’s operations.
This way, the company will make the employees and customers believe that it is genuinely interested in their concerns by opening its communication channels to both groups of stakeholders.
Implementation
The best way to reach the target audiences for this PR plan is through social media and face-to-face communication. Demographic assessments of BA’s customers show that the customers frequently use social media. The company can therefore effectively communicate with its customers this way.
Moreover, social media provides a cheap alternative for BA to interact with the customers. However, employees should get a special attention from the top-level management, through face-to-face interaction, because the management should demonstrate that it is genuinely interested in their welfare.
Therefore, BA’s managers should steer the PR implementation process and not fully delegate the responsibility to a PR firm.
Budget
The budget for the public relations plan focuses on research, information gathering, monitoring and evaluation, and strategic integrated communication. The following spreadsheet outlines the budget estimates for these activities.
Monitoring and Evaluation
Measuring Public Opinion
Measuring public opinion is a reliable way of understanding the effectiveness of the PR plan. BA should measure the public opinion before and after the execution of the PR plan, to understand the impact of the PR strategy on the company’s brand.
The public opinion should be measured using customer and employee surveys. Assessing the responses in the customer surveys may show if BA has achieved the objectives of the PR plan, or not.
Social media evaluation
Since social media forms a key part of this PR strategy, social media evaluation may provide a reliable indicator for monitoring and evaluating the impact of the PR plan.
The key indicator of this assessment is the quality and level of interaction between the customers and the company (not the number of followers).
If there is a high level of interaction between the company and its employees, or customers, BA should expect the development of a positive brand image.
However, if the levels of interaction between the company and the employees, or customers, fail to increase, then BA should assume that the PR plan has failed to achieve its objectives.All about high-end cut, 10" AAX Aero Splashes decay more naturally than SABIAN O-Zone splashes, but their multiple small-hole pattern design delivers a higher density of white noise concentration than the AAX Air Splash.

Wow Henrick! I just loved the activity: Letting students run the show. I’m looking forward to trying it out in my class. Hope it turns out well. Thank you very much for sharing!!!!!!
Hi Sabrina,
Looking forward to hearing about how it unfolds in your class. 🙂
Hi Henrick,
Thanks for sharing some ideas. I love using images in the classroom as it’s a great way for students to share more than just language. It’s so much more interesting for them to look at a partner’s picture and interpret it than to simply read the text or listen.
I also like the idea of saying, “Sorry. I don’t know.” to students. I think they have the capacity to find out the answer for themselves, particularly if it’s a vocab question and they have access to dictionaries in the classroom. It encourages them to take more responsibility for their learning and they may even be more likely to remember the word if they’ve had to make an effort to find out its meaning.
T 🙂
Hi T,
Working with images seems to be successful on most occasions, but I feel students need clear instructions if they’re not used to doing so. I can clearly remember when my professor at university used that with us – more than 50 students. That was something! That was one of the closest groups I’ve ever had at university, and we owe it all to our professor. What a difference we can make, huh?!
Faking lack of knowledge has been very effective in terms of working on students’ autonomy and collaboration skills. In the long run, it also saves a lot of classroom time as they start looking things up on an individual basis. I agree with you! 🙂
Many thanks for your comments! Sorry I couldn’t reply to it sooner… final exams at school in Brazil! 🙂

Really like the first activity, it would be great first week of school/getting to know you activity. Thanks for sharing all of these!
Glad to hear you liked it! I’m looking forward to hearing how it went if you ever try it! 🙂
Love your idea, but even better is that you suggest students run the show! I think this is really important so that our students take charge of their learning!
And this is also something that has to be introduced from the very beginning. We can’t simply assume learners will be able to start running the show whenever we feel like giving them the control. Another reason why all teachers should work together. 🙂
Great ideas! All 3 activities are very interesting and they promote students’ creativity which is extremely important. About the ‘Talking about yourself through Images’, have you ever tried fotobabble.com ? I’ve started with my students and they love it, YLs, teens and adults.

Hi Eduardo,
Thanks for suggesting fotobabble. I’d seen it before, but I’ve never tried it with students. I guess I’ll keep it up my sleeve for next semester! 🙂

Online gambling is any type of gambling conducted online. This includes sports betting, casinos and virtual poker. The initial online gambling site opened to the public, was ticketing for the hugely successful Liechtenstein International Poker Tournament in 1994. Since then there has been a explosion in the growth of this industry, which continues to grow and be a billion dollar industry.
The very best type of online gambling for many people is their capability to gamble with virtual money instead of actual cash. Most websites will let you place bets without even charging you a fee, so that you can place bets without needing to be worried about paying high sports betting fees or coping with cash. In addition, when you gamble with virtual money, you can win or lose any amount so long as you have the money. It’s also nice because you can gamble from anywhere, and that means you don’t have to restrict yourself to your home or your favorite spot to place your bets.
As long as you are over the age of eighteen and a United States citizen, you are free to gamble online with virtual money. There are various kinds of gambling sites that will help you win or lose, in addition to offer different kinds of bonuses and promotions that you can benefit from. However, remember that there are some online gaming sites that could try to scam you, as well as use illegal activity such as for example poker bots. Therefore, if you ever feel that you’re being scammed, usually do not trust your personal information with any online gambling site. Remember to check on the gaming site history and get them to a legitimate site. You should also ask friends or family who they use and what they think of the site before you consider joining.
Some individuals feel uncomfortable placing their personal information with other people, and online gambling certainly fits into that category. However, understand that if you opt to play online, you can examine the site out by searching Google or other search engine and checking their reputation. You may also learn more about the games and gambling sites by reading reviews and speaking with other people who have tried it. When you should not permit the online gambling sites to affect your life, you should understand how and when to tell if they are frauds.
If you want betting on sports, online gambling is an excellent solution to win prizes and win some money. Just as in real life, it is possible to bet on sports, casino games and even the stock market. Some people really have a lot of fun with online gambling, but others lose their mind looking forward to their lucky draw. Keep in mind that if you are not used to online gambling, you might want to limit your spending so that you don’t become broke. If you plan on playing at a site that offers no wagers, you might want to read some poker strategies and learn a few tricks to increase your odds of winning.
Another type of gambling online is craps. That’s where you wager your cash and hope you win. In order to learn more about craps, you should visit some online casino games websites to see what they provide. Craps can be beneficial, because you can win lots of money, but there are also some risks involved. You will need to find out about the risks and decide if it is worth it to you to take them on.
In case you are interested in playing blackjack, you should find out more about online gambling blackjack. Blackjack can be a popular form of gambling online, but you should be aware that you can lose a lot of money doing this. You may even find that you make some friends while playing blackjack, so it can be a great way to meet people. Should you choose decide to gamble online, you need to watch out for bonuses, which are little incentives that you can get from gambling online.
If you are looking for something exciting to do, you should think about playing sports betting online. There are various forms of sports betting available through online gambling sites, including football, basketball, baseball and hockey. THE UNITED STATES is full of individuals who love sports, and there’s an excellent opportunity for you to make some money through sports betting. Whether your home is in the U.S., South America or Europe, you have plenty of options with regards to sports betting.4063

The COVID-19 national death toll is now 23, after three new deaths today in NSW, Victoria and Queensland.
A NSW grandmother died after a holiday on the Ruby Princess cruise ship, which has been linked to hundreds of cases and multiple deaths.
The decision to dock the vessel last month is being blamed for a rise in NSW cases.
Border Force have pointed the finger squarely at NSW Health for letting 2700 passengers – some coughing and spluttering - off the cruise to disperse around Australia and abroad. There are eight cruise ships either docked or waiting off the NSW coast.
NSW health chiefs are now considering a military-style operation to fly doctors to them and test passengers and crew. But there are concerns an influx of new patients will flood the health system
NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller fears hospitals will be overwhelmed.
"There are thousands of people, potentially, in cruise ships off our coasts that aren't members of our state and if we take them in, then that could well flood our system unnecessarily," he said earlier this week.
Authorities were heavily criticised when the Ruby Princess at Circular Quay on March 19 and allowed some 2700 passengers to disembark despite some travellers having respiratory symptoms.
The President of Carnival Australia, which operates P&O Cruises, has condemned the actions of NSW Police, saying they put the whole $5 billion industry at risk in Australia.
P&O Cruises has a vessel, the Pacific Explorer, docked in Sydney but says NSW Police today told the cruise liner it had to leave.
"There is no illness on Pacific Explorer. No passenger or crew member has at any point tested positive for COVID-19, yet today the NSW Police instructed Pacific Explorer to leave Sydney harbour – the ship's own port," Sture Myrmell said.
"It is unprecedented for Australia's homegrown cruise line to be ordered to leave Australia."
"We understand the pressure governments are under to slow the spread of coronavirus. It is a massive task.
"In terms of our ships, we have only wanted the opportunity to take them out of service and keep them and our crews safe until this is all over – and it will be over one day.
"It is bitterly disappointing that short term responses are putting industry, jobs and people at risk."
Meanwhile, the final passengers yesterday.
According to the Australian Border Force, the government is working with the industry "to bring everyone currently on a cruise safely back to port and to their home destinations either in Australia or overseas."
The federal government has restricted all cruise ships from entering Australia until June 15, including direct arrivals and round-trip cruPolar Layers

Low Literacy Level Instructions and Reminder Calls Improve Patient Handling of Fecal Immunochemical Test Samples

- Description:BACKGROUND & AIMS: The fecal immunochemical test (FIT) is an alternative to colonoscopy and can increase overall screening for colorectal cancer (CRC). However, little is known about the frequency of and reasons for mishandled FIT samples. METHODS: We performed a prospective study, nested within a randomized controlled trial of patients, recruited from December 2015 through August 2017, who were not up to date with colorectal cancer screening (50–75 years old). The patients were randomly assigned to usual care or outreach groups that received a mailed FIT with low literacy level instructions or a reminder call, or both. We examined frequency of and reasons for mishandled FIT samples, including absence of collection date; time from collection to laboratory receipt of more than 14 days; or mishandling of stool, buffer, or cap. The outcomes were the frequency of mishandled FIT samples, effects of outreach on mishandling, and positive results from the FIT among proper and mishandled samples. RESULTS: FIT samples were returned from 1871 patients assigned to usual care and 3045 who received the low literacy level instructions and a reminder call. In total, 19.8% of samples were mishandled; most of these (93.7%) had not labeled the date of stool collection but were still processed. Of the received samples, 1.2% of were not processed because the time from patient collection to laboratory receipt was more than 14 days. Outreach was associated with a lower proportion of mishandled samples (16.5% vs 25.0% for usual care; P < .0001). The proportion of mishandled samples was lowest among patients who received the low literacy level instruction and a reminder call (12.8%, P < .0001). There was no significant difference in proportions of positive results between properly processed samples (7.5%) and improperly processed samples (6.2%) (P = .14). CONCLUSION: In a prospective study of patients who were not up to date with colorectal cancer screening, we found that almost 20% of FIT samples were mishandled, with most patients missing the stool collection date. Patient outreach was associated with a lower proportion of mishandled samples, but there was no difference in proportions of positive results between properly and improperly handled samples. Our findings indicate that routine processing of undated FIT samples is associated with similar rates of positive results. There are limited data on test characteristics for FIT samples beyond the 14 days of stool acquisition. The inclusion of low literacy level instructions with reminder calls was associated with improved patient handling of the FIT sample. ClincialTrials.gov no:

Immigrant women account for most of the victims of hate crimes. Why is this phenomenon so pervasive?
Muslim, Asian and Latina women are the main victims of xenophobic attacks in the United States during an increase in hate crimes against immigrants. The phenomenon, said experts convened by Ethnic Media Services, reflects the fact that marginalized groups end up being the scapegoat for everything that goes wrong in the country. But why women?
According to the new survey “Islamophobia in the eyes of Muslims,” women (76.7%) are more likely than men (58.6%) to be victims of Islamophobia, and 91% of women reported that Islamophobia affects their emotional and mental well-being compared to 84% in the case of men.
“Women are viewed as a symbol of a visible (wearing the hijab), external and opposing culture,” said Basima Sisemore, researcher for the Global Justice Program at the Othering & Belonging Institute at UC Berkeley, who conducted the survey. “And that culture is Islam and the East, and Muslims who supposedly are at odds with western ideals and democratic values.”
The survey is the first national study to ask Muslim Americans (about 3.5 million people) their perceptions and experiences regarding Islamophobia. It was conducted in 50 states and 1123 respondents participated.
62% of all respondents reported that they, relatives, friends or members of their community have been affected by federal and/or state policies that disproportionately discriminate against Muslims.
Islamophobia, says Sisemore, already existed before the attacks of September 11, 2001 and dates back to the beginning of the nation as 20% of the African slave population was Muslim.
It has been perpetrated by people in individual acts of violence, but also institutionalized by “structural racism” in the United States with policies such as “the travel ban for Muslims, Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) programs or even anti-Sharia legislation.”
“Liberal and imperialist feminism feeds into the false and dangerous narrative of Muslim women as oppressed,” continued Sisemore. “That feminism says that women have no equality under Islam, and are seen in need of being saved from violent and oppressive Muslim men, which is a very dangerous narrative that played out in the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan as a means to garner public support toward the narrative of white saviorism.”
While in some Islamic countries women need to go out in public with their husbands or have severe restrictions on their rights, Sisemore says these are “extreme examples” and that the media could highlight other aspects of Muslim culture as “women play an intrinsic role in all parts of society.”
According to Elsadig Elsheikh, Director of the Global Justice Program at the Othering & Belonging Institute at UC Berkeley, in some African countries women have led the struggle against dictatorships and invasions and there are exemplary cases of leadership in the East like that of Sheikh Hasina, current prime minister in Bangladesh, and Benazir Bhutto, the first woman to head a democratic government in a Muslim-majority country like Pakistan.
“I’m not quite sure the representation of women in most liberal democracies in the West exceeds 20%,” Elsheikh said.
Elsheikh said that another worrying finding from the survey is that almost a third or more of Muslims have hid or attempted to hide their religious identity, “because Islamophobia has made their place of worship linked to ‘terrorism’ which makes it hard for Muslims to engage with each other… if I see a guy with a turban on his head, I am also filled with rage against those who will come into bombing our country.”
Many Muslims censor themselves by avoiding talking about their beliefs or place of origin and in the case of women “almost nine out of 10 women do that in their everyday life, they try to get away from speaking their mind.”
For Elsheikh, Muslims and other marginalized groups, “seem to be the scapegoats for everything wrong in the United States.”
This experience is similar for Asian-American communities that have been the subject of a wave of racist and xenophobic incidents related to the origin of COVID in Asia. According to the Stop AAPI Hate center, from March 2020 to June 2021, more than 9,000 incidents have been reported against this community and more than 66% of those attacks have been against Asian-American women, including school-age girls.
“With that idea of ‘Make America White Again”, the rest of us are foreign invaders and whole groups of people are rendered as being second-class, less than human,” said Helen Zia, AAPI activist, author, and journalist.
“Add to that a layer of gender-based attacks against women, which puts immigrant women to face multiple jeopardy for being just who they are.” Zia mentioned the massacre in Atlanta, Georgia, where six Asian-American women who worked in spas were killed, and said that the hate incidents, although not documented by gender, date back to 1980.
“The sexualization of Asian women, and women of color in general, plays a role in these kinds of incidents,” Zia said. The most difficult thing for women is to report “because they know that in society overall they are diminished, they are shamed and blamed, and they may even face stigma within their own community.”
Among the Latino community, labor and sexual exploitation occur in silence due to the latent threat of deportation. Latina and indigenous agricultural workers, particularly immigrants from Mexico, Central and South America escape various forms of violence in their countries of origin and by seeking refuge in the United States, they continue to be victimized.
“Latina women have faced a lot of sexual violence, especially in the fields, considering the dynamic that exists with their citizenship status,” said Irene de Barraicua, Director of Operations for Lideres Campesinas, a network of agricultural workers that supports women with their asylum cases.
“They are afraid of retaliation and deportation and do not seek assistance for fear of being deemed a public charge,” added Barraicua. During the pandemic “they were the first to go when business and growers farmers had to stop or wanted to keep the fastest workers.”
The leader says that all these forms of violence can only stop when “we see a fair immigration reform” and for that “we will continue lifting these voices.” carry 6 people.

Thirty dumpster-diving workers at the now-closed Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant found themselves extra-special souvenirs in the plant’s trash bins — nuclear bomb components that had failed quality control.
Officials say the workers won’t be punished, since they didn’t realize the error of their ways. In fact, they tended to display the parts on their desks, using them as candy dishes and paperweights. “It was not unreasonable of them to believe they could go in and pick the stuff up,” says an understanding plant clean-up manager.
Nonetheless, an Energy Department report says it’s conceivable that nuclear secrets could have fallen into the wrong hands (what, again?). The report blames sloppy plant inventory controls./>
Using his own considerable engineering talents, and the greatly appreciated help of some good friends, David brought this almost 100 year old gem back to life.
The 500 cc engine needed new bearings and piston rings, and the bike was missing its rear hub, amongst other things. Once it had been carefully pieced together, it was painted by a gentleman who lives locally to David. The restoration took a total of 18 months.

AdvertThis week contained an anniversary that forever changed the course of history. On Tuesday we remembered the 17th anniversary of the terrorist attack on U.S. soil. In memory of those affected by the event, we dedicate this writing.
Flashbulb memories are described as a recollection of an event so vividly that one can recall it in so much detail, that thinking about it can bring back the feelings that were felt at the time. Some people can remember exactly where they were, what they were wearing, who was in their company and so many more things that is not part of normal memory.
In the Fall of 2000, I remember taking a college psychology course in which the professor told the class that unless you experience a flashbulb memory, it is hard to really understand what it means. He shared with us his first experience of a flashbulb memory, it was when President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas on November 22, 1963. He was able to recall the details so precisely that he gave himself goosebumps. Little did I know at the time that my first experience with a flashbulb memory would come a year later September 11, 2001.
I was a sophomore at UCSB, getting ready for my 8 a.m. macro-economics class that I had taken that summer. Like most students, I had set my alarm to go off with just enough time to jump out of bed, get ready and run to class to make it on time. I had been following this routine all summer, and like most days, I did not expect anything different. Except, that morning was anything but normal.
There it was, my first flashbulb experience. On TV I saw the North Tower of the World Trade Center up in smoke. A few minutes later, I witnessed the North Tower crumble to pieces. Like many of you the feelings of fear, anger and hope battled for control.
The events that unfolded that morning will be vividly plastered in all our memories forever. So many lives were changed because of that event; the course of history was changed because of that morning. I think it is important to remember the victims of the 9/11 tragedy and all our service men and women who lost their lives because of the events that subsequently unfolded. We will never forget you.
Next week our normal market commentary will continue.

Their day was filled with so much joy and laughter! I had such a great time and captured some of my favorite pre-wedding photos everrrrr.
"Yea so if you could just go ahead and lay down in this tub, that'd be great!" Jesse was such a good sport.
The guys had to do a last minute toast before the wedding in their customized flasks.

From recent research, data reveals that there is a rapid and enhanced jobless rate greater than the previous time the economy fell into economic depression. Many industries including production and building companies, retail and financial services have experienced major losses leading to a vast number of job losses. Moreover, the stagnant job growth coupled with increased inflation rates which are way above the average wages implicate a less buying power of those who keep their jobs. Obama’s plan suggests the most successful ways used to combat the unemployment phenomenon is expanding and increasing unemployment insurance. This temporary extension plan is a vital assistance to the workers during this particular period when the world is going through an economic agony. Consumer expenditure will then remains at an acceptable level and the e unemployed given an opportunity to restart and fully exploit their careers.
In an attempt to combat problems encountered in the economic crunch, Barack Obama has placed Americas’ economy a priority agenda from day one as president. He did outline an inclusive package of economic reforms targeting the middle class and working families. This plan will help eliminate to a great extent the problems of this particular class of people while making progress on achieving a long-run budget balance. As a matter of agency, his government is working hard to bring back faith to customers and businesses. This is indeed a fundamental step that once put into place will not let things get to their worst but will instead encourage spending and investment by the respective consumers and businesses. Since consumer confidence levels have drastically dropped, it is necessary that proper policies are put into place to win their confidence back.
For a given stimulus to be effective, then it must offer immediate, temporary solutions and a direct economic relief to the concern, and especially to those who desperately need it and most likely to use the funds effectively and increase the level of economic activity in their communities without permanently increasing the budget deficit. Obama’s stimulus plan realizes this by getting money inform of tax cuts. It then targets to redirect spending directly to those who desperately need it. For instance, by injecting $75 billion of stimulus into the financial system, his proposal provides an immediate solution without lengthy and sometimes unnecessary governmental or administrative delays. A provision for an additional $45 billion of stimulus is made available in this strategic economic recuperation plan. Incase the economy keeps on deteriorating in the future then, this amount can quickly be pumped into the economy.
The low and middle-earning seniors who are squeezed by higher prices will have extra earnings made to them so as to boost the social security usual plan. This will empower this group of persons hence stimulating consumer spending in the most rapid way possible without altering the social security program but will at the same time utilize the revenue from its trust funds
This stimulus plan also has engraved fundamental steps that will help protect responsible homeowners facing fore closure through this difficult period. Short and long-term programs are to be developed to help them remain with their homes as they find a solution on how to settle their debts. This will ensure that families maintain and retain their homes and also prevent a further depreciation in property value. Since this measure is not friendly to speculators or to those buying vacation homes, it will drastically reduce impulse spending. This measure also prevents a possible deadly impact of national foreclosure crisis on state, local and family budgets.Receive for Free - Discover & Explore eNewsletter monthly with advance notice of special offers, packages, and insider savings from 10% - 30% off Best Available Rates at selected hotels.

Screenshot of Trans-Canada Air Lines L-1049C on runway.
Trans Canada Air-Lines was a major airline in Canada. TCA bought many new Super Constellations, and converted many of them into L-1049G standard. TCA retired all of their L-1049Gs and L-1049Hs in 1961, and replaced them with DC-8 jets. TCA became Air Canada in 1968.
- To install CF-TGE, you will need to open up the folder that Manfred's Super G is located in. For example: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Microsoft Flight Simulator X\Sim Objects\Lockheed_L1049. If you are using FS2004, go to your FS2004 aircraft folder and open the folder Lockheed_L1049.
- Then copy and paste the folder that says "texture.tge" into that folder.
- Then copy the following into the aircraft.cfg file:

Went through many owners between 1961-2005. It was sold to the Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington in 2005. It was restored betweeen 2007 to 2009 back in her TCA colors. She is now sitting in Seattle, Washington ready to be put on display."
- Note, the "x" in [fltsim.x] will need to be replaced with the next number in the sequence. For example, if the other textures go up to [fltsim.3], you will need to replace x with 4. If they go up to 7, replace it with 8 and so forth.

If you’ve ever been to a living room dance so much that you’ve slipped across the floor on a rug, you know how, uh, risky it can be having nothing to secure it. Luckily, non-slip mats are on hand to ensure the floor under your feet stays cushioned – and firmly anchored in place – while you try out the final moves.
But you don’t have to cut a rug, figuratively speaking, for them to count. Non-slip mats are an essential part of building the most comfortable space possible and also serve as a layer for safety and protection. They prevent rugs from having wavy edges, moving around when vacuuming, or spreading across the floor when the dog rolls up. Home Depot transports them in a variety of materials, thicknesses and construction styles, each suitable for specific types of carpet that you might have.
The room dictates the mat
Perhaps the most important role of carpet rugs is to make sure that the rugs stay completely attached to one place. This is especially important in high traffic areas, where “grip” non-slip pads, such as those made of extra-durable rubber, are ideal. Grip carpet pads are also a solid choice in any indoor-outdoor setting, like a screened porch or veranda, as they repel moisture and are also useful when you want a rug to have a lower profile (think: anywhere a mat can prevent a door mat from opening).
Non-slip mat pads (those that combine cushioning with a gripping action) do exactly what they promise, adding an extra level of plush to your carpet. These rugs are best served in bedrooms, entertainment rooms, or anywhere people might find themselves sitting on the floor (such as a playground). They usually have a felt top that provides support for the mat itself – and your body when you tackle an online yoga class – and a grippy rubber bottom to grip on the floor. (If you can’t tell which side is which, the manufacturer’s instructions will usually clear it up.)
Either way, non-slip mats don’t just soften the shock of daily trampling on your floors. They help a mat retain its shape more effectively by reducing the friction induced by movement. Non-slip carpet pads can be used on any surface – tile, laminate, carpet, you name it – but if the flooring is smooth, like hardwood, make sure your carpet mat has power. sufficient grip by checking again that it is a “cushion -grip” and not just a “cushion” cushion.
Carpet pads can lead a long, happy life (as long as your carpet itself, if not longer) with a little maintenance. According to Carolyn Forte, Director of Appliances and Cleaning Products at Good Housekeeping, be sure to vacuum the cushion at least twice a year, and in addition to the carpet, be sure to check and treat any stains on the carpet if an accident occurs.
Size matters, but you can customize
Carpet cushions, especially those designed for area rugs, are often sold in standard sizes, but are infinitely simple to customize at home if the desired thickness and style of grip isn’t out of the box.
Measure the carpet itself, then subtract two inches from each side – this is an ideal size for your carpet. (You certainly don’t want a simple looking rug rug sticking out from the side of your old rug!) Cut the pad to fit using standard, sharp scissors, decide where exactly in the room the combination mat and cushion will go and unroll the cushion with the rubber side down (if felt and rubber). Just like that, you have a new built-in support network for your carpet that will keep your floors in pristine condition and trip and fall catastrophes at bay.Property Attributes

Muscled up, often steroid-filled, testosterone-raging men who travel the globe on a regular basis can get a little grumpy from time-to-time. At times, these guys can lose their cool and get into altercations with each other. In part two of a new editorial series here at eWrestlingNews.com, “Backstage Fight Stories,” we’re going to take a look at another infamous behind-the-scenes brawl that involved two well-known professional wrestlers.
As I get older and the business continues to move ahead, I’m learning more and more that the fan base is filled with a lot of younger fans. I’m learning that stories I’ve heard, that I assume are common-knowledge to all wrestling fans, are actually brand new to this generation. So while you and I may remember these stories as if they happened yesterday, we have to understand that thousands upon thousands of younger fans have never heard of them. If you have, then enjoy reading about them again. If you haven’t, strap on your seat belts because some of them will shock the hell out of you. Today, in part two of our “Backstage Fight Stories” series, we will take a look at Scott Steiner vs. Diamond Dallas Page.
Scott Carl Rechsteiner, who performed during his pro wrestling career as Scott Steiner, was a legitimate amateur wrestler before entering the “professional” level. Rechsteiner wrestled at 190 pounds for the University of Michigan, where he became a three-time Big 10 runner-up after finishing fifth in his freshman year in college. He later became a NCAA Division I All-American and placed sixth in the United States in his senior year.
Page Joseph Falkinburg, who performed during his pro wrestling career as Diamond Dallas Page (DDP), was originally an aspiring basketball player. Fulkinburg played basketball at St. Joseph’s High School (which is now known as Monsignor Donovan High School) during his freshman year on the junior varsity team, and on the varsity squad as a sophomore. Falkinburg later became a mainstay in the nightclub industry before becoming a full-fledged pro wrestler at an older age than most talents who enter the business.
Steiner and Page both worked in WCW during the heyday of the infamous WWE vs. WCW “Monday Night Wars.” Things between the two reached a boiling point in 2001 when Kimberly Page, DDP’s wife at the time, found an illegal substance backstage and allegedly went to WCW management, informing them that it belonged to Tammy “Sunny” Sytch. Sytch denied the accusation and even offered to take a drug test on the spot — which she ended up passing. This is where things got interesting.
Apparently Steiner caught wind of what was happening and literally chased Kimberly out of the building. Subsequently, Kimberly would never appear on WCW television again.
At the following television taping, Steiner cut a shoot promo on Page, who at this point was fed up and felt the need to stand up for not only his wife, but himself as a man. Page ended up waiting for Steiner backstage after he cut the aforementioned televised promo, and this is where all hell broke loose.
As the story goes, DDP, who was waiting for Steiner behind the curtain, confronted the former NCAA Division I All-American wrestler as soon as he made his way backstage. The two allegedly exchanged some heated verbal insults before things got physical. Apparently the two ended up in a clinch, and depending on multiple versions of the story, DDP put a front-face-lock of sorts, or a guillotine choke by today’s mixed-martial-arts standards, on the larger grappler. The two were supposedly separated, but unfortunately for DDP the situation didn’t end there.
Again, there are a number of variations to the story, but apparently Steiner broke free from those holding him back at the time and allegedly went completely berserk. Page, who tried throwing a kick at Steiner, ended up on the ground as the result of a double-leg-dive, or a traditional amateur-style takedown from the man with the legitimate wrestling experience. Here’s where things got ugly, and where details become a bit scarce.
Steiner reportedly went for DDP’s eyes. That’s right, Steiner tried ripping DDP’s eyeballs out of the socket, rendering the “People’s Champion” at the time (Page was calling himself that before “The Rock” was in WWE) blind. Going for the eyes in a legitimate fight is one of many tricks professional wrestlers were taught in the old days when instructed how to really “handle yourself” in a legitimate altercation. “The eyes are the groin of the face,” as was once referenced as a joke on the hit-comedy television series “The Office.”
While it may have served as a joke for the documentary-style television series, truer words have never been spoken. Anyone who has taken a solid shot to the ball-bag knows — game over. At least temporarily. In this case, where several other muscled up bad asses were there to break things up, the game was over for good. DDP allegedly bit Steiner in an attempt to get “The Big Bad Booty Daddy” off of him, and the two were once again separated.
DDP, who had come off as a hero to his fellow WCW employees for standing up to someone who was perceived as a bully, and during the initial scuffle reportedly looked to be holding his own in an impressive fashion, was a mess. His face was apparently in bad shape, with obvious damage suffered during their brief exchanges. Page later claimed that his face resembled “Freddy Krueger” from the popular horror movie series, “A Nightmare On Elm Street.”

So there you have it. Join us next time where we will take a look at another real-life fight in the not-so-real world of professional wrestling. Until next time, this has been another installment of the eWrestlingNews.com ongoing series, “Backstage Fight Stories.”

I got a lot of little packages, and I got enough food to sort of feed the family, or, at least, it might have fed the family, had the family genuinely liked the food. What I really got was, simply, the experience of using Blue Apron, and confirmation that, for someone like me, it’s a total waste of time.
I already knew I was kind of anti-Blue Apron, just on principle, but I didn’t realize how frustrating it would be to prepare a Blue Apron meal until I set out to do it. I guess part of my problem stems from the fact that I obviously misunderstood what it is that Blue Apron saves you time on. As my readers doubtless know, Blue Apron is a service that delivers to your door a box of ingredients for cooking dinner. You go to their website and look at their menu and select which meal(s) sound good to you, and the ingredients for those meal(s) are shipped to you in a refrigerated box. I knew this, but since I’d never played with the contents of such a box, I didn’t really understand how it worked, until this week.
A few months back, I noticed that my neighbors, a very busy young couple, started receiving Blue Apron packages. I figured that my neighbors’ schedules were so batshit that the service made sense to them, even though they live literally one block from a lovely Italian grocery store, three blocks from another lovely Italian grocery store, and within easy walking distance of so many other places to get food, it’s ridiculous. (I mean, there are reasons I live in this neighborhood.) The other day, the lady of the house caught me in the courtyard. She said, “Hey, I was wondering — we’re getting our Blue Apron shipment today but we’re not going to be around to cook it. I meant to cancel it but I forgot. Is there any chance you’d want it? I mean, I hate to waste the food.” I thought about it and realized this was my chance to have a crack at a Blue Apron project and said, “Sure!” So late yesterday afternoon she knocked on the door and handed over the goods.
There was a package of two catfish fillets; a little plastic bag with two Yukon Gold potatoes; a really tiny plastic packet with two sprigs of parsley in it; a small foil box of organic whole milk; a plastic bag with a weird grayish powder in it that I took to be the flour mix for breading the catfish; 1/4 of a head of Napa cabbage; and another mini-package with something in it called “knick knacks.” It took me a while to figure out the “knick knacks” because I was afraid to just open it up. It finally occurred to me to read the glossy color instruction sheet my neighbor had helpfully given me. The “knick knacks” were the things you need to make the recipe, things that, in a household like mine, you’d just have because you have them. Things like cider vinegar and butter and mayonnaise and “cajun spice blend.”
I don’t have a jar of Cajun Spice Blend around, but Blue Apron does explain to us what Cajun Spice Blend is. It is: smoked paprika, ground yellow mustard, onion powder, garlic powder, dried oregano, dried thyme, and cayenne pepper. In other words, stuff I had sitting around on my spice shelf.
My family considered this pile of ingredients. My daughter, who isn’t a big seafood person, said simply, “Yuck.” My husband said, “Catfish is good!” but seemed dubious: two potatoes does not make a whole lot of mashed potatoes. And the quarter of a head of cabbage — it was to laugh.
Well, I set to work. I read the instructions carefully and inspected the pretty color photos to make sure I understood what Blue Apron wanted me to do. It seemed to me that this was a situation where, if I winged it, I wouldn’t be giving the product the test it deserved. I resolved to follow the instructions to the letter. To this end: I took a shallow bowl and poured some of the milk and the vinegar into it, and then I stirred it around a bit, and placed the fish fillets in the bowl. This is supposed to do something to the catfish akin to soaking catfish in buttermilk. (Curdling milk with vinegar is a good way to approximate buttermilk; even I know that.) I’m not sure why we are supposed to soak catfish in buttermilk but this is Standard Operating Procedure, so, fine. I soaked the fish and turned it over in the “buttermilk” intermittently while I washed and dried the cabbage, sliced it finely the way Blue Apron wanted me to, and assembled the cole slaw (combine with mayonnaise, a little vinegar, and Cajun Spice Blend). I also set a pot of salted water to boil for the mashed potatoes. I hate making mashed potatoes; I hate cooking potatoes. But I dutifully washed and peeled and chopped the potatoes and boiled them for 12 minutes. Then I drained them (saving the potato water to use in making bread — thank you, Blue Apron, for my future loaves of potato bread) and mashed them with more of the milk and the butter Knick-Knack.
Once the potatoes were done, I put the pot in the (gently pre-heated) oven to stay warm, and I assessed the overall situation. It was abundantly clear that the cabbage might have created enough slaw to satisfy our cabbage needs (raw cabbage doesn’t shrink down the way cooked cabbage does, so I guess 1/4 a head of Napa was sufficient, and my snotty laughter was uncalled for). But there was simply not going to be enough of this meal to feed three of us. For one thing, our daughter was sure to not want to eat any catfish; and there were nowhere near enough potatoes. So I filled a stockpot with water and set it on to boil, and then I spent a few minutes mincing onion and garlic and getting a pot of pasta Natalie ready. (This meant sautéing onion, garlic, and some chopped olives in anchovies, and olive oil and then blending in tomato paste and water. It’s not hard to put together, thank god.)
Once the Natalie sauce was assembled and I didn’t have to think about it anymore, I heated some oil (not provided by Blue Apron) in a wide cast iron pan and dressed the catfish as instructed — shaking the “buttermilk” off the fish and dredging it in seasoned flour. I fried the fish and drained it on paper towels as Blue Apron advised.
“Okay everybody,” I said. “As soon as I’ve cooked the spaghetti, dinner’s ready.” I chose thin spaghetti because it takes five fewer minutes to cook than regular spaghetti, and seven minutes later, the three of us were seated around the table.
“That’s catfish?” my daughter asked, looking skeptically at the handsome platter of fried breaded fish.
“It’s yummy,” my husband said. “Well, it looks yummy,” he said. He took an entire filet and put it on his plate.
“I made spaghetti for you,” I told my daughter. “Don’t worry.” I gave her a large serving and grated cheese onto it and spooned some extra olives on top. “Here you go.” I then served myself some fish, some potatoes, and some cole slaw.
The cole slaw was fine. The potatoes were fine. The fish was entirely unappetizing. I ate a bite, trying to be optimistic. “What do you think?” I asked my husband. “It’s ok,” he said. I chewed, took another bite. “Is the problem the fish or the way I cooked it?”
“I have don’t know,” my husband said. The truth is, I almost never cook fish, so there’s no way anyone could described me as a skilled seafood cook; how could this have turned out well? My husband, the poor guy, doggedly continued to consume his fish. I got through half of mine and gave up.
He looked at my plate sadly. “Had enough?” he said.
“I’m switching to spaghetti,” I said, humiliated. “The cole slaw is good,” I said.
“The potatoes are okay,” my husband said.
“Can I have more spaghetti?” my daughter asked.
By the end of the meal, there were no leftover potatoes and the cole slaw was gone. One half of a catfish filet remained; there was enough leftover pasta to serve some to my daughter for lunch the next day and give myself some for lunch too. Had my husband and I not had catfish, cole slaw, and potatoes, there would have been no leftover pasta at all.
“What should we do with the leftover catfish?” I wondered.
“I’ll take care of it,” my husband said. I assumed this meant he would choke it down. I wiped down the kitchen counter and took the dirty kitchen linens upstairs, saying, “I might as well do a load of laundry now.”
While I was standing at the washing machine measuring in the detergent, my husband came up the stairs holding a small bowl. We don’t generally have food upstairs, so I was curious. “What’s going on?”
“Watch,” he said. He put the bowl down on the floor in the stairwell and our cat came trotting over from the towel on the bedroom floor that he regards as his bed. He sniffed. “You’re giving the cat the catfish?” I said. My husband smiled affectionately at the cat. The cat pawed at the fish and licked his paw once; then he repeated this exploratory movement. Satisfied that this was food, he then plowed through the scraps of fish in the bowl. “I only gave him a few flakes,” my husband said. “The rest of it I’m saving in the fridge as treats.”
“Okay,” I said, defeated. The truth was, if neither of us liked the fish, then the cat might as well enjoy it. The cat finished the fish in his bowl and marched away, pleased as punch. A tiny flake of fish had landed on the floor. I debated bringing it to him and decided that was insane and threw it into the toilet bowl. Then I went downstairs to help finish cleaning up the kitchen.
“I think Blue Apron’s worth it for people who really can’t stand grocery shopping,” my husband said, “or people who’re living in those extended-stay hotel type places and maybe don’t want to deal with stocking a pantry while they’re there.”
“Yeah,” I said, dolefully putting leftover pasta into a plastic tub.
“But otherwise, it’s not really worth it. They don’t take care of the prep for you, or the cooking. It’s just the shopping.”
“I spent just as much time cooking this meal — more time, really — as I would on any other normal weeknight dinner,” I said. “And it was ok, but none of us really liked it.”
The cat marched down the stairs and came into the kitchen and looked at us expectantly.
I’m wondering if I should make my neighbor an offer. For $50 a week, plus the cost of groceries, I will cook dinner for her and her husband two nights a week. It might be a better deal than Blue Apron.Summary:

Booklist - 04/15/2012 Ponti is a prolific picture-book author in his native France, and TOON Books has modified two of his French works as a single addition to their winning stable. Ponti’s aesthetic is quite on display, as each page constitutes a single panel and, while its shape and the iconography and symbols within are drawn from comics, even young readers who have never set eyes on sequential art before will be quite comfortable here. The narrative, in which Chick and Chickie first make scary masks and then play with a living letter A, is as simple as can be, and the youngest readers will find no stumbling blocks (though there is one image of the chicks pretending to scare the A that more sensitive kids might find alarming). The art, however, reveals an accomplished complexity beneath the charming simplicity, as Ponti effectively distinguishes his characters with the smallest details and strategically uses drops of sweat and motion lines to create a sense of lively fun. - Copyright 2012 Booklist.

The businesswoman, who owns Creator Hair/The Blow, said she expects to have to temporarily close her salon when new Covid restrictions are announced today.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to introduce extra restrictions in some towns and cities in the North to try to halt the spread of the virus as infection rates continue to rise.
In a Facebook post on her business page on Saturday night, the owner of Creator Hair/ The Blow branded some of the scenes she witnessed last week on West Street, where her salon is located, as a ‘disgrace’.
Despite social distancing rules being in place and bans on gatherings of more than six people, revellers have continued to socialise in Sheffield.
The businesswoman said: “Today I locked the doors of a business I have spent 29 years building, knowing that on Monday we have a more than likely chance of been forced to close again.
“The scenes I have witnessed the last two days on West Street have been nothing other than a disgrace.
“Very large groups of people dressed as if it’s New Year’s Eve hammered.
“The carnage at 5pm when I locked up was horrendous.
“Sadly Covid-19 has taken lots of lives from lots of family members before their time but the legacy of this period in our history is that tens of thousands of people who built business from nothing in a very wide range of sectors employing millions of people, will disappear leaving high streets empty. Up to four million unemployed and lives ruined and a debt this country will spend 50 years repaying .
“I really hope the cheap Prosecco offers were worth it￼.”
In a second post, she added: “I would like to clarify that Creator is not closing permanently.
“My post was in anticipation of the government’s announcement that Sheffield will be put into tier three of their new Covid lockdown guidance.
“As widely reported this will mean bars, restaurants, cafes, leisure facilities and probably hair and beauty salons will all be forced to close until further notice.
“This has been brought about for the reasons given yesterday.”

When we subject coal to an elementary organic analysis we simply obtain the total amount of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, and ash which it contains, as given in the tables above, but we know little or nothing of the way in which these elements are combined. “There can be but little doubt, however, that it is correct to look upon it as carbon which contains, either mixed with it or combined with it, hydrocarbon compounds of much the same character as the paraffins, and also compounds of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, of somewhat similar kind to the woody fibre from which it has sprung, while other compounds containing nitrogen, and probably of more complexity, are also present."
This theory has been recently corroborated by an investigation conducted by Mr. W. M'Connell, of the Durham College of Science, and reported in the “ Journal of Gas Lighting " for January 30th, 1894.
One piece of information which has an important bearing on the suitability of a coal for gas-inaking purposes is obtained from an elementary analysis of the same, viz., the percentage of unoxidized hydrogen, by which is meant hydrogen unaccompanied by an equivalent of oxygen, which is obtained by deducting one-eighth of the percentage of oxygen from the percentage of hydrogen. .
According to Professor Wanklyn'coal is very poor for
1 “Gas Engineers’ Chemical Manual,” p. 13.
gas-making purposes when the unoxidized hydrogen is less than four per cent., and it is exceedingly rich when the un. oxidized hydrogen exceeds five per cent. The following is an example of what is meant.
Elementary Analysis of Newcastle Coal.
Per cent. Carbon
86.81 Hydrogen
4.96 Nitrogen
1:05 Sulphur
0.88 Oxygen
5.28 Ash
1.08 Unoxidized hydrogen
4:31
.
The reason why the percentage of unoxidized hydrogen plays such an important part in the choice of a coal is, that when the coal is carbonized, every 16 parts of oxygen present unite with 2 parts of hydrogen to form 18 parts of water, so that it is only the hydrogen over and above that required by the oxygen, that is available for the production of hydrocarbons.
In addition to an elementary analysis, much useful information relative to the suitability or non-suitability of any particular coal for gas-making purposes, may be obtained from a “proximate" analysis, which tells us the moisture, specific gravity, percentage of volatile matter, ash, and sulphur. The amount of moisture in coal is of importance. When Newcastle coal is carbonized, water is given off with the gas to the amount of about twelve gallons per ton, but the whole of this is not due to the chemical combination of the hydrogen and oxygen in the retort, but a portion of it (varying in the case of Newcastle coals from two to four gallons per ton) is due to the moisture held in mechanical combination by the coal. The presence of this moisture in
the retort is prejudicial for many reasons, as it reduces the heat of the retorts, increases the CO, in the gas, and liberates a portion of the sulphur, which would otherwise remain behind in the coke. The amount and nature of the ash, or clinker, is a very important factor in the choice of a coal. The ash in coal is purely inorganic, and generally consists of a variable mixture of silica, alumina, oxide of iron, and lime, the colour varying in Newcastle coals from a light cream to a brick red.colour. The red colour is due to oxide of iron, which indicates the presence of iron pyrites, and consequently of much sulphur in the coal. Coals of this description, i.e., coals yielding a red ash, destroy the furnace bars. Another important feature in the nature of the ash is whether a thick, pasty slag, or a thin, fluid slag is formed in the furnace. If a liquid clinker be the result, then the coke will be more easily worked in the furnace, and consequently be better adapted for keeping up the heats in the retorts.
The following is an analysis of the ash of a Newcastle . coal as given in Newbigging's "Handbook :
Per cent. Silica
59.56 Alumina
12:19 Peroxide of iron
15.96 Lime
9.99 Magnesia
1.13 Potash
1.17
100.00
The sulphur which is always present in coal, exists in many forms, generally combined with iron in the form of iron pyrites, sometimes as CaSO4, and more rarely in combination with organic elements. In common coals the sulphur that is present in the form of iron pyrites alone
affects the gas manufacturer, and in this condition it is either invisible, or is seen in the form of nodules, or in the yellow laminations known as “brasses."
The formula for iron pyrites is FeS2, and when it is heated in the atmosphere of hydrogen which exists in the retort, it loses half of its sulphur, which goes off into the gas as sulphuretted hydrogen (SH), carbon disulphide (CS,), and other sulphur compounds; but if moisture is present to any extent in the coal, the water acts upon the other atom of sulphur and sets the latter free also. It should be noted that the sulphur in caking coals generally is found as iron pyrites, while the sulphur in cannel coal occurs in some organic form. This organically combined sulphur is nearly all expelled in the process of carbonization, and unites very readily with carbon at the temperature usually met with in the retort, to form the impurity CS.
The amount of sulphur given off from a coal during distillation is not the same under all conditions, as it greatly depends upon the temperature at which the coal is distilled. It is with high heats, and at the end of the charge, that most of the sulphur, especially in the form of Cs, is given off. For an account of the gas-producing powers of the various descriptions of coal, the student should consult Newbigging's “ Handbook," or King's “ Treatise."
CHAPTER II.
CARBONIZATION
The construction of a retort or oven best adapted for the destructive distillation of coal—The setting of retorts and the construction of retort furnaces — The principles of combustion and their application to the working of retort-furnaces.
HE process by which gas is obtained from coal, is a
chemical operation known as destructive distillation, and technically called carbonization. The chemical changes which occur during the destructive distillation of coal are both numerous and interesting, and as it is very necessary for those engaged in the manufacture of gas to have a correct knowledge of the nature of such changes, it will be advisable, before proceeding further, to say a few words concerning what takes place in the retort when the coal is destructively distilled.
The greater part of the hydrogen of the original coal passes off, partly in combination with oxygen as aqueous vapour (H,0), and partly combined with carbon as marshgas (CH), and olefiant gas or ethylene (C.H.), together with smaller quantities of acetylene, benzol, and other hydrocarbons, while a portion passes off in the free state. The nitrogen of the coal is driven off, combined with hydrogen in the form of ammonia, and with carbon in the form of cyanogen; and the sulphur which is present in the original coal in the form of iron pyrites or “ brasses," is evolved in two forms, viz., as sulphuretted hydrogen (SH,), and as carbon bisulphide (CS.), and according to some authorities as SOz.Industrial Design.
Two very successful people approached us to design a powerful home that would reflect their personalities. This industrial design is our interpretation of their desires.
• 3 Bedroom: A beautiful master bedroom where the clients could wake up to the view of the water and 2 spare bedrooms for the kids to visit.
• 2.5 Bathrooms: 1 bathroom downstairs near the office as this is where the clients still spend a lot of time and an ensuite with powder room upstairs when it's time to entertain.
• Suspended Timber Floors: Due to the difficult construction restrictions of the sloping site and the client's budget, a suspended timber floor allowed us to create cost effectively.
• Basement Style Storage: Building on a sloping site usually results in wasted space under the house, however as the clients love to kayak and hike, this area was transformed into a functional training space and home for their two beautiful dogs.
• STATUS: Completed.
Designed by: Robert Forgione (Building Designer)The Campaign for Inclusive Care is resetting the conversation to include caregivers in their Veterans’ care from day one.
By giving providers the tools and training they need to include caregivers as part of the care team, this initiative is making inclusive care the standard of care across the Veterans Health Administration and, ultimately, at healthcare facilities nationwide. The goal is to improve outcomes for Veterans, their caregivers, and their healthcare providers.
Senator Elizabeth Dole is the nation’s leading voice on behalf of America’s military and Veteran caregivers. In 2012, she founded the Elizabeth Dole Foundation to raise awareness for these hidden heroes and advance initiatives to support them. Now, the Elizabeth Dole Foundation is partnering with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to ensure that caregivers are supported along one of the most important points of their journey: the healthcare setting.
A team of experts from Duke University and UT Health San Antonio have studied caregiver – clinician interactions and developed a 5-component model for Inclusive Care. In June 2019, the findings from phase I quality improvement efforts were published in Health Affairs, “Including Family Caregivers in Seriously Ill Veterans Care: A Mixed Methods Study.”
A Solutions Team of VA providers and healthcare professionals has developed system-level and practice-based solutions for Inclusive Care.
Based on research and provider input, we built the online Academy for Inclusive Care featuring training videos, educational materials and expert-created resources. The online Academy for Inclusive Care is live. Click here to take the courses. As part of our ongoing quality improvement initiative, we will be focusing on impact in three VISNs – VISN 10, VISN 17, and VISN 20.
The Campaign for Inclusive Care will be officially launched at all VA VISNs.
The Campaign for Inclusive Care will continue to build new resources for providers and explore opportunities to expand to other health systems and educational institutions.
Influencing Provider Knowledge
The Campaign for Inclusive Care will measure the effectiveness and influence of Academy courses and materials through pre- and post- course skills assessments and additional follow-on questionnaires administered by the program’s Quality Improvement Team, ensuring that providers understand inclusive care and how it applies to their particular practice.
Increasing Participation
The Campaign for Inclusive Care tracks participation at every step. From site visits to Academy of Inclusive Care course completions to resource downloads, we want to know how and where providers are using materials and learning about inclusive care.
Bettering the Caregiver Experience
Our Quality Improvement Team is working to understand caregiver perceptions of Inclusive Care and how their interactions with providers are changing. Our team is administering pre- and post- intervention surveys to caregivers nationwide as well as drilling down to the VISN level with interviews, targeted questionnaires and journal exercises to understand how the Campaign for Inclusive Care is influencing Veteran caregivers.

The Ducks tip off on November 9 in the 2k Classic Tournament in New York. As basketball fans, we love hype, we love potential and we love to wonder what would happen if hype and potential surpass our wildest expectations. This year’s Ducks squad enters this upcoming season with more hype and more potential than ever before as they look to not just capture their first PAC-12 championship in three seasons but bring home an NCAA tournament championship for the first time in eighty years.
This year is unlike any other in school history, as nine year head coach Dana Altman leads a loaded recruiting class that ranked second in the nation. The group is headlined by the fourth ranked player in the country, center, Bol Bol. Bol, the son of NBA veteran and one of the tallest professional players of all time, Manute Bol, stands a towering 7’2 and has over a nine foot wingspan. Bol Bol is coming into his potential one and done year with the Ducks as one of the elite defenders and rebounders in the country. Bol also has a nice mid-range game with the ability to step out and connect on three pointers as well. Early Ducks gossip has him being compared to former standout Chris Boucher but with a way higher ceiling and a more polished overall skill set.
Fellow McDonald’s All-American and five star recruit, Louis King, will join Bol. Scouts feel that King has the ability to become a dominating stretch-four or big wing, with excellent ball handling skills and a solid stroke that could create nightmare matchups for opponents. King is listed at 6.9” and has a 7-foot wingspan and teaming up with Bol and his length could create one of the most dominating frontcourts in the country on both ends of the floor.
The Ducks also landed point guard Will Richardson to help command the backcourt. The 6’5”, four-star recruit with excellent vision and pacing could be the perfect fit alongside Bol and King. Richardson enters his freshmen year with a solid outside shooting stroke from deep and great slashing to the hoop ability that can free up open shots for teammates on the outside.
Miles Norris will also join this group of top ranked freshmen to help in the frontcourt alongside King and Bol. Norris, four-star recruit, stands 6’8” and holds plenty of potential. Norris is not a huge physical force inside but provides a nice shooting touch with a high release point to enable him to shoot over smaller opponents. Scouts report that he is particularly dangerous when shooting from the elbow.
Rounding out this star-studded class of incoming freshmen is 6’8’ Francis Okoro. Okoro is physical and athletic, with over a 7-foot wingspan, and a chiseled and powerful frame; he will look to add depth and strength to both ends of the floor. Pairing him with Bol, King and Norris could create one of the most unstoppable frontcourts in the country. Okoro was a bit of a surprise recruit for the Ducks, as he reclassified his college status and was able to graduate high school a year early so he could be able to enter college.
Okoro reclassifying is the current trend to help fast track top recruits to enter the NBA quicker and younger. The process of reclassifying ones status was recently described by Jeff Borzello of ESPN, Borzello finds that the current top prospects want to find a way to the NBA by as young as possible because of the potential to make as much money as possible. This practice allows a player to complete high school at a younger age and be able to join the league as young as possible. Borzello describes the way reclassification works by allowing players to “repeat a grade and be a year older during the latter portion of their high school career and then reclassify back into their original class when they are ready to graduate.” This is what allowed Okoro to join to Ducks this year instead of next year. Coach Altman has had success with this kind of play before when he landed Dillion Brooks in 2014 and was one of the most impactful reason why the Ducks made the Final Four in 2017. Altman does not shy away from his comments about this when he.” Making Altman not afraid to recruit potential one-year only players and helping them reach their goals and full potential. This year’s class is his best example of that.
This year’s group of star studied freshmen could be one of the last several to have to play under the NBA’s current age limit rule that breads reclassifying practices. Earlier this month commissioner Adam Silver stated, “We’re ready to make that change” and wants to return to the days when top prospects could jump straight to the pros after high school. The rule is rumored to go into practice in 2021. The current rule forces top prospects to enter college for one year otherwise Oregon would never see the likes of Bol and King in a Ducks uniform as they would most likely jump to the pros instead.
The basketball junkie inside me doesn’t care about one and done players or the act of reclassifying players so they can be younger when they start their college and future NBA careers. I can’t get enough of the potential that this year’s Duck squad represents. On paper, they have the ability to win the PAC-12 tournament and move beyond their 2017 Final Four appearance and into the national title game. Altman will have a chance to develop and grow one of the most dominating frontcourts in school history and with help from senior Ehab Amin and junior Payton Pritchard to lead this group of young talented freshmen beyond potential and into achieved success. The way things look right now is anything less than a PAC-12 championship and a deep run in the NCAA tournament would be a bust for this potentially explosive, dominating group of young men.
Paul White is the Real Deal! #goducks been reported via an interview with Paul Brundage of Oxford Properties, in Property Week, that the company is considering taking space in its own property, the Leadenhall Building, also known as the Cheesegrater.
The property is currently around 70% let, a percentage that will increase if Oxford Properties takes over space in the building. The company, which represents the property aspect of Canadian pension fund Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS), is currently a tenant at 6 Finsbury Square, where there are two years left to run on the lease and a predicted lack of space in relation to the company’s needs in the near future.
Oxford Properties jointly developed the Leadenhall Building with British Land, and with the building’s architect Rogers Stirk Harbour & Partners confirming that it intends to take a floor of the building, the companies really will know the building inside out. The architects will be relocating from their current site at Thames Wharf Studios in Hammersmith, where they have been for 30 years.
However, Oxford Properties have other options, such as the St James’s Market development, currently under way in the West End, a partnership between Oxford and the Crown Estate. An alternative would be Mid City Place in Midtown, owned by Oxford Properties but currently fully let.
Other Leadenhall tenants currently include Servcorp, insurance broker Aon and insurance company Amlin.
An investigation by engineering company Arup has now been completed into the fractured bolts that occurred last year at the building, and the relevant at-risk bolts are being replaced..Party wall insulation from the experts
It is estimated that there are over 5 million (20%) homes in the UK built with a Party Wall Cavity. These 5 million homes are loosing heat to their neighbours.
If a party wall (the shared, dividing wall between properties) has been built with a cavity to help reduce the transfer of sound, it also allows cold air from outside to circulate. The result is both buildings lose warmth and cost more to heat.
A party wall sits outside the ‘thermal envelope‘ of attached buildings. Filling the cavity prevents cold air from outside transferring and circulating, which results in substantial warmth and energy savings. Sound insulation remains effective.
Alternate Energy is now able to provide Cavity Wall Insulation to ‘Party Walls’ making your home even more energy efficient.

It was an age of adventure and savagery. A time when Vikings piled into long ships”).
Most Viking swords fit within the Petersen Typology, described by Norwegian archaeologist Dr Jan Petersen. Petersen lived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and the result of his life’s work as a system of classification for the Viking Sword. The Peterson Typology traces the development of the Viking Sword throughout history, from its origins in the Roman Spatha to its eventual transition into the Medieval knightly weapon. The Darksword Armory Einar Viking Sword is based on later examples in the Petersen Typology from the 10th and 11th centuries – most closely resembling the Type U with its decorative hilt and long, broad, wide-fullered blade terminating in a classic spatulate tip. The knotwork on the cast bronze hilt and the carved oak handle is inspired by actual knotwork on historical Norse artifacts, and is one of the most intricate Viking designs we’ve ever attempted.
Viking swords were often status symbols, and as highly decorated as the Einar is one could assume its purpose to be decorative. Nothing could be further from the truth – hand-forged from 5160 high carbon steel and dual tempered, the Einar Viking Sword is a rugged weapon of choice. Its broad blade is resilient enough to perform the function that all Viking Swords were designed for – to cut through enemies, to split armor and shield, and to protect what the Viking warrior held dear. Despite its robust construction the Einar is surprisingly agile, able to move from cut to guard with smooth motions. In a practiced hand the Einar would be devastatingly effective on the battlefield..

Behold the emerald ash borer. This little sucker, albeit kind of pretty, is the John Wilkes Booth of beetles if you are an ash tree. Emerald ash borers are an exotic, invasive, wood-boring insects that infest and kill North American ash trees, both in forests and urban settings.
Why Trees In An Urban Setting Need Fertilization
There is a large contrast between trees that grow freely in forests and those that are placed into a chosen landscape. In forests, trees are naturally fertilized each year. Trees that grow in an urban setting are often deprived of natural fertilizers that come from decayed plant material.

When I saw one of Lynn's earlier posts on this project, the first glimpse of the sashing reminded me that I have been meaning to use that nine-patch sashing/setting in a quilt for quite some time. I used a variation of it in my Saturday Sampler quilt.
It dawned on me that it would make a good setting for a star block I saw at a quilt show, a variation on the Ohio Star block that I had been meaning to try. And I could make the whole thing in reds and greens, for a controlled scrappy Christmas quilt.
Here is my test block. Each block has 49 pieces but goes together fairly quickly (and I'm sure I'll get even faster with practice). The finished size is 10" square. It will be combined with pieced sashing that is 3" wide. I am thinking of a 20-block quilt, 4 by 5, with sashing and an outer border. But I could keep going and make it bed size; not sure yet.
I bought the background fabric, a subtle white snowflake on an off-white ground, but the rest of the fabrics came from stash. The greens are in the lime family, while the reds are true-red and bluish reds, to better work with the decor in our living room. After pulling fabric from my stash for this project, I realized I have enough for four or five quilts. But I won't be making them all right away!
Time to go make more blocks, and maybe think through a tutorial on this block.
What a great block! Love it!
WHat a georgeous quilt block! This quilt is going to be amzing !
Cathy, this block looks great! I can't wait to see your Christmas quilt, and I would love to link to a tutorial for this block if you end up posting one. Thanks for sharing!ISLAMABAD:
The culture of book reading received a strong show of support from the government, residents and prominent writers in Islamabad on Saturday as the National Book Foundation inaugurated a three-day celebration. The event is being held to mark the National Book Day, which is held on April 20 every year.
The festivities include a book fair, reading sessions with renowned writers and interactive activities for children. The programme is being held at the Pak-China Friendship Centre.
Around 100 booksellers and publishers from around the country are taking part in the book fair.
“There is an urgent need to reintroduce books to children. Books are the best way to lure today’s children away from video games and the Internet,” said a banker and local resident, Salman Baig.
Baig, who had brought both his primary school children to the event, said books impart real knowledge that children could easily reference in the future.
Prominent Urdu writer Intizar Hussain, recently selected as a nominee for the Man Booker Prize 2013, echoed Baig’s sentiments during the authors’ book reading festival, which is part of the programme.
“A story is not just for entertainment,” said Hussain, during a reading session of his famous book Basti. “It also invites you to think and understand.”
Literary critic and educationist Fateh Muhammad Malik spoke about a book of poems written by Nazir Naji, who is otherwise known for his journalistic writing. Malik said Naji’s poems had provoked philosophical questions about human existence.
“There has always been a limited segment of society that takes interest in reading. However, I believe this event can help stoke that interest,” said writer and poet Ataul Haq Qasmi.
One of the attractions at the festival was the presence of the Bright Star Mobile Libraries fleet, which comprises of three libraries-on-wheels.
Educationist Zareen Gandapur, a member of the fleet since its inception in 2010, said the libraries reached out daily to children studying at 17 Islamabad Model Schools across the federal capital’s rural areas.
“Most of these children do not have access to libraries. We are trying to educate them by providing books to promote their reading habits,” Gandapur said.
The mobile libraries team visits the public schools on a rotation basis and conducts reading sessions for children up to grade three. Books are lent to grade four and five students for the course of the day.
The mobile libraries are funded by the World Food Programme, the Asia Foundation with support from Department of Libraries, Gogi Studios and the San Francisco Library, Gandapur said.
Earlier, National Book Day celebrations had started with a book parade. Children from six private and public schools from the twin cities walked outside the Pak-China Friendship Centre whilst carrying banners and posters with messages promoting book reading.

Il Bussetto is a relatively young brand coming from an age old tradition.
Founded by Mauro Gobi in 2004, he opened the company in Milan after many years spent in the leather trade and production of leather goods. He was fascinated by a Tuscan craft technique allowing the production of small leather items by moulding over modes and devoid of any seams. These charming and unique products combine tradition and originality, while showing a high level of craftsmanship.
All the products are made from hand painted, vegetable tanned Tuscan leather. The belts are produced in Italy, while the other leather items are crafted in Thailand. Signor Gobi established a collaboration with a trusted local partner in order to train craftspeople from Thailand in Italy and maintain the level of handcrafted quality of the Tuscan heritage.As Saudi Arabia ends its blockade against the state of Qatar, flag carrier Saudia is set to resume service to Doha for the first time in three and a half years. The flight resumption is the result of six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member states signing a “solidarity and stability” agreement, referred to as the “al-Ula Statement,” on January 5th. Saudia will operate multiple flights per week to Doha from its Riyadh and Jeddah hubs.
Service details
The news was announced by Saudia via a post to its Twitter account, noting that service would begin on Monday, January 11th.
Looking at the airline’s booking service online, the details are as follows:
- Riyadh-Doha operates as flight SV540, departing at 16:40 and landing at 18:05. The return journey from Doha to Riyadh operates as SV541, departing at 19:10 and arriving at 20:45.
- Jeddah-Doha operates as flight SV542, departing at 10:50 and landing at 13:10. The return journey from Doha to Riyadh operates as SV543, departing at 14:15 and arriving at 17:00.
Flights between Riyadh and Doha will operate four times per week, while service from Jeddah will occur thrice weekly.
Deployed on both of these services will be Saudia’s short-haul fleet of Airbus A320 aircraft. The airline has 46 of these aircraft, 39 of which are in service, with the remaining seven listed as parked.
The jets have four configurations:
- The most common configuration is a high-density layout with 12 business, 132 economy. These jets are among the newest A320s in the Saudia fleet,
- There are also two low-density layouts with 90 business and 90 economy, as well as 90 business, 96 economy,
- And finally, nine older A320s offer 12 business, 120 economy.
Ending the blockade
While most service resumption announcements these days are related to the global health crisis, this recent announcement marks the end of the “Middle East blockade,” which had been ongoing for the past three and a half years.
Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates had formed a coalition that imposed a blockade against Qatar in June 2017, suspending diplomatic relations and cutting off border access. The main reason given for the blockade was Qatar’s alleged support for terrorism – something the country has firmly denied.
While the blockade was certainly an inconvenience for Qatar’s national airline, Qatar Airways, the carrier was far from crippled. In fact, the airline’s revenue actually grew during part of the blockade, and its CEO had even boasted about the resiliency of the company in 2019, saying,
“We lost 18 destinations overnight, and lost a $1.75 billion market but we didn’t shy from our expansion. We replaced the 18 destinations lost with 20 destinations and kept on receiving our airplanes. Then we also kept on planning our expansions.
It’s likely that Qatar Airways will benefit more from the blockade’s ending as it offers a larger network and a higher-rated level of inflight service. However, the resumption of flights for Saudia will be welcomed news for those with business and family connections between the two nations.Fifield's Blueberry Crumb Cobbler

There’s nothing that inspires more fear-driven respect than seeing a bunch of burly, angry bikers approaching your adorable little “protest.” No matter how much you believe in whatever is written on that unoriginal sign you’re holding, you step out of the way when you see they’re coming through.
Which is exactly what happened during the inauguration on Friday, when a wall of protestors refused to let supporters of the new President through to the inauguration.
The video is simply magical.
Trending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet
I don’t know what it is with liberal protestors and the need to block roads and keep people from getting where they need to go, but that is a trend that should have been left in 2016.
While innocent people were headed to the inauguration of President Donald Trump, a line of protestors formed a human chain, preventing them from passing. The bikers weren’t having it.
You can see in the video that these men were having to physically pull people through the protestors in order to get them into the event. Turns out a bunch of grass-munching wimps aren’t much of a match for a large biker. Who would have guessed?
Watch the video below:
Don’t you love how the little snowflake yelled “You’re on camera!” as if that was supposed to make the biker tuck his tail between his legs and run?
What’s interesting is that they also have a group of protesters illegally preventing people from freely traveling to a lawful destination.
Clearly we’re not dealing with MENSA members.

In pursuance of its contract with the Chennai governing body, the contractor had to submit Performance and Advance Payment Guarantees in order to avail advances that would allow it to commence any work.
Blend analysed and understood the transaction and helped the contractor raise the required guarantees from an Indian bank backed by AA rated insurance companies. A commendable achievement in the backdrop of the pandemic crisis. The single guarantee was to the tune of USD 30 mn under surety bonds, but Blend overcame every single complexity to ensure the consortium could proceed with this vital project.Sharetribe Theme Development

The blinking cursor can feel like a writer’s worst enemy. The more you try, the more elusive the words are. It feels like your brain is blocked. You have self-diagnosed yourself with the dreaded writer’s block. And the longer that cursed cursor blinks at you, the longer you wonder if you’ll ever find a way of overcoming writer’s block.
Luckily, though I don’t know who came up with the term, writer’s block isn’t really real. However, the more you obsess about being afflicted with it, the more it may try to hang on to you.
1. Get Clear
Table of Contents
A lot of times writer’s block happens because we don’t know what we are writing for. We just think we need to write but there is not target. It’s the same thing as when we don’t know what our destination is. We plain can’t get there because there’s not path to get there.
Get clear on how you want your reader to think, how you want them to feel and what you want them to do after they’re done reading. Then you can reverse engineer what you want to talk about.
Also, get clear on what you want out of your writing too. What’s the purpose of it? To get clients? Make people feel inspired? To be seen as an expert in your industry?
2. Let Go of Perfection
As Seth Godin says, it’s our unwillingness to write bad sentences or fail that gives us writer’s block. We are afraid to be judged. We think we aren’t good writers. But the thing is, if you can talk, you can write. You do it all the time without even thinking about it. So write like you talk. Think about how you would have a conversation with your friend over coffee.
Remember that there’s an editing phase (but do not edit as you go or you’ll be stuck editing chapter 1 twenty times before you move on). So go ahead and flub up your grammar and sentences. Be ok with potentially not making sense. After it’s edited, either by you or a professional, you’ll be able to modify it as much as you’d like to make your book meaningful.
When you realize that your bigger mission is to help people with your book, your ego can get out of the way. It’s not about how good you look. It’s about how many people are waiting for your help, needlessly struggling because you’re too scared to show up. Are you willing to show up a little messy for the greater good?
3. Portion Out Your Topics
I remember when I was a teenager and my mom would tell me to clean my room. It felt like such a mountain of a task because you could barely see the floor. I didn’t want to do it so I procrastinated. Then I came up with all sorts of reasons not to do it like, “I don’t have time.”
If you can take your main topics, create subtopics and then create subtopics from those if necessary, each part will feel much smaller. It will make it easier to tackle and you’ll also feel like you’re finally accomplishing something when you finish each part.
Using these steps, I was able to write my last book in under a week. I wrote about it in How to Write a Book in 4 Days if you’d like to check it out.

United Front Braun Beer is a traditional German Kellerbier co-created and co-brewed by Ralf Pittroff of Vancouver Island Brewery and Peter Schulz of Steel & Oak Brewing. In a press release, the brewers gave their thoughts on the beer and the collaborative process behind it:
“Peter and I share the view of using quality ingredients to brew old world styles. We came up with the idea to do the Braun bier from one of Peter’s own recipes, and adapted to a production level,” said Pittroff. “It wasn’t a difficult decision. I loved the idea of brewing a German style that hasn’t seen much development in North America even as craft beer becomes increasingly popular.”
S&O’s brewmaster agreed. “I think a Braun bier was the perfect style to create,” said Schulz. “With both Ralf and I coming from German brewing backgrounds it was a great opportunity to brew this historical German style lager. I can’t wait for people to try it.”
United Front is being launched this week in 650 ml bottles at select private liquor stores, with distribution to BC Liquor locations to follow soon. It will also be available at several events during Vancouver Craft Beer Week..

Ultra Music Festival came under fire when it announced that the 22nd edition will be postponed to 2021 and there will be no refunds for tickets purchased for the return to Bayfront Park planned for next weekend. After discussing options together with the administration of the city of Miami last week, it was announced on Friday that Ultra Miami will be postponed to next year but did not make any further statements until Monday after as to what the options for ticket holders are.
When they sent out e-mails to ticketholders on Monday, that there won’t be any refunds for this year’s ticket holders, but rather benefits like their ticket being valid for either 2021 or 2022, discounts on additional tickets, amongst others, while other events are offering full refunds due to cancellations because of the current Coronavirus pandemic, fans felt betrayed by the Ultra and took their frustration across social media platforms, like Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter.
However, the e-mails appeared to confirm that Ultra will be taking place in Miami for the next 2 years, but this may not be a safe bet just yet.
Aaron Leib, Reporter for the Miami Herald, a local Miami newspaper with a great track of record when it comes to Ultra Music Festival related news, tweeted that Mayor Suarez and the city will be supporting Ultra in Miami through 2022 as a compromise to cancel this year’s event. However, the commission does not appear to be standing with the mayor on this as he received multiple pushbacks from commissioners. Following up on this, the decision not to give refunds was based on the support through 2022 by the mayor, an Ultra representative said.
Ultra Music Festival in Miami is the flagship event of Ultra Worldwide, taking place since 1999, and is attracting thousands of people to Miami every year for the main event, as well as Miami Music Week and Winter Music Conference.
We’re confident that we will see an Ultra Music Festival flagship next year, and are hoping for it to be in Miami, however, only time will tell. Check out Aaron’s tweets below and we will keep you posted about the developments.
An Ultra rep says this is partly because, in choosing not to give ticket refunds, the festival is offering buyers tickets to either the 2021 or 2022 event.
Hold our feet to the fire and cancel if we don't live up to our promises, he says, but don't cancel without cause.

WASHINGTON – Most American fourth- and eighth-graders lack basic skills in math and reading, despite record high scores on a national exam.
Yes, today’s students are doing better than those who came before them. But the improvements have come at a snail’s pace.
The 2013 Nation’s Report Card released Thursday finds that the vast majority of students still are not demonstrating solid academic performance in either math or reading. Stubborn gaps persist between the performances of white children and their Hispanic and African-American counterparts, who scored much lower.
Overall, 42 percent of fourth-graders and 35 percent of eighth-graders scored at or above the proficient level in math. In reading, 35 percent of fourth-graders and 36 percent of eighth-graders hit that mark.
In Iowa and Washington state, scores increased except in eighth-grade math..
Inching upward
The results come from the National Assessment of Educational Progress, George.
States-led standards
Meanwhile, a majority of states are rolling out Common Core State Standards with the goal of better preparing students for college or a job. The states-led standards establish benchmarks for reading and math and replace goals that varied widely rose with the exception of fourth grade reading.
Specifically pointing to Tennessee, Hawaii and D.C., Education Secretary Arne Duncan said fourth.Smoother netplay, stronger Sinbad!
Super Tilt Bro. 2.0-alpha4
What's new in the game?
Sinbad's gameplay reworked
Sinbad is now way more interesting to play. Focus points are to improve his recovery, fix weird behaviors, and reward skilled player.
First notable change, Sinbad now has a wall jump. It comes in addition to his double jump, and can be done while in helpless fall. The wall jump is a lot more than a simple bonus jump, doing it in helpless means you can chain a second up-special or forward-special after cancelling your helpless fall. Sinbad's recovery is greatly improved, and allow off-stage mind-game as this opens a lot of recovery options. Edge guarding is also safer now.
And he keeps his double jump!
Another big change is the grounded special. It was a first draft of the move that never got the love it deserves. In its old state it had a frame-1 hitbox, and weird momentum behavior, making it overpowered in some ways while unexpectedly weak in others. Now it has a big startup time, and cancels momentum. It is a finish move, requiring anticipation to place correctly but very rewarding.
So powerful!
Airborn special is now cancellable into helpless by pressing B again. Allowing for slightly speedier fall speed, and wall jump. The spike of side special is now stronger. Finally, Sinbad bot has been updated to use wall jumps for recovery.
Kiki's counter slide
Kiki's special is a counter strike. While in counter's animation Kiki retained her momentum in a strange way: only horizontal momentum while on ground. She could slide long distances when countering at the end of a jump. It is changed by having reduced ground friction, so she can still slide, in a more natural way.
This is post-patch, before she would have slide beyond platform's limit.
Better netplay
Connection quality of both players is displayed briefly before starting an online game.
The game has been optimized to be able to rollback more frames, improving netplay on unstable connections. More details on the technical parts of this release note.
What's new under the hood?
Fixed server
Rollback netcode is something notoriously hard. The smaller the game system, the harder it is to rollback frames. Some says that it is impossible to do it on the Switch, because its lack of computing power. Don't listen to them, nothing is impossible, but that's hard. The NES, with its 2 KB of RAM, and its 1.5 Mhz CPU is far beyond minimal specs. The server helps notably with memory management, sending checkpoints so the NES does not have to keep them in memory. The NES receives opponent's inputs with an associated checkpoint to rollback from if necessary.
This solution requires the server to be able to compute the game's state to create those checkpoints. It was originally done by reimplementing the game's logic in C++ (the language of the server), since the game itself is made of 6502 assembly which is not compilable for modern CPUs. Maintaining two completely different implementations of the same logic was terribly time-consuming, and led to inconsistencies between the game and the server.
Now the server embeds a very lite emulator, able to emulate game's logic from the ROM. This solution is slower than the C++ implementation but is guaranteed to be consistent with game's code, it is game's code. The biggest part has been to make it reasonably speedy, the original emulator came without specific optimization. Detailing how to optimize a 6502 emulator would require a full article, here are some hint: avoid a maximum function pointers, avoid branching, and recompile what you can. Easier said than done, if you want a more detailed history of my progress, here is a real-time twitter thread of the optimizations done:
Optimized client
The NES has checkpoints on hand when needed, but it still needs to rollback frames. That means, playing multiple frames worth of gameplay on the time allocated to only one frame. Playing a frame worth of gameplay has to be lightning fast. In this version the code has been optimized exactly for that reason.
The first step was to create tools. Believe it or not, 1980's systems have terrible profiling tools compared to modern systems. Thankfully, emulators are extremely versatile nowadays. With some scripting we can output the game's code annotated with the time consumed by each line, or even flamegraphs.
Each rectangle is a function. The larger the rectangle, the most time spent in the function.
With that tooling, and good knowledge of the code, it is easy to spot bottlenecks. Some were simply old code that became critical, other required little refactoring. Everything considered, the hardest part was to make tools. With good tools, optimization is straightforward.

Toxic: The rotting underbelly of the Tasmanian salmon industry by Richard Flanagan
by James Boyce •
Inga Clendinnen: Selected writing edited by James Boyce
by Tom Griffiths •
Richard Flanagan's new work, Toxic, is a startling exposé on Tasmania's salmon farming industry. From genetically altered 'frankenfish' to the use of dangerous chemicals to turn 'dead-grey flesh a marketable red', the industrial machinations uncovered in Flanagan's new work are stomach-churning. As James Boyce writes in his review, 'After the publication of Toxic, I doubt Tasmania will ever be the same again.'... (read more)

- Elderly people suffer due to deficient publicly provided health, education and transport facilities
There has been considerable public discussion in recent months about the need to find a meaningful and real alternative to the existing two mainstream political formations in Sri Lanka. Yet, the people in the country are yet to see a clear vision and a cohesive program of the proposed political alternative. In this brief article, an attempt is made to articulate a possible vision and a program to be discussed and considered by relevant parties in the next weeks and months.
Against the backdrop of persisting political turmoil, chronic uncertainties and a deep sense of insecurity felt by the vast majority of people, what is urgently needed is to identify a clear path along which the country should move forward to meet the legitimate aspirations of diverse segments of society. Given the serious economic, social, cultural, political and environmental issues that have evolved over a period of time, the country needs to find alternative ways to address various issues that have remained largely unresolved due to past policy failures. In the remainder of this article, I outline some alternative strategies that can be adopted to have a clear break from the past in the five areas mentioned above.
As is well known, Sri Lanka’s economy today is highly distorted, tilting heavily towards services. Productive sectors like agriculture, urban and rural industry and artisan production have either stagnated or declined. Many rural people have migrated to cities or overseas for casual employment. Continual exodus of labour, the decline of productive sectors, a continually widening trade gap and mounting public debts have generated inflationary pressures that make life miserable for an increasing proportion of population. While income distribution has become highly unequal, rural urban disparities have widened. Meanwhile, the informal sector of the economy has expanded and living and working conditions of people dependent on the informal sector remain precarious.
The above state of the economy demands a major effort to restructure it in order to diversify all sectors, create productive employment in all parts of the country and reduce inflationary pressures. Both domestic and foreign capital should also be diverted into production-oriented ventures outside the major urban centres. The development of social infrastructure such as quality health and education facilities outside major cities is critically important to facilitate decentralized development in the country. What should be noted here is that the concentration of wealth and people in and around urban centres is not socially and environmentally sustainable.
Increasing economic and social pressures arising out of the above economic conditions have created precarious working and living conditions for a majority of people in the country. Growing spatial mobility of people of all walks of life has weakened family and community life leading to vulnerabilities among children, youth, the poor, the differently-abled and the elderly. Increasing significance of privately funded education, transport and health services have given rise to a sense of relative deprivation among low income people. While formal systems of social protection such as pensions and Employees Provident Funds cover only a minority of economically active people, others are exposed to economic and social risks and vulnerabilities. Many elderly people continue to engage in employment way beyond retirement age due to the lack of old age pensions or productive assets. Many such people also suffer due to the deficient publicly provided health, education and
transport facilities.
The conditions outlined above show that the social system is increasingly polarised and unjust. Emergent social conditions are at variance with the widely held egalitarian values in the country. A range of social policies are needed to address the issues involved and create a sense of social justice and equity among socially marginalised people in the country.
By the time the British rulers left Sri Lanka following nearly one hundred and fifty of years of colonial rule, the country had already become a centralised parliamentary democracy.
"Emergent social conditions are at variance with the widely held egalitarian values in the country. A range of social policies are needed to address the issues involved and create a sense of social justice and equity among socially marginalised people in the country"
Yet, the social and cultural policies adopted by the colonial rulers had prevented the emergence of a unified citizenry. Ethnic, linguistic and religious divisions were already part of the social, cultural and political landscape. Highly unequal education system during the colonial period continued to reproduce social and cultural divisions in the country. Poor and basic educational facilities in rural areas did not help transform the largely marginalised rural population into a citizenry with a modern social and cultural outlook. Such people remained wedded to a traditional way of life connected to a largely subsistence oriented rural economic pursuits, and their world views and lifestyles were very much shaped by traditional beliefs and archaic religious and ritual practices.
Given the lack of access to modern educational facilities and mass media in rural areas, most rural inhabitants remained cut off from the influence of modern urban industrial cultures. Though a tiny anglicised, privileged post-colonial elite had emerged in urban areas, thanks to the emerging colonial economy dominated by plantation production, import and export trade, service industries, etc. , the vast majority of people remained wedded to parochial, traditional rural cultures of several ethno-religious communities. This cultural pattern continued after independence due to post- independence cultural policies that prevented the formation of an overarching mainstream national culture suited to a modern, secular democratic society.
Though Sri Lanka became a centralised parliamentary democracy under the British rule, the vast, remote rural hinterland remained weakly integrated with the Centre due to poor transportation and communication infrastructure. This situation was also conducive for the perpetuation of strong regional, ethnic and religious identities. Following independence, such identities became even stronger due to cultural, language and educational policies adopted by post-independence regimes. It is this situation that paved the way for competition among ethno-religious groups for political power and public resources such as land, employment and business opportunities. Such competition eventually led to anti-state, violent political campaigns including the armed struggle in the north and east for a separate State that ended in 2009 with the defeat of the LTTE.
Though there have been some efforts over the last few decades to institutionalise a more decentralised political structure in the country, mostly centralised nature of the State remains. Provincial and local government institutions remain weak and poorly resourced. Many functions that can be easily and more fruitfully carried out at local and provincial levels remain with the central government. The result is a top heavy administration that controls much of the country’s public finances and other resources, often leading to wastage, corruption and inefficiency. The distribution of public resources through political party based networks of patron-client relationships has made the situation worse as this has given rise to political favouritism and discrimination, preventing the emergence of a unified citizenry with equal rights and life chances.
Economic, social and political conditions outlined above have not been conducive to the sustainable management and use of natural resources of the country. Fragmentation of land, unplanned human settlements, implementation of development projects in a haphazard manner, over-exploitation of natural resources, pollution and degradation of the environment, etc. have been the result. Natural and human induced hazards such as flooding, land slides, soil erosion, pollution of water resources, human -animal conflict, droughts, etc. pose serious threats to livelihoods and well-being of people in almost all parts of the country.
Successive governments that ruled the country over the last several decades are
largely responsible for the above state of affairs. Their failure or refusal to adopt evidence-based policies to deal with issues in the five areas mentioned above, namely, the economy, social system, culture, political system and the environment, has been the main reason for the deterioration of economic, social, cultural, political and environmental conditions.
These governments were led by the mainstream political parties that have not shown any readiness to change their policies and governance styles. Given this situation, people in the country have to opt for a viable political alternative outside the political mainstream. There are already growing signs of a clear readiness on the part of a majority of people to look for such an alternative.
Such an alternative path has become critically important today as the economic, social, cultural, political and environmental challenges facing the country demands a holistic and rational approach to development, public welfare and peace in the country. Such an approach is already outlined in the Sustainable Development Vision 2030, a policy document prepared by an independent expert committee.Iranian FM underscores IAEA role in final nuclear deal Iranian FM underscores IAEA role in final nuclear deal ۱۳۹۴/۰۲/۰۸ - ۱۲:۱۷ ۱۳۹۴/۰۲/۰۸ - ۱۲:۱۷ Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) can play a more active role to facilitate the conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear deal between Tehran and the G5+1 group.

KEYSVILLE – This summer, the Virginia Rural Center is excited to welcome a new team member on board. Chandler Vaughan, a Charlotte County Virginia native, has developed a passion for addressing rural issues through his childhood and college experiences. For twelve weeks this summer, Vaughan will serve as the Virginia Rural Center Fellow, providing input on rural issues, planning events, representing the center and rural Virginia in meetings, and assisting in other center functions.
“We are thrilled to have Chandler Vaughan join our staff as a fellow. As a native of rural Virginia, Chandler's knowledge, enthusiasm and experience will allow him to make an immediate contribution to our organization as we continue to work towards advancing economic development and prosperity throughout rural Virginia,” said Kristie Helmick Proctor, Executive Director of the Virginia Rural Center.
“To provide friends at college and outside of my home county with scope of how rural we are, I proudly tell them that Charlotte County is home to about 12,000 people and 18,000 cows. The town I grew up in, Keysville, is the largest in the county, with a population of around 800,” said Vaughan. “I grew up and still work on our family’s beef cattle farm. The farm is a part of the larger agriculture and forestry industry in the county, which serves as one of the top three employers in Charlotte County, along with the school system and sheriff’s office.”
Vaughan graduated from Virginia Tech in December 2018 with a Bachelor’s Degree in Agricultural Business. He is currently a graduate student at Appalachian State University in North Carolina where he studies public administration with an emphasis on rural economic development. “If I truly wanted to understand rural issues, I needed to attend a rurally focused college in a relatively rural area. Appalachian State checked all those boxes,” Vaughan said. “I am also fortunate to have a rurally based research assignment at Appalachian State where I study how communities collectively govern the New River’s ecosystem health”
The Rural Center is not Vaughan’s first experience in state-level government, also serving as a Governor’s Fellow in the Secretariat of Agriculture and Forestry last summer. When asked about the experience, Vaughan was grateful. “The Governor’s Fellows Program provided a great ground-level view of the functions within the Governor’s Office, especially those within the Secretariat of Agriculture and Forestry. One of the most memorable experiences of the summer was attending the opening of a bourbon cooperage and stave mill in Smyth and Washington Counties, which will bring 160 jobs to the rural region.”
The Rural Center is excited to have another contributor to work towards advancing economic development, job creation, workforce development, education, infrastructure, healthcare and other vital initiatives for the prosperity of rural Virginia.
“My interest areas align greatly with the rural center’s mission. Broadband and increased, high-speed internet access is the first key for rural prosperity. When I talk to my friends from home and other rural areas in Virginia, most plan, or are forced, to move to an urban area to find employment after college, trade school, or high school. With telecommuting becoming increasingly popular, we must be able to provide the current and next generation with access to high speed internet,” Vaughan said. “Hand-in-hand with broadband access expansion is a need for greater attention on education, especially career and technical education, vital to job attainment, workforce development, and other aspects of economic development. I am looking forward to learning more and contributing to the rural center’s efforts this summer!”Waiting for the Dust to Settle
Waiting for the Dust to Settle
I took a little bit of a blogging break, simply because I haven’t had the time lately. We spent 4 wonderful days visiting the wild horses, and since we got back I have been sifting through thousands of images, editing, printing, and working with Al on the mixed media photography pieces for the upcoming art shows. (More on that next week)
I have however been hanging out on Instagram, and the Tales from the Back Road facebook page a lot. I would love to have you join me, in either place as I will always be posting more stuff there.
I have also been waiting for the dust to settle from last weeks election, and I have some observations on all that.
I’ve seen people rocked to their core with disbelief, and disgust at the man who won the white house. I have also seen supporters of Hillary spewing mean, and hateful comments at the people who voted for him. I am also seeing a middle class that thinks they might, maybe be heard now. The worst part is the senseless violence that has erupted. Protests, name calling, and bullying, coming from both sides of the political fence. It’s disgraceful.
But the most positive thing I have noticed, is people are wanting to be involved in their country, and the decision making again. America is great because people have always stood up for what they believed in, spoke out when something needed changing, or a wrong needed to be set right. That is what this country was founded on more than 200 years ago, and some of the greatest changes were brought about in the same way.
In my small circle of friends, both on and off the internet, people are vowing to be more involved in issues that concern them either personally, locally, or on a national level. This is good! This is what America is all about, and what we need to stay strong and united. Voicing your opinion in a positive, and constructive manner is the way to bring about the changes you personally care about.
For me, my greatest concerns are the environment, and all the creatures that inhabit this planet. I love, and need the wide open spaces, the quite and solitude that only the wild can provide. It may surprise you to learn that I am a very anxious person. Too many people, too busy of a world, and I can be thrown into a full blown panic attack. This is not a fun thing for me, and escaping to nature is like balm for my soul. Listening to nothing but the wind, or the animals, brings me peace, and the thought of losing that…well I panic.
I want to fight to keep the public land, public. I want to help the wild horses, and all wild animals stay free and safe from harassment.
A perfect example was this last time we visited the horses. All we wanted to do was spend a few days visiting with them. We arrived at their house on Thursday evening, only to find they had been invaded by a couple thousand smelly cows. It’s like having a bunch of rude, destructive, horrible people invade your house and force you into the far reaches of the back bedroom because you have to get away from them. The main body of the herd was certainly more scattered, and they were much harder to find. We were quite upset, and it hurts my heart to think of those cows ruining the horses domain. This is exactly what I’m afraid of everywhere. The almighty dollar, being more important than clean land, air, and water. Public land being handed over to big oil and gas, or handed to the highest bidder.
For my part, I am going to donate 15% from every sale of wild horse photos sold on Mary Hone Photography to American Wild Horse Preservation Campaign. They are the biggest advocates for wild horses in the nation. They go before congress to argue against bills that would harm the horses, they have people on scene at every round up to report on what happens. They are a huge voice for wild horses, and I want to help them in my own small way.
My hope is that the country can move forward in a positive, and united way. That we can all just be…..Americans.
Not been an easy week to understand…let the dust settle. Well it is nearly 6 months since the upheaval of Brexit here in the UK and that dust just will not settle. We are still wondering where all the hatred and intolerance came from expressed by many hitherto rational people. I do think that politicians everywhere have to wake up to the fact that people no longer trust them, they have to listen and respond. But above all else people want and need to be able to be recognised as individuals not grouped together on block and treated as a statistic. Next they have to recognise that austerity does not work particularly when it is the working and middle classes that face the austerity measures whilst watching the selfish corporates get richer. Maybe globalisation in its current formulation doesn’t help. Wounds will take time to heal (that old saying about stick and stones and names isn’t true…it hurts for some). The only clear fact is that in the UK and the USA there has been a change but a change that has yet to be implemented. Keep smiling
Thanks so much for your insight from the other side of the pond. You bring up some great points, that are certainly relevant for both issues. I wish the people that were talking about peace and harmony would get as much press as the negative people. We have to outnumber them, right? It is an upheaval, and I am waiting with fingers crossed that everything will somehow turn out OK.
Dearest Mary,
So much to say here, but I will say that I agree with you 100%.
Nature brings me peace. The horses, well, you know how I feel about them. (AND, I somehow missed any announcement on a winner of the horse print???)
Then there was this week. I was rocked emotionally more than I thought I’d be, and so many questions and feeling running rampant not just in my mind, but for my students. And our world is being rocked, however; like you said here, some good things are seeping out of all this turmoil. I like many others, are beginning to understand that WE must become more involved in some way to make a difference within our own lives, community and in the world at large.
I too have quit my blog and Instagram is where I’ll be now always to share my work. I will see you there dear friend.
Anita it must be hard for you, and every other educator out there to explain all the turmoil to your students. How do you explain to young minds that the world is off it’s rocker, but they need to stay calm and focused. And the giveaway was won by Taryn, so sorry the randomizer didn’t pick your name this time.
P.S. THESE PHOTOS ARE AWESOME!
Your photography has become so amazing in such a short time, you can be really proud. It’s great to take a break from things. We post regularly on the blog, but we also rotate around the social media thing. Sometimes we are into Instagram, sometimes Pinterest, variety is what keeps it interesting. We stay out of politics, it is a circus and we don’t need that. It is just sad with the violence that goes on as it serves no purpose.
Thanks for the compliment on my photography! I really appreciate that. Ya, politics is something I usually pay scant attention to.
Very tempting to just ride into the sunset at this point. Much better idea to contribute to the things which matter to us; really appreciate that you’re donating proceeds from your sales to help the horses!
I guess it comes down to the easy way, or the hard way. But I guess the hard way is usually better in the end.
Hello, gorgeous horses and awesome photos. Happy Monday, enjoy your new week!
I hope your wish comes true… it is the time we all should stay together …
you are an artist and sometimes I think you have a magic cam :o) I love the photos and if I see this wonderful horses, I have the wild horses song of belinda carlisle in my mind… think I sing it to the pup in an endless loop, he dug two holes today and that’s his punishment LOL
It is the time to stay together, hopefully more and more people all over the world will see that.
Love these magnificent photos, Mary. So much strikes me about each one but I don’t want to ramble on. You are so blessed to be spending your life away from the noise and crowds, I understand how you feel. I love the peace I find in the woods, and I feel particularly drawn to them during times of unrest. It’s not a solution, but it is a way of refreshing my mind and spirit so I can return more productive. And I agree – we need unity and understanding, not violence and finger-pointing. Of any type.
When we can be out, and away, I am my happiest. My brain just needs a break.
you TOTALLY ROCK on EVERY LEVEL!!!!! Beautiful example, and gorgeous photos!
Thanks Caren!!
Dear Mary,
Your thoughts and insights on this week hit a bullseye! The violent protests from the people who did not support Trump need to stop immediately! Protesting is a good thing, when done in a peaceful way. With the destruction of property, the message is easy to disregard and ignore. On the other side, the hate directed at liberals, Native Americans, Latinos, African Americans and women is deplorable. Really? This is what our country believes? The current and new leaders need to step up and lead. I love the way you are giving back!!! Thank you for donating to the American Wild Horse Preservation Campaign. Everything helps! And, yes, we all can make a difference! Each in on our own way….we are stronger together ☺.
Love You, Candy
Thanks Candy. I do believe that the majority of the people in this country are good, and kind, and want peace for everyone. Sadly, the news only reports the violence and the meanness, making it look like we are all that way. We are stronger, and louder together when we put our voices together for peace. Love you too.
Agreed!

It’s been a really rough election season. I (stupidly) thought it would get better after the election but I think it’s about 100X worse. You are right though – it is encouraging to see folks getting behind the things they believe in. Good for your for supporting public lands. I am going to look into various groups and decide which to support. There are so many groups now that need support and so many I want to support but I need to try to figure out which are the best/most effective. I think I’ll feel a bit better about things once I feel like I’m helping – even if it’s just in my own small way.
It is 100 times worse, it’s all just crazy and discouraging. But yes, find a small way to help a cause you love. Every little bit helps!
This is a wonderful post, Mary, very well said. I’d gotten away a little bit from donating to conservation and nature organizations, thanks for the reminder that they are going to need us more than ever now. I feel the same way as you do about nature, I don’t think I could breathe without it. I also share your feelings and worries about the election, and how we should be reacting to it. We not only need to hope for the best, but do our best to have our voices heard.
Thanks, I’m glad you liked it. And I’m glad it reminded you we need to support our causes.
Yes, Mary, too many people fail to see the bottom line such as yourself. Too many people focus on hatred, preying on the weaknesses of others. A lot of people need to wake up and realize what matters!! Your wild horses matter…I am glad to hear you support them!!…:)JP
Focusing on hatred will get this country nowhere, fast. How do we get everyone to wake up, that’s the big question.
By doing just what you are doing! It is so unlikely that any of us will rise up to save the world by ourselves, but these simple acts: supporting a cause that is important to you, asking questions of someone you disagree with and REALLY listening to the answers, treating every single person with respect and compassion, speaking out against hate-that is how we change the world. And staying informed! Gads, I have been the worst at that. I am now receiving the newsletters from all my elected officials and I will be reading them. I have emailed them all to introduce myself and I will continue to let them know what issues are important to me. You know, I am finding it sort of ironic that 8 years ago Obama won largely as a Washington outsider and on a campaign of change. If I can truly listen to why so many people voted for Trump (besides the ones that really do believe in white supremacy) they also wanted an outsider and change. Ok, the people have spoken. Let’s change this two party system and get it working again! Just my opinion ☺.Sessions

Imperva CEO steps down following breach investigation
Chris Hylen unexpectedly stepped down as CEO of Imperva in the wake of a data breach involving cloud WAF customer data, though it's unclear if the two events are connected.
Imperva CEO Chris Hylen resigned as of Oct. 21, less than two weeks after the company's latest update into a data breach that occurred in August.
It is unclear if the data breach had anything to do with Hylen stepping down, but the timing leads to questions. Imperva first learned of the security incident on Aug. 20. In the breach, cloud web application firewall customer data was stolen, including email addresses, hashed and salted passwords, and API keys and SSL certificates for some.
In an update regarding the breach posted Oct. 10, Imperva CTO Kunal Anand admitted the breach occurred because an internal instance was left exposed, allowing a malicious actor to steal an AWS API key which was then used to access a database snapshot with user data.
It is unclear how many customers were affected, but Anand said remediation efforts led to customers changing "more than 13,000 passwords, rotating over 13,500 SSL certificates, and regenerating over 1,400 API keys."
Hylen reportedly turned in his resignation 11 days later and the company did not have a replacement ready. Imperva chairman of the board Charles Goodman will be acting CEO while a search is conducted for a permanent replacement.
According to a statement given to tech news site CTech, which first reported Hylen's resignation, it was a mutual decision between Hylen and the Thoma Bravo board for him to step down as Imperva CEO.
Thoma Bravo completed an acquisition of Imperva in January. At the time of the acquisition, Imperva wrote in a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that Hylen would stay on as CEO. In that same filing, Goodman was named to the board.
Hylen was made president and CEO of Imperva in August 2017.Campaign details

See how this car scored on our sister site DrivingElectric Straight after launch it began to appear outside upmarket addresses, sharing driveway space with Ferraris and Porsches. This is clear to see when you get inside – a huge 17-inch display, portrait-orientated like a tablet computer, dominates the dashboard and controls much of the car’s standard equipment, including its ‘autopilot’ semi-autonomous driving mode. It doesn't look likely to go anywhere soon either, with Tesla instead confirming it will seek to revamp its existing saloon into the foreseeable future.
The rest of the Tesla’s interior is plush and well appointed, although not to a standard that takes it beyond its luxury competition, which includes the BMW 7 Series, Mercedes S-Class, Audi A8 and Jaguar XJ. It’s a shame that the latest front-end styling has rather detracted from the visual appeal of the Model S, but the car has been kept at the cutting edge of technology. If you can resist using all that acceleration, a 396-mile range is promised. Safety isn’t a concern either – the Model S was awarded the full five stars after crash-testing by independent experts at Euro NCAP in 2014. Against all these, the unique design of the Tesla puts it at an advantage for interior space.
Reliability has been impressive, too – the Tesla Model S was number one in our 2016 Driver Power owner satisfaction survey and came fifth out of 150 cars for reliability, but too few owners responded for it to appear in our 2020 survey. As zero-emission luxury transport solutions go, the Model S is a practical, enjoyable and reliable choice – if you can afford it. In early 2020, a wireless update added ‘Cheetah Stance,’ which puts the car into an optimal setting for launches from a standing start.
The 100kWh battery pack Long Range Plus and Performance models, offering up to 405 miles of range in the former and, in the case of the Performance, a scarcely believable 2.3-second 0-60mph acceleration time when ‘Ludicrous Mode’ is engaged. It appeals on an emotional level as an object of desire and is therefore highly sought-after. While the low-volume Roadster attracted praise for its explosive acceleration, it fell rather short on day-to-day practicality. Unlike many electric and hybrid cars on the market, the Model S has the advantage of being designed as an EV from the ground up, so there are none of the compromises in comfort and passenger or luggage space that often result from converting a petrol or diesel car to run on electricity. Since it first arrived, the Model S has been constantly updated, both with over-the-air software updates and more substantial mechanical upgrades.
The less performance-focused Long Range Plus is the first EV to offer a range of over 400 miles on a charge, and its 3.7-second 0-60mph time should still be swift enough for most. Tesla also boasts its own well-established ‘Supercharger’ electric charging network, and is able to wirelessly transmit software updates for its cars – with the potential to boost their electrical efficiency without you knowing it. Rather than just being a sophisticated box of gadgets, the Model S is also very strikingly styled. It's biggest rival arguably comes from within, because the newer and cheaper Tesla Model 3 will offer many owners a similar experience for far less money.
And thanks to ever-improving battery technology, the Model S can offer very impressive range on a full charge. Considering the independent company started off with the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, it’s remarkable the Model S was only the second Tesla to hit the market.
<
p>It could be argued that Tesla has done more to shape the electric car market than any other brand. The UK Tesla Model S line-up currently consists of two models. The Model S strikes a rather more useful balance of space, comfort and luxury, while formidable performance is still on tap.
This won the Best Autonomous Drive category at our 2016 Car Tech awards, with the judging panel remarking it was “streets ahead” of similar systems. The limited driving range of electric vehicles is one factor that has curbed their popularity against conventional petrol and diesel cars, but the Tesla Model S Long Range Plus model has the longest range of any pure-electric car, and this is bound to increase its appeal against its premium saloon car rivals, such as the BMW 7 Series 745e and Mercedes S-Class 560e plug-in hybrid models and premium electric models like the Porsche Taycan.Accommodation

Fresh flood warnings have been issued ahead of Wednesday after the capital battled flash flooding in July, August and September.
Downpours and strong winds are predicted, according to forecasters.
Stormy weather will grip the UK for the rest of the month in the lead up to a bone-chilling Halloween.
Jim Dale, meteorologist for British Weather Services, said: “The Atlantic is going to push a lot of rain into Britain through the start of the week and strong winds are likely to touch gale-force.
“Another low-pressure system comes in on Tuesday and Wednesday bringing the risk of localised flooding. Later this week we will pull winds in from the north so it will feel colder, and any snow will be most likely over high ground in northern regions. This turbulent and stormy weather going to be the story for the rest of the month.
“There will be settled periods, but the pattern is tempestuous and we could be looking at a proper witches’ brew of weather in the run up to Halloween.”
Exacta Weather’s James Madden has warned of snow and widespread frost arriving in the final week of October marking a wintery end to the autumn.
He said: “There will be a greater risk for snow events during the final third of the month, and these are more likely across higher ground.”
Earlier this month, the Met Office said there was a real chance snow could blanket the UK in weeks.
Warnings of a white Halloween have been circulating for some weeks now.

Users of these products and stakeholders involved in all areas of the value chain have until 23 August 2021 to provide feedback.
The European Commission’s first initiative focuses on the possible introduction of energy labelling for mobile phones and tablets, which would inform consumers about a device’s environmental impact. The second initiative considers the adoption of ecodesign requirements to ensure that mobile phones and tablets are designed to be sustainable. In this way, these initiatives aim to improve the energy and material efficiency of mobile phones and tablets and accordingly reduce their harmful impact on the environment.
Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP)
The European Commission’s initiatives support the Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP), which was launched in 2020 and aims to promote sustainability and circularity by setting out a strong and coherent product policy framework targeting the entire life cycle of products. The CEAP identifies electronics and ICT as a key product value chain that is not sustainable. The CEAP asserts that this value chain requires urgent, comprehensive, and coordinated actions in relation to products including mobile phones and tablets.
Taking into consideration the CEAP, the European Commission launched two initiatives targeting the environmental impact and sustainability of mobile phones and tablets. When identifying potential measures to regulate the environmental impact of these products, the European Commission considered the introduction of energy labelling and the adoption of ecodesign requirements. In this way, these initiatives are also seen as building upon the Ecodesign Directive (Directive 2009/125/EC), which promotes the durability, reparability, and recyclability of products, and the Energy Labelling Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/1369), which promotes the energy efficiency of products.
Electrical and electronic equipment is one of the fastest-growing waste streams in the EU, whereby less than 40% of this waste is recycled. Mobile phones and tablets are widely used products that form part of this waste stream, whereby key materials used to manufacture these devices are not reused, recycled or recovered at the end of a device’s useful life. The environmental performance of mobile phones and tablets is further undermined by the fact that their increased functionality has meant that more power, storage capacity and materials are required to manufacture these products. In addition, mobile phones and tablets are frequently replaced. For example, consumers replace their smartphones with such frequency due to their desire to acquire a new model or software; the limited availability of the most commonly damaged spare parts and the updated versions of the operating system, firmware, or software; the high cost and lack of ease of repair; and the device’s reduced battery endurance over time.
In order to address these issues, the European Commission aims to improve the energy and material efficiency of mobile phones and tablets by making them less prone to premature obsolescence and damage. As part of its initiatives, the European Commission could introduce an energy labelling scheme and ecodesign requirements to ensure that mobile phones and tablets are designed to be energy-efficient, durable, repairable, upgradable, easily maintainable, reusable and recyclable.
In accordance with the findings of two reports published by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre, the initiatives consider the following aspects of mobile phones and tablets as areas that could be regulated: resistance when accidentally dropped; protection from water and dust; battery accessibility and longevity; availability of software/firmware/operating system updates; product durability; the ability of the product to be disassembled; availability of priority spare parts; data deletion and transfer functionalities; and the provision of appropriate information for users, repairers and recyclers.
As part of its initiatives the European Commission has identified five policy options for achieving its objectives: (i) no action is taken; (ii) the introduction of a self‑regulation model; (iii) the adoption of mandatory specific and/or generic ecodesign requirements in accordance with the Ecodesign Directive; (iv) the introduction of energy labelling under the Energy Labelling Regulation; and (v) the adoption of a combination of ecodesign requirements and energy labelling.
The European Commission has indicated that cost‑benefit analysis will be undertaken as part of its initiatives. This analysis will consider the impact of adopting regulatory measures on users and the industry, including the social impacts in relation to health and safety, and employment. In order to better understand the impact of such measures on these groups, the European Commission has opened its public consultations to all users of mobile phones and tablets, as well as stakeholders involved in all areas of the value chain, including original equipment manufacturers, component suppliers, repairers and recyclers, among others. These public consultations were launched to give these groups the opportunity to express their views on how to best address the policy challenges outlined in the initiatives and to allow them to provide the European Commission with relevant information.
Hong Kong sellers who place mobile phones and tablets on the EU market may be interested in participating in the public consultations, given that the adoption of regulatory measures under these initiatives could impact their competitiveness, profitability, and investment. The adoption of measures in relation to these devices could also place administrative burdens on Hong Kong sellers and create issues relating to reparability.
During the course of these initiatives and their ensuing legislative procedure, the European Commission may decide to introduce new rules. These would then be fully applicable in all EU Member States and apply to domestically‑made as well as imported goods alike.
Hong Kong companies and those in their supply chain that are interested in providing feedback to the public consultation have until 23 August 2021 to do so. Please click on the energy labelling initiative’s webpage or the ecodesign initiative’s webpage for more information.Products

Not only is the studio dedicated to evolving classic Live casino online games, but it has also trained its sights on its very own specific gaming lobbies. And it’s exciting stuff. The Blackjack Lobby gives us Blackjack fans the chance to enjoy all the Evolution Gaming Blackjack games right front and centre. No more arduous searching. Smooth navigation, quick loading and easy access means there’s a new, simpler, quicker way for us to enjoy online Live Blackjack.
Gameplay
As expected from a lobby, there are plenty of games to choose from. In the Blackjack Lobby we can enjoy various kinds of Blackjack, all fully optimised for us to enjoy either on desktop, tablet or mobile. There’s a generous selection of Live Dealer games to help create that realistic experience. And you know what they say, there ain’t no party like a Blackjack Party. This low stake version of the game features energetic hosts who might belong on TV, but they have found their calling in the Blackjack Party lounge. It’s a rewarding game to play, but it’s also a whole lot of fun.
The more serious gamer might head straight for Blackjack VIP, a high-end game with high-end payouts. Likewise, we can choose low roller variations too, so any player of any capability can enjoy Blackjack from the lobby. In fact, it’s not just restricted to Blackjack, as other games including Money Wheel, Top Card, Baccarat, Casino Hold ‘Em and Three Card Poker are also available. These can be found in the other sections in the lobby, just a few clicks or taps away if we fancy switching from counting cards to practising our poker face.
Bonuses
Evolution Gaming’s Live Blackjack tables follow classic Blackjack payouts, paying out 1:1 for standard wins, 3:2 for Blackjack and 2:1 for any Insurance wins. Each Blackjack game also comes with its own particular bonus features and with so many games to enjoy from the lobby…well…that’s a lot of bonuses.
The ones that stand out to us are the features such as Pre-Decision and Bet Behind.The Bet Behind feature lets us place a bet behind a seat while we’re waiting for a space. Or even if we’re in a game we can bet behind any other seat if we like the cut of another player’s jib. It’s pretty neat! These are added-value features that Evolution Gaming added to its Blackjack games. They help us place the right kind of bets at the table and also helps to hone our Blackjack strategy. And when we’re playing live, that’s something you want on it’s A Game.
Summary
Blackjack is one of the most popular table games at any online casino, so it’s nice to have all Evolution Gaming’s Blackjack varieties compartmentalised in one easy to use menu. The lobby feels very personal, helping to create a more immersive gaming experience. And with scores of Blackjack games to choose from, prepare to get fully immersed.This week has been one marked by contrasts. I entered it on a high, having taken full advantage of the isolation imposed by Storm Dennis to shut myself in the library and get as much work done as I possibly could. At the time of writing, on Saturday evening, I feel I’m leaving it on a slightly lower note – a low-pitched squeaking, rubbing and rattling note, to be precise. That’s the noise currently making my eardrums bleed from an unspecified location. Despite my valiant efforts to trace the source by getting on my hands and knees and shining my iPhone torch into the chair’s inner workings, I am so far at a loss to explain it (although I do think something connected to the wheel could be loose), and since everything is packed into it so tightly, I can’t reach any of the parts. That means I have to leave it to the professionals and wait until an engineer turns up at some stage next week. By that time, I may well have scratched my own ears off. Oh well, at least I’ve got a quiz at the noodle bar where Lara works to look forward to tomorrow night. Let’s just hope I don’t manage to deafen the entire restaurant on my way in!
In the meantime, I’ve returned to the library, and I have a nice quiet booth all to myself. I’ve started listening to music as I work now – I never really did that before as I always felt slightly conspicuous wearing headphones in public – but it’s so much easier to get settled in a little cocoon of sound. I’m trying to use it as an opportunity to discover new music, as I find it too easy to slip into the habit of listening to the same artists, songs and playlists over and over again. Since Spotify offers such a wide-ranging array of lists, I’ve simply taken to reading their names, deciding whether I’ll like them based on that alone, and then pressing play and seeing what happens. It’s been quite exciting so far – maybe I’ll list some of my better discoveries in a future post (leaving out the more embarrassing ones)?

Background: Xerostomia is a uniform complication after radiotherapy (RT) for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Dosimetric studies suggested that intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) can spare part of the parotid glands from high-dose radiation. Disease control and salivary function after IMRT for early-stage NPC was studied prospectively.
Methods: Thirty-three patients with T1,N0-N1,M0 NPC were treated with IMRT from 2000 to 2002. The prescribed dose was 68-70 grays (Gy) in 34 fractions to gross tumor volume, 64-68 Gy to the planning target volume, and 70 Gy to enlarged cervical lymph nodes. Nineteen patients had stimulated whole salivary (SWS) flow assessment and stimulated parotid salivary (SPS) flow assessment at baseline and at 2 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months after the completion of IMRT.
Results: At a median follow-up of 2 years, only 1 neck failure was observed. The 2-year and 3-year local control, distant metastases-free, and overall survival rates all were 100%. The lymph node control and progression-free survival rates were 100% at 2 years and 92.3% at 3 years, respectively. The average mean dose to the parotid gland was 38.8 Gy. The SWS and SPS flow showed continuous recovery: 60% and 47.1% of patients recovered at least 25% of their baseline SPS flow and SWS flow, respectively, at 1 year after completion of IMRT, and the proportions rose to 85.7% and 71.4%, respectively, by 2 years. The pH and buffering capacity of saliva also improved with time.
Conclusions: Parotid-sparing IMRT achieved good locoregional control, and there was continuous recovery of salivary flow, pH, and buffering capacity in the first 2 years after IMRT in patients with NPC.

OnePlus said it’s going to invest $150 million in the next three years to better the camera experience, with Hasselblad playing a central role in that. It’s too early to tell whether we’re looking at a marketing push or whether the Hasselblad magic is indeed coming to OnePlus phones. OnePlus did not share more camera details during that announcement, but the OnePlus 9 phones will be the first to rock Hasselblad-branded camera models. OnePlus scheduled the launch event for March 23rd, at which point it will surely showcase the phones’ photo and video recording capabilities. But we don’t have to wait as long to see the OnePlus 9 and OnePlus 9 Pro in all their splendor, as both designs leaked in full ahead of the official launch.

It’s common for OnePlus handsets to leak well in advance of the press event, and we’ve always known what to expect from OnePlus handsets in terms of design and features. The OnePlus 9 design leaked before the Hasselblad announcement, hinting that a camera partnership was in the works. After the Hasselblad deal was official, OnePlus CEO Pete Lau teased the OnePlus 9 Pro design, showing the phone’s rear, including the quad-lens camera system that will feature Hasselblad branding.
It all begins with a simple thought. Discover the #OnePlus9Series, co-developed with @Hasselblad, on March 23.
— OnePlus (@oneplus) March 8, 2021
But it’s the same German blog that brings us the full press renders for both the OnePlus 9 and OnePlus 9 Pro. WinFuture found images that highlight the two designs. Lau’s teaser helps confirm the renders are genuine.
The OnePlus 9 and OnePlus 9 Pro will not feature identical designs, with the forming sporting a couple of distinct design changes. The first concerns the screen, which is flat on the OnePlus 9 and curved on the OnePlus 9. This might be an advantage when it comes to handling drops. We saw Samsung earlier this year use flat screens for both the Galaxy S21 and S21+ models.
The OnePlus 9 also features what appears to be a plastic back, just like the cheaper Galaxy S21 phones. WinFuture notes that the phone’s chassis does not feature any antenna lines, which are customary on most handsets. “Glass sandwich phones,” which feature a metal chassis between the front and back glass panels, need those antenna lines so that the phone can communicate with cellular and Wi-Fi networks.
The OnePlus 9 Pro has antenna lines on the top, bottom, and sides. All Galaxy S21 handsets also feature antenna lines, even the two models that have plastic backs. It’s unclear why the OnePlus 9 doesn’t have any. The phone’s plastic back might be the reason why, but that’s just speculation.
Aside from these build quality observations, there’s one additional difference to consider. The OnePlus 9 Pro rear camera has four lenses, including a 50-megapixel Sony IMX766 ultra-wide camera and a 48-megapixel IMX789 primary camera. Both of them are present on the OnePlus 9 as well. But the cheaper version has just three rear cameras on the back instead of four.
Finally, the leak gives us the various color options for the two phones. The OnePlus 9 Pro comes in black, green, and silver. The OnePlus 9 will be available in black, blue, and purple. You can see all the images at this link.

Q: How many people can you accommodate?
A: As a hands on guide service, I can accommodate up to three anglers, although two anglers are ideal. If you have more than three anglers in your party, we commonly take out multiple boat trips. Over the past couple years in Michigan I have accommodated up to 10 anglers on business trips, family outings and bachelor parties with five boats (and five separate licensed Guides).
In Florida this past November, Roland Martin’s Marina hosted ‘The Tony Stewart Golf and Fishing Charity Classic’, which consisted of 28 boats with licensed guides! On multiple boat trips our goal, as it is with an individual boat trip, is to surpass your expectations. We have accommodated requests to fish close to one another for bragging (and shouting) rights and have staged ‘mini tournaments’ with small trophies.
Q: Do I need to send a deposit?
A: Yes, see our policy below
Q: Does the guide fish?
A: Yes and no. In Florida, the guide does not fish on live shiner trips, although he will while lure fishing. In Michigan, we only use artificial baits and the guide fishes along with the customers for the most part. Guides fishing along with you can greatly help with technique, boat positioning on structure and achieving the correct angles for your baits.
Q: Where will we meet?
A: I will call you the night before our trip to confirm the meeting location. Usually we will meet at the location discussed when the trip was booked. Occasionally due to local weather the meeting location will change. At times a little flexibility can pay huge dividends in our success!
Q: What if it rains?
A: We still fish in the rain. Unfortunately we cannot predict the weather in advance.
Q: Can we keep the fish?
A: No. Roland Martin’s Marina on Florida’s Lake Okeechobee is strictly catch and release for largemouth bass, as are my musky and smallmouth bass trips in Michigan on Lake St. Clair and the connecting rivers. Trophy fish are measured, girthed and photographed for reproductive mounts. If you are looking for a big fish fry, I can recommend some excellent walleye guides in Michigan or crappie guides in Florida.
I would not recommend hiring someone (large charterboat or otherwise) that allows you to keep bass or musky in any state. If you do hire someone that allows you to keep bass or musky I will bet you $1,000.00 they have these three traits. #1 – they are from the old school. #2 – They are fundamentally poor fishermen. #3 – They are unable to fill their limit with fish that taste good for their clients.
Q: What if I have to go to the bathroom?
A: Bass boats do not come with a fixed head (bathroom), although we can plan our day to always be within a couple minutes from a clean restroom on shore.
Q: Do we have any bad weather alternatives?
A: Yes. Occasionally the wind or other conditions can be so bad that alternatives must be utilized to have a successful fishing day. (All decisions based on the weather are solely up to the captain) These are just alternatives, and if I cancel due to weather, I will do everything possible to re-book our date! If you prefer to fish no matter what (a true diehard) I am familiar with quite a few inland lakes and rivers (in both Michigan and Florida) with exceptional fishing that are much more protected and safe under harsh conditions.
Q: Do I need to bring my own tackle or do you provide the equipment?
A: We provide all of the equipment needed including rods, reels and baits. For avid anglers used to using their own equipment, here are a few ideas that should help you cover the basics.
Florida Largemouth
7'6" to 7'11" heavy action flippin' stick with 65 lb. braid
7' to 7'6" heavy action worm rod with 15 - 20 lb. fluorocarbon
7' medium/heavy 'utility rod' with a fast tip and 20 lb. mono. for moving baits
Michigan Smallmouth
7' to 7'6" medium/heavy spinning rod with 8 lb. fluorocarbon (tubes)
7' to 7'6" medium spinning rod with 8 lb. fluorocarbon (drop shot)
6'6" medium power/moderate action casting rod with 12 lb. fluorocarbon (jerkbait)
7' medium/heavy casting 'utility rod' with 15 lb. mono. for moving baits
Michigan Musky
8'6" X-heavy casting rod with 80 pound braid (jigs)
8' to 8'6" heavy casting rod with 80 pound braid (moving baits)
A Common Question in Florida:
Q: Do we need to book with you or should I call Roland Martin’s Marina?
A: I highly recommend booking through Roland Martin's Marina. In more than 15 years, we are proud to say that we have never had a scheduling error at Long Cast Guide Service!

Square Enix released footage of its canceled horror Tomb Raider game “Tomb Raider: Ascension”.
The company released this video as part of its 25th anniversary celebration. In the approximately 7-minute video, we saw a gray character model, apparently Laura Croft traveling through dark caves, swamps, and gloomy Mori’s house, etc., according to reports Chronicles of Video GamesThese shots are obviously prototype shots in the early stages of game development, but they are an interesting observation of what the game will look like over time. For example, Ascension later became the reboot of Tomb Raider in 2013.
“Check out Tomb Raider: Ascension footage. In the exploration phase that finally became the restart in 2013, Tomb Raider went deep into the realm of survival horror,” Square Enix wrote in the description of the shot. “It is through Ascension that the team has honed in telling the origin story through the lens of survival.”
A particularly scary scene is Laura Croft in a place that looks like a mansion (perhaps the Croft mansion scene in the entire restarted franchise), burning tall and lanky with a flamethrower Monsters, and then stab them to death with a pickaxe.
We also saw some elements of a more open world, in which Laura Croft rode a horse to escape along the edge of a cliff while fleeing various giants or ogres. Elsewhere in the video, Laura Croft fights a boss who looks more like home in the FromSoftware game than in the restarted Tomb Raider game. It goes in and out on the ground, using its branch-shaped tendrils to attack Laura Croft, who is controlled by the player.
Two other Ascension videos were released, one of which focuses more on the concept art of the now cancelled survival horror game. In it, Lara Croft looks more vivid than the more realistic reboot and its sequel we received in 2013. We also have a clearer understanding of some of the monsters Lara Croft will fight and the locations she will visit.
The latest video released is titled “Tomb Raider (2013) Development: Ascension Branding”, which is a closer look at brands that may be related to Ascenion marketing. It highlights possible box art layouts, “early exploration” voice-overs, etc.
VGC Point out that Ascension first appeared in the digital version of Square Enix Tomb Raider: The Last Moments In the book, when Crystal Dynamics began to doubt its potential, the survival horror film of Tomb Raider was abandoned. This book describes a team meeting where Crystal Dynamics asks itself if Ascension is as good as Rocksteady’s “Batman: Arkham Asylum” game. When no one said it would be so good, the team decided to move from Ascension to the 2013 Tomb Raider reboot as we now know it.
Check out the video above for yourself, and then check out our thoughts on the 2013 restart Game informant Tomb Raider review. Read our thoughts on its sequel Game informant Rise of the Tomb Raider review with Game informant Shadow of the Tomb Raider review after that.

This point has now been made so many times that I don’t think it counts as counterintuitive anymore, but Barro makes one additional point that represents my real gripe with channel bundling:.paying $37 for an unbundled cluster of sports channels, even if they would have paid the roughly $9 that it costs to get those channels as part of a bundled package.
Most people don’t know just how much sports channels cost them, but they can account for nearly half of your average cable bill in some areas. Not everywhere, mind you, but the explosion of sports channels (Fox Sports 1, the NFL channel, the Golf channel, the NBC Sports Channel, etc.) and rise of dedicated team channels (the Lakers channel, the Dodgers channel, the Pac-12 channel, etc.) have steadily pushed the price of sports skyward in big media markets like Southern California. You don’t pay $9 for that collection. Carriage fees are a closely guarded secret, so it’s hard to say how much you do pay, but it’s probably something like $25 or more.
This doesn’t hurt me, since I watch enough sports to (mostly) make this worthwhile. And the fact that all you non-sports watchers have to pay for this stuff basically subsidizes my habit. So thanks! But honestly, I don’t think you should have to. When Time Warner demands that the Dodgers channel be part of basic cable—my latest hobbyhorse—it basically amounts to a Dodgers tax on every family in the LA area. But I’m afraid I don’t really see why Time Warner should be allowed to levy a tax on every family in the LA area.
So go ahead and keep bundling. Maybe it’s more efficient in the end, and doesn’t really cost most of us very much money. But unbundle sports. It’s a big expense, and those of us who are sports junkies ought to be the ones paying it. Plus there’s this: if we all paid the true cost, instead of forcing everyone to subsidize the rest of us, it might finally provoke some serious pushback—and maybe the astronomical and absurd upward spiral of sports rights would finally abate. If this means the Dodgers are worth only $1.7 billion instead of $2 billion, that’s okay with me.Having any of these problems?

Do you have an emergency at your property where your water will not turn off?
In instances where emergencies arise, follow the below steps to isolate your water and call a plumber immediately if you cannot isolate the water to the property and you have an emergency
Contain & Isolate the Water
If possible, try and contain the water leak into a bucket or by diverting it into a drain if possible. If the leak is urgent and damaging property, the first step should be to isolate the water immediately
Turn Main Water Off (House)
If you are in a house, turn your main water off clockwise till the water stops. Turn an external tap outside to drain the water out of the house line and call a plumber immediately if your taps continue to drip.
Turn Main Isolation Valve Off (Unit)
If you are in a unit, turn the main isolation valve off clockwise till the water stops. The location in a unit varies where they could be installed. It is extremely important to become familiar with where the valves are located prior to an emergency
This is what the valve should look like:
Only the top half of the valve will be protruding out of the wall.
Turn it clockwise till the water stops
Are your drains overflowing?
This is a warning sign that your drains are blocked
Emergency Drain Blockage Sydney
The team at Sydney’s Plumbing Specialists provide same day service for blocked drain services throughout Sydney. An overflowing drain external to the property is an indication that the main sewer line is blocked. If a line is overflowing internally, this may mean the blockage is generalised and maybe only blocked on a certain fixture
CCTV Camera Inspection
A plumber will be needed to attend and with the use of a high pressure jet blaster, clear the blockage and conduct a CCTV camera inspection on the sewer or stormwater line to determine what caused the blockage in the first instance. Without conducting a CCTV camera inspection, the issue will most likely re occur.
How does flooding occur?
The main causes of flooding within properties are generally from burst pipes/hoses or flooding which have ruptured and caused a significant amount of water damage throughout the property. This is an extremely stressful situation and could mean a large insurance claim.
What should you do?
We recommend you complete the following. The main priority is to try and stop the leak or flood from continuing. Whether this means turning off the mains immediately till help arrives, or whether it means using the below steps to help prevent any further damage.
Turn off electrical hazards
If there is a risk of water leaking or dripping onto any electrical power points or outlets, turn off the circuit breakers labelled protected power to ensure no water leaks onto any fixtures and causes a safety hazard
Protect areas of your property
Where possible, place buckets or towels down to protect certain areas of the property. We highly recommend, anything valuable be moved to safe location away from floor level if there is an immediate risk of these objects becoming damaged
Contain the leaks
Try and contain the leak or place something over it to stop it from spreading
Ensure that help is on the way!
A qualified technician will be needed to help prevent any further damage. This is critical so no further problems or damage occurs
SPS Plumbers Sydney is a Multi-Award Winning Plumbing Company Delivering the Highest Standards of ServiceResearch undertaken at the University of Leeds reveals that many ex-MPs struggle to prosper after life in the Commons.
The Daily Mail's reporting of the findings is typically trenchant. Under a story entitled The Unemployables, correspondent Steve Doughty writes:
"A careers advice company cited in the report warned that a high percentage of former MPs 'were commercially unemployable at senior management level'. Only a handful of them could command salaries in the business world that matched their Westminster wages, it added. A high proportion of those who do find work get places on quangos."
Some MPs want to be paid more - particularly Conservative MPs. Sir John Butterfill has even called for a 66% increase. The Mail believes that this report suggests they're far from worth it: "MPs are fond of complaining that they're worth far more than they're paid. Isn't the truth the exact opposite?"
ConservativeHome columnist Cameron Watt has proposed a £100,000pa salary for MPs but only if they work full-time.
5.45pm: Also revealed today was a 5% increase in MPs expenses to £87.6m. Sky has the story. The best value MP is the Conservative Philip Hollobone.
7pm: This just in from The TaxPayers' Alliance:
"Expenses per MP (ex. all travel):
1 Conservative £123,370
2 Labour £128,439
3 SNP £129,337
4 Lib Dem £130,589
5 Plaid Cymru £132,144
Matthew Elliott, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said:
“Conservative MPs should be proud that their average expenses are lower than the other political parties. However, their expense claims have still gone up by around 7 per cent, far more than inflation, so there is still room for improvement. Plaid Cymru MPs should go to the back of the class.”
I have no problem with an MP receiving a decent salary if they do a good job representing their constituency. However certain MPs are as good as invisible and are just there for the ride, Labour's David Crausby being a good example of those who simply make up the numbers. It is certainly true that the modern career-politican has little to offer outside of the Westminster bubble. That could be a major reason as to why our country is in such a mess, MPs with no experience in business or public service are given charge of essential government departments.
Posted by: Tony Makara | October 25, 2007 at 19:16
There are a variety of reasons why ex MPs struggle:
1. Age - often a defeated MP is 50+
2. If the ex MP had been in Parliament for any length of time, their expertise in their former employment would have become out of date.
3. Employers are wary of taking on anybody who still harboured an ambition to return to the Commons.
4. Many employers are wary of those with strong political views.

The SNP's and Labour's expenses are bound to be higher then our's as they have a lot more members travelling from scotland then we do.

Yes, but Editor, there's just something inherently more expensive about being Scottish. Ask Mr Keith.

An interesting post. As someone who recruits senior execs for the City, I think there's something in Fraser Nelson's analysis. £100k would be a better benchmark of a salary, but it should be constructed so as to preclude any outside interests. The fair rejoinder is that this will only create career politicians, but that is rather where we are now. What it might do is encourage a better quality of candidate, as I have to say, having been involved in a number of selections in safe seats, the Candidates' List has a really tragically low calibre of people on it.
To Nick Bennett's points, all fair. This said, proximity to power is always useful to a prospective employer. Labour MPs were of no use when they were out of power for so long and the same now applies to the average Tory backbencher. Why give you a non-exec role at Merrill Lynch when you can get someone of real talent.
Overall, the salary needs pushing markedly upwards, but with restrictions on outside interests. However, the overall gene pool badly needs improving or it will continue to be the case that the most talented and capable individuals pursue other careers.

As parliament's powers reduce, so surely should MP's wages. What exactly do they do?
Posted by: Henry Mayhew | October 25, 2007 at 23:04
Being an MP should be a civic service to the Country, not a money-making scheme. I think the financial incentives should be reduced. Further, I think allowances should be scrapped and an independant budgeted body should handle London living for MPs. The communication allowance should also be scrapped - its a dreadful idea.
MPs should also be required to demonstrate that they have taken the most economical option. 1st Class flights with your wife should lead to that individual only being reimbursed to the tune of an economy ticket for one.
Someone once said that Jack Cunningham 'cannot look at a wine list without picking the most expensive'. This is a scandal, politics is not 'show business for ugly people', its serious and dedicated. We need to fight to stop the gravy train attitude, it undermines our country.

I read that MP`s expenses are decided by a cosy all party committee, so don`t expect any cuts. Turkeys don`t vote for Christmas.
Posted by: Edward Huxley | October 26, 2007 at 15:35
The Mail are being a bit disingenious when they describe these figures as 'MPs pocketing £200k'.
Most of these expenses go on office costs, staff allowances etc. If you take your average newspaper editor, and add the cost of running his office and payig his immediate staff to what he 'pockets', his apparent salary would steepen pretty swiftly.
One way to avoid this annual mudslinging is to stop paying expenses to MPs, who then pay their staff etc. Why not have standard office/staff expenses/contracts etc, all met centrally - like any other organisation? NHS CEOs, Chiefs of Police, Headteachers - none of them have to hire their secretaries, pay for their offices, then claim the money back!!

It is always a treat when we get to head out to the fields and pick our own strawberries at the farm. There really is nothing better than farm fresh organic strawberries. This recipe combines these flavorful berries with some basil to create a tasty and refreshing popsicle. Great for both adults and kids! If you don’t want to use your whole quart of strawberries that you picked this week, feel free to half this recipe. You can also use frozen strawberries, just soften enough to be able to chop them and blend them really well. Recipe made 10 popsicles, but amount will vary depending on mold size.
Strawberry Basil Popsicles
Ingredients:
1 cup maple syrup
¼ cup packed, chopped basil leaves
½ cup water
1 quart strawberries (4 cups, divided), cleaned with stems removed
- Combine maple syrup, basil, and water in small saucepan. Bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer.
- Simmer for 5 minutes. Turn burner off. Cover and allow the mixture to infuse for an hour.
- Chop ½ cup of berries into small pieces. Place the strawberry pieces into the bottoms of the popsicle mold.
- Place remaining 3 ½ cups strawberries into the blender. Blend until a smooth puree is formed.
- Add basil syrup into the blender with strawberry puree. Blend again to combine. Continue blending until mixture is smooth and uniform.
- Fill molds with puree.
- Freeze overnight.
- Carefully remove popsicles from molds and enjoy!
>:You will all be pleased to know that I am back in business. Phones and computer like devices are all charged and fully capable of obnoxious posting on the www. Confused because of this? Check out yesterday’s post about Dog the Bounty Hunter and my cape. Confused due to every day events and society as a whole? Yeah, me too.
Today’s Zero to Hero Challenge, encouraged us to play with widgets. At first I thought it said play with midgets and I was really shocked…and then excited…and then realized I don’t really know any midgets, so that made me sad. I then pondered if “midgets” was deemed politically correct of not, and well, here we are.
I love widgets. I really do. With that said, I am quite content with the widgets I have, but in the spirit of the challenge, I added a Search Bar. I also added a new menu, which will likely be Day 11’s challenge, but we’ll tackle that when the time comes.
The new menu, you may have noticed, is in the left hand column. So far there is only one menu item, and that is: Saturday: Holy Haikus, He-Man.
This will now be a permanent part of The Playground. Every Saturday, you will receive a haiku of something very relevant to me at the moment or for that week. In Japanese, a haiku is a poem that follows a simple, 5-7-5 syllable rule to correspond to each line.
We were also encouraged to keep our post under 400 words., hence the haiku inspiration.
Today, I am doing one of my infamously really weird jobs. I’m running a hot dog stand in Sundsvall, Sweden with a friend of mine at a sold out concert for a popular Swedish band. We both work for the same (very big) music business company and this is about the furthest thing from our job description, but what the hell, right? Money is money.
With that said, here is the very first installment of “Saturday: Holy Haikus, He-Man”.
The Hot Dog Haiku
Hot dogs are korv here
Today I am selling them
A girl’s gotta eat.
Tips are indeed sexy. I hope that you nailed a few.
As a fellow expat yourself, you know tipping, for however sexy it is, is not customary in Europe and Sweden is no exception, unfortunately. We made about 120 sek in tips,100 sek of which was from two women who didn’t want to wait in the coat check line so gave us 100 sek to hold their coats. So roughly $10 each.
Now I want hot dogs.
I had resolved to attempt to eat less processed meats this year, but there were so many leftover hot dogs, I felt it was my duty to eat four of them at the end of the night, for the sake of the starving children worldwide. They would have wanted it that way. Just trying to be a productive part of society. No need to thank me.
Just because you make my husband laugh, I thought you deserved this: I nominated you for the Liebster award:
Wow… I’m super humbled. Thank you so much, and I promise to strive to also make you laugh, too 😀
Oh you do, don’t worry. But with me it’s not as hard as with my other half.
Ok, good… Still I will continue to strive in the challenge to make the two of you laugh on a daily basis if you’ll allow me.

The Resilient Leadership™ Community was born in Perth, Australia, have their message listened to by the directors in a positive way. As she drove, the essence of a community emerged in her mind — a place where people working for supportive change in their communities could gather and work together towards their goals — a place where they would be listened to and in the process, learn to listen to those with whom they disagreed.
Catlyne Hos joined Wendy in March 2000, after Wendy called a meeting of colleagues and friends to discuss how this community objective — then called the Wonder of One — might happen. As Catlyne developed her Paths to Identity process during the years that followed, she used it to facilitate the creation of the community and its objective. She overcame the later challenge of the co-creators being spread across the globe by holding online co-creation dialogues. As well Catlyne co-created the 3rd Key of Kindness™. Catlyne finally retired from the team in April 2018, leaving her deeply thoughtful approach to shared creation as her lasting legacy.
Alfred Leung accepted Wendy’s invitation to join the co-creation group in July 2006 after completing Wendy’s first public trial of the Wonder of One concept as The Leader as Inspiring Coach. Working in a corporate environment at the time but approaching retirement, he worked with Wendy to develop his unique approach to people’s life values into the Core Values process of the 2nd Key of Kindness™. As well, Alfred’s Core Values approach became an inherent part of the group’s practice.
During 2007, Wendy’s mentor Tom Wilson guided Wendy to find a more suitable name for the concept — one that would capture the outcome that it intended to deliver. After many discussions, the name Resilient Leadership™ was born.
The next challenge was the image which portrayed the project’s essence. Annimac, a friend of Wendy’s and ongoing adviser for the project, introduced Wendy to Katina Woodruff-Robert. in early 2008. Katina and Wendy enjoyed a number of playful conversations about their projects. During their final conversation, the first part of the current image emerged — 2 sweet lion cubs.
Anne Radford accepted Wendy’s invitation to join the group in September 2008. Based in London, United Kingdom, Anne’s inclusion in the dialogues marked a shift from face-to-face meetings to online meetings. Anne’s authentic and empathetic practice of the Appreciative Inquiry process deepened the team’s dialogues, especially around the 1st Key of Kindness™. Anne remained a committed co-creator until she retired from the group in April 2018. Her lasting legacy was the group practice of respectful listening — inquiring from the place of not knowing — a practice in which Anne which especially skilled.
After Anne joined the group, Wendy’s colleague Andre Burki supported Wendy with his Team Architect skills to craft an online dialogue process. With his support the team culture and co-creation flourished during the now-online dialogues.
Sue White accepted Wendy’s invitation to join the group in September 2010. By this time the online dialogues were working well, and Sue was warmly welcomed. Sue’s warm and insightful approach to Type further deepened the team’s discussions as the 4th Key of Kindness™ continued to emerge during the discussions. Her lasting legacy was the group’s approach to understanding and appreciating difference.
Sally Paulin accepted Wendy’s invitation to join the team in December 2010. Sally’s heartfelt commitment to her sustainability teaching using Theory U broadened the group’s ability to support change makers by helping them to understand the bigger picture in the 6th Key of Kindness™. She also taught the group to be present for the future they were co-creating.
George Eapen accepted Wendy’s invitation to join the group in April 2013. Based in India, George was developing a people-focussed approach to social value innovation. With his thoughtful and wide-ranging care about in our human world, this gave the 5th Key of Kindness™ and the team, a most welcome deepened community focus on their co-creation work.
Now there was a whole community around Resilient Leadership™:
During the team dialogues, the current version of the image emerged — the lion family which we gratefully included in our website banner. This was a good time to reflect on the many people who had been part of its creation. As well those listed above, others who had been part of the journey included Roberta Mead, Tony Manso, Ken Holzman, Paul Chatfeild-Clarke, Digby Scott, Marie Finlay, Phillip Ng, Andrew Nelson and Michael Van Der Zanden.
By the time Carla Van Raay signed up to undertake Resilient Leadership™ in December 2015, the group had co-created a unique and profoundly helpful reference book with associated mentoring, underpinned by the 7 Keys of Kindness™ Journey. Carla took all the time that she needed to work with each of the mentors — Anne, Alfred, Catlyne, Sue, George, Sally and Wendy — before completing her goal in early 2017. She has remained a valued and enthusiastic member of the community ever since.
Lynn Allen formally joined the Resilient Leadership™ team in October 2017. Jo’s effervescent personality and personable approach brought a welcome new perspective to the group, and to the 4th Key of Kindness™ of Resilient Leadership™. Sue supported Jo as she took her place in our mentoring group, then retired to join our Past Mentors group.
David Shaked accepted Anne’s and Wendy’s invitation to join the mentoring team in March 2018. His thoughtful and kind approach to the big issues that we all face as we strive for positive change added a new depth to the 1st Key of Kindness™. Anne supported David is he took his place in our mentoring team, then retired to join our Past Mentors group. Sadly, in December 2019, after a very busy year following the successful launch of his latest book, and his increasing consulting work, David no longer had the space to give this important role the attention it needed. He retired to join our Past Mentors group.
Tertta Paananen accepted Catlyne’s and Wendy’s invitation to join the mentoring team in August 2018. Her delightful and kind approach to seeing the whole of whatever we are striving for, added a lovely breadth to the 3rd Key of Kindness™. Catlyne supported Tertta as she took her place in our mentoring group, then retired to join our Past Mentors group. She continued her involvement with the Resilient Leadership™ Community by writing a reference book for the 3rd Key of Kindness™, with Tertta.
After many months of Resilient Leadership Community inactivity while our human world reeled from the many shocks of the pandemic and other global upheavals, by late 2021 it was obvious that our community was no longer relevant. In October of that year, Wendy closed the doors. Our work was done. A new way would be found for helping to build a kinder world.
Yet this story of co-creation and friendship will remain with us for the rest of our lives, and of the lives of all those whom we touched during our years together.
In deepest gratitude for this journey,
Wendy

They would be 74% to approve meetings by interposed screens, whether they are teleworking or not, according to the results of an Ifop survey for Speechi, manufacturer of interactive screens, the results of which are unveiled this Wednesday, October 27.
From this survey carried out on a sample of 1002 people, representative of executives working in mainland France, it appears that the youngest appreciate it a little more than the others, they are 82% of those under 40 and 70% over 40s. They are right to love video, especially since it has become widely used. The gradual return to face-to-face has not started this trend, since 94% of executives used video conferencing in the past 12 months, 71% of which in the past 7 days.
Add to this the fact that the number of meetings (face-to-face or not) has increased considerably, from an average of three meetings per week in 2015 to more than five today, or even more than six in large companies. And, of course, more than half (56%) of the meetings attended by executives interviewed by Ifop took place by videoconference.
Saving time and stress?
If executives appreciate video so much, it would be above all because it saves time, in particular by avoiding travel to go to meetings. They are 95% to give this argument, among those who say to like the video.
Then, 88% of them perceive the video as a benefit compared to the reduction of health risks. And more than 8 out of 10 executives believe that using videoconferencing reduces the length of meetings (86%) while increasing their efficiency (82%). Finally, 64% of executives surveyed declared that the use of videoconferencing reduces stress when they have to speak in meetings.
Visio in pajamas … even naked
Executives are very numerous (85%) to turn on their camera. But they are only 32% to do it systematically. And for good reason … when the camera is deactivated, more than a third of participants, and almost half of those under 40, admit that they do not always wear appropriate attire.
They seem to want to take advantage of this meeting format to discuss more casual outfits, such as pajamas or underwear, for more than a third of them (35%).Even not to wear it at all. Thus, they are 5% of executives questioned to admit having already participated in a video meeting while being naked.
Likewise, 74% of executives under the age of 40 admit to having already discussed with their colleagues via messaging, in parallel with a videoconference meeting. Wiser, those over 40 are only 57% to do so. Others (22%) actually performed a task such as cleaning or cooking, during a videoconference meeting with the camera off.

This is a review of Perfect Pout Lip Plumper. The manufacturer claims that this product will have a visible impact on your lips’ shape, increase lip volume, improve softness and hydration and also decrease anti-sagging and anti-aging of lips. To discover the facts you need to know read our review below.
Ingredients
- Volulip
- Vitamin E
- Corum
- Peppermint
Volulip assists with the moisturizing, plumping and shaping of lips. Vitamin E has moisturizing and antioxidant properties. Peppermint and Corum create a refreshing scent and flavor.
We like the fact that Cougar only uses cruelty-free formulas which never get tested on animals. It is not clear, however, whether this formula is suitable for vegans.
We find it concerning that there aren’t any patented ingredients included in this formula and that it does not include at least 10% active ingredients. Rather be on the lookout for a lip plumper which contains at least 5 patented ingredients and 10% active ingredients if you really want to see results.
How To Use
The product should be rubbed around and on the lip area. All of the lip areas should be covered in order to see fuller and more intense results. The manufacturer does not give clear usage instructions in terms of how often the formula should be applied. We prefer manufacturers who provide clear usage instructions in order to make sure that the end user is in no doubt about how to use the product for optimal benefit.
Price
Perfect Pout can be bought for $14.99. They do not offer any discounts or bulk purchasing options at this stage. There are other lip plumper companies who provide excellent ranges of purchasing options with discounts for bulk buying their product. This is much more cost effective in the long run.
Guarantee & Feedback
The company has a 7-day return policy. It is not clear, however, in what shape the product should be in when returned. We don’t think that seven days are really enough in order to give a client a chance to try out the product to find out whether it works for them or not.
There are only a few positive (5-star rating) reviews available on the manufacturer’s website.
Our Conclusive Review About Cougar Perfect Pout Lip Plumper
After we reviewed Perfect Pout, we found that it contains a few quality ingredients and that the price is relatively affordable.
We did find it concerning, however, that there isn’t at least 10% active ingredients included in this formula and that it does not contain any patented ingredients. This will definitely affect the effectiveness of the product.
We also find it worrying that the dosage instructions are not clear and that the company offers a 7-day money-back guarantee only. This does not give the end-user enough time to really find out whether the lip plumper shows results or not. There are other lip plumper companies who offer up to 90-day money-back guarantees even for empty containers. We would suggest you rather try one of those products as it will give you the chance to try out a new product without the risk of losing your money.Entrepreneur Exchange

“I feel so fortunate to have met you Selina. Thank you so much for your gift that you share to help others in need.

My parents were also very pleased and my father even began to speak of some tragedies which happened over the years I’d never heard of. We are all feeling blessed that you could bring our family and the spirits peace, and the property to a content state of being. My daughter is no longer afraid to be in the house by herself and our pets are no longer restless and afraid. Blessings to you and thank you so much for helping our family.

Aside from the dozens of young women, boys, and girls who accuse R. Kelly of sexual and physical abuse, the disgraced R&B singer’s ex-wife Andrea “Drea” Kelly says she is a survivor of his abuse as well. Kelly and Drea were married for over a decade. Though Drea initially stayed quiet, she now advocates for other victims. Kelly was recently found guilty in one of his criminal cases and Drea is conflicted on how to feel.
Drea Kelly accuses R. Kelly of abusing her
ABC reports of Drea’s testimony when she gave a speech during the Marjaree Mason Center’s Top Ten Professional Women and Leading Business Awards event. Drea says the abuse began early on, with Kelly preferring to keep her a secret from the public. She says Kelly told her it was to protect their love, but she feels otherwise now.
“Now looking back at it, no, actually it was to keep me isolated so that no one would know about the abuse and also I felt so distant and separated from the world that I didn’t feel empowered to speak out about it,” she said.

At one point, Drea says she considered taking her own life by jumping from a penthouse balcony. “I think the thing that really kept me from jumping and saving my life was hearing my children in the background and they were saying, ‘Mama, mama, why did she jump, why did she leave us.'”
Drea accuses Kelly of heinous acts, including hogtying her, beating her, and abusing her financially and emotionally. She says she did not come forward sooner out of fear.
The singer’s ex-wife says she’s is split over the verdict
A jury found Kelly guilty of all six counts of racketeering and sex trafficking in his Brooklyn criminal trial. He faces 10-years minimum to life in prison. Kelly’s legal team say they are planning to appeal the decision.
While many are jumping for joy, Drea says her heart is split. “I sit in a very difficult place because, unlike the rest of his victims, I also share children with him. I was married to him,” Drea says in a statement, as reported by The Jasmine Brand. “So I wear two hats–I wear the hat of a survivor and an advocate, but I also wear the hat of a mother and an ex-wife. So it’s very difficult for me. I feel that my heart is in two places.

Drea says her children are the most impacted by Kelly’s crime and current situation. Per Drea, their three children will suffer as a result in the long run. She says she has remorse for all involved.
“My heart definitely goes out to the survivors and the courage that it takes to even kind of distance myself from it, but his blood runs through my children’s veins–it’s a part of their DNA. They can’t escape it even if they wanted to.”
Illinois Congressman says Kelly deserves a second chance
Despite Kelly’s 30+ years of being an alleged sexual predator, Illinois Congressman Rep. Danny Davis says the singer has a chance to redeem himself. TMZ asked Davis whether he feels Kelly will be welcomed with open arms in his hometown of Chicago, and Davis does not see why not.
“As an artist, one who is gifted, I think he’ll be welcomed back into Chicago as a person who can be redeemed,” Rep. Davis told paps. “I’m a big believer in what is called second chances and I actually have a bill that we got passed called The Second Chance Act, which gives individuals the opportunity to be redeemed and to redeem themselves. So, it really will all depend upon him.”
Kelly is preparing to defend himself in criminal trials in at least three other states. He maintains his innocence.We’re back with Debbie and Art’s third and final ceremony tradition (Did you see their vow exchange and Chinese tea ceremony?), a Thai water ceremony where every guest pours water over the couple’s hands and gives them their blessings.

Alcohol Use & Color Saturation with Skin Illustrator
Skin Illustrator is used many different ways by many different artists. It was designed to be used like you would use watercolors – that is, overlapping layers of translucent color. That said – it is also designed to be used, in some cases, alone or in conjunction with PAX, RMG, Cream, and/or Aqua colors, – often going back and forth between those mediums – and will bind those layers together.
There are 3 basic methods of activating individual cells in the palette.
- Activator sprayed directly into the cell.
- Activator in a dropper bottle – delivering drops of Activator into the cell.
- Wetting your brush in Activator, then creating a slurry in the cell with your wetted brush (this method on hot summer days can evaporate quickly. You’ll have to adjust your timing and amount of Activator).
How much you wet the cell and much color is liquified in the cell will determine the density of the color you apply to the mixing palette or directly to the skin. If mixing multiple colors – the art of keeping your brush, the color cell and your mixing palette as wet as you need is an art unto itself. Once it dries on the mixing palette, the colors can be reactivated with more Activator.
Remember, the longer you activate the color cells with Activator the more dense the color will become. If you want a sheer color – activate the cell for less time and with more Activator. Hot temperatures can increase the amount of Activator needed to keep the material activated.
Application Techniques
There are many ways to get Skin Illustrator onto the skin or appliance:
- Brushes – Flat, round, stipple, synthetic, natural, etc.
- Makeup Sponge, Torn Makeup Sponge, Sea Sponge
- Airbrush
- Spattering/flicking – Airbrush, Dye brush, Tooth Brush
- Black/Orange/Red Stipple Sponge
- Fingers
- Cotton swabs, etc.
Safety With Alcohol
Alcohol is highly flammable. All cautions should be taken that heat sources do NOT come in contact with ALL alcohol, alcohol-based liquid makeup and alcohol-based products.
When Airbrushing Skin Illustrator liquids make sure you have plenty of ventilation. Be extra cautious when spraying around the eyes and nose – have the actor/model close their eyes and hold their breath.
Ventilation
Local ventilation in a trailer or confined space – for years artists have used box fans with inexpensive A/C filters appropriately sized for the box fan to draw fumes away from the actor. In some instances, we use a second box fan on low behind the artist to facilitate an air flow past the actor and toward the 1st box fan. Opening doors and windows helps to facilitate air flow.
What are the different palette sizes?
Five Cell: 5 x 1.5 in (12.7 x 3.81 cm)
On Set: 4.25 x 3.5 in (10.795 x 8.89 cm)
Full Size: 7.25 x 3.5 in (18.415 x 8.89 cm)

I can't get 99% alcohol. Can I use 91% alcohol? Can I use 70%?
Skin Illustrator is designed to be used with it’s proprietary mixture of alcohols as approved by the FDA. It’s sold as Skin Illustrator Activator.
However, that said, so as not to cut out any artist who either can’t afford another alcohol or doesn’t have immediate access to Activator, you can use 99%. We find 99% a bit too harsh for applications around an actor, but with good ventilation (a necessity) you might not force everyone from the trailer. We’ve had some reports of success with 91% alcohol. But be aware, unscrupulous retailers will sometimes cut their alcohols and sell them to an unaware artists or companies which will inhibit Skin Illustrator from working properly. We found adulterated 99% Alcohol happening in the Vancouver area of Canada in 2015, as well as other countries around the world. Be aware!
Never use 70% alcohol (rubbing alcohol).
What is the proper way to use Green Marble ‘Ager’, and what's the best way to remove it at the end of the day?
Ager is best applied with a flat synthetic brush. Stretch the skin on the area of the face to wish to affect, while holding the skin, load your brush (not too much) and apply the material in the direction of the wrinkle, be quick and sure with the stroke not allowing the material to leave heavy striations or trails that may take longer to dry than the rest of the application. Use a hairdryer to speed drying. Apply as many coats as you think necessary then powder before you release the stretch. Some have chosen to powder in-between each application, but we choose not to, to help control buildup.
Removal is done with Telesis IPM Gel™. The Gel stays better on the face. Using your fingers and fingers only, No Powder puffs, No tissue, nothing but fingers, apply the IPM Gel and moving your finger in small circular motion work the material on and around the face. Continue the motions until you feel the Ager material breakdown, then using warm damp towels, wipe off the Ager and IPM Gel, repeat until residue can no longer be felt, apply Moisturizer and/or EDAP.
For more, see our page on Green Marble SēLr Aging Techniques.
Do you perform animal testing?
Absolutely not!
Skin Illustrator is the only alcohol-activated material that is Vegan-approved and allowed to display the Pink Bunny.
How do you activate your metallic (Alchemy) palette?
Due to the nature of the pigments used in the Alchemy Palette the activation can be a bit longer than other Skin Illustrator palettes. The easiest way is to apply a thin layer of Activator or 99% alcohol into the desired color cell – too much alcohol will make it too thin and not enough alcohol won’t activate the cell enough. and may need a bit more. Close the lid (no need to snap it shut) – keeping the palette horizontally level. Wait at least 5 minutes, then open the lid and activate the color with your brush.
Can Skin Illustrator be used with a sunscreen?
Yes, choose a film-forming alcohol-based sunscreen and allow it to dry thoroughly before applying Skin Illustrator.
What should I use to color teeth?
Fleet Street Pegworks Tooth Laquers are specially designed temporary pigments safe to use on teeth, most veneers and crowns. It is not recommended to apply colors from the original Skin Illustrator line as they are created for external use on the skin only.
What do I do when I run out of a color in a palette?
All palette colors can be purchased as a liquid concentrate. They can then be poured into a palette cell – frequently stir while using a blowdryer on the cell will dry the color quicker and more evenly.
These concentrates should not be confused with the standard liquids. The liquids are a thinner consistency to allow it to be sprayed through an airbrush gun.
What makes Skin Illustrator products different from other makeups?
Skin Illustrator is manufactured and distributed by Premiere Products, Inc – FDA licensed, cruelty-free and Vegan approved. Skin Illustrator is a color system created by a professional makeup artist.
What does "fumo" mean?
Fumo is an Italian painting term meaning smoky, translucent or wispy. So, those colors designated as ‘fumo’ are created translucent.
Can I paint AcrylStains directly in the mouth?
No, AcrylStains are solvent based and not for cosmetic use. AcrylStains are not safe to use directly in the mouth. Once you have painted your dentures with AcrylStains and they have had sufficient time to dry then they are safe for the mouth. See our AcylStains page for more information.

I've wandered down to the Chicago River to see it dyed green for the occasion (while living out action sequences from Harrison Ford's The Fugitive). Other than that, I have generally spent the day lamenting the not-quite-spring weather and avoiding being vomited upon by overenthusiastic merrymakers.
So, it makes sense that this year I didn't seek out the craic that could surely be found in the Irish bars of Kathmandu's tourist mecca, Thamel. Instead, I went in search of an alcoholic high of a different kind. Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to meet chhyang:
Chhyang is an alcoholic "drink" found in Nepal, Tibet, and throughout other parts of the Himalayan region. It is made most commonly with fermented rice but can be concocted using barley or millet. I'm not sure how the locals first discovered this brew (although I am certain it involved a bit of desperation), but I first encountered it the other night when a brave new acquaintance ordered it at dinner without batting an eye. Intrigued, I joined him, despite the warning I had recently received that such local firewater is usually made with untreated water and is thus a food poisoning death wish if under 40 percent alcohol. No one warned me that tasting the stuff would bring a death wish of its own. Legend has it that chhyang attracts the Yeti, known to raid Himalayan villages in search of a sip. Learning this, I fear that the Abominable Snowman is more abominable and beastly than we all dared imagine.
I should pause a moment to point out that I am a storied lover of food and drink. To this day, I am proud that there are few things I find distasteful in the culinary realm. My wife (lovingly?) calls me her garbage disposal; I will eat anything. Such habits had me looking like this in third grade:
But back to the chhyang. There is a more drinkable, and I think common, version technically called chamal ko chhyang.
chamal ko chhyang
This stuff is served "chilled" (read: just below room temp). It's thick and a bit chunky, the consistency of very pulpy orange juice. It tastes like a sour, fermented, strong sake (Japanese rice alcohol). It is lightly carbonated, and my waiter encouraged me to drink quickly before it went flat. Bottoms up!
The thicker stuff, pictured at the top of this post, is chamal ko chhyang bhuteko. As you can see, it is served in a bowl with a spoon. Taking a bite of your alcohol may seem like a slightly thrilling change of pace, but this is no jello shot from your college days. First of all, the alcoholic sludge is served hot and has a slimy texture that can be described in no other words than fresh snot. It tastes sweeter than the liquid chhyang, almost tart. But, with the boozy aftertaste, the final impression is of something from your fridge that's gone putrid out in the sun.
So, while celebrating St. Patrick's Day wherever in the world you may be, I encourage you to raise a pint of your favorite tipple in a toast to friends, health, country, whatever you please. Please just assure me it's not a pint of fresh chhyang.GroupFull judgmentTHE REPUBLIC OF UGANDA IN THE HIGH COURT OF UGANDA SITTING AT GULU CRIMINAL REVISION No. 0002 OF 2018 VERSUS HON.

The Chief Magistrate seeks to satisfy himself as to the regularity of the proceedings now pending before him in Criminal Case No. 52 of 2018, Uganda v. Hon. Kassiano Ezati Wadri and 31 others. In that case, the thirty two accused were on 16th August, 2018 produced before the Chief Magistrate's court at Gulu and jointly charged with the offence of Treason c/s 23 (1) (b) of The Penal Code Act. It was alleged that the thirty two accused,. Being a capital offence, the accused did not take plea and were accordingly remanded to the Government prison at Gulu from where they are due to appear before the same court on 30th August, 2018 for further mention of their case. In his letter to the High Court, the Chief Magistrate's Court has expressed doubts as to whether or not it has geographical jurisdiction over the accused persons in that case, considering that the particulars of the charge sheet indicate that the overt act for which they stand charged took place in Arua, which is a different magisterial area outside the territorial boundaries of the Chief Magistrate's Court of Gulu. In accordance with section 50 (2) of The Criminal Procedure Code Act I listened to the submissions of the learned Resident Senior State Attorney Mr. Omia Patrick, representing the prosecution and those of Hon. Medard Lubega Seggona appearing together with Hon. Asuman Basalirwa and Mr. Mr. Acellam Paul Ocaya, Counsel for the accused persons. In his submissions, the learned Resident Senior State Attorney argued that under section 37 (b) and (d) of the magistrates courts act, when an offence is committed partly in one local area and partly in another and where it consists of several acts done in different local areas, the offence may be inquired into or tried by a court having jurisdiction over any of those areas. In the instant case the evidence we have and the charge sheet before court indicates that the alleged offence which culminated in the act that was committed in Arua Municipality on 13th August 2018 started from other areas, inclusive of Gulu. There was a pre-action processes which included planning and at the time of hearing they shall adduce evidence to that effect. Gulu is one of such places. The stoning of the motorcade was just the epitome of the act. He continued to argue that while the accused were arrested from within Arua Municipality, the security situation in Arua both at that time and now is still tense given the fact that the MP elect who was a candidate in that election process is accused No.1 in the case before the Chief magistrate's court in Gulu, Mr. Kassiano Wadri. Arraigning 32 persons before the magistrates court in Arua would provoke a violent situation that would give rise to more harm to both the accused, the people of Arua municipality and the security organs. Given the fact that the matter can be inquired into by courts of other local jurisdictions, including Gulu, the accused were transferred to Gulu for arraignment as inquiries continue. It was his submission that the 32 persons are properly before the Chief Magistrate's court in Gulu as one of the local jurisdictions where some of the acts giving rise to the incident were committed. He prayed that the court holds that it is lawful to have them in Gulu for arraignment and the subsequent mention of their case. As regards the High Court, he submitted that the court has unlimited original jurisdiction over all matters including treason with which the 32 accused are charged. The fact that the court is sitting in the circuit of Gulu does not bar it from hearing a criminal case. It has not been committed to this court for trial yet. The court will have the jurisdiction to try the matter once it is committed to it. Gulu was not mentioned in the charge sheet. This was an error which can be cured by having the charge sheet amended. The process of mentioning the case in the meantime can be validated, he submitted. In response, the learned defence counsel submitted that he agreed with the reasons given by the State Attorney and his interpretation on section 37 (b) and (d) of The Magistrates Courts Act. The offence having been allegedly committed in Arua, he could only comment on the propriety of the charge. The limitation on jurisdiction relates to trial. The transfer of a case is a pre-requisite for cognisance, but that is a procedural error that should have been corrected earlier but still can be cured by ratification. It is a matter of inherent unlimited jurisdiction of this court which can be exercised by the court since the Chief Magistrate's court will not try the case. The arrangement of the high court circuits has no territorial ramifications but is rather based on administrative convenience. A1 is concerned about the brutalisation of his people and would not like to have it escalated. The situation is volatile. The proceedings before the Chief Magistrate should not be quashed. The case should not be transferred back to Arua. Jurisdiction should be maintained by the Chief Magistrate of Gulu. Having considered the submissions of both counsel, the averments contained in the charge sheet, addressed my mind to the law regarding personal and geographical jurisdiction of Magistrates' Courts, the transfer of criminal cases and the powers and jurisdiction of the High Court, I found and decided ex-tempore that although there were some procedural irregularities leading up to the Chief Magistrate's court at Gulu taking cognisance of the case, they were not fatal to the proceedings and could be rectified by an order of this court ratifying the exercise of jurisdiction. The proceedings of the Chief Magistrate's Court were accordingly validated. It was directed that the accused persons are to continue appearing regularly before that court for the mention of their case in accordance with the law. I undertook to explain in a detailed ruling the reasons behind that decision, hence this ruling. In his letter, the learned Chief Magistrate expresses doubt as to whether his court has jurisdiction over the case before him. "Jurisdiction" is an omnibus term which has several meanings depending on the context. It may be used when addressing the scope of affairs a court may seek to regulate and control. It may also mean the kinds of issues a court could possibly have on its plate, i.e. the question whether a court may hear a case and decide a matter may thus be formulated as an inquiry into the jurisdiction of that court. Alternatively it may mean the factual relationship between a court and a person or a thing. It may also, somewhat colloquially, refer to a judicial entity itself. So it might be said that "other jurisdictions" deal with some issue in a particular way, which would refer to the practice of other courts. However in this context, it is used to describe the territory in which a court regularly exercises its authority. It is trite that jurisdiction is a term of comprehensive import embracing every kind of judicial action and that. The issue of jurisdiction was extensively dealt with by the Kenya. (emphasis mine).. Jurisdiction therefore is the power or authority vested in court to "decide matters that are before it" or "to take cognisance of matters in a formal way for its decision." One cannot speak of jurisdiction without the power or authority to make a decision on the merits. To have jurisdiction is to have the power to inquire into the fact, to apply the law and to declare the relief in a regular course of a judicial proceeding. This power or authority may be limited to a specific territory. Hence, "geographical or local jurisdiction" is the territory within which authority is granted to a court to deal with legal matters, to make legal decisions and judgments and to direct justice. However Jurisdiction must not be confounded with venue. Jurisdiction is the authority to hear and determine a cause, in the sense of power rather than in the sense of selection. There is thus a distinction between "jurisdiction" and "venue." Whereas venue is simply a geographic location, jurisdiction has a geographic location alongside aspects that have nothing to do with geography or location. In criminal matters, jurisdiction is a composite expression comprising; subject matter (ratione materiae), personal (ratione personae), temporal (ratione temporis), or territorial (ratione loci) considerations. The mix-up in terminology stems from the fact that according to section 42 of The Magistrates Courts Act, all criminal prosecutions, whether of misdemeanours, non-capital felonies and capital felonies, must begin in a magistrates court, yet magistrates' Courts have no jurisdiction over the latter category of cases, whose trial is the preserve of the High court. In that case, when dealing with the latter category of cases, a magistrate's court deals with issues of venue rather than subject matter jurisdiction. Geographical location (ratione loci) when considered as a component of jurisdiction is for the determination whether a court may adjudicate a matter at all, while when considered as venue it is for the determination of which court, within Uganda, is the proper forum. When provisions as to geographical location are deemed as ones of venue, their benefit must be invoked at the preliminary stage of a proceeding or they are waived. If they are deemed ones of subject matter jurisdiction, they usually can be invoked at any time during the action and may be the basis for attacking a judgment after it has been rendered. By these requirements, a distinction is made between rules of conduct and rules of adjudication in criminal law. Although the primary basis of criminal jurisdiction is territorial, jurisdiction is used in the sense of proper court, which has the authority to hear a particular case whereas venue refers to the court in which the case is to be held. The term "jurisdiction" refers to a court's power to decide a case, while the term "venue" relates to the place, the geographical situs, where a court with jurisdiction may hear a case. Consequently, jurisdiction may exist to hear and determine causes of a certain class, and yet that jurisdiction may not be permitted to attach to certain cases by reasons of limitations of venue. While certain provisions may give the courts power to hear certain causes, other provisions may limit the rights of certain parties to avail themselves of that jurisdiction. This constraint results from a combination of expediency and legal principle. A court has little interest in spending its scarce resources on trying offences that have little or no connection to its territory or persons in respect of whom it is unable to exercise control. At the same time, in a judicial system of territorially constrained courts, considerations of orderliness in the disposal of cases advocate against taking too keen a prosecutorial interest in acts occurring outside jurisdiction. It serves both the purpose of minimising the chances of conflict and duplication of judicial authority. Providing for the jurisdiction of courts on the basis geographical location is meant to give structure to the system of administration of justice by ensuring that there is orderly disposal of cases. It also helps to create efficiency within the system by reducing conflicting cognisance of cases by different courts at the same time. Enforcement is limited to measures that can be taken only within the confines of the jurisdiction and in accordance with its rules, and the enforcing court’s judgment has no coercive force outside its jurisdiction. Consequently, the criminal laws of Uganda apply to everyone in the country, but procedural limitations curb the competence of the various courts in enforcing them. In this context, territorial jurisdiction, as distinct from venue, would have to be construed to mean that fundamental "competency" which is the non-waivable aspect of jurisdiction while "venue" is the non-fundamental, waivable aspect of jurisdiction. Whereas there is a distinction between jurisdiction and venue, depending on the category of case brought before a magistrates court under section 42 of The Magistrates Courts Act, section 34 of the Act does not reflect it. Under the latter section, both jurisdiction and venue are defined by the location of criminal activity and the subject matter of the criminal activity. That section provides that subject to the provisions relating to transfer conferred by the Act, every offence is to "ordinarily be inquired into or tried" by a court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction it was committed. Consequently the personal jurisdiction of courts in a criminal case is established by the location of where a crime is committed. In the same vein, the power of courts to take cognisance of offences is primâ facie local, limited to the territory over which legislation has granted it jurisdiction, and does not extend to offences committed beyond its confines. On the face of it, Courts can take cognisance or try offences perpetrated only by certain individuals or under certain circumstances, and within a specified territory. A Court’s jurisdiction flows from either the Constitution or legislation or both. Thus, a Court of law can only exercise jurisdiction as conferred by the constitution or other written law. It cannot arrogate to itself jurisdiction exceeding that which is conferred upon it by law. A court ought to exercise its powers strictly within the jurisdictional limits prescribed by the law. Acting without jurisdiction or ultra vires or contrary to the provisions of a law or its principles are instances of illegality (see Pastoli v Kabale District Local Government Council and others [2008] 2 E.A 300). For the reason that a court can derive its general jurisdiction only from the power which created it, the law. It is trite law that no court can confer jurisdiction upon itself. It is equally trite that no court can assign or delegate jurisdiction vested in it (see Kasibante Moses v. Katongole Singh Marwana and another, H.C. Election Petition No. 23 of 2011). As stated earlier, "local jurisdiction" is the adjudicative power of the court with reference to the territory within which it is to be exercised. The territorial jurisdiction of magistrates’ courts is delimited by way of statutory instruments issued from time to time by the Minister of Justice, after consultation with the Chief Justice, in accordance with section 2 of The Magistrates Courts Act. The Magistrates Courts (Magisterial Areas) Instrument, 2017; SI No.11 of 2017 currently in force stipulates under item 19 thereof, the Gulu Chief Magisterial area comprises; a Chief Magistrate' Court at Gulu, a Grade one Magistrate Court at Aswa, a Grade one Magistrate Court at Bobi, a Grade one Magistrate Court at Gulu and a Grade one Magistrate Court at Omoro. According to section 6 of The Magistrates Courts Act, every magistrate appointed under the Act is deemed to have been appointed to, and have jurisdiction in, each and every magisterial area but may be assigned to any particular magisterial area or to a part of any magisterial area by the Chief Justice. According to section 3 of The Magistrates Courts Act, within each magisterial area, magistrates’ courts are designated and are known as the magistrates court for the area in respect of which they have jurisdiction. The purpose of these provisions is to ensure that the authority of the various magistrates is limited to certain well defined territory. For that reason the Chief Magistrates’ Court at Gulu has its local limits restricted to the geographical limits of the local government administrative units of Gulu Municipality, Aswa, Bobi, and Omoro. The geographical aspects of criminal jurisdiction have divergent implications when construed from the perspective of magistrates courts as opposed to the High Court. Whereas section 4 of The Penal Code Act, confers jurisdiction upon the courts of Uganda, to every place within Uganda, and with regard to specified offences, to offences committed outside Uganda by a Uganda citizen or person ordinarily resident in Uganda, section 3 of The Magistrates Courts Act requires that magistrates courts are established by statutory instrument designating them as magistrates courts to be known as the magistrates court for the area in respect of which they have jurisdiction. Within these specified geographical areas, the various magistrates' courts have adjudicative jurisdiction by way of the power to determine compliance with legislation and the capacity to subject persons or things to their process, as well as enforcement jurisdiction by way of the capacity to induce or compel compliance or to punish noncompliance with their orders. Thus, while a magistrate's court may be competent to try a misdemeanor offense or a non-capital offence, if the offense occurs outside its geographical territory, the court lacks jurisdiction over the offense. To the contrary, the High Court has only a county-wide territorial restriction. The High Court has unlimited original jurisdiction in all matters and such appellate and other jurisdiction as may be conferred on it by this Constitution or other law (see Article 139 (1) of The Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, 1995). In principle, if a charge for a capital offence is placed before a competent court (i.e., magistrate's court), the High Court, no matter where located in Uganda, may have subject matter jurisdiction of the offense, even when sitting outside the circuit where the offense was committed. Whereas magistrates courts are established under section 3 of The Magistrates Courts Act and The Magistrates Courts (Magisterial Areas) Instrument, 2017; SI No.11 of 2017 as part of a system of multiple, homogenous units comprising different courts of various grades spread out throughout the country, the High Court is established by Article 139 (1) of The Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, 1995, as one Court. Its sub-division into units such as divisions and circuits is not a split of its unlimited original jurisdiction but rather an administrative arrangement for the determination of venue, designed to bring its services closer to the people it serves and to promote judicial economy and efficiency in the disposal of cases under its jurisdiction. The power conferred on magistrates court by sections 42 and 168 (3) of The Magistrates Courts Act with regard to capital offences is limited to charging and committing for trial, which power is in the form of assistant, supplemental, ancillary or auxiliary jurisdiction in that it is afforded by law to a magistrate's court in aid of the High Court. Although the traditional meaning of ancillary jurisdiction is the court's authority to rule on issues and claims that it would not usually be allowed to hear, but which are related to another claim currently before the court, in this context it refers to that jurisdiction which allows a subordinate court to take cognisance of a case that would normally be outside of its subject-matter jurisdiction. This type of ancillary jurisdiction is based on considerations of judicial economy, aimed at limiting the workload of the High Court during the preliminary, pre-trial stages leading up to the trial of capital offences, triable only by the High Court. Being a jurisdiction that is ancillary in nature, contentions of lack of jurisdiction by a magistrate's court in respect of such a jurisdiction will sound only to the extent that the High Court lacks jurisdiction over the subject matter. The High Court will not have original criminal jurisdiction only if it is an offence that is not covered by section 4 of The Penal Code Act, conferring jurisdiction upon the courts of Uganda, to every place within Uganda, and with regard to specified offences, to offences committed outside Uganda by a Uganda citizen or person ordinarily resident in Uganda. Therefore in bringing this matter to the attention of this court, the learned Chief Magistrate is not expressing doubt over matters of the jurisdiction of his court, but rather its propriety as a venue. For magistrates' courts, personal jurisdiction is based on territorial concepts, that is, a court can gain personal jurisdiction over a person only if the person has a connection to a crime committed within the geographic area in which the court sits or is within its area but committed an offence anywhere within Uganda as stipulated by section 3 of The Magistrates Courts Act, thus; 31. General authority of magistrates courts. Every magistrate’s court has authority to cause to be brought before it any person who is within the local limits of its jurisdiction and is charged with an offence committed within Uganda, or which according to law may be dealt with as if it had been committed within Uganda, and to deal with the accused person according to its jurisdiction. In such cases, section 32 of the Act requires the magistrate to send the accused to the area where offence was committed. This provision is a recognition of the fact that certain actions that may be undertaken by a magistrates court are transitory and thus can be brought wherever the accused may be found. Nevertheless, in making the determination as to whether or not the person is before it in connection to a crime committed within the geographic area in which the court sits or is within its area but is charged with an offence committed within Uganda, a magistrate's court takes cognisance of the facts alleged in the particulars of the offence at the point the charge sheet is placed before that court with a view to the court taking action in respect of the alleged commission of an offence. It is thus on basis of the charge-sheet that a Magistrate takes cognisance of a case. A Magistrate takes cognisance of a criminal case when he or she has not only applied his or her mind to the contents of the charge sheet, but also has done so for the purpose of proceeding in a particular way, i.e. for taking action of some kind e.g. reading the charge to an accused, or issuing a search warrant. Taking cognisance of the case is the first step in the assessment of proper exercise of jurisdiction or propriety of the venue. Taking cognisance of the case only for determination of propriety of venue, the Magistrate applies his or her mind to the contents of the charge sheet, and may take such procedural steps as reading the charge to the accused, or issuing a search warrant, but without the ultimate specific purpose of a desire to proceed, because it is not within his or her competence to do so as he or she has no subject matter or personal jurisdiction. On the other hand, jurisdiction is exercised at the moment of taking cognisance of a case only where the court is competent to try the offence. In that case, a Magistrate applies his or her mind to the contents of the charge sheet, and may take such steps as reading the charge to the accused, or issuing a search warrant, but with the ultimate specific purpose of a desire to proceed with the trial of the case, because it is within his or her competence to do so given the fact that he or she has both personal and subject matter jurisdiction to do so. Jurisdiction over the offense is therefore acquired when a prosecution is commenced by the filing of a charge sheet in a court in the specified jurisdictional territory, competent to hear and determine the particular cause. Accordingly, both questions of jurisdiction and venue should be determined at the point where the prosecution has submitted a charge-sheet against certain named persons, before the magistrate signs the charge sheet and reads it out to the named accused. A Magistrate must be deemed to have taken cognisance of an offence when he or she, after satisfying himself or herself of its propriety, signs the charge sheet placed before him or her by the prosecution. It is not in doubt that all crime is local. Both the jurisdiction over and venue of trial of an offence is vested in the court where the crime is committed. There is therefore need to demonstrate in the particulars of the charge sheet, a real and substantial connection between the offence or the accused person and the court. As mentioned before, for magistrates' courts, personal jurisdiction is based on territorial concepts, that is, a court gains personal jurisdiction over an accused person only if that person has a connection to a crime committed within the geographic area in which the court sits as provided by section 34 of The Magistrates Courts Act, thus; 34. Ordinary place of trial. Subject to the provisions relating to transfer conferred by this Act, every offence shall ordinarily be inquired into or tried by a court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction it was committed. It was argued by the learned Resident Senior State Attorney that by stating in the charge sheet that the accused are alleged to have committed the offence in "Arua and other places within Uganda," this alone was capable of designating the Chief Magistrate's Court at Gulu as the appropriate venue. This argument is not persuasive at all. Prosecution owes the court a duty to disclose in the charge sheet facts that indicate a real and substantial connection between the offence or the accused person and the court. This is an important aspect of jurisdictional and venue determinations that should not be left as a matter of inference to be deduced from such vague statements as "other places within Uganda." To hold otherwise would be to allow room for uncertainty in the commencement of prosecutions. Applying the rule of adjudication (criminal procedure) is a necessary step in the determination of an alleged violation of a rule of conduct (substantive criminal law). The former is an external trigger, a condition for application of the rule of conduct. It is in that regard that determinations of jurisdiction and venue are triggered by specific places mentioned in the charge sheet not by speculative surmises based on vague statements contained therein. Although not specifically stated as a requirement under section 23 (1) (b) of The Penal Code Act, by convention a charge of treason must specify the overt act(s) and the place(s) where they occurred. The overt act requirement is a procedural safeguard ensuring that some act in general was in fact done (since words alone do not constitute treason) and that put into context the stipulated act was part of a treasonous plot (that the treasonous nature was not fabricated by political enemies). The procedures simply stand as a safeguard that the accused did not just think or imagine treason, but actually began to act on a plot. The overt act required to charge someone with an offence must have occurred within the geographical jurisdiction of the court where the charge is preferred, and it should be specifically stated in the charge sheet. To ask court to infer that "other places within Uganda" includes Gulu is to abdicate that responsibility. To illustrate the importance of this requirement further, section 35 of The Magistrates Courts Act, requires that trials should take place where the criminal act is done or consequence of the offence ensues. It provides thus; 35. Trial at place where act done or consequence of offence ensues. When a person is accused of principles of statutory construction we are required, if possible, to interpret statutory language in such a manner as to give it meaning and a useful function. The primary objective in construing a statute is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature. The best evidence of legislative intent is the language of the statute itself, which must be given its plain, ordinary and popularly understood meaning. Each word, clause and sentence of a statute must be given a reasonable construction, if possible, and should not be rendered superfluous. In determining the meaning of a statute, a court will not read language in isolation, but must consider it in the context of the entire statute. Clear and unambiguous language will be enforced as written. In addition, a court may consider the reason for the law, the problems sought to be remedied, the purposes to be achieved, and the consequences of construing the statute one way or another. Moreover, courts will presume that the legislature did not intend to enact a statute that leads to absurdity, inconvenience, or injustice. The interpretation of section 35 of The Magistrate's Courts Act should give it meaning and purpose with relation to capital offences. In this context, if the territorial restriction contained therein is deemed to be a subject matter jurisdiction, then it would mean that no High Court Circuit outside the magisterial area where the offence was committed, could ever have subject matter jurisdiction over the offense. This would have the absurd effect of elevating administrative units of the High Court to the level of distinct "High Courts." Consequently, whereas section 35 of The Magistrate's Courts Act deprives a magistrate's court of jurisdiction of the person of the accused and the offence, if venue is improper, with regard to capital offences that provision should be construed as relating solely to venue, with no effect on the jurisdiction of the court. Hence, no jurisdictional significance whatever may be attributed to improper venue in relation to capital offences commenced before a magistrate's court, since in that context section 35 of The Magistrate's Courts Act relates solely to venue, and has no jurisdictional significance. Even though a charge for a capital offence is brought in the wrong magistrate's court, this fact does not impair the jurisdiction of that court to any extent whatever. This becomes a mere procedural irregularity that can be cured by, waiver, ratification or validation. When considered in context, the plain language of section 35 of The Magistrate's Courts Act merges into two concepts; jurisdiction over the subject matter (the offence), the person (offender) and the place or venue (geographical location) where the trial is to take place. It clearly states the normal rule as being that an offence should ordinarily be inquired into and tried by a court within whose local jurisdiction it was committed. Although use the expression "ordinarily" manifests an intention that the provision is not to be construed peremptorily, in the absence of statutory provisions to the contrary, venue must as well be laid in the jurisdiction where the offense is committed. Accordingly, determinations of both geographical jurisdiction and venue requires a demonstration in the charge sheet, of a nexus between the alleged criminal conduct, the alleged offender and the geographical limits of the territory over which the magistrate's court in which the charge is preferred, exercises authority. One approach to the determination of territorial jurisdiction or venue is the gravamen or completion of the offence test. The gravamen of a criminal charge or complaint is the material part of the charge. Exclusive jurisdiction belongs to the court where the essential aspects of the offence took place or where it was completed (see for example R. v. Ellis, [1899] 1 Q.B. 230; R. v. Harden, [1962] 1 All E.R. 286; R. v. Stoddart (1909), 2 Cr. App. R. 217 and Professor Glanville Williams; "Venue and the Ambit of Criminal Law" (1965), 81 L.Q.R. 276, 276‑288, 395‑421, 518 et seq.). Application of either the gist of the offence test or the completion of the offence test has the effect of limiting the courts' jurisdiction in criminal matters to a single location, namely, where the essential element of the offence occurred or where it was completed. The other approach is the continuity of offences test which posits that any court within whose territorial jurisdiction a substantial or any part of the chain of events constituting an offence takes place may take jurisdiction (see for example R. v. Godfrey, [1923] 1 K.B. 24; R . v. Wall, [1974] 1 W.L.R. 930; Secretary of State for Trade v. Markus, [1976] A.C. 35 and Treacy v. Director of Public Prosecutions, supra; R. v. Baxter, [1972] 1 Q.B. 1). Whereas section 37 (b) and (d) of The Magistrates Courts Act, permits inquiry into or trial of an offence by a court having jurisdiction over any of two or more geographical jurisdictions when an offence is committed partly in one local area and partly in another and where it consists of several acts done in different local areas, whichever of the two approaches is used in determining whether a crime should be prosecuted in a particular area, court inevitably considers the substantial links that connect the crime to that jurisdiction. It is undeniable that there may be sufficient links to different jurisdictions to justify proceedings in more than one place but there is no way a court at the time of charging an accused person will be able to determine that a place within its territorial jurisdiction is one of such places unless it is explicitly stated in the particulars of the charge. Territorial considerations are so important to a magistrate's court to the extent that even where a person accused of having committed an offence within Uganda has escaped or is removed from the area within which the offence was committed and is found within another area, the magistrate’s court within whose jurisdiction the person is found is required to cause him or her to be brought before it and then unless authorized to proceed in the case, send the person in custody to the court within whose jurisdiction the offence is alleged to have been committed, or require the person to give security for his or her surrender to that court there to answer the charge and to be dealt with according to law (see section 32 of The Penal Code Act). Having determined that jurisdiction and venue are distinct legal concepts, in that jurisdiction relates to the power of a court to decide the merits of a case, while venue determines where the case is to be heard, it follows that statutory venue requirements with regard to capital offences whose prosecution is commenced in accordance with section 42 of The Magistrates Courts Act are procedural only and do not have any relation to the question of the jurisdiction of a magistrate's court. That notwithstanding, considering that the purpose of a criminal trial is to dispense fair and impartial justice, uninfluenced by extraneous considerations, there are occasions when strict compliance with venue requirements may lead to the exact opposite. If it appears that the dispensation of criminal justice is not possible, impartially, objectively and without any bias, at any place, the appropriate court may transfer the case to another court, where it feels that holding of fair and proper trial is conducive. When it is shown that public confidence in the fairness of a trial would be seriously undermined, the court at its own motion or any of the parties may seek the transfer of a case. That power is contained in section 41 of The Magistrate's Courts Act which provides thus; 41. Power of High Court to change venue. (1) Whenever it is made to appear to the High Court— (a) that a fair and impartial trial or inquiry cannot be had in any magistrate’s court; (b) that some question of law of unusual difficulty is likely to arise; (c) that a view of the place in or near which any offence has been committed may be required for the satisfactory inquiry into or trial of the offence; (d) that an order under this section will tend to the general convenience of the parties or witnesses; or (e) that such an order is expedient for the ends of justice or is required by any provision of this Act, it may order— (f) that any offence be tried or inquired into by any court not empowered under the preceding sections of this Part of this Act, but in other respects competent to inquire into or try that offence; (g) that any particular criminal case or class of cases be transferred from a criminal court subordinate to its authority to any other such criminal court of equal or superior jurisdiction; (h) that an accused person be committed for trial to itself. (2) The High Court may act either. This provision enumerates, although not exhaustively, the extraordinary circumstances which would justify a departure from the stipulation that the place where the offence is committed is where the, inquiry into, prosecution and trial of a case has to be conducted. A motion to transfer is allowed on the ground that prosecution was commenced within the right jurisdiction, but for exceptional reasons, the case should be transferred to another venue outside jurisdiction, subject to any equitable terms and conditions that may be prescribed. Although whether or not a particular person should be prosecuted in a specified court is the concern of procedural law, not a question of the reach of the criminal prohibitions of the State, the rules of venue in criminal cases are of fundamental importance to territorial jurisdiction and venue so as not to compel an accused person to move to and appear in a different court from that within whose territory the crime was committed, as it would cause him or her great inconvenience in looking for his or her witnesses and other evidence in another place. Courts thus begin with a presumption of reasonableness of the venue designated by the laws of procedure which can only be overcome by a compelling case that due to the presence of some other considerations, that venue is rendered unreasonable. It would be a negative reflection upon the credibility of not only the entire judiciary but also the prosecuting agencies, it would not only undermine order but also fairness, if the choice of forum is determined whimsically. It is no wonder therefore that in deciding cases, courts have to look beyond violation of the rules of conduct but holistically at the rules of adjudication as well. The right to a fair trial is guaranteed by article 28 (1) of The Constitution of the Republic of Uganda and it requires "a fair, speedy and public hearing before an independent and impartial court or tribunal established by law." As regards the pre-trial stage (inquiry, investigation, committal), the concept canvases criminal proceedings as a whole. This is because some requirements of that article, such as the "speedy" requirement, may also be relevant at the pre-trial stage of proceedings in so far as the fairness of the trial is likely to be seriously prejudiced by initial failures at that stage. Steps and measures taken right from the point of arrest have a direct influence on the conduct and fairness of the subsequent proceedings, including the actual trial. Accordingly, article 28 (1) of The Constitution of the Republic of Uganda takes effect right from the point of arrest, throughout the investigation, at the point of charging and all other pre-trial proceedings. The right to a fair trial may be fundamentally impaired by a procedural irregularity at that stage. In criminal trials, proceedings may be stayed in the exercise of the judicial officer's discretion not only where a fair trial is impossible but also where it would be contrary to the public interest in the integrity of the criminal justice system that trial should take place. For example, in extreme cases courts have refused to countenance behaviour that threatens either basic human rights or the rule of law, for example in Dr. Kizza Besigye and ten others v. The Attorney General, Constitutional Petition No. 07 of 2007, a criminal trial was stayed on account of the fact that the accused could no longer receive a fair trial in light of what security and other State agencies had done at the premises of and Headquarters of the third organ of State (the Judiciary)." The Constitutional Court found that this conduct constituted an outrageous affront to the Constitution, constitutionalism and the Rule of Law in Uganda. It stated; "This court cannot sanction." That case serves as an example to show that in criminal trials, despite the fact that the charges may be grave, the merits of the case and that a fair trial may still be possible, proceedings have been stayed on broader considerations of the integrity of the criminal justice system. It is recognised that a person charged with having committed a criminal offence should receive a fair trial and that, if he or she cannot be tried fairly for that offence, he or she should not be tried for it at all. Proceedings may be stayed in the exercise of the judge’s discretion not only where a fair trial is impossible but also where it would be contrary to the public interest in the integrity of the criminal justice system that a trial should take place (see Regina v. Horseferry Road Magistrates’ Court, ex Parte Bennett (No 1), [1993] 3 WLR 90, [1994] 1 AC 42, (1993) 3 All ER 138, (1994) 98 Cr App R 114). The question there is whether the behaviour is "so unworthy or shameful that it was an affront to the public conscience to allow the prosecution to proceed," (see Regina v. Latif; Regina v. Shahzad, [1996] 1 WLR 104, [1996] 2 Cr App R 92, [1996] 1 All ER 353, [1996] Crim LR 92).. In Uganda v. Shabahuria Matia, H. C. Criminal Revisional Cause No. Msk-00-CR-0005 of 1999 (unreported) for example, a stay was ordered on account of the fact that the period of three and half years without committing an accused for trial, without an explanation for the delay by the state, was found to be oppressive, amounting to an abuse of the process of the court warranting the extreme remedy of ordering a stay of prosecution. Selecting a venue for any subsequent step taken in the process leading up to and including the trial is therefore not a matter to be taken lightly as it has a bearing on the concept of a fair trial. Selecting a forum is a necessary practice for any prosecutor filing a charge. The decision should be guided by the procedural laws regulating venue. Forum selection is simply a procedural part of litigation, when it takes place within the rules, but may easily turn into forum shopping. "Forum shopping" typically refers to the act of seeking the most advantageous venue in which to try a case. Whereas seeking a venue in which a fair trial can be better guaranteed would be a decision in the interest of justice, where it is sought for purposes of gaining some unfair advantage or opportunity to begin with the odds in one's favour, would be a subversion of justice in that in the latter situation it is designed to undermine the principle of equal protection of the law. Forum shopping is abhorred when it involves conduct that either compromises the other party’s fair trial interests or the integrity of the justice system. It may be evinced by misconduct, improper motive or bad faith in the approach adopted by the party, going beyond mere legitimate tactics before the court, or evidence of irremediable impairment to the fair trial interests or that the conduct has prejudiced the other party's ability to have a trial within a reasonable time. Courts have traditionally expressed a strong anti-forum shopping sentiment. Forum shopping is generally disparaged as an abuse of process because it calls into question the courts' and the judicial system's ability to be impartial and even-handed. In McShannon v. Rockware Glass Ltd. [1978] A.C. 795, Lord Diplock rejected existence of forum non conveniens (the non convenience doctrine positing the discretionary power that allows courts to dismiss a case where another court, or forum, is much better suited to hear the case) in common law stating that for the interests of all the parties and for the ends of justice, the jurisdiction must be exercised - however desirable it may be on grounds of public interest or public policy that the litigation should be conducted elsewhere and not in the English courts. There appears to be two categories of abuse of process;- (a) conduct affecting the fairness of the trial; and (b) conduct that contravenes fundamental notions of justice and thus undermines the integrity of the judicial process. Forum shopping may result in either. Concurrent jurisdiction between courts at the same level of hierarchy in the court structure may be the only legally acceptable means by which a litigant can select a venue or "forum shop" (horizontal forum shopping). Vertical forum shopping is discouraged by the principle that where an inferior and superior court have concurrent jurisdiction, then the matter must first be heard by the inferior court before it is presented before the superior court. The power of transfer of case is not one to be exerted as a matter of routine. It is a power to be judicially exercised and requires that the reasons be recorded. The court must first conduct an enquiry and then decide whether such transfer is in the interest of justice or whether the application has been made with an intention to defeat justice. If the grounds of filing such application are found to be false, frivolous or vexatious the court would dismiss the application. The powers of transfer of cases conferred upon Chief Magistrates are limited by section 171 of The Magistrate's Courts Act to cases of which he or she has taken cognisance for trial to another magistrate holding a court empowered to try the case within the magisterial area of the jurisdiction of that chief magistrate. Cases may be transferred based on improper venue but it follows that a Chief Magistrate cannot transfer cases of which no court within his or her geographical jurisdiction has taken cognisance. For example in Ankwatsa Mary v. Uganda, H.C. Crim. Rev. No. 004 of 2013 the Chief Magistrate Nakawa after taking plea and listening to the testimony of three witnesses, ordered the file to be transferred to the Chief Magistrates Court of Buganda Road. In an application to the High Court for the revision of that order, it was contended by counsel for the accused that the initial decision of the Chief Magistrate at Nakawa to proceed without jurisdiction was a nullity and that the subsequent decision of the Chief Registrar and Chief Magistrate of Nakawa to transfer the file from one magisterial area to another was unlawful. Dismissing that contention, the High Court held that since the charge sheet showed that the offences charged were committed at the Land offices Kampala which was within the Kampala Magisterial Area within the Chief magistrate’s Court at Buganda Road and Mengo, the Chief Magistrate at Nakawa was right when after realizing that the offence was committed within the jurisdiction of Buganda Road she declined to further proceed with the hearing. The reference of the file to the Chief Magistrate Court of Buganda Road to handle the matter was confirmed and an order made for the file to be accordingly forwarded. The rules which guide the determination of what courts and magisterial areas criminal prosecutions may be commenced are fixed by sections 42, 31, 35 of The Magistrates Courts Act read together with The Magistrates Courts (Magisterial Areas) Instrument, 2017; SI No.11 of 2017. Departure from these rules is only acceptable in exceptional circumstances, determined by courts upon which that primary jurisdiction or venue is cast, at their own motion or upon application of either party. Exceptionally, the courts may refuse to take cognisance, hear or decide a case, if they believe it would be better for the case to be heard before a court having equivalent jurisdiction in another judicial area, because this would increase the likelihood of an efficient and impartial hearing of the particular case. Jurisdiction or venue may be declined or the proceeding transferred when the court is manifestly inappropriate relative to another more appropriate court that could exercise jurisdiction. In making that decision, the court vested with primary jurisdiction or venue by the laws of procedure, takes into account, in particular: any inconvenience to the parties in view of their habitual residence, the nature and location of the evidence, including documents and witnesses, and the procedures for obtaining such evidence, their safety, and so on. The paramount consideration is the interest of justice. The case will not be transferred if the reasons advanced are unlikely to have any negative impact on the justice of the case. For example in Ranjit Singh v. Popat Rambhaji Sonavane AIR 1983 SC P.291, the complainant while proceeding towards his house on 19th November, 1981 at about 8.00 p.m., was accosted by the nine accused persons who abused and threatened to kill him. He was robbed of a golden chain and an amount of Rs. 500/-. The complainant went to lodge the first information report to the police chowki, but the police declined to accept the information and take follow-up action. Therefore, on 23rd November, 1981, the complainant initiated a private prosecution in the Magistrates Court. The learned Magistrate took cognizance and held a preliminary enquiry and thereafter the learned Magistrate framed a charge against the accused for having committed multiple offences under The Penal Code Act. The learned Magistrate committed the case to the Court of Sessions at Pune. The complainant filed an application seeking transfer of the trial from Pune to Indore alleging that two of the accused were relations of the local police officers and because of an incident in the town of Ahmednagar in which the brother of the complainant was murdered, the entire police force of Maharashtra had become inimical to the complainant. He stated that he was forced to shift to Indore and if he was required to go to Pune for prosecuting the case, his safety was in danger and on that ground he sought transfer of the case. The accused opposed the application for the transfer of the case contending that they had been in jail unnecessarily for the last seven months and transfer of the case would further delay the hearing of the case which would necessitate their continued detention in jail. On basis of assurances made by the State Attorney that the State would extend all possible facilities as directed by that Court to ensure the safety and security of the complainant which should put an end an apprehension about the safety and security of the complainant and would also knock-out the ground on which the petition for transfer was founded, the court found that the allegation made by the complaint as a basis for seeking transfer of the case was too nebulous a ground for transferring a case from Pune to Indore. The court further noted that all four witnesses to testify at the trial were from Pune. It instead chose to take necessary precaution for assuring the safety of the complainant when he would be required to attend the Court at Pune. The application for transfer of the case was rejected. In contrast, in Kaushalya Devi v. Mool Raj, 1964 Cr. L.J. 233, the accused filed an application before the superior court seeking transfer of a case pending before a subordinate court to another court on ground that that the facts alleged by the complainant might perhaps constitute a civil dispute but the said facts had been deliberately twisted and a criminal charge had been made to harass the accused. The trial magistrate himself swore an affidavit opposing the application and stating, inter alia, that the clause indemnifying the purchaser contained in the deed of sale on which the accused relied would not absolve him from criminal liability. Deciding that the case ought to be transferred, the superior court held; The action of the Magistrate in making an-affidavit and opposing the application for transfer was wholly improper. In criminal trials, particularly, it was of utmost importance that the Magistrate who tried the case must remain fearless, impartial and objective; and if a Magistrate chose to make an affidavit challenging the application made by in accused person whose case was pending in his court, made the said affidavit on behalf of the Administration, and in the affidavit put a strong plea opposing the transfer, all essential attributes of a fair and impartial criminal trial were immediately put in jeopardy. Even without considering the merits of the contentions raised by the petition or, it was expedient in the ends of justice that the case should be transferred to some other court of competent jurisdiction. It is demonstrated by that case that a transfer of venue will be appropriate where it is expedient in the interests of justice. It will also be appropriate where there was every likelihood of physical harm being caused to the parties. The court considering such factors is not equipped to conduct a general inquiry and assessment of the general implications if it were to allow transfer of the case. Considerations of policy which cannot be dealt with in this way should be left out of account. However tempting it may be to give effect to concerns about the expense and inconvenience to the administration of justice of prosecuting cases, such as this, in a court other than that within whose territorial jurisdiction the offence is alleged to have been committed, the argument must be resolved upon an examination of their effect upon the interests of the parties who are before the court and securing the ends of justice in their case. If any of the above conditions is satisfied, the High Court may, acting either on the report of the lower Court, or on the application of an interested party, or on its own initiative (suo motu), order a transfer. Therefore, only when a Magistrate to whom the rules confer authority as the proper venue has taken cognisance of a case committed within his or her geographical area, may he or she then invoke section 41 of The Magistrates Courts Act to cause the High Court to transfer the case to another Chief Magistrate's Court. I find that based on the particulars of offence as stated in the charge sheet, and in accordance with sections 42, 31, 35 of The Magistrates Courts Act read together with The Magistrates Courts (Magisterial Areas) Instrument, 2017; SI No.11 of 2017, the proper venue for the commencement of this prosecution was the Arua Chief Magistrate's Court. Consequently, it is that court that should have sought the transfer of the case and the justifications thereof ought to have been considered by the Resident Judge at Arua. To the extent that in the instant case the charge was preferred in the Chief Magistrate's court of Gulu before any magistrate's court in Arua, where the offence is explicitly alleged to have been committed, took cognisance of it, this undoubtedly occasioned a procedural error. Nevertheless, errors of this kind are considered only procedural, not amounting to a defect of jurisdiction. For example in Slepicka v. The Illinois Department of Public Health, 2014 IL 116927, the Illinois Supreme Court rejected a claim that improper venue was a jurisdictional defect necessitating dismissal. In any event, under section 166 of The Magistrate's Courts Act, where a charge is brought against a person in a court having no jurisdiction to try the offence with which he or she is charged, the magistrate is required to remand the accused person in custody to appear before a court having jurisdiction to try that offence. It follows that filing of a case in an improper venue does not necessarily deprive the court of subject matter jurisdiction. I accordingly hold that this error can be cured by this court taking upon itself the task of evaluating the material placed before it and determining whether or not it discloses sufficient justification for selection of Gulu as venue instead of Arua, the latter being the place designated by the relevant laws, albeit by way of validation or ratification. A careful perusal of section 41 of The Magistrates Courts Act, shows that the provision clearly enunciates that the paramount norms of transfer of venue are "expediency" and "the interests of justice." Where the apprehensions that an accused will not get a fair trial are unsubstantiated, or if such claims are based on flimsy, unreasonable or irrational grounds, the selection of venue cannot be validated retrospectively. The High Court will not validate, permit or encourage such transfer unless it is satisfied that there are some grounds on which the apprehensions of the accused or the prosecution may be regarded as reasonable. A person seeking change or transfer of venue is not under any obligation to establish conclusively that in absence of transfer the interest of justice in the specific case would fail. The applicant only needs to reasonably substantiate his or her contentions regarding such application. There must be a reasonable apprehension on the part of a party to a case that justice will not be done if proceedings are conducted by the court which would otherwise have been the appropriate venue. A mere allegation of apprehension is not enough, the court has to be satisfied that the apprehension is reasonable. The rules of procedure are designed to ensure that the parties will have a fair and impartial hearing at all stages of the proceedings. This process must establish the cause why the accused can’t receive a fair trial in the jurisdiction where it is required by the rules of venue to take place. In a case where a significant number of the essential attributes of a fair and impartial trial are put in jeopardy, then section 41 (1) (a), or (d), or (e) of The Magistrates Courts Act, or a combination thereof may be invoked in a bid to promote a fair and impartial trial or inquiry, the general convenience of the parties or witnesses, or expedience for the ends of justice. In the instant case, from what I have gathered from the record of the court below and from the submissions of counsel, the choice of venue was made by the prosecution. Considering the fact that had the prosecution followed the right procedure in seeking a transfer of venue, section 41 (3) of The Magistrates Courts Act would have exempted them from the need to back their grounds for seeking to do so with an affidavit, I will take into account the submissions of the learned Resident State Attorney, without the necessity of requiring proof. From his submissions, the decision was backed by the prosecution's apprehension of the likelihood of proceedings when initiated and conducted in Arua provoking "a violent situation that would give rise to more harm to both the accused, the people of Arua municipality and the security organs." I am inclined to believe the prosecution considering that treason is an offence of a political character, or one that is politically motivated, the potential for parallel emotions of public approbation, anxiety and panic, all in one, accompanying any indictment of treason cannot be ignored. Very few offences, if any, have that particular or similar inflaming association. On the other hand, the record of proceedings of the court below shows that a significant number of the accused, through their counsel, claimed to have suffered varying forms of physical torture during or shortly after arrest while in Arua, to the extent that the Chief Magistrate at Gulu deemed it necessary to direct the prison authorities in the Gulu Government Prison where they are currently remanded, to ensure that they are accorded their right "to be availed proper medical care at a facility of their choice..." This came about as a backdrop to counsel having chronicled in some detail the more grave degree of injury sustained by some of the accused while in that jurisdiction. That the Chief Magistrate, who had the opportunity to see the accused in respect of whom those injuries were narrated to have been inflicted found it necessary to make such an order, this court that has not had the benefit of seeing the accused, has no basis for doubting the genuineness of those claims. It is no wonder that counsel for the accused did not oppose the decision by the prosecution, of selecting Gulu as the venue for the commencement of these proceedings. I therefore find that it has been proved to the required standard that it was in the interest of justice when the prosecution made that venue selection decision. In any event, courts acknowledge that unlike subject matter jurisdiction which cannot be conferred by consent of the parties, territorial jurisdiction can be conferred by the consent of parties. For example in People v. Jackson (1983)150 Cal. App. 3d Supp. 1, 198 Cal. Rptr. 135, the appellant contended that his trial and conviction in the Alhambra Judicial District, located within Los Angeles County for an offence alleged to have occurred in the Oaks area which is located in the County of Ventura, was a nullity. During the trial, after he was found guilty, but before judgment was pronounced, he moved for a new trial and to arrest the judgment under the relevant provisions of the law. In his motions appellant argued that the court lacked jurisdiction since the victim "testified that the misdemeanour was committed on a fire road in the Thousand Oaks area which is located in the County of Ventura. The trial court found the testimony inconclusive as to whether the crime had occurred in Los Angeles County or Ventura County, but reasoned that lack of jurisdiction was waived under a provision of the Penal Code, when he failed to raise this ground prior to trial. The court held that all municipal courts in the State of California had subject matter jurisdiction over all misdemeanours committed in the State of California. A provision of the Penal Code defined territorial jurisdiction of the court and placed territorial jurisdictions for the misdemeanours committed in that county, and that another provision stipulated a procedure whereby if a case was filed in a county not having territorial jurisdiction then the case should be transferred. But absent that procedure, the Act permitted the trial court, once a trial has commenced, to hear the case to its conclusion. The court denied both motions. On appeal to the California Court of Appeal, the appellant argued that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case since the prosecution failed to meet its burden of proving venue in the Alhambra Judicial District. Dismissing the appeal, the court held; Sometimes territorial jurisdiction is indistinguishable from subject matter jurisdiction. Whatever term is used, the concept of authority to decide a particular type of legal controversy is sometimes difficult or impossible to distinguish from that of territorial jurisdiction. For example, when reference is made to a court's authority to determine a matter of status or to determine interests in property, it can be said that the state's connection to the status or the property is a matter territorial jurisdiction or that it is one of subject matter jurisdiction. Indeed, sometimes the distinction can be intelligently made only by consideration of the differences in consequence that follow from the classification. If the matter is regarded as one of territorial jurisdiction, it is waived by a party who appears in the original action if he does not make proper threshold objection. If the matter is regarded as one of subject matter jurisdiction, the parties not inevitably waive it by litigating the merits and the court may raise the question on its own motion......Although subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred on a court by consent of the parties, territorial jurisdiction can be so conferred." (People v. Tabucchi (1976) 64 Cal. App. 3d 133, 141 [134 Cal. Rptr. 245].) Both parties in the matter before the Chief Magistrate have consented to that venue. The power of transfer is intended to avoid any hardship, inconvenience and anomaly in the criminal justice system such as is likely to undermine the interests of justice. While no universal or hard and fast rules can be prescribed for deciding an application to transfer, which has always to be decided on the basis of the facts of each case, the convenience of parties, including the witnesses to be produced at the trial, is a relevant consideration. This includes the convenience of the prosecution, the accused, the witnesses and the larger interests of society. I found in this case that the relevant criteria was met and it is on that basis that I ratified or validated the proceedings now pending before the Chief Magistrates Court in Gulu, and I re-state that the accused persons are to continue appearing regularly before that court for the mention of their case in accordance with the law.

By all rights, All My Puny Sorrows should be a bleak, miserable read. Thanks to Toews, it isn’t. This book made me laugh out loud many times. That hasn’t happened in a great long while–I can’t even remember the last book that made me literally laugh out loud. I guess you have to laugh through your tears sometimes.
“I too a sister had, an only Sister–
She lov’d me dearly, and I doted on her!
To her I poured forth all my puny sorrows”
When she was a teenager, Yoli’s older sister Elf took on ‘All My Puny Sorrows’ as her personal brand. Decades later, Yoli uncovers the source of the term in the passage above (within a poem by Coleridge). It’s a passage that sums up the relationship between Yoli and Elf, as well as the difficult place Yoli has found herself.
Elf has always been a brilliant girl with an anarchic disregard for rules or structure. She has gained worldwide fame as a concert pianist but nothing has been able to cure the darkness she feels within herself. Following a suicide attempt, Elf finds herself in the psychiatric ward of a hospital under constant watch. But once Elf has made up her mind she will not change it, so she turns to her sister–who has always been there for her–for help. She wants Yoli to help her die. Obviously, Yoli balks at the very notion, but as her sister continues to not get better she must ask herself how you help a loved one who truly wants to die.
Such a bleak premise may understandably scare many readers away, but those who flee are missing out on one of the most darkly funny meditations on love, family, sisterhood, and the dual natures of life and death that has ever been put to the page. And Toews knows of what she writes: her own sister was a celebrated pianist who cut her life short.
There are far too many quotes I could list here to prove what an incredible work this book is. Suffice to say that if you pick it up, bring a pen with you to note them so you can savor them for years to come. And if you do venture into All My Puny Sorrows, odds are you’ll be captivated from the very beginning. I find the first six pages in particular to be gorgeous. This book now stands with The Virgin Suicides among my favorite openings for a novel ever.
All My Puny Sorrows is a devastating work (not to mention devastatingly funny), and a beautiful ode to sisterhood. I don’t think this book will be leaving me for a long time. It will haunt me for many years in the best possible way.

FREDERICTON – New Brunswick’s opposition on Friday known as for the government to enable participants to seem virtually in the legislature after three Liberals from the Edmundston scheme had been absent from the dwelling because of COVID-19.
The scheme in the northwest of the province has seen a high replace of infections and is below the “red” pandemic-alert level, which is a partial lockdown.
Participants Chuck Chiasson and Jean-Claude D’Amours decided not to commute to Fredericton to eradicate from seemingly unfold, while Francine Landry is mourning the brand new COVID-19-related death of her father.
Period in-between Liberal Leader Roger Melanson mentioned he believes most participants favor the power to participate virtually if COVID-19 prevents them from travelling to the capital. “I essentially essentially feel there’s a majority of MLAs who favor it, so we’ll quit preventing having beefy debates on considerable points that New Brunswick goes by lawful now,” Melanson advised journalists open air the legislature.
Inexperienced Leader David Coon mentioned the Progressive Conservative government of Premier Blaine Higgs has ideal held 18 traditional sittings in the legislature because the narrate of emergency became declared 11 months prior to now. He mentioned changes will must rating already been made allowing participants to participate virtually.
“That trudge will must rating been brought again in December when all four leaders publicly mentioned here’s how we take into consideration we must always always proceed in the face of the narrate of emergency and the narrate of the pandemic and zones shutting down,” Coon mentioned.
Training Minister Dominic Cardy, alternatively, has persistently expressed his opposition to virtual participation, announcing debates must happen face-to-face in the legislature.
Premier Blaine Higgs mentioned the technology for virtual sessions is in space and that discussions about the exercise of this can proceed till March 16, when participants return to the legislature for the provincial budget.
“The ask of comes down to the major route of below which now we rating the legislative complaints and the debate of wanting unanimous consent to bag that,” the premier mentioned.
Folk’s Alliance Leader Kris Austin, meanwhile, mentioned virtual participation must ideal be authorized below coarse circumstances. “I’m not fully in opposition to it, nevertheless I deem it would must be coarse measures in the sense that you just’re diagnosed with COVID, you’re self-atmosphere aside resulting from COVID, or something to that regard,” he mentioned Friday.
Austin mentioned it is miles extreme to withhold the custom of elected officers travelling to the legislature to conduct government commerce in person.
“We’ve been doing this for over 100 years,” he mentioned. “I peek no cause why this pandemic must quit that.”

Then life goes awry, and you miss in the future of lower-body coaching, for example. Do you go back to the upper body the next day or attempt to catch up on the decrease-body workout you missed? Consistency is difficult enough with out that additional stress of in the future throwing off your whole schedule. Additionally, some folks turn into jaded when power training every day, which can in the end lead to full avoidance. Habits are inclined to rapidly turn into man’s second nature, and gym workout routines are no exception.
- Weight machines are nice for serving to gym newbies study correct kind, but once you’ve obtained it down, it’s time to move to free weights.
- For more intense workouts with heavier weights, depart two days between strength coaching exercises of the identical muscle group.
- That’s largely as a result of free-weight workouts faucet a wider range of muscles.
Because of this, many ladies endure bone density testing. The consternation resulting from a prognosis of osteoporosis or osteopenia may cause some girls concern about exercise. However, the NOF strongly recommends regular bodily activity to include weight-bearing/impression and resistance/strengthening routines.
While a case can be made for working the higher physique in the future and the lower body the following, there’s a draw back. Not solely can you feel off-balance, but that routine requires a commitment for day by day energy training.
Technical errors stop progress, delay the outcomes and make you prone to injuries. By nurturing the best habits, you will be able to simply use the correct technique in more superior levels of your workout routine. Remember to coach all muscle groups throughout your coaching session.New and improved versions of popular movies
With the semester ending, we all need some new movies to break up our Wendy Wellesley workloads and help us relax. Movies that’ll make us laugh, cry, think, feel, run, cook, jump, verbs! I don’t know about you, but I’m pretty sick of the normal movies. Boy meets girl, they fall in love, one of them turns out to be a vampire. Here are some movies I’m looking forward to watching as soon as 20th Century Fox responds to my requests:
Interstellar 2: InterSTELLA! —Interstellar 2
Sure, “Interstellar” was great. Three hours of wondering whether Matthew McConaughey’s going to clear his throat once and for all? Where do I sign up?! But, I will say that one thing missing from the space-time continuum of hilarious intergalactic conundrums was the one thing “A Streetcar Named Desire” had – that scene where the guy yells “STELLA!” “InterSTELLA!” is “Interstellar,” just with that extra scene. Trust me, makes a world of a difference.
Gone Girl 2 — Gone Guy
Sure, we love the sexual tension rising and falling between these two nutjobs (Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike), and at times even I was like, “Come on! Get it together, guys!” I mean, all couples go through something. That’s the challenge! It’s always a classic game of “He said, she said, he didn’t murder her and dispose of her body, she’s definitely missing and all fingers point to that.” As an audience member, I was left only half satisfied. Only half so because even though this movie was about a girl AND a guy, the title is just about the “girl”! “Gone Guy” follows a similar plot but instead of Ben Affleck disappearing, it’s his father, played by Liam Neeson. Which brings me to…
Taken 4 — Miss Taken
I don’t know about you (I wish I did; I’ve heard you’re the best), but there’s nothing like watching a movie in which Liam Neeson is super tense and on the phone trying to get a lady (any lady! Daughter, mother, Aunt Pam, whom he’d rather not talk to but, hey, he can’t ignore when she’s been kidnapped, you know the drill with family) back home. But in this era of ladies having-it-all, can we see an Irish woman get Liam Neeson back?! In Taken 4: Miss Taken, a brave woman (played by Liam Neeson wearing a dress) gets back onto the ol’ phone (played by Liam Neeson wearing a phone costume) and says the following line: “I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.” Every character is played by Liam Neeson in a quasi-Tyler Perry-esque way. Does it detract from the drama? Maybe. Does it detract from Liam Neeson? Absolutely not.
The Hunger Games 4 — I Haven’t Eaten Lunch
Based on my life and the lives of many before us, sometimes we just don’t have time for lunch. While the drama and excitement and Jennifer-Lawrence-quirkiness of the previous Hunger Games kept America going, did it really strike that “relevance” chord? In the fourth installment of The Hunger Games, the battle of survival is really between Katniss and Katniss. We see Jennifer Lawrence, now in all her post-apocalyptic survival glory, asking herself, “Why did I skip lunch?” “Should I have a snack?” “It’s 4 p.m., damnit, and I don’t want to ruin my appetite.” It’s 2 hours of real time thrill.
Into the Woods 2 — Into the Concrete Jungle
The magic and charm of those old fairy tale characters take form in the Sondheim musical, “Into the Woods.” Can you say “Snore-ville”? Who goes to the woods anymore? We have buildings and cars and Internet now! I want to see Cinderella there — surfing the web in her stepmother’s house, selling her mice’s clothes on Etsy. Or the baker selling out his store to work at an Au Bon Pain, because let’s be honest, where are our small businesses going? Fairy tales are only at their best when they reflect reality. When at the end of the day, it’s just a couple of people with real problems, singing in unison in crazy costumes in public.
22 Jump Street 2 — 23 Jump Street
What happens when Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum get together for a sequel? Another sequel! 23 Jump Street is everything you loved about 21 Jump Street and 22 Jump Street, but it’s just one more Jump Street to add in the mix. As the zany undercover cops, Hill and Tatum tug on our heartstrings a little bit when they realize that the criminals they’ve been looking for have been inside them the whole time. It’s beautiful. Time magazine calls it “a movie,” and Entertainment Weekly gives it “two thumbs.”
50 Shades of Grey 2 — 100 Shades of Gray
Just a PowerPoint of paint samples.Intensity is the perfect word for the way the Rambler football team played on Friday night. In the locker room before the game, not a sound could be heard except for Coach Mischler’s inspired speech to the team, amping the entire team up and building even more desire for the first W of the season.
Early in the first quarter, Glenville snuck a touchdown past the defense on a broken fourth down QB run, but that would prove to be the only points the defense surrendered.
As the second quarter started, the Rambler defense recovered a fumble to sway the momentum of the game, leading to a score. The defense was the main story of the game with two goal line stands to turn away Glenville’s offense, one of which turned into a 99-yard drive from Prep’s offense. Late in the fourth quarter, the Ramblers put the game away with a final touchdown to put the score at 21-6, the eventual final score.
The road win was a great start to the season for the Ramblers who have high hopes for the rest of the season. They have their home opener Friday, Sept. 5, when they welcome Strong Vincent to Dollinger Field at the Cathedral Prep Events Center.- About

By William Burmester
Diocesan Seminarian
"I will be a Father to you, and you shall be my sons and daughters, says the Lord." (2 Corinthians 6:18)
This summer I was blessed to go to a 10-week program called the Institute of Priestly Formation. IPF is a program that is rooted in helping diocesan seminarians fall more in love with Christ, equipping them with tools to stay in love with Christ and preparing them to share this love with future parishioners.
The topics that we learned in class ranged from Ignatian spirituality to celibacy formation. It was a great opportunity to meet seminarians from around the country and to spend time learning about prayer and God's presence with me in my discernment.
It has allowed me to find confidence in my discernment and to rely on my relationship with God as my source of joy rather than on my own achievements. An overarching theme of my summer was that I am a beloved son of God. During the second week of our program we went on an eight-day silent retreat and this identity of being God's son came up many times.
This is a concept that I knew in my head, but during the retreat I felt it in my heart. This simple movement of feeling God's fatherly love has changed the way I pray and how I live out my relationship with him throughout the day.
It is hard for me to live as God's son most days because this demands complete dependence on God. I am a type of person that prefers control of situations especially when life gets stressful. During these stressful times in my life I tend to rely on my own power and skills to get me through the day. This leads to frustration, burnouts and negative feelings toward God for not helping me.
All the while, God is loving me and waiting on me to trust him and to give him permission to be with me.
He not only wants to be with me in prayer, but he wants to work with me in the daily struggles of life.
Even though the understanding that I am God's son has changed the way in that I relate to him, I constantly struggle with remembering this throughout the day.
In one of our classes in which we learned about the identities of the priest, one of the bullet points on a slideshow said "God loves you." The teacher pointed out how bizarre it is that this needs to be realized every day in our prayer life. God loving us is something we learn in Sunday school and here it is on a slideshow for a graduate-level class.
If we place ourselves in the love God has for us then we sense God's invitation to be with him in prayer and we can rely on this love throughout the day.
I have made it my priority each day to realize God's love for me during even the most mundane activities. Feeling this love in the sacraments allows me the ability to trust that I am a beloved son and that he is well pleased in me. It is a love that is not based on what I can do or have done, but because of who I.SnuzKot Skandi Changing Unit

Java is termed a subject Oriented language. Therefore , exactly what does Object Oriented show? It signifies of which the foundations regarding virtually any computer program built-in Coffee may very well be imagined when it comes to Objects. A very good example of this particular idea is in order to check out a number sample business specifications for a merchandise. Imagine that we all are actually requested with developing a personal computer program which should control a huge public library system. This method will have in order to account for the whole set of divisions of the libraries, every of the supplies that might end up being contained in the branches, in addition to any personal visitors that may would like in order to borrow books in the library's department.
First of almost all we could begin doing is take a look at these specifications and place each of typically the words which occur to be nouns. For the report, a noun is usually really a particular person, place or point. Thus, when a person assess these requirements we discern the foregoing nouns:
1) Library
2) Book
3) Branch
4) Customer
All of these terms definitely symbolize Things in Java. That is, fundamentally, Object Oriented programming (aka O-O programming). Whatever we might now go about doing, is simply transfer these 4 Objects on to a single piece of old fashioned document, and begin to discover what types regarding attributes each one of these Items possess What perform I mean by simply attributes? Okay, inside O-O development that is often called recognizing the "has a" relationships. The following is an example, a Branch "has an" address, a Book "has a" title, a Customer "has a" designation. We're able to map out all of the substantial attributes that all of these Objects have, and build ourselves a superb start point for the particular design of any kind of Java application.
Object Oriented development allows developers to consider in terms of genuine world "things" or perhaps Objects, and merely solve problems with all those Objects. It will be advisable to remember that Java is actually not the only O-O programming language in existence, when it was actually recognized practically five decades in the past and a whole lot of popular programming languages make use of Object Oriented principles. Those dialects may include C++, C#, Objective-C, Python, Ruby, and Visual Basic.
There are usually a lot a lot more notions that happen to be important in O-O development languages including gift of money, polymorphism along along with encapsulation. If you are interested in finding out much a lot more Object Oriented development as it pertains to the Java language, there are lots of great Java tutorial weblogs in existence nowadays.Lots of things going on at the Bierwirt

TOKYO, Oct. 8, 2020 /Kyodo JBN/ --
Nippon Express USA Constructing New Warehouse near Chicago
Nippon Express USA, Inc. (hereinafter “NE USA”), a subsidiary of Nippon Express Co., Ltd., held a groundbreaking ceremony on Friday, August 14, to mark the start of construction work on a new warehouse in Wood Dale, Illinois. The warehouse is scheduled to start operations in January 2021.

The environs of Chicago, Illinois, host one of the largest industrial clusters in the U.S., and the automobile industry in particular has built up a concentration of facilities in nearby states such as Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky and Tennessee.
NE USA’s Chicago hub has established facilities in three locations near Chicago with the aim of providing gateway functions for the Midwest as one of the most important hubs in the country, and its existing warehouse in Wood Dale offers storage, delivery and logistics services for general cargo, including electrical discharge machines, press machines and other heavy equipment.
In opening a new business location in Wood Dale, NE USA is seeking to generate synergetic effects by bolstering its logistics functions and restructuring its business locations, including the sharing of facilities with the Nippon Express Group’s company Associated Global Systems, Inc., in order to meet the diverse needs of automotive-related and other customers for such incidental operations as repacking and inspections as well as cross-docking.
Upon completion of this warehouse, the NE USA head office, presently situated in New York, will be relocated to the new facility with the intent of enhancing the speed and efficiency of operations by integrating head office, sales and operational functions into a single location and thereby improving Nippon Express’ operations across the U.S.
Image of new business location (for illustration purposes only):
NE USA will be placing particular focus on upgrading its nationwide logistics functions serving the automotive and pharmaceutical industries, positioned as priority industries in the Nippon Express Group’s Corporate Strategy.

It is my first attempt at anything like lace knitting and I was persuaded to have a go by my friend and inspirational knitter Asti, who seems to knit things like this up in an afternoon :o
The pattern is called Falling Leaves and was found by Asti on the wonderful Raverly site. I'm grateful to her for this for two reasons...
1. Once I enter the realms of the Raverly site I can never make a decision what to knit... I want to knit mostly everything I see on there and end up jumping from one thing to another so much that my head hurts and I come away very frustrated.
2. Persuading me to have a go, as when I saw hers it looked far too complicated... however, once you get a grasp of the pattern it is honestly fairly easy, and methodical, and I am really pleased to have got this far.. even though I haven't finished it yet!
So anyone without a current knit project I would urge you to have a go.... you'll probably finish it before I do!
This is looking really good and I like the colour you chose, I love knitting but not sure if I would do this myself I will wait and see yours when its finished. best wishes
Posted by: Julie.C | January 21, 2009 at 11:51 PM
I laughed when you suggested getting another knitting project, I have about eight I still need to finish. I get seduced by all the beautiful colours and textures and now I'm tempted to look at ravelry. Hope you get yours finished as the colour is gorgeous.
Posted by: Bobo Bun | January 22, 2009 at 12:24 AM
Its looking beautiful
I've tried knitting about twenty times over the years and just cant do it - I am so enviious of anyone who can.
I am just about managing to teach myself crochet at the moment
Looking forward to seeing finished scarf

What a beautiful colour!.I've just popped over to Asti's blog,thanks for the link.She's a very clever lady,all that spinning and dying her own wool.I hope you get your scarf finished soon,it will keep you lovely and cosy!I'm working on a baby jumper for my niece.Just got to do the pressing and making up.Trouble is,thats the bit I hate!

It looks beautiful: I can't wait to see a picture of the finish article! x
Posted by: Hannah | January 22, 2009 at 10:20 AM
Hi Nicky, Funnily enough I have just started a knitting course at the shop in Bovey Tracey which seemed very familiar and I couldn't work out why until I remembered Asti's post about weaving! Love the colour of your scarf and I hope to persevere with the course and learn to knit once and for all! Kathyx

that's beautiful! it looks so soft and cuddly. you've made me want to go pick up my knitting now:)
Posted by: Bobbi | January 22, 2009 at 11:35 PM
oh it looks lovely...I have had rather a fustrating time with a lovely cashmere scarf which I eventually sat down and made myself finish...and I really love it now...I am having nightmares with crochet ...can you hear me cursing from where you are???

Oh, you star ! It's lookin good. Not long to go now. We can model them when we go for coffee :)

In February, the “Beverly Hills, 90210″ and “Charmed” alum revealed that her breast cancer had returned and metastasized, meaning it spread beyond her breast and lymph nodes. Now, in an interview with Elle magazine, she opened up about how she shared the news with her family and friends, and said that she expects to be in treatment for the rest of her life.
“I try to treasure all the small moments that most people don’t really see or take for granted,” Doherty said in the October issue. “The small things are magnified for me. We have this endless well within us, and it’s just about continuing to dig in that well for the strength to face adversity — and so that we can also see all the beauty.”
When she was first diagnosed in 2015, a public disclosure made in a lawsuit against her former manager, she underwent surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. The disease has since spread to her spine and she expects it to spread further, likely to her brain, lungs, liver or some other combination. She’s hunkered down in her Malibu home to ride out the COVID-19 pandemic and spends her days tending to the vegetable garden she and her husband revived during lockdown.
The 49-year-old, who revived her image with the “BH90210″.
“But whenever it comes time for me to do it, it feels so final. It feels like you’re signing off, and I’m not signing off,” she said. “I feel like I’m a very, very healthy human being. It’s hard to wrap up your affairs when you feel like you’re going to live another 10 or 15 years.”
Her new treatment regimen would include hormone therapy to block the estrogen fueling her cancer, as well as a second targeted drug that is often effective at stabilizing metastatic disease, the magazine said. She expects to try other drug combinations if that doesn’t work.

Reseller hosting is a particular type of web hosting where the account owner can use a certain amount of allotted hard drive space and bandwidth to host third-party websites. The reseller buys the hosting service at wholesale prices and sells to end users to gain profit. This service is helpful for anyone willing to set up a web hosting company.
The first benefit of using cheap reseller hosting is saving money for your business. But, it doesn’t mean compromising on quality, functions and essential features needed for improving website’s performance. Thus, a reliable web hosting service is a must for your business.
Another crucial thing to ponder which category to choose - Linux reseller hosting or Windows reseller hosting. These hosting services are almost similar but there a few fine lines of differences. If you are still confused and can’t figure, let us see the differences now:
Customization
The first difference between these reseller hosting services is the customization options. Though both have customization options, yet Linux has more than the Windows. The tech-savvy people like admin or developer prefer to choose Linux while Windows fits the non-technical persons.
Use of Applications
Reseller hosting services come with applications naturally, and different hosting service comes with unique features of application installation. If you use a Linux hosting service, you can install more apps than Windows, being an open-sourced platform. Although, it depends entirely on the user’s requirement on the number of applications wanted on the server.
Stability Factor
High stability is one of the primary reasons for people to choose reseller hosting service. Both Linux and Windows are top rated for their stability. But, Linux has the upper hand enabling to adapt to any environment with frequent updates or development possibilities.
Cost Factor
Both Linux and Windows reseller hosting service do not cost much to your pocket. But, if you want even cheaper hosting service, Linux would be a great option. You won’t pay slightly less than a Windows as the operating system comes free.
Easy Setup Feature
Configuring the OS in your server is crucial as it is where the power to activate and deactivate the applications rests. To be honest, configuring the Windows is much easier than Linux. You need only a few minutes to set up in Windows while Linux may take hours.
Security Factor
Every hosting service should come with total security of both data and applications on the website. For reseller hosting in India, many providers offer good protection. But, if you need advanced security, then Linux is the best choice.
Conclusion
Security, stability, and uptime are essential features needed to get a high performing site. All these features are available with the Linux hosting service.

Mermaids, Fairlight
Architectural
A residential bungalow located in Fairlight, East Sussex, the small family dwelling required modernisation.
C L took on the project and successfully redesigned an open plan rear extension. The additional space provided a new Kitchen, living room and dining space. Bi folding doors and a large roof lantern maximised the amount of natural light entering into the south facing space. A cosy log burning stove was added into the design creating a warm and attractive central feature to the living space. Overall a scheme that completely changes the way in which the previous bungalow functioned.
Landscaping
Two years after the Extension was successfully designed, the client invited CL back to assess the external spaces leading out from their new building.
The brief included a large patio for dining and entertainment off of the bi folding doors, level changes for interest, planting beds, retained edgings, some form of outdoor Bar, shaded space, an overall aesthetically pleasing, organic terrace that enhances the already, striking contemporary extension.
Cl considered several options with concept sketches, the design developed into a linear scheme, building lines from the extension were used as reference points, and pulled forward to set out a rectangular shaped space.
The main area was paved using a grey Indian sandstone, detailed with a pebble edging, and retained using oak sleepers, the Bar was formed using excess soil from the excavation works, creating an earth rammed wall, capped with an Oak top, Clay pots were inserted randomly to enhance the walls natural organic form and texture.
The upper patio formed the perfect location for a bespoke crafted Oak Pergola, stepping through the centred raised beds, lined with box hedging, onto the Pebble & Slab mosaic patio, high quality cables above, tensioned across the oak beams ready for a Climbing Vine to settle and produce a natural shaded space.ONE TIME OFFER (just $17): Want the Audio Files to go along with your new copy of Shoot or Don't Shoot?

I was heart broken and devastated! Everyone’s journey in battling cancer is personal. From the day you start your “Breast Cancer Battle Plan”- honoring yourself, your journey and creating traditions around what matters to you becomes your mantra for life! It’s what gives you hope and carries you through your days.
I had to make peace with how I would cut my hair, when I would cut it, would I do a crazy hairstyle, shave it, go bald, wait for it to go naturally and the list goes on and on. Chemo number one had come and gone and the hair would be slowly coming out soon. Onward and upward looking to traditions of women before me who had gone bald (Bald is beautiful), done crazy colors , worn wigs, done hats and had many ways they had honored themselves. Creating ideas that I would now be looking towards for inspiration.
Next came the preparations for hair loss. Trying on hats, wigs and scarves at the H.R. Hoover Cancer Center, hats were ordered, a wig was bought (even though I said I wouldn’t do it), a wig brush, fake eye lashes and even fake eyebrows. All the thoughtful gifts a “Breastie” (Best Friend on your journey thought Breast Cancer) thinks of while you are taking it all in. My breastie didn’t miss a thing!
When? How? What was I going to do with my hair? I was in denial! I figured if I didn’t think about losing my hair it wouldn’t happen. It was my coping method at the time coming out of “Breast Cancer Boot Camp.” Your head is consumed with appointments, port placement, first chemo (where hair comes out about two to three weeks later, depending on the person) and geting to know your body post chemo.
I couldn’t wrap my head around being bald or was it I couldn’t wrap my head around losing my hair I had for 45 years of my life. I would countdown after my first chemo, how many more shampoos do I have until I have no hair. I stopped blow drying it, looking at it and styling it. I was “detaching” from what was to what would be. I was mourning my hair.
I decided I would cut it short as my hair started thinning. I put that off for a weekend because it was more then I could handle.
I had another friend (husband of my breastie) plan to shave his head in solidarity. When I was finally “ready” he went first. I watched intently and sadly.
Now it was my turn. My 11 year old daughter and her best friend were involved. We made two ponytails and the girls each cut one, as tears rolled down my cheeks. I looked at myself before and after and mourned my hair. It was done! Now there was no looking back, only forward!
How would I honor my amazing hair that I loved? We made a plan with the Mermaid loving littlest members of my Breast Cancer Support team. We would make a special trip to the coast to “release my hair” to the mermaids. My daughter was sure Oregon Coast mermaids would love to use it for their own!
On a cold, rainy and beautiful day I set off in search of the Oregon Coast with my “breastie”, three very excited children in search of Mermaids and a plan for a ceremony to release the hair. This would be the closing of this part of my Breast Cancer Journey!
Everyone clipped a tiny lock of hair from their head to combine with my whole head of newly shaved hair. This turned a painful event into a peaceful occasion. We all joined together and released the hair to the sea!
The last of what was my hair…goes out to sea for a Mermaid, we hope to create it into something more beautiful then it was on me…..
What an amazing way to let my hair go… a strand of everyone’s hair was also placed in our “Mermaid Jar” along with grains of sand from the beach.
Much love to you all for making what was the hardest part of the journey thus far happen with peace and grace……For the Mermaids of the ocean it belongs to you.
Here is to making traditions, creating ceremonies and new memories, honoring things we fear and to letting go even when sometimes it feels as if we can’t.
Nova A. will be writing a weekly blog in the month of October. October is breast cancer awareness month. Please help us welcome and support Nova during her journey.

Quick Info
Rhodes, Greece
BiographyWe should certainly credit Eudemus of Rhodes for his achievements in this archive since Eudemus seems to have been the first major historian of mathematics. Simplicius informs us that a biography of Eudemus was written by Damas, who is unknown but for this reference, but sadly no trace of this biography has been found. As exciting aspect of the history of mathematics is that the discovery of this text (and other lost texts) in the future, although highly unlikely, always remains a possibility.
Eudemus was born on Rhodes and we know that he had a brother called Boethus. Of his parents and early life we know nothing, but we do know that he studied with Aristotle. Aristotle spent time in Athens, Assos and other places and it would certainly be good to understand when Eudemus studied with him. Unfortunately there is no record either of time or of place which would let us answer these questions with any degree of certainty. W Jaeger, however, in his discussion of Aristotle [4] (see also [5]) has argued strongly that Eudemus studied with Aristotle during his period in Assos.
Aristotle had two followers, Eudemus and Theophrastus of Lesbos, who were known as his "companions". We should make it clear, however, that there was another philosopher called Eudemus associated with Aristotle, namely Eudemus of Cyprus and it was this other Eudemus after whom Aristotle named his famous text Eudemus. When Aristotle realised that he had only a short time left to live he chose his successor between his two companions, Eudemus and Theophrastus. He chose Theophrastus and it appears that Eudemus, although not unhappy with the decision, left Athens and set up his own school, probably back on his native Rhodes.
To say that Eudemus was not an original mathematician may be fair but just a little harsh, for we do know through Proclus that he wrote an original mathematical work called On the Angle. This work is lost so we are unable to judge its importance but it does seem likely to have been considerably less important than his works on the history of mathematics.
We know of three works on the history of mathematics by Eudemus, namely History of Arithmetic (two or more books), History of Geometry (two or more books), and History of Astronomy (two or more books).
The History of Arithmetic is known to us from only one reference to it in the writing of Porphyry. This reference tell us that the first book dealt with the Pythagorean idea of number and its interrelations with music.
The History of Geometry is the most important of the three mathematical histories of Eudemus. Although the work has not survived, it was available to many later writers who made heavy use of it. We are fortunate therefore that much of the knowledge that Eudemus had of the history of Greek mathematics before Euclid (it had to be before Euclid given the dates when Eudemus was writing) has reached us despite the fact that he book has not. In many of the articles in this archive we have quoted from accounts based on Eudemus. To illustrate with one example, the work of Hippocrates on the quadrature of lunes is only known to us through Eudemus's History of Geometry.
It is unclear exactly when the History of Geometry was lost. Paul Tannery (see for example [7]) believed that it was lost before the time of Pappus while others such as J L Heiberg have argued that Pappus and Eutocius both wrote with an open copy of Eudemus's History of Geometry in front of them.
The History of Astronomy again was heavily used by later writers and in exactly the same way as his geometry text, much information has survived in the works of others despite the loss of the original text. In particular Thales' eclipse prediction was described in Eudemus's work and we believe that Eudoxus's system of concentric spheres was first described there and later transmitted to us through the writing of Simplicius in the second century AD. Other topics in this book included [1]:-
... the cycle of the great year after which all the heavenly bodies are found in the same relative positions; the realisation by Anaximander that the earth is a heavenly body moving about the middle of the universe; the discovery by Anaximenes that the moon reflects the light of the sun and the explanation of lunar eclipses; and the inequality of the times between the solstices and the equinoxes.We have described above the important contributions of Eudemus to mathematics. However he is even better known for his contribution to saving the work of Aristotle for posterity. But for Eudemus we might not have had access to the works of Aristotle for he used his own lecture notes, Aristotle's lecture notes and recollections from memory to produce volumes of Aristotle's work fit for publication.
One further work is definitely due to Eudemus, namely a work on Physics which was a treatise in four books following the work by Aristotle of the same title fairly closely. Simplicius had a copy of this work which he found very helpful in understanding Aristotle's Physics and perhaps this was precisely the role the Eudemus intended for the work. Another work by Eudemus was on logic, in fact he may well have written two logic books and he also wrote On Discourse.
Some works by Eudemus are harder to identify with Eudemus of Rhodes and may have been written by others with the same name. Certainly there are many references to a work on animals written by a certain Eudemus and one of the references certainly does refer to Eudemus of Rhodes. Since the work seems to have been a collection of fables about animals the subject matter seems too far removed from the serious, scientific and scholarly works which he certainly wrote. Perhaps more likely is a work on the poet Lindos. Since Lindos had connections with Rhodes the link makes this a more likely possibility.
Again there is a reference which seems to imply that Eudemus wrote a history of theology and again this seems highly probable. Many authors refer to Eudemus as the 'pious Eudemus' due to his belief in the 'contemplation of God'. This however may be due to editing by a later Christian who would have seen that clearly Eudemus meant 'contemplation of God' rather than what is much more likely what he wrote 'contemplation of Mind' and "corrected" the text accordingly!

Walnut with honey is a very good bribe. 😂
Haha it gets harder to bribe him now. Now he demands banana muffins or some other baked goods instead 😂Drifting the sea of life, singing in the melas, dancing in the bazaars was Bhulwa, a young urchin, pleasantly naughty but highly sentimental, earning his few annas a day in mela theatricals. A suburb of Calcutta is agog with excitement with the presence of a touring theatrical in the midst of its semi village quietude. Bhulwa as usual plays his pranks, arouses the ire of the Manager, gets a box on his ears, a punch on his nose and a kick in his hind parts, his self-respect hurt, he runs as fast as his small legs can carry him, clings on the ladder of a speeding fire engine and escapes the fury of his persecutor. The fire engine rushes to extinguish the flames that engulf an orphanage. Bhulwa is an astonished on-looker. Little orphans are being saved, one of them, a sweet little mute runs away from her tormentor, here again the manager and literally bumps into Bhulwa. Bhulwa, ever sympathetic with ones smaller than himself, pities the girl and together they run away from the scene of confusion and turmoil. Safe in the peacefulness of a nearby groove, Bhulwa tries to impress upon his ward his greatness and confides in her, his ambitions of appearing on the stage of the big theatres of Calcutta. He speaks enthusiastically of the footlights and the limelight. He assures her that he will teach her to sing and dance and together they will win fame and fortune. His enthusiasm waxes and his eloquence takes them deeper into the night, when the cold wind rudely reminds him of his poverty and the scantiness of Monju's clothing. Bravely, Bhulwa doffs his shirt and wraps it round the shivering Monju and spying some boats. Taking advantage of the high tide, the boatmen push off, unaware of the stowaways, and the morning sees them in a distant village.
Bhulwa and Monju, thrown together by circumstances, develop a strong attachment, singing, dancing, begging, growing up together. They grow and Bhulwa's desire to join the theatre grows. They carefully save the alms they collect from village to village. They buy a harmonium and set out for Calcutta, to attain Bhulwa's long-cherished desire and ambition, with great hopes. But Dame Fate is peculiar, and her eccentricities still more peculiar.
Bhlihva's hopes are shattered. Monju entreats Bhulwa to return to the village. She speaks of the peace of village life. Bbulwa does not agree. His desire is unquenchable.
Singing on the streets for alms, the golden voice of Monju attracts the attention of Amarchand, the Actor-Manager of the Diamond Theatre. This profligate, as he is, orders a servant to call the street singer in. Amarchand is astonished to see such a beautiful face matching the golden voice, and to think that they are being wasted on the streets. He gives them a five rupee note and promises Monju a job on the stage, and holds out a promise to Bhulwa as well.
Brooding over his losses, pondering over the possibilities of a revival of business if a beautiful girl is found, sat Trilokenath, the proprietor of the Diamond Theatre, worried and perplexed. Amarchand rushes in with the good news. Trilokenath and Amarchand go to Monjn. Monju's job is confirmed. Promises are held out to Bhulwa. Monju gets her theatrical songs tuned by Bhulwa and is trained by him. Events change fast. Amarchand has fallen in love with Monju. This love has changed Amarchand. He has got rid of his vices. He tries to serve Monju. Tirlokenath tries to seduce Monju. Amarchand saves her. Amarchand explains to Monju that there is dirt and uncleanliness in all walks of life but one can live cleanly in any walk of life.
The premiere. Monju's debut. Stage fright. Amarchand encourages Monju. Monju appeals to Bhulwa. Bhulwa comforts her. Amarchand gives a bouquet to Monju, Monju gives it to Bhulwa. Bhulwa whispers soft words of encouragement. Monju enters. Her eyes on Bhulwa, she greets the audience. The audience greets her. Monju's debut is successful.
She is acclaimed. The Diamond Theatre prospers. Though successful, Monju does not like the city life. Bhulwa, still hoping for a chance for himself, persuades her to stay on.
He infuses her with spirit. The evolution of Monju begins. Modern furniture, modern dresses, modern taste.
Swollen headed with fame, Monju is no longer a village girl. Monju rebukes a servant. Bhulwa is annoyed at her high-brow manner. He reminds her of her own days of poverty.
Monju does not like the reminder. She leaves for the theatre. Amarchand, in his desire to possess Monju, turns up a new leaf in life. He places himself and his all at Monju's disposal. Monju is pleased. She is carried away by Amarchand's attention and munificence. At times she forgets Bhulwa. Bhulwa feels this inattention. He bears it silently.
Amarchand keeps Bhulwa in hopes for a job.
One day the .Music Director requests Monju to learn the new tune of a song, Bhulwa's favourite song. Monju refuses to change the tune. The Music Director insists. Monju persists. They argue. Monju declines. Monju returns home. She does not find Bhulwa at home. She hears that Bhulwa has fever and has gone out. She cooks some light food for the sick.
Amarchand hears of Monju's refusal to work. He hurries to request her to return. "It is the opening night of the new play. They will be ruined." Amarchand pleads. A voice is heard on the radio. Monju is pleasantly surprised hearing Bhulwa's voice on the radio. At the same time Monju feels hurt because Bhulwa never told her about this engagement at the radio station. Amarchand entreats Monju to come back and sing the song, in the new tune. Monju declining, says it will pain Bhulwa if she changed the tune set by him, and then, suddenly, agrees to the new tune, just to spite Bhulwa. She believes Bhulwa ignored her when he took up the job at the radio station. To tease Bhulwa, further, she orders the servant to ask Bhulwa, on his return, to go to the theatre; calculating on his annoyance when be bears the new tune, not counting upon the grave consequences it may lead to. Bbulwa returns home soaked in rain. The fever has increased. The servant gives Monju's message. Bhulwa hurries to the theatre. The servant requests him to rest with his fever. Bhulwa says that Monju will be nervous without him. He must be near her. She will be encouraged. He goes.
The play has started. Monju nervously awaits Bhulwa. She looks for him in the audience. Bhulwa arrives. Monju sees him. She sings. Bhulwa is surprised. It is not the same tune. The Devis are insulted. He cannot bear it. He jumps on the stage. There is confusion. The curtain is dropped. Bhulwa is thrashed and turned out of the theatre. Monju is unaware of the treatment accorded to Bhulwa. On the contrary, she is highly strung and feels insulted at Bhulwa's behaviour in the presence of the big crowd. Monju tells Amarchand that she will never return to Bhulwa. Amarchand is inwardly delighted. Amarchand takes Monju to his house. Monju cannot sleep. She weeps and passes a sleepless night.
Bhulwa returns home. He picks up his old harmonium and speaks to it. "Monju is lost," he says, "let us find her." With an old costume of Monju and singing her favourite song on the faithful harmonium, Bhulwa sets out.
Monju comes home to tell Bhulwa that she will never see hi m again. She does not find Bhulwa. She is upset. Complaints and accusations fly to the winds. Remorse sets in.
Old love finds its place. Monju telephones to Amarchand to come quickly. Amarchand misunderstands. He hurries to her. Monju accompanies Amarchand in his car, her eyes searching for Bhulwa. Amarchand is happy. He thinks she is fleeing with him. Amarchand, with a hidden pride, reminds Monju that she is leaving fame and fortune behind.
Monju does not pay heed to his words. There is but one thought in her mind, one object in view. Her eyes scanning, her mind fixed, her heart going out to the one and only Bhulwa. Her one request to Amarchand is to go faster. At a fork in the road Monju requests Amarchand to go on the road on which Bhulwa •and she had travelled to the city.
"He must have gone on this road. Please hurry. Find him. .He is angry. I will lose him." These words bring the truth home to Amarchand. He realises.
A storm arisen.
The riverside is reached, Bhulwa's boat can be seen in the distance. Monju's favourite song can be faintly heard through the storm. Monju cries and shouts for Bhulwa. The storm increases. The boat is tossed about. Monju can still hear the faint music. She cries louder and louder. The storm rages stronger. The boat is dashed against the banks!
And then?

“We are extremely pleased with Karen’s work. She did all the research necessary to totally understand our business as well as meet with us for a detailed fact-gathering interview. The wording she provided was perfect. We felt as if she was in the same business as ours. We attempted the project ourselves but what we produced was far below our standards. Karen’s wording really made a difference. She really knows how to write about various subjects while keeping the reader interested and informed. She always kept her deadlines and her services were very professional. From the moment we met with her we knew she just had “a way with words”. We recommend her service to anyone seeking a professional copywriter.”

Cardinal Raymond Burke on Friday said that he is continuing to recover from COVID-19 and can offer daily Mass now, in a statement posted on his Facebook account.
“With heartfelt gratitude to all those who have prayed for my recovery, I write to inform you that, since my previous letter, physical therapy has aided my rehabilitation so greatly that I am now able to offer daily the Holy Mass,” the cardinal stated on Friday. “Words cannot adequately express my joy at this gift of God’s grace in my life.”
Burke added that his “recovery continues to remain an intensive process.”
The 73-year-old cardinal was hospitalized with COVID-19 in August and was placed on a ventilator. Normally based in Rome, he reportedly fell ill while in Wisconsin. By Aug. 21, the Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Wisconsin – which provided official updates on Burke’s condition – stated that he was off the ventilator and was leaving the hospital ICU.College News

By Melody Brown-Peyton, The Daily Record of Dunn.
DUNN - Area senior citizens are proof that "learning never stops," as they take computer classes two days a week at the CCCC-Dunn Center. The classes are part of continuing education programs offered by Central Carolina Community College (CCCC).
This program is designed for seniors who walk in the door without knowing anything about computers. Digital technology plays a vital role in learning new skill sets. Many of the seniors said that before they started taking computer classes, computers intimidated them. Now, this class has given them the confidence they need.
Some of the computer programs that seniors are learning are Microsoft Word, PowerPoint and Excel. They are learning how to put together a travel itinerary and a brochure. And after completing the program, students earn a certificate.
With this window of opportunity, seniors don't have to shy away from the use of computers. During their working careers, many seniors did not use computers every day and most did not have a computer in their home.
Computer technology has become a part of everyone's lives. From banking, the gas pump, dining and telephones, technology is all around us. Some of the seniors said they wanted to have computer skills so they could volunteer in their church or civic groups.
"I started taking computer classes at Central Carolina Community College back in the fall. I wanted to learn more about Excel," Laverne Smith said.
Seniors found their new skills to be rewarding from a sense of technological freedom. Many stated that taking the classes has been a vehicle to collaborate with other seniors and it gives them something to do outside of the house.
Students said that instructor Robin Jones makes the class enjoyable because she is patient with them.
T.C. Everett, who serves as the coordinator for Computer and Technology Programs at CCCC, said that one way to make seniors comfortable with technology is to have them in an environment with their peers.
"So they don't feel like they are competing with younger people," Ms. Everett said.
One thing Ms. Everett found to be most rewarding is when a senior stops her in the hallway and beams with pride about the new skills they are learning.
"Seniors are like sponges -- they want to learn -- and we give them the tools they need," she said.
One challenge she's faced with is finding instructors who work well with senior citizens.
Ms. Jones appears to be the perfect fit. Many of her students have taken other classes with her.
"My goal is to provide seniors with hands-on opportunities while they work at their own pace," the instructor said.
Research has shown that when seniors have an active lifestyle, they enjoy life and live longer.
The mission of CCCC is to serve as a catalyst for individuals, community and economic development by empowerment through accessible lifelong learning. The college has the vision of providing learning opportunities that contribute to economic progress and cultural enrichment for students andCiara McNamara: Every Cork soccer player dreams of playing at a packed Turner's Cross

CIARA McNamara insists it would “mean the world” to her and her Cork City teammates if they were to get a huge crowd in for their final game of the season at Turner’s Cross this Saturday.
The Drive for 2k is revving up this week as they look to get 2,000 fans to attend the Munster Derby clash with Treaty United this Saturday afternoon, 2pm.
Proceedings from the event will be donated to Breast Cancer Ireland and McNamara is hoping people will show their support for the initiative.
“It means an awful lot to just play there,” began McNamara.
Growing up in Cork… it’s the home of Cork soccer really and you always have the dream to just play there as a boy or a girl.
“I was lucky to play in cup finals and win a few trophies there when I was young but there wasn’t a big crowd in on the day so it would mean the world for me to play there in front of a big crowd.
“It would mean so much to have people come out and support us.
“It’s been a tough season but to finish on a high, with a big crowd would be great.
“I think it is a brilliant initiative especially with the lads being finishing their season last weekend.
“We hope the regulars that go to the lads’ games on a Friday night might just push out their regular outing and come on Saturday at 2 o’clock to watch us. Hopefully, the local clubs can get behind it.
“It would mean the world to all of us to have them there and it would be great for the young girls to see what is possible and help us build for next season and the future.
“I know all our extended families are making an effort to go on the day especially when it is for charity as well.
“Breast Cancer Ireland is a great cause.
“Unfortunately, a lot of people in Cork have been affected by that. I know people that have been affected by it, so it would be great for people to come out and support that first and foremost and then support us as well on the day.
“It’s going to be an exciting game, emotions will be high from our point of view just because the last we played them at Turner’s Cross they beat us.
“That was a game that we had marked beforehand that we wanted a good result and they beat us so we will be looking to do the business this time around.
“We know what we have to do to get the win and we will be hoping for a big crowd to help us get it.”

9HP says the refreshed vanilla Pavilion units borrow design elements from the Spectre and Envy products. HP incorporated a metal faceplate surrounding the keyboard and injected the Pavilion family with different “hues, finishes, and textures” for a highly sophisticated look on a mainstream laptop. They also borrow the “Lift” hinge from the Envy family to promote better airflow to the bottom vents.
On the hardware front, the updated Pavilions are configured with seventh-generation Intel Celeron and Core i3/i5/i7 processors, and E2/A10 APUs from AMD. The laptops also include one USB 3.1 Gen1 Type-C port (5Gbps), two USB 3.1 Gen1 Type-A ports (5Gbps), HDMI output, and an SD card reader at the very least. The color options consist of opulent blue, silk gold, orchid pink, mineral silver, and empress red.
One of the big points HP sells with the refresh is the reduction in size compared to last year’s models. For example, the Pavilion 14 2016 model had a side bezel of 17.2mm and a top bezel of 13.4mm. For the 2017 model, the side bezel measures 13.99mm and the top bezel measures an impressively thin 6.5mm. Even more, from a side “closed” view, the Pavilion 15 2016 model measured 22.5mm thick whereas the 2017 model is 19.9mm thick.
As for the refreshed Pavilion x360 line, they arrive in mineral silver and silk gold colors sporting a flat metal surface in the keyboard area, or an artsy “strata” pattern design. Like the vanilla Pavilion units, the new x360 models are thinner and lighter than the 2016 lineup. A good example is the x360 15-inch model, as the 2016 version measured 23.9mm thick and weighed 5.07 pounds. The new model measures 20.3mm thick and weighs 4.63 pounds.
On the hardware level, the x360 offers seventh-generation Intel Pentium and Core i3/15/i7 processors, storage capacities of up to 512GB on an SSD, and even discrete graphics options provided by Nvidia and AMD. But don’t expect to see GTX 1050 options, as the x360 isn’t designed to handle that kind of heat.
Below is a generalized overview of the Pavilion refresh arriving in the May/June release window provided by HP. Note that the prices don’t reflect the starting prices HP announced on Thursday:

Sunday School provides one of the chief means of discipling both for children and adults with classes for every age and electives for adults. Children and adults may come at 12:00 P.M. for Sunday School. The Sunday School class gives your child the opportunity to build a relationship with his/her teacher who has committed to teaching that class for a full year. Consistent attendance in the class will be most beneficial but new students are welcome to the class at any time. We recommend that children come with their own Bible.The 90% testWarning: This information may not apply to the current year. Check the content carefully to ensure it is applicable to your circumstances. End of attention The 90% test only applies if there is an interposed entity between the CGT concession stakeholders and the company or trust in which the shares or interests are held. The interposed entity satisfies the test if small business participation percentages in that entity totalling at least 90% are held by CGT concession stakeholders of the company or trust in which the shares or interests are held. As with the significant individual test, the participation percentage can be held directly or indirectly through multiple interposed entities. Example The discretionary trust sells the units in Unit Trust. Catherine, a significant individual and a CGT concession stakeholder of Unit Trust, has a 72% participation percentage in Discretionary Trust. 80% x 90% = 72% If the other interests in Discretionary Trust are held by people who are not CGT concession stakeholders, Discretionary Trust will not satisfy the ownership requirement and will not be able to access the concessions. End of example Example Based on the ABC Trust example: Jennifer, a significant individual and CGT concession stakeholder of Operating Co, has an 80% small business participation percentage in ABC Trust Bill, a CGT concession stakeholder of Operating Co, has a 15% small business participation percentage in ABC Trust Nicky, who is not a CGT concession stakeholder of Operating Co, has a 5% small business participation percentage in ABC Trust. At least 90% of the participation percentages in ABC Trust are held by CGT concession stakeholders of Operating Co. As a result, ABC Trust satisfies the ownership requirement if it sells its shares in Operating Co, and can access the concessions on those shares, provided the other conditions are met. End of example Example A discretionary trust sells shares in an operating company. Anna receives 90% of the distributions from the trust, and the trust has a 50% interest in the company. The trust cannot be a CGT concession stakeholder in the company because it is not an individual. However, Anna will be a CGT concession stakeholder in the company if she (or her spouse) has a direct or indirect interest in the company of at least 20%. She, together with other CGT concession stakeholders, must also have a combined interest in the trust of at least 90%. The 90% test is satisfied because Anna’s indirect interest in the company is 45% (50% of 90%). Therefore, she is a CGT concession stakeholder in the company and her interest in the trust is 90%.

Enter The Virtual Dipping Game. Hosted by Maker’s Mark Chairman Emeritus and Bourbon Hall of Famer Bill Samuels, Jr., it’s an immersive experience – literally – that allowed our target audience to spend a few minutes inside an artistic recreation of the Maker’s Mark Distillery – and try their hands at dipping a few bottles of that beloved bourbon.

How to play
The game rules
All our guests had to do was order up a bottle of Maker’s Mark or Maker’s Mark 46, dip it in the iconic red wax and place it in the correct wagon to leave the distillery.
Hint: It’s not as easy as it looks.
The technology
Advanced enough for Lucasfilms
Created with and powered by Unreal Engine, the immersive experience was developed through an ongoing, iterative collaboration with our partners, Picasso Pictures. The result is an artistic recreation of the distillery’s dipping room featuring high technical standards that include high-definition 3D visuals, 6 degrees of freedom and full tracking of the player’s head and hands. These high standards paid off most when two artists from Industrial Light and Magic, Lucasfilm's VFX and animation studio, gave the game two thumbs up after their trial.
Insights
Building belief in craft
Maker’s Mark, America’s original craft whisky, is easily recognizable on the shelf with its signature red wax. But the VR experience helped us tell the important story behind that red wax: Each and every bottle is dipped by hand at the Maker’s Mark Distillery. Fans and new friends alike were captivated by the experience – helping us prove that Maker’s Mark is still a handmade bourbon. Or, in the words of Bill Samuels, Jr.: “The bullsh*t is real.”

He ask if your sister got fish, how are you going to cook it. I said pan fry with batter like fish and chips. Or I could steam fish with garlic oil spring onion and chili eat with rice and fried kai lan. He said not bad menu. I hope your sister get some fishes.
I said to him you have got a good catch today. Are you taking it to the market to sell? He said yeah. You got plenty of mussels. Then he asks me: You want some mussels? I said how much a kilo? For you, I give it to you for $10. I said ok, thank you.
Then I left happily with my mussels. My sister got some fishes, I took 1 baby snapper, and she took 3 different fishes for herself and gave some to her friends.
Came home, wash and removed the beards off the mussels and fill it in a bowl with ice and place in fridge until time to cook. Meantime, I prepare the other ingredients to add to the mussels.
I have to admit some mussels didn’t open up. Threw away. The rest that is opened were delicious to have with garlic bread and a glass of Chardonnay wine.
Let’s Bake mussels, am hungry already.

Can I have a price for China's Train Service to UK?
NO! It's a complete waste of time in our opinion.
Unless of course you're a big fan of spending 8-12x the cost of sea freight whilst saving only 4-5 days?
The China train service offers a fantastic alternative for cargo travelling from Yiwu to Eastern Europe, where the cost sits somewhere between Airfreight and Seafreight, with a transit time of around 50% less. However, most suppliers will be offering FOB terms from a nearest seaport and not Yiwu, so firstly you have to consider the additional costs for taking your container from most likely a coastal city, nearby to the port vs Yiwu terminal. If you're lucky and your supplier offers FOB Yiwu, then we can move to the next question.
How long does the train take? From Eastern Europe which takes around 12 days, the train then travels through North Europe to Hamburg, tranships to another service and calls to London eventually, some total of around 18 days. Seafreight from Shenzhen is as quick as 24 days, so saving just under a week doesn't seem so appealing for the extra expense of 8-12x as much cost, especially when a similar cost depending on the total size could get you Airfreight within 4-6 days.
The train service has a maximum capacity of containers it can take, and therefore it's operating cost is always going to be stable. If you bear in mind that the largest of todays sea vessels can take up to 22,000 containers, the cost proportioned per container is always going to win this comparison.
This is why, sea freight will always be the most cost effective method to import your products, and if it's a deadline you must hit then Air freight is the most sensible option.DENVER — Authorities are searching for five suspects wanted for an aggravated robbery at a 7-Eleven.

Under the leadership of chef Christiaan Campbell, the restaurant shows what it really means to use local, seasonal, ethically sourced ingredients. This hard work has earned the restaurant the 2018 Eat Out Woolworths Sustainability Award, as judged by Sonia Mountford of Eategrity, Karen Welter of the Longtable Project and Pavs Pillay of WWF-SASSI.

“Christiaan paved the way for sustainably-minded chefs long before it became a trend,” says Sonia. “He not only understands the connection between how our food is grown – including how livestock is treated, human health and the health of the planet – but he also actively pursues ways to advocate for the principle of respect.”
A family-style meal at this award-winning restaurant. Photo supplied.This philosophy is deeply embedded at Boschendal. The farm employs regenerative farming practices that enrich the soil and promote biodiversity in the kitchen garden, vineyards and surrounding vegetation. The small menu that changes daily depends on the day’s harvest and creativity of the chefs. The team makes cheese and yoghurt on site, and the Black Angus grass-fed beef is farmed on the estate and broken down at their own butchery to limit wastage and champion nose-to-tail cuts.

If it’s not from the farm, it’s from a like-minded neighbour in the Franschhoek valley. Any element on the plate can be traced to a spot of land no more than 150 km from the restaurant. It takes real confidence to start a meal by serving a ‘garden salad’ consisting of nothing but a baby carrot and its leaves, plucked that morning and drizzled with a piquant dressing. Such is the quality of the produce here.
The Werf Restaurant at Boschendal is an example worth following. “Christiaan has been a chef ahead of his time – and still is in many ways,” Sonia concludes.

Hurdles to adoption of biosimilars include regulatory issues and lack of interchangeability with the reference drugs.
Obstacles continue to impede the full adoption and acceptance of biosimilars, according to a new report published by the HDA Research Foundation.
"The U.S. market for biosimilars has been slower to develop than that of many other developed countries due to the slower pace of a supporting regulatory framework," say the authors of the white paper, Biosimilars: The State of the U.S. Market.
They identified reasons for the slow adoption such as a lack of provider awareness and acceptance of biosimilars, an uncertain return on investment, a lack of interchangeability with biologics, coding concerns, and on-going patent litigation.
The report was compiled after conducting a series of interviews with U.S. specialty distributors and pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as evaluating research on biosimilar policies and trends.
It highlighted the current biosimilar market, challenges that continue to face the industry, and potential strategies to improve awareness among healthcare professionals and patients.
Related article: Biosimilars Have Entered the Market, But Are They Safe?
The first biosimilar in the United States, Zarxio, launched in 2015. Another five biosimilars received FDA approval by August 2017.
Drug manufacturers continue to see tremendous opportunity within the market for biosimilars, particularly as six of the top 10 U.S. biologic drugs are expected to lose patent exclusivity by 2019.
The biosimilar market remains small, with only three biosimilars reaching the market as of August 2017. However, new biosimilar products continue to flood the drug pipeline with an estimated 700 biosimilar products in development worldwide.
Biosimilars have the potential to provide more therapeutic options for patients with complex diseases and could lower healthcare costs. The delay could be in part due to the length of time it's taken to establish a clear regulatory pathway.
According to the report, discussions about a biosimilar approval pathway in the United States first began in the 1990s, but it wasn't until 2010 that a separate pathway was started through the 2010 Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act.
Since then, the FDA has provided guidance on the regulatory, scientific and quality considerations to be used for biosimilars, and naming standards.
The FDA released draft guidance in 2017 on the data needed to support interchangeability between a biosimilar and its reference biologic; but no biosimilar has achieved interchangeable status.
Once a biosimilar is ready to launch, there are still unique challenges for the industry.
Related article: How New Biosimilars Will Impact the Market
One of the biggest is a lack of awareness and acceptance of biosimilars among providers. For instance, a recent 2016 study noted in the HDA report found that, while a survey of provider perceptions indicated that 57.2% of respondents believed a biosimilar would be at least as safe as the reference product, a significant 42.8% disagreed with that statement.
Manufacturers and distributors believe that education efforts need to be started early to improve acceptance of biosimilars.
"While several biosimilar drugs are now available in the U.S., these products only are available for a small number of therapeutic areas, so most specialty providers have yet to have the option to prescribe a biosimilar drug to treat a patient," the report stated.
The report stressed that education efforts begin with general information about how biosimilars are produced, how they are approved, and the evidence needed for determining interchangeability with the reference product.Cowards die many times before their actual deaths— Julius Caesar

There was a Coronation Street reunion for show icon Sally Dynevor with her former co-star Ryan Thomas as they headed to cheer on Adam Thomas at his huge new restaurant launch in Manchester. And both Sally and Ryan were joined at the Oh My Glaze launch night by their mini-me daughters. Proving that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, Sally was beaming next to her lookalike daughter Hattie Dynevor, 17, while Ryan cuddled in next to his daughter Scarlett, who has just turned 13. The launch event was a chance for Sally, who plays soap legend Sally Metcalfe, and Ryan who played builder Jason Grimshaw for 16 years until filming his final scenes in 2016, to have a good old catch up.

And there was another reunion on the night as they were also joined by Sally's on-screen daughter, Corrie's Brooke Vincent at the party too. Brooke, who plays the soap's Sophie Webster, is currently on maternity leave after welcoming baby Monroe with her footballer partner Kean Bryan in May. Hattie is Sally's youngest daughter, while her eldest daughter Phoebe Dynevor is known to millions as Daphne in Netflix megahit Bridgerton. It was a true family affair at the new Oh My Glaze site at the Trafford Centre, as Ryan along with brother Scott Thomas cheered on their former Emmerdale star brother Adam Thomas with his latest venture.

Adam and his old school pal Scott Graham have been building on the success of their restaurant The Spinn in Gatley with new spin-off ventures. They ran a successful Spinn pop-up at MediaCity over the summer serving up their now-famous range of burgers. And now they are aiming to capitalise on the success of Scott's Oh My Glaze street food and sauces business with the winter pop-up at the Trafford Centre's new Hangar space. Former Emmerdale and I'm a Celebrity favourite Adam has spoken of realising a lifelong dream to have a base for his business at the Trafford Centre. Adam's brother Ryan headed to the launch with his partner Lucy Mecklenburgh on Thursday night. Ryan Thomas and Lucy Mecklenburgh supported brother Adam at his launch (Image: Stephen Farrell)
Ryan was with his daughter Scarlett, from his previous relationship with Corrie star Tina O'Brien, as well as his 19-month-old baby son Roman with Lucy. And Ryan couldn't resist playing a trick on his brother earlier in the day - by posting an apologetic video with a crying Roman in the background saying he couldn't make the launch bash. He swiftly followed it up laughingly saying: "AS IF! Roman whether you like it or not we are supporting Uncle Adam tonight, you can cry all you want."

988 will go into effect in 2022.
In a unanimous vote, FCC commissioners approved the proposal to establish a three-digit number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which will make it infinitely easier for those struggling with suicidal thoughts to get help ASAP. Currently, the number to reach the hotline is 1-800-273-TALK (8255). In two years’ time, that number will change to 988.
The FCC originally introduced the proposal in August 2019. But for many Americans, recent events (i.e., all of 2020) has had a significant impact on their mental health—which, for the FCC, only served to underscore the importance of making mental health care easily accessible for all. As USA Today reports, some of the commissioners voting on the proposal “acknowledged the strains caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the compounded effect of George Floyd’s death and protests that ensued.”
According to The Washington Post, a recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll revealed that almost half of Americans report that the coronavirus pandemic has negatively impacted their mental health.
The Post also reports that a “federal emergency hotline for people in emotional distress” saw a 1,000% uptick in calls in April 2020 from April 2019.
FCC Chairman Ajit Pai also acknowledged that suicide disproportionately affects BIPOC, LGBTQ+, rural Americans, and other marginalized groups. There is a major disparity in the quality and accessibility of healthcare services among minority or marginalized communities, too. What’s so crucial about the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is that its life-saving services are entirely free.
“We hope any American in a suicide crisis will come to know that 988 is the number to call for immediate help and assistance,” Pai said at the FCC’s open meeting on Thursday, July 22nd. “With the implementation, we anticipate that many more Americans will receive help from suicide prevention and many more lives will be saved.”
Moreover, the movie to an "easy-to-remember," three-digit number could help reduce the stigma around mental health crises and suicidal ideation, an FCC press release noted.
The 988 number will go into effect on July 16, 2022. Until then, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline’s original number remains accessible 24/7 at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).Dr. Griffiths holds a Ph.D. from The University of Western Ontario in Canada along with an M.A. (Economics), an M.B.A. (Finance), and two undergraduate degrees.

I have a very simple message for you today. Central Asia matters to Europe. And Europe matters to Central Asia.
In the thirty years since your independence, Central Asian economies grew almost non-stop – until the pandemic hit all of us. Our cooperation can help restart your economic engine. And at the same time, it can make Central Asian economies stronger, fairer and more sustainable in the long run.
This is exactly what we are pushing for in Europe, too. We are using the massive investment in our recovery plan to reshape our economy. We are speeding up the transition to clean energy. We are connecting more people and companies with digital infrastructure. And we are promoting the decisive reforms that Europeans have been demanding for years.
Green recovery, digitalisation and a stronger business climate. These are also the three points on today’s agenda. Europe has unparalleled expertise in all of these fields. And we are offering greater cooperation to all countries in Central Asia, in our mutual interest.
Valdis Dombrovskis will outline in his address a few proposals to reach this goal. And he will also tell you more about our new connectivity strategy called Global Gateway Europe. But allow me to run quickly through the three topics on our agenda.
First, on the green recovery. Central Asia is already suffering from the consequences of climate change. This summer’s drought has destroyed harvests, killed animals and emptied reservoirs. But Central Asia also has an immense untapped potential for renewable energy. With the right investment, your region can become less dependent on coal and other fossil fuels, creating quality jobs and cleaning the air that you breathe. Let us work together so that green investment can drive the economic recovery.
Second, digitalisation. The answer to this is not just to build new infrastructure, but also to improve rules and regulations for the digital market. Europe has a lot to offer in this respect, because this is what we are doing at home too. The European path to digitalisation puts people, companies and their rights at the centre. This is what we are putting on the table.
Third, on the business environment. Europe is already the biggest foreign investor and the biggest trade partner in many of your countries. Europe is the source or the destination of one third of your international trade flows. Yet I am convinced that the potential exists to make our partnership even stronger. And for this, companies want to know that they can compete on a level playing-field. That they can trust your judicial systems and the rule of law. This is also the foundation of a sustainable growth model – one that creates jobs and prosperity in Central Asia, for your people and for future generations too. All of these principles will be at the heart of Global Gateway Europe, our new connectivity strategy.
Global Gateway Europe will be all about investing in our mutual interests. We want to create links, not dependencies. And Central Asia is the global gateway by definition. You stand at the centre of Eurasia. Your prosperity matters to Europe. And I am convinced that our partnership can truly matter to your people, too.
Thank you, and let me wish you an excellent EU-Central Asia Economic Forum.Climate: Rich nations have dodged finance pledge
PARIS: A hundred billion dollars every year –- that with tensions, experts say.
- The Context -
The vow to gradually ramp up aid for the Global South to $100 billion (86.5 billion euros) per year by 2020 was first made at the 2009 UN climate summit in Copenhagen.
A decade later, wealthy nations were still far from the mark, with the total below $80 billion in 2019, according to the OECD, which took on the role of tracking climate finance.
If only outright grants and not loans are considered, the amount drops by almost half, say NGOs that monitor money flows.
With a Democrat back in the White House, the US has doubled its aid and promises $11.4 billion per year by 2024, but it's still not enough to close the gap. Canada and Germany are expected to announce enhanced commitments before the Glasgow summit opens on October 31.
China may be the world's top carbon polluter today, accounting for more than a quarter of global emissions, but the United States and other rich countries are historically the main emitters of greenhouse gases.
COP26 host Boris Johnson recently reminded leaders at the UN that Britain had pioneered the industrial revolution and was the first country "to send enough acrid smoke into the atmosphere to disrupt the natural order".
"We understand that when developing countries look to us for help, we have to shoulder our responsibilities," the British Prime Minister continued.
- Stakes high -
One of the biggest challenges facing climate negotiations is a deficit of trust among parties, and climate finance may be the most fraught issue on the table.
"The shortfall in funds is costing lives and livelihoods," Sonam Wangi, chair of the Least Developed Countries (LDC) negotiating bloc, said in a statement.
"Developed countries delivering on their decade-old commitment to support vulnerable countries ... will be critical for building trust and accelerating the global response to climate change."
UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa agrees that living up to those promises could be a key for unlocking other logjams.
"The complexity of the outcome of COP26 is that it is not one or two or three decisions, it has to be a package," she told journalists.
"If we can get a good perspective regarding the $100 billion, that would ... give us the means to make progress on some other issues."
- $100bn not a ceiling -
In 2009, $100 billion sounded like a lot of money, but the recent crescendo of heatwaves, flooding caused by extreme rainfall, drought and evermore powerful storms has made it clear that it's not nearly enough, experts agree.
The sum seems especially paltry compared to the multi-trillion dollar Covid recovery packages that have been cobbled together to prop up rich economies.
"A combined global fiscal response to the crisis of close to $12 trillion begs a question," climate finance experts commissioned by the UN wrote in a recent report.
"If a pandemic can provoke such a rapid and far-reaching response, at scale, surely the world can muster the necessary will to act with similar decisiveness and urgency in response to the climate crisis?"
"The $100 billion target therefore needs to be seen as a floor and not as a ceiling," the added.
Former Maldives president Mohamed Nasheed, representing the Climate Vulnerable Forum of 48 countries home to a billion people, said financing should be broadened to include sovereign debt relief.
"We are so threatened that we might not have an island or a country much longer, so it's hardly possible for us to pay the debt if we are not around," he said.
"Is it not then reasonable for climate vulnerable countries to call upon debt holders to restructure their debt?", he added, saying he would be taking this proposal to the Glasgow talks.
- Symbols of justice -
The $100 billion figure -- earmarked for emissions reduction and preparing for future climate impact -- has become a symbol of the perceived need for "climate justice", many observers point out.
The failure of rich nations to honour their pledge is especially galling in light of a separate track in the negotiations over "loss and damage", meant to cover the costs of climate-enhanced damages that have already occurred.
"The people and communities the least responsible for the rise in global emissions are facing the worst of the climate crisis right now," said Vanessa Nakate, a young climate activist from Uganda.Price:

ITMG020092After spending four days in jail, Andile Lungisa, ANC councillor for Nelson Mandela Bay is expected to be heard in the Grahamstown court of magistrate on Monday.
Lungisa was sentenced to two years behind bars for assaulting a DA councillor in 2016.
He smashed a glass water jug at a head of that councillor during a heated meeting for councillors.
In his petition, Lungisa says that the unpalatable foods were not suited for him, he’s complaining about the risk of violence, degrading ablution facilities and uncomfortable sleeping arrangements found in the cells according to The Herald.
The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) have said that they were going to oppose a bail application made by Lungisa to the Constitutional Court for leave to appeal against the sentence in order to be outside pending the outcome of the application.
Lungisa has since had his membership in the ANC suspended while the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) dismissed his appeal against the two-year sentence citing that there is no basis found to interfere with the imposed sentence as the crime was serious and5 Things: National Soaring Museum and Corning Painted Post Civic Music Association
This week's Five Things honors culture and history. We are lucky to have many wonderful organizations who provide a rare glimpse into the past and provide access to history and music, and these two Member organizations are some of the finest. If you are looking to enjoy a unique experience, please see Five Things you Don't Know about the National Soaring Museum and the Corning Painted Post Civic Music Association.
Five Things You Don't Know About the National Soaring Museum:
1. We are in our 51st year!
2. We have the largest collection of historic sailplanes and gliders in the United States.
3. We have rental space for meetings, banquets, receptions and more.
4. We have special exhibits throughout the year such as art, miniatures and others.
5. We have a delightful gift shop!
Our Goal for Membership is to raise public awareness of our fabulous museum.
What ONE thing do we want people to know about the Soaring Museum? We will exceed your expectations!
Five Things You Don't Know About Corning-Painted Post Civic Music Association:
1. CCMA is the longest continuously operating, all-volunteer performing arts organization in our region – 91 years and going strong!
2. Civic Music organizations were set up all over the country in the early 20th century to bring cultural events to small communities like Corning. The current board will be reaching to several “sister” organizations of a similar “age” to benchmark best practices.
3. In the early days, all concerts were sold out, there was a waiting list to subscribe, and subscribers were not notified about the next season’s artists until they had paid their subscriptions in advance.
4. Despite its “age,” several community leaders have pointed to CCMA as the model “arts organization of the future” since we have no paid staff, no buildings or other physical assets, and a lean administrative footprint. Our strength is in our volunteers!
5. CCMA is one of the best entertainment values in our area. For example, if you wanted to see Booker T. or Bela Fleck anywhere else you’d pay twice or three times as much!
Our Goal for Membership is to raise the community profile and awareness of CCMA. We’re also looking to collaborate with other businesses. For example, Connor’s has sponsored a single concert for the last two years, yielding good revenue return from their program discount offers.
What ONE thing do we want people to think of when they think of my business? We bring the highest quality performing artists to our region at a most affordable price. And we give back to our community by sponsoring a variety of in-school music education programs, featuring world-class artists as teachers, mentors and inspiration!Free Tools & Resources

One Intelligent Systems. They moved to the University of Tübingen, where she is about to submit her thesis.
Although it may sound illogical, destruction of cells is as essential as their creation in the course of proper formation, growth and development of multi-cellular organisms. For this reason, cells program deliberately their suicide through a very controlled process, named apoptosis (from the Greek, “fall off”). Our research group at the University of Tübingen, Germany works to unravel the precise mechanisms behind this vital process. This type of programmed cell death is crucial for proper organ shape and for the development of the nervous system. For example, our fingers and toes are connected by a webbing before we are born until the cells between them undergo apoptosis. In our brain, the cells that are not needed for good synaptic connections also have to die. Moreover, cells kill themselves off when they sense a potential threat to the organism, such as a virus infection or DNA damage.
Unfortunately, this is not a perfect process and the imbalance between cell proliferation and death carries fatal consequences for our organs. Excessive cell death is associated with the occurrence of strokes, heart attacks, or diseases such as Alzheimer´s and Parkinson´s. However, if something fails and apoptosis is not completed, the cells grow and accumulate massively leading to autoimmune diseases or cancer1.
The Bcl-2 family of proteins is the main orchestrators of apoptosis. The different members of this family can act in pro- (Bax, Bak) or anti-apoptotic (Bcl-xL, Bcl-2) ways. They form a very complex interaction network to manage the processes that induce the permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM), which is the point of no return in the cell´s commitment to die2. Bax is a key member of this family believed to directly participate in this process. However, how the integration of Bcl-2 interactions regulates apoptosis remains poorly understood.
In healthy cells, Bax is a soluble monomeric protein constitutively shuttling between the cytosol and the mitochondrial surface. When a cell is stressed, Bax activates its killer instinct and accumulates at the MOM, where it inserts in symmetrical pairs 3. Once it is membrane-embedded, more Bax dimers are recruited leading to the formation of big aggregates that end up permeabilizing the membrane. This enables the release of cytochrome c and other death factors to the cytosol and irrevocably to cell death. Despite intense research, the mechanism that Bax follows to irreversibly damage the cell and the structures that the protein adopts during pore formation are still unsettled. In fact, the existence of these pores is under debate because nobody has managed to visualize them in the mitochondria of mammalian cells.
But seeing is believing, so in our latest work we have taken advantage of super-resolution microscopy as a tool to tackle the organization of Bax at the nanoscale during apoptosis 4. We used a combination of fluorescence, atomic force, and electron microscopy techniques to investigate Bax architecture in single cells. First, we corroborated that the spatial distribution of Bax evolves with time during the different stages of apoptosis progression. Fluorescence confocal microscopy showed that in healthy cells Bax localizes homogeneously in the cytosol but it moves to specific sites at mitochondria after an apoptotic insult (Fig 1). However, confocal microscopes do not have enough resolution to provide information about the structure or orientation of Bax assemblies on the membrane. Thanks to dual-color super-resolution microscopy we could observe for the first time the shape of these assemblies. Surprisingly, we discerned well-defined structures of Bax shaped as full rings, arcs and lines along mitochondria (Fig. 2). These characteristic “doughnuts”, “half-moons”, and “chains” are only present when Bax is active and the cell is dying, so they were not created by chance. Then, we checked if these Bax assemblies were really permeabilizing the mitochondrial membrane using atomic force microscopy. Strikingly, we observed that full rings and arcs of similar size (from 30 to 300 nm) are able to perforate membranes that mimic the composition of mitochondria (Fig 2). This confirms beyond doubt that the doughnuts and half-moons we detected are tightly related to Bax killer function. To further validate our findings, we also analyzed the mitochondria of apoptotic cells via electron microscopy. The cells exhibited disrupted mitochondrial surface, with holes in the same order of magnitude as the Bax structures identified in the super-resolution images.
In summary, this work proposes a new mechanism for Bax action and endorses the pore forming theory, providing an essential piece to assemble the intricate apoptotic puzzle.
There is still a long road ahead of us to fully understand how Bax and the other Bcl-2 proteins interact to kill the cells, but now that we have evidence of the existence of pores we are one step closer to completing the picture. When we finally untangle all the molecular details involved in apoptotic progression, we will be able to come up with ways to block or induce MOM permeabilization. This would open interesting possibilities for the development of therapies against cancer or neurological disorders.

The range of values is always 0 to 10, and generally the value plotted is around 1.1 or 1.2 (a value of 1.0 indicates an area of “stagnant” solidification). You can plot Hot Spots based either on Solidification Time or based on Critical Fraction Solid Time.
To figure hot spot values, the system compares either the solidification time, or the critical fraction solid (CFS) time of each metal node to its neighbors. If it froze later than its neighbors, it is an isolated area, or a hot spot. The system keeps track of the differences in time, then orders them from the greatest isolation on down. All isolated areas are normalized to the range of 0-1, where 0 is most isolated, and 1 is stagnant, that is, froze at the same time as neighbors. Non-isolated areas are ordered, then normalized to the range of 1-10, where 1 is stagnant and 10 is most directional.
By plotting at a level of 1, you can see actual isolation locations. If you plot at 1.1 or 1.2, you may be able to see these locations more clearly, since they will cover a greater volume.
The hot spot plot does not give an indication of the severity of the defect, as it does not take contraction/expansion into account. But it does give a good indication of what areas may have problems.Romance made a great progress means before few years. By using the fast surge of tech like smart phones along with popularity of internet dating applications like Tinder, Grindr and Hinge, it’s more likely than ever before you’ll find your upcoming mate on line.
But regardless of the rise in tech — plus the multitude of programs accessible to single men and women looking to see a match — online dating offersn’t altered the importance the all-important primary go out. Very first goes stay as stressful as always; their particular achievement (or breakdown) can see whether you’ll generally be watching everyone for a long time, or if you’ll parts tips and don’t speak again.
The best how to determine whether you are big date is certainly going nicely? Psychiatrists claim the gestures; the little evidence given away through non-verbal signs that occasionally can say in excess of terminology can. Researchers have become keen on this field working on their own personal studies; actually this bingo games site searched body gestures on a night out together.
The following are some of the ways you may tell just how your potential companion is feeling according to their body communication.
it is all-in the face
It’s gone stated that the eye are the gap for the psyche. While specialists may not be capable confirm this, someone’s eyes are a good way of studying loads about them — specifically when you are considering online dating. An inability for making eye-to-eye contact often means dullness or disinterest. Appearing downwards can propose submissiveness or stress, while aiming to along side it is known to indicate deceit.
Look closely at their particular individuals, too. Experts have realized that when intellectual energy goes up (for example. somebody is being attentive to your or centered on exactly what you’re saying) that pupils will quickly dilate. Traci Brown, a human anatomy speech professional and creator states: “If their own students dilate once they have a look at one, they’re totally loving what they view. If they shrink, they’re less to the view.”
Pros say that eye-contact is a superb way of suggesting whether the time keeps any involvement in a person.
Search hindering
Preventing doesn’t only come on the web. Named “distancing language”, stopping is really what occurs when an individual isn’t feel an association with someone or is disatisfied with ways a discussion goes, thereby ‘blocking’ on their own psychologically through distancing. Checked look for entered arms or an angling of the muscles (when someone thinks installed and operating, they’re more likely to square with the other person or experience these people straight). Stopping is definitely a non-verbal of letting you know your go steady belongs to the defence that will stop being keen.
Your feet are a fantastic share
Need an easy way to share with in the event your date proceeding very well? Look at their legs! Experts have realized that people are likely to aim our legs inwards once we’re wanting be much more friendly.
And simply like when considering stopping, foot going straight towards other people show fees — while base pointing on the doorstep indicates want to regarding indeed there.
Will you be getting mirrored?
Another simple strategy for finding down when someone wish we is if you start feeling like you’re looking in a mirror. Mirroring is the mimicking of another person’s nonverbal communication; could incorporate sets from the manner in which you’re sitting, to holding hair or taking a sip of a glass or two soon after we. It’s a non-verbal motion that many of us create innately to construct a rapport with someone you know.
If you’d like to test this principles aside, decide to try transitioning enhance actions or state; if they stick to match, there’s a good chance they’re building an easier experience of an individual.
Her closeness
When it comes to a primary go out, closeness is vital. When your date is record or parked close to you, it’s more likely that things are running smoothly. Sitting down across from oneself at a table? Aim to have a feeling of whether they’re tilting in nearer to we or pulling off. Leaning in was a non-verbal methods of partaking with you. Psychotherapist Paul Hokemeyer confirms this. “A individual who inclines in in your direction are generally exposing their interest in who you really are, all you have to talk about in addition to the addictiveness of your respective staying,” according to him. “It reveals achieve really a person not less.”
Hands data
Much like the base, a person’s arms can spot all of us a whole lot about how exactly they think about usa. Hands inside their purse or face to face their particular mind, for instance, can show trick. Gesturing towards some body can indicate an affinity in their eyes. Leaning in and sleeping the top similarly try an indicator that they’re wanting give attention to exactly what opponent is saying. The pinnacle sleeping in two hands, with elbows on the table, can reveal monotony or disinterest.
Be aware of hand-related blocking also. If the date locations, or keeps, a product between a person they can be subconsciously wanting range by themselves!
Conversational movement
It’s not just exactly what your big date claims to you personally — it’s how they say it. Speed can show panic, as can tripping through to his or her words. Nervousness on an initial time is not often a tell-tale sign of interests — nevertheless often it will indicate tourist attraction. “When the attraction try good it is able to transform extremely brilliant grown ups into bumbling youngsters,” Hokemeyer states. “So, if they stumbles on terminology or keeps a tough time assembling a night of cogent opinions, most likely it’s considering they are quite definitely into you.”
So that the on the next occasion you are well on a very first go steady and so are unsure about how it is actually supposed, remember fondly the gestures information.

All your found sculptural assemblages are culled from your immediate local surroundings and re-appropriated into Rube Goldberg like contraptions with each object serving a very specified transmissive function. The sculptural forms then become crucial as they exist to explicate the sounds themselves. Can you expand on the intentionality of the material used, or lack thereof? How do you approach the documentation of these sculptures as images on the internet, without the accompanied support/context of audio?
As images or objects devoid of their operational potential, the works are sculptures like any other static and quiet object of art. I see their formal qualities as a thing in itself - the aesthetic result of a process of engineering music. So the form follows function and therefore the composition or constellation of objects becomes somehow more gestural than designed. Of course as images it is difficult to understand the work as a whole but I hope that the form opens up some ideas around traditional sculpture.
Works like Adhãn, Taka Tak and Evolution of a Revolution, capture a certain political ethos and critique specific Islamic ideological structures . Where potentially, can sound, and music in general (your own and others) exist in such arenas? Where do you see its potential? How do you think it can actively function and what form can it take, besides one of aestheticizing politics?
To be honest I don't believe it can have any immediate function other than an aesthetic one, however, I do think the proliferation of sound and music within an Islamic society can have a transformative social function. This, however, isn't the aim of my practice. For me it's a way of understanding and rationalising the problems around belief systems in general such as religious faith. I make an ideological critique on Islam because I understand it more by growing up with it, but really the critique is about dogmatic views that are prevalent in all types of religious faith.
As software and technology fluctuate from being highly complex, new and unaccessible to consumerable and egalitarian, sound and music production increase with the amount of people determined and willing to, on a whim, express themselves. Digitization and recent computing technology, has in general been understood within opaque boundaries, .i.e. we don't really understand how these things we use work. There's definitely a type of 'analog' transparency that's apparent in your installations and though we may never technically understand your acoustic spaces, we can witness moments of its disambiguation. Can you talk more about the importance and responsibility of working this way?
The demystification of processes in art is important to me. I guess it's an open-source sensibility that is synonymous with the development of technology. Yes it's true that analogue is easier to understand but that's only now that our knowledge and education has caught up. 50 years ago an ordinary person would not know the workings of a transistor radio but now kids make such things at school and I imagine the same will happen with modern digital technology. The other thing that I find interesting is that the principle remains the same - electricity passes through components either at varying degrees or simply just on and off. For example the world digital has been around for a while. In the 80's we prefixed calculators and Casio watches with the word digital. But now we associate the word with technology that is not analogue. So digits that once were numbers 0 - 9 have now been reduced to just 0 and 1. It's a simplification or codification of information coupled with a semantic shift. I find this interesting as a way of thinking about how language or at least syntax could become outmoded.
You sometimes frame your practice within Marxist theory. Could you further articulate the placement of your practice within such? Perhaps specifically in regards to materialism and mediation?
This is a challenging question that I guess I could write an essay on! I think Marx and his legacy, mainly through French post-strucualist thought, is something that I refer to in contextualising my work and how it is presented in the world. An important area of thinking for me is Marxist value systems and how art can manipulate and distort the idea of use, exchange and surplus value. Another is the idea of materialism in that nothing in the world is new, it's just modified material. And thirdly is the idea of mediation. I believe any form of mediation is a step away from reality or truth. Reading this sentence in your email or on the Rhizome website is not an experience of me and my thoughts but rather a mediated (and probably edited) representation of me.

My mind.
How long have you been working creatively with technology? How did you start?
If we assume Marshall McLuhan's idea of technology then its when I started to help my mum make clothes when I was a kid. I was probably 8 or something.
Describe your experience with the tools you use. How did you start using them?
I use a soldering iron a lot. The first time I used one was when I did work experience in a company that developed networking systems. I was 13. Artists have welded for years. Soldering is mini welding.
Where did you go to school? What did you study?
BA Painting in Winchester, BA exchange in Chicago, MA Design in London then MA Art in London.
What traditional media do you use, if any? Do you think your work with traditional media relates to your work with technology?
Other than mini welding, I use a whole variety of media and materials, some traditional such as metal and wood others not so traditional such as LED's and micro-controllers.
Are you involved in other creative or social activities (i.e. music, writing, activism, community organising)?
A little yes, but I see these things all part of my practice. Other than DJing - that's separate although it deeply informs my work.
What do you do for a living or what occupations have you held previously? Do you think this work relates to your art practice in a significant way?
I used to make Pizza's and also worked in McDonalds for a while. I'm sure it has some influence somewhere but nothing significant. I used to design websites and some print material too. I'm very interested in design and design processes because it has an immediate impact on everyday praxis.
Who are your key artistic influences?
Edgard Varese, Max Neuhaus, Marcel Duchamp, Richie Hawtin, Fred Sandback and Guy Sherwin.
Have you collaborated with anyone in the art community on a project? With whom, and on what?
I have collaborated with many people on many projects. Some are straight collaborations others are curatorial projects and some are instances where I've incorporated existing works into my own installations. Laura Buckley, Dave Maclean, Django Django, Jeremy Deller, Guy Sherwin, Nina Canell, Giles Round, Angus Fairhurst, Torsten Lauschmann, Richard Sides, James Clarkson, Ed Atkins, James Richards, Theo Burt, Joy Division, Peter Saville, Richard 'Kid' Strange, Kim Coleman and Jenny Hogarth are some of the people I've worked with on various projects.
Do you actively study art history?
Yes.
Do you read art criticism, philosophy, or critical theory? If so, which authors inspire you?
Not enough at the moment. It would be easier to say which authors don't inspire me.
Are there any issues around the production of, or the display/exhibition of new media art that you are concerned about?
Yes. Multiple sounds in space is an issue for me. Lengthy time-based or moving image works in galleries are an issue for me. Gallery acoustics are an issue for me. Plug sockets, non-universal power and cabling is also an issue for me.Anything but plain sailing for Yachtsmen

Are you battling the woes of low self-esteem and do not know how to feel better about yourself? You are not alone as there are several others like you who suffer from low self-esteem issues for varied reasons. Today’s post will look into this problem and help you to discover easy and effective ways on how to overcome these low feelings to feel better about yourself and the world. So, stay tuned till the end.
What causes low self-esteem?
Low self-esteem generally originates in the mind when you feel you are unworthy. There could be some events in the past or present that might have made you feel this way. Thoughts that you are inadequate, incompetent or unacceptable haunt you all the time. These strong beliefs lead to thoughts that are negative and self-critical. They affect your mental health and later your life choices and behavior in life.
With the power of mindfulness, you can effectively mitigate negative thoughts that affect your choices in life. You will learn how to look at situations better and tend to view yourself and other people less objectively.
Ways to overcome low self-esteem
The following are some effective ways to help you to overcome the feelings of low self-esteem-
1. Live in the present moment
When you live and focus on the present moment, you can choose your actions wisely. You will not be affected with the thoughts of the past and unperturbed about anxiety and worries in the future.
2. Develop a keen sense of awareness
Being fully aware of yourself and surroundings helps you in a large way to respond and react better to fears and apprehension. When you create a moment between your actions and emotions, you are able to respond in a better and healthier way.
3. Write daily in a journal
Do you know that writing in a journal helps? There are several fears and thoughts that often remain locked up inside your sub-conscious mind. When you pen them down in a personal journal, you can separate the negative thoughts from the truth as to who you really are.
4. Do not judge
Self-acceptance helps you to be non-judgemental in life. This goes a very long way to help you accept successes and failures in life. The same holds true for other people as well. You are able to accept them just the way they are without shame or pride.
5. Remain connected to yourself
Mindfulness helps you in a large way to stay connected with your inner self. You can curb thinking in the auto-pilot mode and stop pleasing people. Gradually, you will stop jumping around to please others without thinking about your own needs.
6. Practice mindful meditation
Meditation means you should let go and declutter the racing thoughts that run through your mind all day. Take some moments to remain still and silent. Take deep slow breaths and experience calmness in the mind. Focus on your inhalation and exhalation of breaths to feel peace inside. This simple daily practice helps you in a large way to remain focused and peaceful inside.
7. Participate in life
With daily meditation and mindfulness, you are able to remain active and participate in the activities of life. You can assess your thoughts and your response will be better. When you are aware of what you feel, you are able to take action and responsibly participate in life.
8. Let go
Letting go of events and people that pull you down helps you to break negative attachments. Trust yourself and choose what is completely right for your happiness. Sometimes, other people enter your life and damage your self-esteem. Do not allow them to control your thoughts- if someone is not right for you, let go and move on.
With these simple ways, you can boost your self-esteem to a large extent. Show compassion towards yourself as this is the first step for you to enhance your self-worth. Remember, to love yourself first. Do what is right for you and gradually watch the low feelings drifting away from your mind. It will take some effort but trust the process-it does work and you will feel better with time!Study design: A 15-year follow-up study.
Objective: To find risk indicators for self-reported sick-listing because of low back trouble and to evaluate which variables were the most important indicators of work incapacity resulting from low back trouble during the follow-up period of 15 years.
Summary of background data: The initial data were obtained from a health survey conducted in a general population from the Municipality of Glostrup, Denmark. The follow-up data included information from the Central Person Register, the Early Retirement Pension Register, and a postal questionnaire regarding self-reported sick-listing because of low back trouble.
Methods: An epidemiologic study, in which logistic regression analyses were used for evaluation of the data. The model used consisted of the variable in question, age, gender, and previous experience of low back trouble, along with interactions.
Results: It was found that 22 of 37 variables were risk indicators for later self-reported sick-listing because of low back trouble during the preceding year or the 7 years before the date of follow-up evaluation. In analyzing the most significant variables simultaneously, it was found that information from the initial investigation about sick-listing in general during the previous 10 years, sciatic pain, use of analgesics for low back trouble, previous sick-listing because of low back trouble, and occupation were the most important risk indicators for self-reported work incapacity resulting from low back trouble during the follow-up period of 15 years.
Conclusion: Findings showed that the strongest prognostic indicators of later sick-listing because of low back trouble involve information from the person about previous sick-listing behavior in general and previous experience of low back trouble episodes, especially if these had been accompanied by sciatic pain, use of analgesics, or previous low back trouble sick-listing.An example, to whit.

Hello, i live in Genoa (Italy) and i work as a taxi driver. I can confirm the good quality of the new decoder, i can view all channels as at home, also all HD channells. The image quality are great and is very easy to use. I have tested the decoder inside my city at speed up to 90 km/h with no problem, the highway near my city have many tunnel and is no possibile to see the tv, i will test in future at high speed.
So i can recommend this decoder because if it works in Genoa where the signal is very low, this decoder can works anywhere.

the Germans programs without encryption run without problems ,But Freenet -TV I do not get installed,wweiss anyone have any advice.
R.Barkhuysen –
Have received very quickly and installed the system. All free programs run smoothly even while driving. Since the device has no ir.deto decryption, the private stations can not be received. Since there are also other ways in the state. But in order to go short to look over the car radio display times in the news, it is perfect and fully serves its purpose. The great sensitivity can also receive over a wide range from a transmitting station to. small disadvantage, then you need to load your programs, because you are out of range, lasts a long time. But this is the abundance of TV channels also likely otherwise difficult to achieve. One advantage but, retained the programmed stations, even in complete power cut, z.B. Batterieausbau. So I can say is highly recommended.

From the trials of long distance dating, to buying a house together, these two are there for each other through thick and thin.
“I knew he was the one right away. I saw the way he treated others, respected his parents and his family, the way he looked at me and respected me. I saw the drive he had and how good of a person he is, and I knew right away that he was the one. I think I knew it 3 months into our relationship even though I was only 16 years old.”
Their proposal happened over the winter up on the Grand Mesa. Bill was so nervous he actually hid the ring in his sock to make sure Katie couldn’t feel the ring box on him when she’d hug him. Smart thinking! Katie recalls, “It was a Thursday, my first day of winter vacation from school, and we took a drive up to the Grand Mesa to take a walk. We walked a mile and then Bill said it was time to turn around so we could head back down. He said, ‘But before we do that, I have to ask you something.’ He got down on one knee and said, ‘Katie, all I wanted for my birthday is for you to be my wife, so will you marry me?’ I was shocked!” Later that night Bill had lined up a limo to take them to look at Christmas lights, which is the cutest thing ever!
Bill and Katie were so excited to begin their married lives together, and were wed on a beautiful early summer day in June. The celebration was held at Katie’s church, First Congregational UCC here in Grand Junction. It was amazing to see all the little details they put into everything. The two of them, along with their families, worked hard to DIY most parts of the day from the decorations to the food! We incorporated their love of dirt biking in some photos, which were also cake toppers for their sheet cake. It was such a beautiful day; check out some of my favorite moments from their Grand Junction Wedding at First Congregational U Bill & Katie for having me be part of your big day!

As technology keeps advancing, it’s becoming a bigger and bigger part of our lives. These days, most families own several different computers and smart devices, and we use them all day long. Everyday activities such as work, entertainment, socializing, and shopping are all happening through a screen. Research shows that most Americans now devote at least 10 hours a day to screen time, and it's only growing.1
Never before in human history have we spent most of our waking hours staring rigidly at a brightly lit screen directly in front of us. This sudden increase in screen time over the past decade has raised concerns about the effects of screen time on our health, and especially our vision.
Digital Eye Strain
The blue light emitted from our phone, computer, and LED TV screens has a short wavelength and high energy, similar to UV and blue light from the sun. It’s more intense and less focused than other visible wavelengths, creating visual “noise” that can be hard on the eyes.2 It's easy to see how this kind of visual stress can cause discomfort, possibly with long-term consequences.
When our minds are focused on the screen, we may not even realize how hard our eyes are working. We tend to blink only half as often, and may forget to move or shift our visual focus for long periods of time. All of these factors can lead to digital eye strain, or computer vision syndrome. Nearly 60% of Americans have reported digital eye strain symptoms,3 including eye fatigue or irritation, watery or dry eyes, eye strain headache, and difficulty concentrating.
Digital eye strain is temporary, but there is also concern that too much screen time may cause lasting damage to our eyes. The powerful blue light from our screens passes through the cornea to the retina, increasing the possibility of retinal damage that could prematurely age the eyes.Some research shows a link between blue light exposure and age-related macular degeneration.4
Risks of Screen Time for Kids
The risks of too much screen time may be higher for children, whose sensitive eyes are still developing. Kids need exposure to sunlight and the outdoors for healthy eye development, yet they are increasingly spending more time indoors in front of screens. Kids have a harder time with self-discipline when it comes to on-screen entertainment, and may not easily recognize symptoms of eye strain.
This extensive screen time may be harmful for childrens’ visual development. Research shows that kids who stay indoors are more likely to be nearsighted.5 In fact, since 1971, there has been a dramatic increase in nearsightedness around the world. In the US, nearsightedness has nearly doubled to 42%, and in Asia, up to 90% of teens and adults are nearsighted.6
Many experts think there may be a link between screen time and nearsightedness, or myopia, in children. Researchers in Ireland found that the risk of nearsightedness in schoolchildren increased when screen time exceeded three hours per day.7 A similar study in Denmark found that the risk of myopia nearly doubled in teens who used screen devices for more than six hours a day.8
Healthy Screen Time Habits
You can protect your family’s vision by setting smart screen time limits and practicing healthy habits to avoid digital eye strain. Here are some tips for minimizing the effects of screen time on your eyes.
- Position your screen to support a healthy viewing posture. This is especially important if you work on a computer all day. Place your monitor directly in front of you at an arm’s length distance. The first line of text on the screen should be at eye level, and you should not have to tilt your head or neck.
- Adjust the lighting in the room to reduce eye strain. Make sure there isn’t overhead light glaring off the screen, and that there’s just enough light contrast to read the screen easily. If you find yourself leaning forward or squinting, enlarge the text.
- Practice the 20-20-20 rule. Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. This helps your eyes relax and adjust focus to a further distance. There’s even an app that can help remind you to take this eye break.
- Stay hydrated. Drinking water regularly can help keep your eyes from drying out. You can also use a room humidifier or eye drops if you find yourself getting dry eyes. Remember to blink regularly.
- Wear glasses for computer use. If you normally wear contact lenses, they may increase symptoms of eye irritation. Wearing glasses instead can give your eyes a break. Even if you don’t normally wear glasses, you may want to try computer glasses that reduce screen glare or filter out blue light.
Nutrients for Eye Health
Making sure you get enough eye-friendly nutrients can help protect your long-term vision and reduce the risk of premature eye aging, or macular degeneration. Here are some of the nutrients that have been shown to help protect your eye health.
- Lutein and Zeaxanthin. These carotenoids found in leafy green vegetables are absolutely crucial for healthy vision, and have been shown to protect the retina against the damaging effects of light-induced oxidative stress.9
- Vitamin C. This powerful antioxidant found in colorful fruits and veggies has been shown to help slow the progression of macular degeneration when combined with other nutrients.
- Vitamin E. Found in nuts and sweet potatoes, this antioxidant helps protect the eyes against free radicals, which have been linked with degenerative eye conditions.
- Zinc. Highly concentrated in the eye, particularly in and around the retina, this essential mineral helps bring Vitamin A from the liver to the retina to produce melanin, a protective pigment.10
- Copper. This essential mineral also acts as an antioxidant, helping to protect the eye from oxidative stress and encouraging the development of flexible tissue for healthy eye structure.
Two definitive clinical studies on maintaining visual health, known as the Age-Related Eye Disease Studies (AREDS and AREDS2), looked at the long-term effects of taking nutritional supplements to protect against age-related macular degeneration. The resulting AREDS2 formula, which includes all of the above nutrients, has been shown to effectively slow the progression of AMD.11
The nutrients in the AREDS2 formula are hard to obtain in sufficient amounts from diet alone. However, eating a nutritious diet rich in leafy greens has been shown to reduce your risk of developing AMD. Those who don’t eat enough leafy greens are likely deficient in lutein and zeaxanthin. For these people, supplementing with the AREDS2 formula resulted in a 26% reduction in their risk of developing advanced AMD.11
If you’d like to try the AREDS2 formula for yourself, check out NATURELO’s Eye Health supplement. This supplement includes all of the nutrients in the clinically-proven AREDS2 formula, plus additional eye health nutrients, such as Omega 3 fatty acids EPA and DHA. For best results, you may want to combine the eye health supplement with a daily multivitamin, as two-thirds of the AREDS trial participants did.
The Eye Health supplement is intended for adults, but it's also important for kids and teens to get enough eye-friendly nutrients. Our Chewable Multivitamin for Kids and Whole Food Multivitamin for Teens include lutein and zeaxanthin, as well as vitamins C & E, zinc and copper, to help kids hit their daily nutritional targets and support healthy vision.

Triptans are first-line medications to treat acute migraine, but new research shows patients do not take them in more than 40% of their migraine attacks.
Few studies have been conducted regarding how closely migraine patients follow treatment protocols. Recently, however, Robert A. Nicholson, PhD, of Mercy Clinic Headache Center and Mercy Health Research in Saint Louis, led a team that studied more than 260 migraineurs, who kept headache diaries for at least one month. Over the course of the study, patients reported 4,291 migraines and treated 57.2 with triptans. When they did so, they were more likely to report mild pain (56%) and less disability than when they recorded moderate pain (43%) or severe pain (39%).
Patients were also more likely to use triptans when they experienced nausea, photophobia, throbbing pain or unilateral pain. Those who were least likely to adhere to the use of triptans were unmarried males with a higher number of headache days each month.
The study did not determine why patients chose not to take their medication, but researchers suggest improved patient education about the benefits of triptans is important.
“One of the things we want to do is encourage providers to work with their patients and make sure patients are engaged in their own care to be able to be their own best managers of their pain,” Dr. Nicholson told Medscape Medical News. “They should be trained to pay attention to their symptoms so they can give themselves the best chance of success in treating a migraine when it occurs.”

A woman’s age is the best predictor of whether in vitro fertilisation will result in a baby, with women under age 34 having the greatest chances of success. But older women can largely overcome poorer odds by using donor eggs from a younger woman, according to the research.
Those are among the findings of a massive study on in vitro fertilisation that, while offering few surprises, provides what experts say is the most detailed, nuanced look at who is likely to be successful using assisted reproductive technology.
“What this study does is look at a woman’s chances of conception based on adding all cycles together and taking into account her age, the diagnosis that brought her in for fertility treatments, whether there were additional embryos [preserved] and the stage the embryos were transferred,” said lead study author Barbara Luke, professor and epidemiologist at Michigan State University in East Lansing. “When women come in for treatment, there isn’t a simple answer about their chances of conception. There are a lot of factors to be taken into consideration.”
For example, after the third treatment cycle, women aged 31 and younger had a 63 percent to 75 percent chance of ending up with a baby, while women 41 or 42 using their own egg had a 19 percent to 28 percent chance. Those 43 or older had a 7 percent to 11 percent chance.
When donor eggs were used, the rates were much higher — 60 percent and 80 percent, respectively, for all ages.
“If you use a younger egg, you will vastly improve the chances of conception,” Luke said.
In other findings: The chances of getting pregnant were higher when physicians transferred a “blastocyst embryo” (an embryo that is five to six days old) instead of a “cleavage embryo” (one that is two to three days old). At the third cycle, live-birth rates were 52 percent to 81 percent for blastocyst embryos and 43 percent to 65 percent for cleavage embryos.
The study, published in the June 27 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, looked at data on nearly 250,000 women who underwent 471,000 in vitro fertilisation cycles from 2004 to 2009 at approximately 400 clinics. The treatments resulted in 141,000 babies. The data was from the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology Clinic Outcome Reporting System.
Rather than look at the likelihood of success per cycle, the researchers were able to track women over several years to determine their cumulative rates of success — that is how likely they were to get pregnant and carry a baby to term on subsequent in vitro fertilisation cycles if their first, second or even third cycle was unsuccessful.
Many women quit after one or two cycles, often because of stress, discouragement or finances. One cycle of in vitro fertilisation costs approximately $10,000 to $12,000. The study findings, which included women who had up to seven or more cycles, suggested some may be giving up too soon, Luke said.
About 25 percent of women quit after the first cycle, and about one-third of the remainder quit after two cycles, Luke said.
“One of the messages to take away from this is to think about infertility treatment as a course of treatment that, for most women, will take more than one cycle,” she said. “This is showing your success rate may be right around the corner. One more try may do it.”
By the same token, women 40 and older should take a hard look at their odds and perhaps consider a donor egg more quickly, she added.
The new study also looked at infertility diagnoses that could influence chances of success. Having a low number of eggs or a diagnosis of diminished ovarian reserve was associated with lower odds of a live birth. Uterine factors — such as fibroids, endometriosis or adhesions on the uterus — also were associated with a markedly lower success rate.
Other factors, such as male infertility, polycystic ovarian syndrome and tubal factor infertility, had less of an impact, the study found.
Dr. William Gibbons, former president of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine and director of the division of reproductive endocrinology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said the new study was unprecedented in that it involved such a large number of women.
He also commented that the data enabled researchers to track women over time to determine the overall chances of success based on a variety of factors.
Couples want to know their chances of ultimately having a baby, and if it makes sense for them to continue going through the expense and stress of multiple in vitro fertilisation cycles, Gibbons said. One major message from the study is that an older woman’s chances of getting pregnant after three cycles are pretty similar to a younger woman’s chances if the older woman is willing to use a donor egg, he said.
The new statistics will enable doctors to give more detailed information to couples as they make their decision about whether they want to keep going with in vitro fertilisation, to turn to donor eggs or to keep trying with their own.
“We can show this to couples, and it can be used in counseling patients,” Gibbons said.

Malin posted on Instagram: ‘Completely.’
Malin named her first child with partner Tom Kemp after her late mother who died in November 2017 following a battle with breast cancer.
On 9 January, Malin, 26, thanked her followers for their prayers. She wrote: ‘.’
Globally, there is one preterm birth every two seconds. These babies (born before 37 weeks of pregnancy) are often critically ill and suffer lifelong complications. There was exceptionally limited success in reducing rates of preterm birth, largely because current treatment plans are ‘one size fits all’ while preterm delivery often has very different causes. Our scientists made major headway addressing this issue and identifying potential solutions. In a recent original study funded by Genesis, which profiled the thousands of small molecules that are present in blood and urine, our scientists were able to identify different reasons for preterm birth from very early in pregnancy. This means that we may now begin to design individualised treatment and prevention plans that are based upon a much better understanding of why an individual woman is at risk and therefore much more likely to be successful.
From all at Genesis Research Trust, our thoughts and prayers go out to Ms Malin Andersson and her family during this difficult time.

Children who learn to value honesty are equipped to maintain and even improve society as responsible, caring adults. Use a simple craft integrated into a class lesson about honesty to teach kindergarteners the benefits of honesty as well as the consequences of acting dishonestly.
Video of the Day
Lesson Plan
Set aside a class session to explain what honesty is and how being truthful or telling lies affects how you feel about yourself and how others feel about you. Start the lesson by asking children questions about honesty like "What is honesty?" "Why is it important to be honest?" "Is it ever okay to lie?" and "What are the consequences of dishonesty?" After discussion, move into a craft involving masks. Complete the lesson with an activity that tangibly demonstrates the effect that dishonesty can have on a person's character.
Mask Craft
Help each child hold a paper plate up to his face. Lightly make eye holes with a pencil where each child's eyes are. Help the children cut out the eye holes if they are not able to do it themselves. Encourage the children to decorate the masks with paint or crayons into someone or something they like. Children can make a favorite animal or superhero. Punch a hole on either side of the plate and cut an 18-inch piece of string for each mask. Secure the string so children can wear their masks.
Discussion
Gather the children to talk about the mask craft. Discuss that while it's fun to wear a mask for Halloween or playtime, masks hide who we really are. Explain that honesty is showing the world who we are and what we think about circumstances, places and other people. Help the children understand the importance of authenticity in healthy relationships by saying that good friends tell each other what they think and feel in a kind, respectful way. Talk about the consequences of lying, such as making people think they can't trust you or be friends with you and making you feel guilty.
Tower of Flour Activity
Drive home your lesson with an activity involving common kitchen materials. Place a dime in the center of a glass cup. Pour about one cup of flour into the glass on top of the dime. Pack the flour down tight. Set a paper plate on top of the glass. With the plate pressed up against the glass, flip the plate and glass over and set them on top of the newspaper. Tap the sides of the glass gently with a kitchen knife. Carefully remove the glass from the paper, leaving a short pillar of flour with a dime placed on top.
Tell the children that the dime represents honesty. Cut off one of the edges of the flour tower with the knife. Watch as the dime begins to fall. Continue cutting off slices of the tower until the dime falls through the flour tower and the tower itself collapses. Explain that this is what lying does to our character.Template. 👉(Read Online eBook): How to Fight and Reduce Maintenance under CrPC 125 and DV Act 👈 But I … Continue reading Template/Format for newspaper apology by wife for filing false complaint or cases

Fiction:
The Survivors
1982 Short Story Contest Third Place Winner
Waiting in the rain, she thought of how tired she had been long ago, working and running the farm. She was tired now.
Morning gave off the damp earth smell of spring as Sister Tucker stepped out onto her front porch, letting the storm door slam shut behind her. Sunlight breaking through the patchy layer of clouds lit up the corners of the market across the street, glinting off the windshields of the two or three cars parked there, while March gusts blew plastic wrappers and squashed paper cups across the parking lot from the service station next door. The shrubs, whose untidy tops brushed her window ledges, cast moving patterns of shadow and light on her lawn, and the grass was growing shaggy and green again after a long winter. Time to call the Simmons boy to come and cut it—a sure sign that soon robins would be tiptoeing across her yard and she would be able to plant her tomato and onion sets and clear out the sun porch to make room for her begonias and African violets.
Pulling on her knit navy-blue gloves, she peered up the street in the direction Darcy’s car would come. Sister Tucker was a thin woman and spare; but bundled up as she was now in her furry winter coat, she looked like a bear emerging from hibernation. The coat had been an extravagance, probably more suitable for a much younger woman, but she hadn’t been able to resist the soft feel of the brown orlon fur under her hand in the department store, and the saleslady had insisted it looked good on her. Perhaps so, but the effect of youthfulness was certainly lost when one considered the veined legs wrapped in stockings like bandages and the heavy black old-lady’s shoes she had to wear.
Darcy’s car was nowhere in sight. Sister Tucker was early getting ready for church this morning, or Darcy was late—no surprise for a young mother with three little ones to get dressed and fed all by herself. Darcy’s husband was a policeman and quite often had to work on Sunday, or else so late Saturday night that he couldn’t make it to church the next morning.
Sister Tucker was in sympathy with all those young mothers she saw shepherding their families into church every Sunday morning, the boys’ hair all slicked down with water, the comb lines still sharp, white shirts tucked in neatly until halfway through Primary—or the little girls with their hair pulled back into French braids, feet dancing in black patent-leather sandals, and carrying their little purses self-consciously over thin wrists. The Church hadn’t been part of her life during those years when she raised her own daughters, struggling to buy the dresses and schoolbooks and pay the dental bills—and living with Gus. Maybe life would have been easier, maybe harder.
Darcy’s blue sedan pulled to a stop at the curb with a short honk of the horn. Sister Tucker touched her braided coronet of white hair with her glove to make certain all was still in place before slipping on the plastic rain bonnet and snapping it securely under her chin against any unexpected gusts of wind.
Darcy reached over to unlock the car door, and Sister Tucker lowered herself inside, placing her straw carryall and new triple combination and Bible on the seat between them before turning to pull the heavy door shut with both hands. A brief smile of greeting touched Darcy’s lips before she shifted out of park into drive and lurched into the street, gunning the motor slightly as she did so. “I’m late,” she announced flatly, glancing over her shoulder at the two boys and a girl sitting quietly for the moment in the back seat absorbed in picture books. “I’m teaching the Social Relations lesson and my room isn’t set up yet.”
Sister Tucker nodded, watching for a moment the play of light on Darcy’s long, pale hair as they moved through traffic. Darcy’s eyes frowned into the windshield, intent on the road. “I went to see my daughter Lucille yesterday,” she told Darcy. “Her little son, the one with Down’s Syndrome, had just been to the doctor. He needs surgery and they haven’t been able to get insurance. Poor Lucille. Her husband hasn’t been able to get overtime at the plant and they can’t find a house they can afford so that Jimmy can play outside without Lucille chasing him out of the street. He’s twelve years old now.” She took a breath.
“You kids stop your arguing over that book!” Darcy called over her shoulder. “Simon, you are not to call Moira a pig. That is her book and she’s allowed to share it with whomever she pleases. … However,” she added in steely tones, “those who share will be blessed.”
Sister Tucker chuckled, a dry rippling sound, as she looked into the back seat in time to see Simon surreptitiously pinch his sister. The girl winced and elbowed him in the side. Sister Tucker turned forward again, her face quite solemn.
“I remember when my girls were that small,” she said. “Lucille and Winnifred were always picking on Alberta. Of course, Alberta asked for it with her constant teasing. ‘You girls behave now,’ I used to say when they played. But it wouldn’t take ten minutes and they’d be at each other again.”
As she talked, Sister Tucker remembered the three little girls in their starched pinafores playing with salt boxes for cradles and wooden clothespins for dolls on the polished blue and gray linoleum of her kitchen. Their thick brown hair hung down their backs in the ringlets she had curled up in rags the night before; their dimpled hands darted back and forth in play, their thin voices rising and falling in laughter and quarrels. She’d watched them while she stirred her boiling jam with a wooden spoon or hurried back and forth between the well, the garden, the kitchen, and the sickroom where Gus often lay with his asthma attacks.
“Seems like they grow up so fast,” she said to Darcy. “My girls all have gray hair now, but they’re friends too. They’re all coming to see me on my birthday next month, you know. Winnifred and her husband are even driving in from the farm, which is hard for them to do these days because his mother’s sickly and they can’t get away.”
The car suddenly pulled off the road onto the shoulder, gravel spattering under its wheels, and Darcy turned around in her seat to rake her children with a glare. “If this quarreling does not stop now, instantly, this minute, I am going to let you all out of the car and you can walk home.”
Sister Tucker watched the faces of the three young children in the back seat grow very still, eyes rounding as they tried to guess whether their mother really meant it this time. Darcy’s face seemed as remote as the painted china figurines you see in drugstores, marred only by a vertical frown line between her eyebrows, though when she turned to glance at Sister Tucker she smiled in apology. “Sorry,” she murmured. “They’ve been on their worst behavior all morning. They must sense I’m in a hurry.”
Sister Tucker nodded vigorously. “They can tell, I know. It puts them on edge, too. I remember when I started working again because Gus couldn’t hold a job anymore. The girls would do their best to be late for school and make me late, too.”
They had dawdled, those girls, pulling on the red wool stockings that came up to their knees, fastening the buckles of their shoes. The tangles in their hair refused to unsnarl and their sweaters would develop spots and holes. She’d driven them to the bus stop in the ’39 Chevy, rattling over the jagged ruts in the dirt road, while Gus stayed behind in the house coughing and wheezing and she worried about what he would do if his lungs suddenly filled up. They’d been lucky though. Somehow God and good fortune had kept him alive until a year and a half ago—just before the missionaries came. Ah, well, two more months and she could go to the temple and have their work done.
Darcy plunged into the conversation. “They’ve asked me to give a breadmaking demonstration at Relief Society next month. Do you want to sign up for my class?”
Sister Tucker laughed heartily. “Oh my, no!” she gasped. “I used to make twenty loaves at a time for the field hands on daddy’s farm before breakfast. Goodness, those men could eat. We spent the afternoons bottling fruit. I got so fast I could do one hundred quarts of peaches a day all by myself.”
Darcy looked at the road as she pulled out to pass a slower car. The frown line had deepened again. “We’re also going to do English muffins and hamburger buns. You might like to learn how to do those.”
The car was rounding a corner and the children’s voices were rising again in a new quarrel, so Sister Tucker’s question seemed lost, not really needing an answer. “Well, who would I cook them for?” Before Gus had died he’d made her promise she would eat three meals a day and take care of herself. At first, before the missionaries came, alone in the echoing house and double bed, the cooking pots and full set of flowered dishes had seemed a mockery, but she had done it, just as he’d asked.
They were at the church, an unprepossessing structure built at a time when the neighborhood had been more prosperous. Now the surrounding houses looked run-down and weary, with paint peeling. Teenagers played basketball in a front yard across the street. Darcy pulled into the parking lot, quickly sliding out to let the three children spill from the back seat. She walked ahead of Sister Tucker into the church, shepherding her three children and carrying the box of visual aids she needed to set up before church started. The wind billowed her blue winter coat around her long legs. “I’ll see you after church,” she called over her shoulder. “Meet me at the car.”
Sister Tucker enjoyed church. She always sat through sacrament meeting and Sunday School with her scriptures and Relief Society manual held neatly on her lap. In Sunday School she liked to tell experiences from her past relating to the lesson. Everything the teacher said reminded her of something. It was good to feel her mind leaping and playing about, as if she were young again. How many memories she had! Each part of her life had taught her something.
Today in Relief Society she made a special point to sit beside Sister Hollis, a divorced woman in her fifties and an even more recent convert than she was. Sister Hollis still taught high school and was still young enough to wear lipstick. Sister Tucker thought that from a distance, with Sister Hollis’ blonde hair and her white hair, and the glasses each wore, the two of them looked remarkably alike, though Sister Hollis seemed more drawn to the younger members of their Special Interest group. Now she sat half-turned away from Sister Tucker, her polished fingernails and wrinkled knuckles placed on her open Relief Society manual.
Darcy’s lesson was well prepared, even if one of her posters did flap down from the board near the end, leaving the dots of masking tape exposed. The discussion was spirited, darting back and forth from sister to sister. Darcy’s face looked almost gay. Her pale blonde hair swung as she wrote on the chalkboard or pointed to acknowledge a questioner. After closing prayer, the women filed out of the Relief Society room in clumps, a few surrounding Darcy to chatter while Sister Tucker gathered up her scriptures and put them carefully into the straw carryall. She knew Darcy would have to take down her magazine pictures and posters, find her children, and encourage them into their coats before going out to the car. In the hallway she shook hands with the bishop and then her home teacher, located her coat, and moved to the back door.
The morning’s patchy layer of white clouds had sealed over, hiding the sunshine and producing a misting rain that drizzled down onto the grass and turned the sidewalks a darker gray—not good weather for standing outside by the car. She decided to go back to the Relief Society room to wait.
The crowd lingering in the hallway had thinned to a few parents still rounding up children as they passed back and forth from the coat closet to the cultural hall. Sister Tucker paused near the doorway of the deserted Relief Society room for a moment. Only Sister Hollis remained, sitting in a front-row chair and chatting while Darcy rolled up a large sheet of butcher paper.
“Your lesson went well today.”
“Thank you.” Darcy seemed pleased.
“Except for one certain party who can’t seem to keep quiet long enough for someone else to get in a word.”
Darcy looked uncomfortable, slowly dropping the roll of masking tape into the box. Sister Hollis went on, her voice carrying remarkably well. “I admire you for putting up with her as well as you do. You bring her to church all the time and she’s your visiting teaching companion, too, isn’t she?”
Darcy taped some papers together and dropped them into the box. “Well, she’s okay. She just likes to talk.”
“And talk and talk and talk,” Sister Hollis said laughing.
Darcy looked up then. Was it some movement, or an inner cry of pain from Sister Tucker that caught her attention? Darcy, staring hard at Sister Tucker, bit her lip, uncertain, the frown line now a groove between her pale eyebrows. Sister Tucker turned and walked away, heels clattering on the tiles in the hallway, through the door and out into the rain where she found Darcy’s car and stood waiting. Only when she felt damp trickles of water on her scalp did she realize she’d forgotten to put on her rain bonnet.
The pain of sudden self-knowledge had numbed her, but now thoughts like something angry and alive began to churn in her mind. She thought of how she had to get up alone every Sunday morning, throwing back the covers from the double bed, the drab room still gray with night shadows, of her one boiled egg sitting by itself on the flowered dish. She thought of how she’d had to depend on Darcy remembering to pick her up every Sunday morning, and how she had to carry her washing to the Laundromat and make frequent trips to the store because Gus was gone and she was too old to drive. She thought about the brief handshakes and perfunctory smiles of a few of the ward members, their sudden shifts in conversation when she paused for breath. Did they know how much easier it would be to stay home, to stay in bed, to stare at the wall, to give up the struggle?
Her life had gone on so long and it had never been easy, and here she was, faced with another battle. She’d learned a thousand lessons and survived a thousand battles in the past, from learning how to light that old wood stove in the farmhouse where they’d lived, to standing up and walking away after Gus’s funeral. But she was old now and daily heroics were harder to come by. But the Church was true—the Church was true. And deeper than the pain of humiliation, she felt the knife edge of loss if the hope that had reappeared on her horizon should fade and disappear. She thought about her plans to go to the temple and wanted to cry because she wanted to go home and go to bed; but if she did, would she and Gus ever be together again? She thought about how tired she’d been so long ago working and running the farm and taking care of Gus and the girls, of how in the evening she’d just kept doing one dish after another until the pile of them was done and she could finally go to bed. She was tired now.
And then she thought of Darcy’s frown line, that perpendicular groove between her pale eyebrows, and wondered suddenly about Darcy’s battles—and Sister Hollis’s too. After a while she got her rain bonnet out of her purse and snapped it into place, blinking into her rainsmeared glasses. She pulled her gloves out of her coat pockets and put them carefully on. She held the straw carryall tightly under her arm, shielded by her orlon coat so that her new scriptures wouldn’t get wet.
Several minutes later Darcy stepped out into the misting rain, carrying her box and hurrying her children along. Her eyes avoided Sister Tucker’s as the children climbed noisily into the car, grabbing at picture books and pulling their dampened coats closer around them. Sister Tucker waited for Darcy to unlock her door so that she could slide inside.
The car was silent except for the squabbling children as they drove through the rain. Sister Tucker supposed Darcy was wondering whether to apologize, fearing such an apology might bring her unnecessary pain if she hadn’t overheard. She decided to put the girl’s mind at ease. “It’s the twentieth of the month,” she said.
Darcy flushed, still tense. “Oh, yes, we still need to go visiting teaching.”
“Shall we go tomorrow?”
Darcy said, “I’m sure I can arrange it.”
Sister Tucker saw she was still uncomfortable, frowning into the windshield. She needed to make one more gesture. It took a moment before she could do it.
“I really enjoy our visits,” she began. “Sister Bird seems to need our company every month, doesn’t she? She reminds me of my sister, you know. She had an alcoholic husband, too. She finally had to leave him back in ’38 and get a job in a drugstore.”
And while the talk flowed, she saw Darcy sigh in relief—and Sister Tucker was able to smile a small, peaceful smile.

Getting Started
Sometimes, the most difficult part of a journey is the first step. Perhaps you can relate. Maybe there is a place in the world you have been longing to visit. You’ve thought about how great it would be when you finally made it there. But try as you might, you just can’t seem to figure out how to take the next step to make that trip a reality.
Or maybe the issue is you were hit with setbacks when you tried to make plans. You realized that to afford the trip, you wouldn’t be able to stay in all the quaint Bed & Breakfasts you envisioned. Or the weather at the time you could travel wasn’t ideal. Or a family commitment arose… and you couldn’t see how to take some time off for a vacation.
We can come up with any number of reason as to why we can’t pursue a goal. The same was true of the people in Jesus’ day. The crowds had heard about Jesus’ teachings and his miracles, and many wanted to follow him. But not all could find the time or the willingness to step away from their obligations. Luke describes some of these people in his Gospel: MSG
As you look at your life, is there something that is keeping you from seizing the day? Is there something that is holding you back? If so, it’s time to identify those obstacles in your life. In this first lesson, we will look at some common obstacles that get in the way of our journey with Christ and determine how we can move past them.
Opening Discussion
For this first session, go around the group and introduce yourselves to one another, and then answer the following questions:
- When was the last time you got lost while on a road trip? How did you end up getting back on track?
- What made you want to be a part of this group? What are you hoping to get out of this study?
Watch Session One: What’s Next?
Play the video segment for session 1. As you watch, use the following outline to record any thoughts, questions, or points that stand out to you.
Notes
God wants you to know Him, find freedom, discover your purpose, and make a difference
Three things you need to move on from include:
Old history
Old habits
Old hurts
Write down this phrase: “I can’t start ________________________” It’s time to repent — to change your mind and your direction in these areas:
It’s time to get closer to God
It’s time to get honest with a friend
It’s time to get in tune with your purpose and passions
It’s time to get doing something greater than yourself
If you dedicate your life to something greater than yourself, God will fill your life with passion and adventure
Group Discussion

Fazenda Trapiá - Brazil
Fazenda Trapiá was purchased by Andréa de Souza Rangel and Renato Pita Maciel de Moura in 2005, immediately upon their retirement from their respective jobs in IT and insurance. The farm once belonged to the mayor of Baependi, where the farm is located in Southern Minas Gerais, and has long been well-known within the region. Although neither Renato nor Andréa had backgrounds in agricultural business, they had always dreamed of owning a farm. Trapiá presented them not only with the perfect opportunity to manifest their life-long penchant for farming but also presented them with optimal growing conditions for coffee, of which they have made the most. When the couple purchased the farm, there were there were only 20,000 coffee plants planted and no coffee infrastructure whatsoever. The farm now has 70 hectares (170,000 plants) under coffee and the couple have built state-of-the-art processing infrastructure.
When they acquired the farm, Renato and Andréa changed its name to Trapiá, in honour of the farm where Andrea’s mother was born, in northeastern Brazil. Trapiá takes its name from a tree common in northeastern Brazil.
Today the couple live on the farm full time and have succeeded in achieving BSCA and UTZ certification.
Other agricultural activities at Trapiá include primarily forestry. Some 40,000 Candeia trees (a native species) have been planted on the farm and are selectively and sustainably harvested annually. 30% of the farm is under conservation, and there are several springs and falls inside the farm, all of them preserved. Environmental programs currently in effect include the planting of native tree species and the establishing of a wildlife corridor in partnership with neighbouring farms. Andréa and Renato have also started a beekeeping program in order to promote pollination.
All coffee at Trapiá is hand harvested using the stripping method or is machine harvested where the terrain allows. This particular lot comes from the ‘Talhao 3 Pinheiros’ (3 Pine Trees lot). The lot lies at a higher elevation and is planted with Yellow Bourbon, which composes this very special lot.
Coffee cherries are separated by density on the same day as they are harvested before proceeding to their respective processing methods. This particular lot has been composed of coffees processed using both natural and pulped natural methods. Trapiá’s natural coffees are delivered to the patio directly after sorting, where they then spend 12 days, reaching their target humidity of 12%. Alternatively, some lots spend 3-5 days on patios until they reach 18% and then spend 3 days more in mechanical dryers. Pulped natural coffees are pulped using the most widespread method in Brazil – that is, pulping without fermentation. The mucilage is partially removed, enough to enable the coffee to be delivered to the patios where it is regularly turned (“rolling” the fruits).
All lots begin their drying on the patio, though some are finished at low, constant heat in the farm’s mechanical dryers. Throughout all stages, the drying process is controlled through periodic humidity measurements using a precise capacitance device.
The farm also has its own dry mill, located very close to the cultivated areas.
The biggest challenge of the farm is finding manpower during harvest season. To resolve this issue, in 2015 the couple purchased a harvesting machine, which has brought, as a side benefit, a more selective harvest, where two or more harvesting ‘passes’ are made in each area. They also have plans to build new patios, install additional selective sieves and are looking at installing centrifugal equipment and an automatic control of mechanical dryers temperature.
Currently, La Trapiá employees 13 workers during low season and ups this to around 24 during the harvest season. In addition to providing liveable wages, the farm promotes lectures on health and hygiene, nutrition, and environmental care for all employees and their families. All the workers’ housed on the farm (currently 4 families) have septic tanks, wood burning stoves and hot water. All the children are driven to the local school by the municipality. Employee Turnover is very low – surely an extension of the farm’s ethical approach to their workers.Listen in as playwright/performer Manning Jordan, director Alice Cash, and performers Ashley Underwood & Ellie MacPherson of Dooley, performed as part of FRIGID 2018, discuss inspiration from disturbing 1960s board games, plunging psychological depths, collaboratively re-writing, re-naming in the interest of financial considerations, “sneaking around outside of classrooms” to meet your new collaborators, the benefits of inconsistent performance times, and sharing your most vulnerable self onstage.

However, we have recently seen the Hulu Error Code 504 with a lot of our users and have set out to fix it in this article. Using these methods, you are also able to fix the Hulu Error Code 3 and Hulu Error Code 503 errors that are also mainly triggered due to the same reasons.
Before you move on towards checking out and deploying the solutions, it is best that you are also made familiar with the reasons due to which you are seeing the Hulu Error Code 504 on your screen.
What Causes the Hulu Error Code 504?
Before we move on towards implementing the solutions, we think it is best that we check to see what are the factors due to which it is being triggered.
- Corrupted Cache: For most users that were getting the Hulu Error Code 504 on their screens, the main reason was the corrupted cache. Cache can often be corrupted if it has been left over for a long time. Therefore, clearing the cache seems like a good way to start troubleshooting this issue.
- DNS Configuration Issue: If you have improperly configured your DNS servers, you might not be able to properly access the internet and even if you are able to do that, you might face issues streaming from Hulu. Therefore, it is recommended that you try and switch your DNS servers and check to see if by doing so, you are able to fix the Hulu Error Code 504.
- Location Ban: Sometimes streaming applications such as Hulu block people from a certain area from accessing their services. Due to this, you might be unable to stream using Hulu and this can easily be fixed by using a VPN to mask your location and imitate another one.
- Firewall Block: It is possible that the Firewall installed on your computer might be blocking you from accessing the Hulu Streaming services and due to this, you are getting the Hulu Error Code 504 on your screen. You can try and whitelist this app in your Firewall and confirm that your Firewall isn’t blocking it.
- Outdated Application: If you haven’t updated the Hulu app for a while, it is possible that you might be unable to stream from it because often certain updates on the service’s end require the users’ app to be updated to the latest version and if it isn’t, you might get the Hulu Error Code 504.

Heating & Air Conditioning review in North Vancouver
Our furnace was lighting, but not blowing hot air through the forced air system. I called North Shore Plumbing (NSP) as they are Lennox certified dealers..
The Problem turned out to be the ignition board which needed to be replaced. NSP were able to source the new board the same day and managed to return and get the part fitted on the same day.
The engineer was very knowledgeable and helpful.
Thank you! We have heat again.

Botox will not have much of an effect on these kinds of wrinkles. The treatment is rather basic: the Botox service provider will use a needle to inject Botox into a particular muscle. Some providers will apply topical anaesthesia before injecting it with Botox. It ought to only take a few minutes with just very little discomfort.

But if the United States just needed a designated victim to kick off Gold Medal victory tour, Costa Rica is probably is good as any.
The U.S. women clobbered the helpless Costa Ricans, 8-0, Saturday in their first contest since the 2012 London Olympics. Abby Wambach and MMegan Rapinoe scored twice each in front of a sell-out crowd of 13,208 at Rochester’s Sahlen’s Stadium.

Sanitisation Services
“We are so very happy with the sanitisation services Highline did, and it is so comforting to know that we are doing all we can to make our workplace safe under the current circumstances. Colm Mahon did a fab job, and what a lovely guy he is! We all thought he was so easy to deal with & so cheery too!”
“We would like to thank Colm and all the team at Highline Office Technology for their recent work in cleaning and sanitising our printers, laptops, keyboards and mouse, with their long lasting antimicrobial coating. Our Doctors and staff feel safer in the knowledge that our workplace equipment is now protected and will continually sanitised for the next year. Great job Highline.”
Managed Print Services
“Highline Technology provides a service that combines premium quality with value for money. In Accounting for Growth we need reliable, easy to use printers that use the latest technology available – Highline fulfil that need.”
“The service Highline provides is top quality and extremely efficient. The staff are professional and are a pleasure to deal with. We found them to be very competitive in terms of cost and would highly recommend using their services.”
“Aspera Solutions Limited have been a Highline Office Technology customer for the past number of years. On foot of a tender for a new supplier for our MFD and following a strict evaluation process, we decided to proceed with Highline. I find their service excellent as they are always attentive & proactive for our company requirements. I have no problem recommending them as a supplier to any other business out there. They use the hashtag #ServiceExcellence and I have found that they deliver on this promise.”
“I would highly recommend Highline Technology, and in particular Robert, Brian and the guys and gals from the service department. They were professional and highly knowledgeable in their field, they certainly made our migration path easy and have been supporting our printer fleet since installation and we look forward to a continued and mutually beneficial arrangement.”
“We have worked with Highline for the last six years and they have always provided us with excellent service. An engineer would be out within an hour if there was any issue and new printer cartridges would arrive efficiently when required. We needed to upgrade all of our printers and Robert conducted a complete site audit and provided us with a full managed print solution the next day. We did get quotes from other suppliers but none were as comprehensive and as easy to understand as the Highline quote. Highline was reappointed and they had the new printers installed within a week of signing the agreement with no issues. I would recommend Highline to anyone looking to have one simple printing solution for your business with clear and easy to understand costings.”
“I was recently in the market to upgrade my old printer, copier, scanner. I contacted a number of potential suppliers to get advice and options for consideration. I trialled one printer, but it was not fit for purpose, particularly around scanning function, as this is business critical to the productive and efficient workflow in my business. Robert Pepper in Highline Office Technology consulted with me and made a recommendation of a Canon IRAdv3525i printer for my office. I found him to be knowledgeable and true to his word. He provided me with accurate and timely advice and once I pressed go, the process for delivery, installation, set up and training was all very efficient. I didn’t feel any pressure through the process at all, but instead a company who was looking to provide the right solution to meet my needs. I am delighted to have chosen Highline as my print management partner.”
“At Jefferson Tax we work with Highline Office Technology for our managed print services, including our printers and scanners. As a company, we are continuously looking to embrace technology and leverage the digital evolution that faces businesses today. We always find Highline to be very knowledgeable of what is available today, and customer focussed in offering the best advice and solutions to meet our needs. And none of this would matter if we didn’t have a reliable service partner to keep our equipment running smoothly. We don’t need to think about the equipment, as Highline manage this for us and give us the peace of mind we need to get on with our own day jobs. All while being cost effective – happy to recommend them!”
“Getting a printer has never been so exciting! The whole experience was transparent, personal, professional and smooth. We knew nothing about printers but the level of service we received was above and beyond. We were equipped with all the information necessary in order for us to choose the best printer. We would highly recommend Highline Office Technology for any of your printing needs as you will get quality, expertise delivered from an amazing team! We love our printer!”
“Birdwatch Ireland has been a Highline Office Technology customer since 2013. I find the whole team from sales to service really personable and easy to deal with. They are completely customer focused and have never let me down. They always find a solution.”
“We run with Highline Office Technology for our printers and copiers. Their engineers are extremely helpful and knowledgeable. Whenever an issue is raised, their response times are immediate, and I have to say, that they go above the norm.”
“Highline takes care of all of our photocopier and printer needs. Since outsourcing this to Highline, we no longer have to worry about toners, cartridges or parts as Highline take care of everything. Their support services are excellent.”
“Highline provided a very good and efficient service to us. All staff were very friendly and helpful in working around the class timetable in our language school to ensure a timely service. We would highly recommend using their services.”
“Highline Office Technology are a fantastic company. They are reliable and very efficient. Their staff go above and beyond to help with any issues that may arise. They are extremely knowledgeable and friendly. I have 3 creches in which I have Highline printers and I find them great value for money. I am very happy with their service. I would highly recommend them.”
“We are absolutely delighted with our new high specification office printer. While we managed for a number of years with a fairly basic printer, it did of course cause us some ongoing frustration between regular paper jams and of course the dreaded running out of ink (just when you need it). With our new printer, we now have the peace of mind of the service and support offered by Highline, which is invaluable for any busy office environment. A big thank you also to Colin who installed our printer, he was a gentleman and a pleasure to deal with.”
“We use Highline Office Technology as our stationery and general office machinery supplier for all our photocopier, printing and scanning requirements. My experience of Highline Office Technology is of a small dynamic company that delivers on their promises with regards to sales and, in particular, service. In our office, we have a very high level of requirement for printing, scanning and photocopying; the need for the machines to be running efficiently at all times is vital to our business. Anytime we have had an issue, the response time from Highline’s dedicated service team has always been very impressive and definitely helps my Company in dealing with our clients’ needs. Highline Office Technology also have unique finance deals, but I suggest you talk to them in confidence yourselves. As the preferred choice of provider for my Company, all I can say is that I have no problem in recommending Highline Office Technology.”
“Before we were introduced to Highline Office Technology, we had a printer that was not fit for purpose. We were spending a fortune on ink and the quality was mediocre. Now thanks to Highline our office life has completely changed. We can easily print the highest quality, at high volume at the touch of a button. We no longer have to shop for our own ink as it is delivered right to our door before we run out. We now have a printer that suits our needs which can grow with our business. The professional and informative dealings by Jean Evans gave us the peace of mind that Highline was the right choice and we couldn’t recommend anyone better!”
!”
“As you can imagine our fleet of printers and MFDs are busy, busy machines, so it’s imperative that we have reliable and hard-working equipment in the hotel 24/7. They have to be fit for purpose and permanently spotless. Having a trusted advisor and provider is key to helping us run our business smoothly. Highline Office Technology manages our full fleet of printers and provides a fully managed print service. They have a speedy response time and a really high rate for first-time fixes. When the machines start becoming unreliable, Highline immediately replaces them with new machines. We don’t need to stockpile toners or supplies, which also eliminates panic buying. The toners and supplies arrive as we need them. We rely on their Service Engineers to be discreet and find them continuously professional, experts in their field, but also friendly and very comfortable when around the guests and staff. We really value their expertise, so much so, that as we get requests from event and conference managers, for short-term rentals, we direct the requests to Highline Office Technology, as we know they’ll get the same service. And we achieve all of this for a fixed price per month, so we can predict and manage our costs. It’s simply expertise and service, we could not do without.”
“Our relationship with Highline Office Technology began in 2014 when we needed a short-term rental of a machine for a board meeting. The first machine that was installed wasn’t what we needed, so Robert drove out to the hotel at 9pm that night to deliver and install a new photocopier and printer for us so that we could work through the night and deliver all the documentation that was needed for the executives and board members on schedule. We couldn’t have been any happier with the support, solutions and speed that Highline offered to us, so when we opened our new offices in Dublin, they were our first call. The service provided has always been top notch, in particular for our latest batch of machines. Once the Highline service team get the nod from us re the day and time for installation, their turn-around time is superb. It’s just a smooth operation over all. Service is always good. Toner is delivered when needed, which means we are ensured of no down time for our machines. I have Robert on speed dial; he is always so solution orientated, which makes my life easier and helps me ensure that Horizon Pharma successfully operates each day.”Topics Xiaomi India | Chinese smartphones | Xiaomi hard to find in a smartphone priced under Rs 10,000. So, the Redmi 9 Prime looks like a go-to smartphone in the budget segment. But how does it fare as a complete product? Let’s find out:
For a budget smartphone, the Redmi 9 Prime has a good build and inspiring design. Made of plastic, the smartphone has a textured back cover that provides good in-hand grip. It feels comfortable to hold and operate, despite a form factor that is wide and tall.
The phone’s rear camera module does not protrude much from the frame. Therefore, it does not wobble on flat surfaces, unless you do a pressure touch on the top side of the screen. As for the screen, it is covered under Gorilla Glass 3 for protection against scratches and smudges. It is not the best iteration of Gorilla Glass you get on a budget smartphone, but this is better than not having any protection at all. The phone also has a P2i coating for protection against minor water spillage and dust.
The Redmi 9 Prime has a 6.53-inch IPS LCD screen of a fullHD+ resolution and 19.5:9 aspect ratio. The display has bezels, and the bottom one is fairly thick – something common in most budget smartphones. The screen is vivid and responsive but the brightness is slightly muted. So, the screen has poor sunlight legibility. It, however, works fine in indoor settings. Being a fullHD unit, the screen does not look pixelated and works fine for a wider genres of content — web, multimedia and text. The phone has a Widevine L1 security certification from Google’s digital rights management (DRM) platform which is required for streaming movies or TV shows from over-the-top platforms like Amazon Prime and Netflix at resolutions higher than 480p.
The Redmi 9 Prime has a quad-camera set-up at the back, featuring a 13-megapixel primary sensor, an 8MP ultra-wide sensor, a 5MP macro sensor, and a 2MP depth sensor. On the front, the phone has an 8MP sensor for selfies and face unlock.
The phone’s primary camera is good, but not class-leading. It works fine in daylight conditions and captures good amount of detail with minimal noise and neutral colours. In low light, however, the camera picks up noise and misses out shadow and highlight details.
The ultrawide camera is decent for landscape shots in day light. It works fine in lowlight but, like the primary camera, misses capturing detail, shadows and highlights. The captured images show the barrel effect with distorted frame corners and softer details on the edges.
Xiaomi’s budget smartphones use one of the best iterations of macro camera and the one on the Redmi 9 Prime is no different. It is good for close-up shots and captures a good amount of detail with a decent exposure value. Like with the primary and ultra-wide sensors, lowlight photography is a no-go for the macro sensor as well.
The depth sensor aids the phone’s portrait mode and some other imaging-related value-added features. It seems to work fine in segmenting object and background detail, and portraits come out well, with a creamy bokeh effect in the background.
The Redmi 9 Prime features the MediaTek Helio G80 system-on-chip, paired with 4GB RAM and up to 128 GB of internal storage. The phone boots Android 10 operating system-based MIUI 11 user interface, which is a custom skin layered on top of the operating system. The phone is powered by a 5,020 mAh battery and supports 18W fast charging. However, the phone comes with 10W standard charger in the box.
Details aside, the Redmi 9 Prime is a no-frills smartphone that handles everything just fine. It delivers consistent performance without any major issues. It works fine with processor-centric jobs like multitasking, switching between apps, internet browsing, UI scrolling, etc, and shows no weakness. It is not impossible to do graphic-intensive tasks like gaming, multimedia editing, etc, on this mobile. However, like other budget smartphones, it is not best suited for such operations.
As for the on-battery time, a fully charged battery gets you around two days of back-up on regular usage, and a day’s back-up on intensive usage. Charging the phone using the supplied 10W charger is painful — the battery takes around three hours to get a full charge. The charging time, however, drops to almost half with Xiaomi’s 18W charger.
The Xiaomi Redmi 9 Prime is the best sub-Rs 10,000 smartphone in the market at present. It has an inspiring design, vivid fullHD resolution screen, capable cameras, a swift performance, and good on-battery time. All these seem to justify the phone’s prime moniker and make it a go-to smartphone in the segment. However, do take note of advertisements in user interface before considering this one.

I think it was great and totally delivers the goods. Unlike the bad review linked from post #3, I thought it really gave what it promised in the (fake) trailer: a hell of a fun ride, nothing to be taken seriously. And I loved Danny Trejo in the lead; about time he gets it!

I saw, "Machete", last night! It delivered the campy, over-the-top silliness, and gory action that the trailers were advertising. The plot was pretty good and it was exactly what it needed to be. My only problem was the showdown at the end, which I though was a bit of a letdown; Steven Seagal was good in this, as well as, DeNiro, Don Johnson, and Jeff Fahey was impressive. The women were smokin' hot in this. Wow! It was a great time at the movies!

I heard that there was supposed to be a faux trailer by tarantino.. that was to be played prior to machete?? Did anyone see it??? / Hear about it??

the movie was GREAT. the action, comedy, nudity, and just sheer ridiculousness made this movie good. BUT... what i also found great about the movie was the social message. me living in arizona, this movie fits perfectly w/ the sb-1070 drama. i felt this movie addressed the anti-hispanic/anti-chicano behaviors this state and most of this country displays. really disgusting IMO and i'm glad this movie tackled that issue somewhat.

I thought it was pretty funny, a B-Movie style violent comedy, really ridiculous too.

Saw this last weekend & I guess I expected something a bit more gritty & grimy. Don't get me wrong - this is Rodriguez firing from all cylinders & never once compromising. But the actual look of the movie didn't fit the action. I expected an unofficial type of sequel to Planet Terror with the pops & skips of the burned up footage & things like that. But gone was the scratchy footage & the "scenes missing." I know some folks didn't care for that novelty (I'm aware that this is exactly what it is), but I think the film's over-the-top action would have benefited from a true Grindhouse makeover. This movie requires the audience to have fun & suspend all disbelief just like Planet Terror did. But I think it was easier to do with Planet Terror because of the actual look & feel of the movie. That movie never had one clear or clean shot. I think if Machete would have definitely been a 3-star film if it followed the same exact formula of its trailer from so many years ago. I understand that Rodriguez probably didn't want to repeat himself, but it's forgivable when it comes to a movie called Machete. I did notice, however, that the movie had that same Grindhouse feel pre-credits. I was in total exploitation heaven for that first 5 minutes. Maybe the DVD will have a special feature where the Grindhouse filter can be turned on. Highlights were (spoiler free): Cheech Marin as the gun-toting priest, Steven Segal as a Mexican, Don Johnson oozing sinister, the weed whacker, Doc Felix (from Planet Terror), each grin by DeNiro, &, last but not least, 1-800-HITMAN 🙂 & just a random side note. Where the hell is the official soundtrack, Rodriguez?

As more and more people are turning to digital and virtual worlds to get by, big names in the gaming industry have taken full advantage of it and created new technology to keep up with the ever-rising demands.
Now, as a new year is set to begin, the gaming industry is predicted to continue its momentous rise with even more new trends and innovations. Here are some of the top video game trends that are sure to take the world by storm.
The rise of indie
For a long time, indie games, or games that have been made by independent studios consisting of small teams of people, have struggled to find a spotlight or gain the same recognition that big franchise names have. But the same can no longer be said in today’s scene. Before, indie games were often relegated to more niche audiences. Now they enjoy the same perks and recognition as any triple-A game studio.
Games like InnerSloth’s Among Us, Supergiant’s Hades, and Media Tonic’s Fall Guys, all indie games developed by a small-scale team, have become increasingly popular due in part to their accessibility, gameplay, and their ability to make the most out of a smaller budget.
Among Us and Hades, in particular, have seen a rapid increase in sales and interest since its introduction. The former quickly became an international hit, while the latter was recently nominated for multiple awards, including Game of the Year, in 2020’s Game Awards.
Indeed, indie games have started to see a renaissance of sorts that puts indie creators and small studios in the spotlight with the rest. With the value of indie games on the rise, the industry can only continue to flourish.
A new generation of consoles
The latest generation of video game consoles began with Sony’s Playstation 5 and Microsoft’s Xbox Series S and X. This new generation boasts an upgraded computation and graphics processor, real-time ray tracing graphics, and support for in-game streaming, among other things. Sony and Microsoft are starting this new generation strong, with PS5 units selling out in a matter of minutes during its initial release and many retailers and consumers alike still waiting for a restock.
As of now, Nintendo has yet to announce any news on next-gen consoles. However, given the success of the Nintendo Switch, it wouldn’t be unfounded to say that Nintendo has been resting on its laurels for a while now. Even though it technically belongs to the previous generation, the Switch still manages to hold up well against its modern competitors, with sales still going strong and Nintendo continually upgrading and churning out new models, such as the Lite and the OLED models.
Suffice it to say, a new generation of consoles means more innovations and upgrades, the likes of which we can only imagine for now.
The growing appeal of mobile games
As a whole, mobile gaming appeals to a bigger audience than console or PC gaming due to its ready accessibility and, for the most part, being free. When Among Us was released on mobile free of charge, it became a hit even among people who didn’t consider themselves gamers.
Similarly, Genshin Impact, one of the biggest games of 2020 and 2021, owes a big part of its success to its mobile players. However, it’s completely free to play (except for a few in-app purchases) could be attributed to its success.
Gacha games offer micro-transactions where players can exchange in-game or real-life currency for characters, items, and other in-game valuables. They have become the norm for many mobile games. It should come as no surprise then that many developers now see mobile gaming as a viable platform in itself.
Cloud gaming and blockchain
Another gaming platform that has seen a considerable rise is cloud gaming. Cloud gaming or gaming-as-a-software allows players to stream games, similar to streaming movies or TV shows, as long as they have a high-speed internet connection. It bypasses the need to buy and download games onto various devices. It offers an entirely new way to play games and brings them to an even bigger audience than mobile gaming does.
Speaking of new ways to play games, with the rise of cryptocurrency and crypto marketing comes another trend: blockchain. Blockchain technology saw the development of crypto gaming, which uses cryptocurrency and allows players to place real-world value on in-game assets. However, due to the volatile nature of cryptocurrency, the future of blockchain and crypto games remains ambiguous at best.
Remakes and remasters galore
In recent years, many game developers have taken advantage of the new technology that’s now being offered and making remakes and remasters of old games with upgraded HD graphics, stories, and gameplay.
Final Fantasy VII Remake, for example, saw the beloved fan-favorite of Square Enix’s franchise rendered in exquisite 3D. It had new gameplay, story details, and a complete overhaul from its humble origins as a first-generation Playstation title. Other remakes or remasters that have seen considerable success are Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening and Capcom’s Resident Evil series.
Old games that never got to shine due to their outdated systems, consoles, or graphics are now being polished, made anew, and brought to wider audiences through the act of remastering. With many gamers eager for the nostalgia factor and to see their favorites given the all-star treatment, we might see an influx of new old games in the future.
The return of MMOs
Massively multiplayer role-playing games, or MMORPGs, saw a steady decline after the 2010s, with games like World of Warcraft dominating the scene yet also heralding the downfall of MMOs themselves. It wasn’t until the success of Final Fantasy XIV Online: A Realm Reborn, the revamped and improved version of the now-defunct original FFXIV Online, that MMOs started to gain a more steady foothold in the gaming industry.
It’s safe to say that MMOs have seen a comeback in recent years. It’s phenomenal, with FFXIV becoming a success, with an expanding user base that seems to be growing. This is perhaps because of its expanded free trial that covers a mind-bogglingly massive amount of the story and gameplay for no charge.
Undoubtedly, many creators and developers will be looking to emulate the success of FFXIV. They might give in to the demand for more quality MMOs like it in the future.
Diversity and inclusiveness
As the accessibility of video games grows, so does its fan base. Although the video game industry continues to be dominated by men, many women and people of other gender identities still form a significant amount of the gaming industry’s audience. As such, there have been many calls for the representation of minorities in video games.
The gaming industry has answered by introducing more female protagonists with active roles, more character customization options to include a diverse set, and more varied stories in general. This highlights different cultures and places instead of the monotony of traditional stories.
If the demand for more representation and diversity in video games keeps up, we could soon be seeing one of the most diverse generations of games in history.
The gaming industry is evolving and changing rapidly; it can be hard to keep up. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that so many new technology and changes have been made in only the span of a few years. Many more are predicted to happen in the future.by offering. Adapted for screen and directed by Carl Franklin from Walter Mosley’s neo-noir novel, Devil in a Blue Dress layers a standard noir plot – PI charged with finding beautiful but elusive dame – with historical, political, social, and ethnic themes.
I saw the film before I read the book, back in the 1990s, and loved its visual sumptuousness. It establishes its credentials from the off: the title sequence is a montage of images from Archibald John Motley’s painting Bronzeville By Night, which depicts Chicago’s ‘Black Metropolis’ in a blue and red pallet, while T-Bone Walker sings West Side Baby. Motley, like the Daphne Monet, the femme fatale at the centre of the mystery, was of mixed race and – like Daphne – he struggled with his racial identity.
Tak Fujimoto’s cinematography is impeccable on the period detail, style and look of the 1940s. The opening scene shimmies through a busy night scene in the LA district of Watts; the street is populated by shopkeepers, couples and families and lovers – all black – all perfectly got up to fit the 1940s jazz-and-blues vibe of the film. In the bright hot pallet of the daylight scenes, we feel the heat of an LA summer. The night scenes are split between city backstreets, tinted sepia and grey, and the out-of-town sequences, shot in deep blue tones. In the bars and night clubs, Fujimoto creates seductive tableaux that might have been lifted from an Archibald Motley interior. So, when Easy opens the door into the illegal ‘juke joint’ fronted by Etta-Mae’s grocery store, he walks in on a fog of cigarette smoke so thick you get dizzy from the nicotine high.
You will have gathered that, for me, the photography was pretty much flawless. I loved Denzel Washington as the charismatic Easy Rawlins (of course), and Don Cheadle as Mouse Alexander. They say that good things come in small packages, but so does poison. And gelignite – and Don Cheadle is so convincing as the explosively unstable Mouse that I held my breath through most of his scenes.
Racial inequality is a constant hum in the background of Franklin’s adaptation, but apart from an early scene which provides a rather heavy-handed explanation of Easy’s joblessness, Franklin wisely treats the racial elements as a given. Rawlins pushes against the establishments’ barriers to independence and autonomy for African Americans, but there is no sly wink to the audience, no implied prescience of the changes to come in American society.
Which is not to say that Franklin is coy – at least not in his depiction of police attitudes to black interviewees. Here, he is clear-eyed and uncompromising: a black man, whether victim, witness, or perpetrator, is always suspect, and is always treated as hostile. In a truly shocking sequence, and with no explanation, Easy is handcuffed, taken to the station house for questioning, told to sit, and is almost immediately knocked out of the chair and half-way across the room. This is not the neatly choreographed, hard-boiled knockabout of 1940’s film noir – you believed those cops really could take Easy into the alley out back and beat him to death, with no qualms and no fear of comeback. And when they finally release him, he doesn’t hail a cab and head back to his office, Philip Marlowe-style for a stiff drink. He walks home, because what cab driver is going to stop for a bloodied black man in LA in 1948? Easy, harassed on his long walk home by uniform cops, sleeps feverishly, and when the phone rings by his bed, he wakes afraid and with blood on his pillow.
The best dialogue in the film is lifted straight from the novel, as in the electrifying scene in which Mouse, in a drunken fugue, points a gun at Easy’s heart and mutters to some unseen demon, ‘I kill ’im!’, Easy talks him down: ‘Let him live,’ he says, the gun barrel bruising his chest, ‘he be scared’a you whenever you walk in the room.’ And we know that Easy is talking about himself.
Critics of the film were disappointed with Jennifer Beals’s performance as Daphne Monet, but to be fair, under Franklin’s writing and direction she really wasn’t given much to do. In the novel, Monet is constructed over several chapters; a complex, mysterious character; a beauty, but a chameleon, too. Like her mythological namesake who metamorphosed to escape a rapacious god, Mosely’s Daphne is constantly changing; she shifts from strong and earthy to soft and vulnerable, from innocent to sex siren, being what men need her to be. Much of this depth and ambiguity is lost in a rewriting of the plot that I felt weakened the story. The novel’s central secret – that Daphne is a black woman passing for white – is sidelined. Oh, it’s there in the film all right, but in the novel, the real shocker is that Daphne is so ashamed of her racial origins that she cannot bear any man to know it. She turns down her rich (white) suitor’s offer of marriage and flees with his money, unable to live with the prospect of facing him every day, knowing that he knows she isn’t white. The film adopts a simpler (and for me, less interesting) storyline: Daphne’s money is a payoff, funded by the family of her weak fiancé, Todd Carter, who tacitly colludes in their decision, and the shocking secret is shifted to a subplot involving a child-abuser who is running against Carter for mayoral office. A tit-for-tat blackmail spat ensues between the two mayoral candidates, with Carter emerging as victor after he obtains incriminating photographs of his rival.’. It’s a difficult subject, but one that Hollywood has tackled before, notably in the 1934 and 1959 film adaptations of Fannie Hurst’s novel, Imitation of Life. I won’t second-guess writer/director Franklin’s reasoning, but it seemed like a missed opportunity to me.
The film ends with Easy chatting on his own front porch in the sunshine with his friend Odell. Kids play in the street, some are having their picture taken on a pony across the way. Easy chases a nuisance ‘gardener’ from hacking down a tree in a neighbour’s garden; on the way back, he dodges a car and has some laughing banter with the driver. It’s an optimistic, ‘things gonna change’, Holywood-style ending. But here’s a little context: Devil in a Blue Dress, published in 1990, was the second Easy Rawlins novel. The first, Gone Fishin’, was completed two years before. Gone Fishin’ introduced Easy and provided some of the back story for Mouse, his morally wrecked and psychologically twisted sidekick. It was turned down by publisher after publisher, and remained unpublished until 1997, when Mosley gave the publishing rights to Black Classic Press, a small indie company in Baltimore. Why was this novel shunned for nine years? Novelist John Baker posits the theory that publishers ‘assumed that white folks didn’t want to read about black folks, and that black folks didn’t buy books. The result was nine years of obscurity for a modern masterpiece.’
Finally, a personal story from a crime convention in Manchester in the late 1990s. This was a couple of years after the film’s release. Walter Mosley was an honoured guest. I was newly published, thrilled to share the elevator with Mosley up to the convention floor; a tall, imposing man in a dark overcoat and a black fedora. That night, word went around that Mosley had been racially abused by youths riding that same elevator, later in the day. No doubt things had changed in the fifty years since 1948 – just not enough.

Bluehost Testimonial
Bluehost is among the most significant web hosting business worldwide, getting both enormous marketing assistance from the business itself as well as associate online marketers who advertise it.
It really is a massive firm, that has been around for a very long time, has a large reputation, and also is most definitely one of the top options when it pertains to webhosting (absolutely within the top 3, at least in my publication).
Yet what is it exactly, as well as should you get its services?
Learn More About Cheap Web Hosting Html Here ->
Today, I will respond to all there is you require to recognize, given that you are a blog owner or a business owner that is trying to find a web host, and also doesn’t understand where to start, given that it’s a fantastic solution for that target market generally.
Let’s visualize, you intend to host your websites and also make them noticeable. Okay?
You already have your domain (which is your site destination or LINK) today you wish to “transform the lights on”. Cheap Web Hosting Html
You require some organizing…
To accomplish every one of this, and to make your site visible, you need what is called a “web server”. A server is a black box, or device, that stores all your web site information (data such as pictures, messages, videos, web links, plugins, and also various other info).
Now, this web server, needs to get on all the time and also it needs to be connected to the web 100% of the time (I’ll be pointing out something called “downtime” later on).
On top of that, it additionally requires (without obtaining as well elegant as well as right into information) a file transfer protocol typically known as FTP, so it can reveal internet browsers your internet site in its designated type.
All these things are either expensive, or require a high level of technical skill (or both), to develop as well as preserve. And also you can totally go out there as well as learn these points by yourself as well as established them up … but what regarding instead of you getting and also keeping one … why not simply “renting hosting” instead?
This is where Bluehost is available in. You rent their servers (called Shared Hosting) as well as you launch a website utilizing those web servers.
Given that Bluehost keeps all your data, the firm additionally allows you to establish your content monitoring systems (CMS, for short) such as WordPress for you. WordPress is a super popular CMS … so it simply makes sense to have that alternative readily available (virtually every holding firm currently has this option also).
In short, you no more need to set-up a server and after that incorporate a software application where you can build your content, independently. It is currently rolled into one bundle.
Is it safe to have Bluehost look after your sites?
Well … envision troubles away, as well as deals with whatever technical: Pay your server “rent”, and also they will look after every little thing. And also when you get the solution, you can after that start focusing on including material to your website, or you can put your initiative into your marketing campaigns.
What Services Do You Obtain From Bluehost?
Bluehost supplies a myriad of various solutions, however the main one is hosting obviously.
The organizing itself, is of various kinds by the way. You can rent out a common web server, have a dedicated web server, or also a virtualpersonal server.
For the purpose of this Bluehost testimonial, we will certainly concentrate on holding services and also various other solutions, that a blog writer or an on the internet business owner would certainly require, as opposed to go too deep into the rabbit hole and discuss the other solutions, that are targeted at more skilled folks.
- WordPress, WordPress PRO, and also e-Commerce— these hosting services are the packages that permit you to hold an internet site using WordPress as well as WooCommerce (the latter of which allows you to do e-commerce). After acquiring any of these packages, you can start building your internet site with WordPress as your CMS.
- Domain Industry— you can additionally acquire your domain from Bluehost rather than various other domain registrars. Doing so will certainly make it simpler to direct your domain to your host’s name web servers, since you’re using the exact same marketplace.
- Email— when you have purchased your domain name, it makes sense to also get an e-mail address linked to it. As a blog writer or online business owner, you should pretty much never utilize a totally free email service, like Yahoo! or Gmail. An e-mail such as this makes you look unprofessional. The good news is, Bluehost gives you one free of cost with your domain name.

Bluehost also supplies devoted web servers.
And you may be asking …” What is a dedicated server anyway?”.
Well, the thing is, the fundamental webhosting bundles of Bluehost can only a lot website traffic for your site, after which you’ll need to update your holding. The reason being is that the usual web servers, are shared.
What this means is that one website starts to strike 100,000 site brows through each month, you are going to need a devoted web server which you can additionally get from Bluehost for a minimum of $79.99 monthly.
This is not something yous must stress over when you’re starting however you should maintain it in mind for certain.
Bluehost Rates: Just How Much Does It Expense?
In this Bluehost review, I’ll be focusing my interest primarily on the Bluehost WordPress Hosting packages, given that it’s the most prominent one, as well as highly likely the one that you’re looking for and that will certainly fit you the most effective (unless you’re a significant brand name, firm or website).
The 3 offered plans, are as complies with:
- Basic Strategy– $2.95 monthly/ $7.99 normal cost
- Plus Strategy– $5.45 each month/ $10.99 regular rate
- Option Plus Strategy– $5.45 each month/ $14.99 normal rate
The initial rate you see is the cost you pay upon register, and the 2nd price is what the expense is, after the initial year of being with the company.
So essentially, Bluehost is mosting likely to charge you on an annual basis. And also you can also select the amount of years you want to hold your website on them with. Cheap Web Hosting Html
If you pick the Fundamental plan, you will pay $2.95 x 12 = $35.40 beginning today and by the time you enter your 13th month, you will certainly now pay $7.99 per month, which is likewise charged per year. If that makes any kind of sense.
If you are serious about your website, you need to 100% get the three-year alternative. This means that for the standard plan, you will pay $2.95 x 36 months = $106.2.
By the time you hit your 4th year, that is the only time you will pay $7.99 per month. If you consider it, this technique will save you $120 throughout three years. It’s not much, however it’s still something.
If you wish to obtain greater than one web site (which I extremely advise, as well as if you’re serious, you’ll possibly be getting more at some time in time) you’ll want to use the option plus strategy. It’ll permit you to host endless sites.

What Does Each Strategy Deal?
So, in the case of WordPress organizing strategies (which are similar to the shared hosting strategies, however are more tailored towards WordPress, which is what we’ll be concentrating on) the attributes are as complies with:
For the Fundamental strategy, you obtain:
- One website only
- Protected site through SSL certificate
- Maximum of 50GB of storage
- Complimentary domain for a year
- $ 200 advertising and marketing credit rating
Keep in mind that the domains are purchased independently from the organizing. You can get a complimentary domain with Bluehost below.
For both the Bluehost Plus hosting as well as Choice Plus, you obtain the following:
- Unlimited number of internet sites
- Free SSL Certificate. Cheap Web Hosting Html
- No storage or transmission capacity limit
- Totally free domain for one year
- $ 200 advertising and marketing credit history
- 1 Workplace 365 Mailbox that is complimentary for 1 month
The Choice Plus strategy has an added advantage of Code Guard Basic Back-up, a back-up system where your data is saved and also replicated. If any kind of crash happens and also your internet site data vanishes, you can restore it to its initial kind with this feature.
Notice that although both plans set you back the exact same, the Selection Strategy after that defaults to $14.99 each month, normal rate, after the collection quantity of years you’ve picked.
What Are The Advantages Of Using Bluehost
So, why pick Bluehost over various other webhosting services? There are thousands of web hosts, most of which are resellers, but Bluehost is one select few that have stood the test of time, and also it’s most likely one of the most popular around (and also completely factors).
Here are the three primary advantages of selecting Bluehost as your webhosting service provider:
- Web server uptime— your website will certainly not be visible if your host is down; Bluehost has more than 99% uptime. This is extremely essential when it involves Google SEO and rankings. The greater the far better.
- Bluehost speed— exactly how your web server response determines just how fast your website shows on an internet browser; Bluehost is lighting quick, which indicates you will minimize your bounce price. Albeit not the most effective when it pertains to loading rate it’s still extremely vital to have a quick rate, to make customer experience better and much better your ranking.
- Endless storage space— if you obtain the Plus strategy, you need not worry about the amount of data you keep such as video clips– your storage space ability is unlimited. This is actually important, since you’ll probably face some storage space concerns later down the tracks, and you do not want this to be a hassle … ever before.
Finally, customer support is 24/7, which means despite where you remain in the world, you can call the assistance group to fix your internet site concerns. Pretty basic nowadays, but we’re taking this for granted … it’s likewise really important. Cheap Web Hosting Html
Additionally, if you’ve obtained a cost-free domain name with them, after that there will certainly be a $15.99 charge that will certainly be subtracted from the amount you initially bought (I picture this is because it type of takes the “domain out of the marketplace”, uncertain regarding this, but there possibly is a hard-cost for registering it).
Lastly, any kind of demands after 30 days for a reimbursement … are void (although in all sincerity … they need to most likely be stringent here).
So as you see, this isn’t always a “no questions asked” policy, like with some of the other hosting choices around, so make sure you’re alright with the plans before proceeding with the organizing./>

The special effects were mind-blowing, and the 3D was incredible. With word of James Cameron preparing to release Avatar 2 to the world, the release date, as of today, is December 17, 2021. A lot of people think that it will be another banging hit that will dominate the box office. That may prove to be correct, but if anybody feels that Avatar 2 will beat Avengers: Endgame at the box office., will it surely beat?
Avatar was once the highest-grossing movie of all time until Avengers: Endgame beat it off the top spot. People love Avatar and are going to come out to see the sequel, right? Well, maybe, maybe not, and here are some reasons why people might not come into theatres for the film.
When Avatar first released, some people were so fascinated by the world of Pandora that some reportedly needed therapy to manage with the world not being real. But now, ask anybody, and they will be likely indication and say, “Yeah, I remember Avatar. It was good.” Or at worse, “Avatar? Do you mean that movie that was just a rip-off of Dances With Wolves and Fern Gully? Yeah, I hate that movie.” But when it comes to the Avengers: Endgame, you couldn’t get a more crazed fanbase than it has.
Avatar was released on December 18, 2009, and exploited interest with its groundbreaking visual effects and 3D presentation to become the highest-grossing movie ever released with $2.78 billion worldwide. 3D was efficient and wasn’t used reasonably with stuff flying toward the screen, which brought the fans to the screens. Now with people watching movies on their phones and tablets, we can’t expect them to go to theatres to watch the film.
The Story Was Too Bland in the First Avatar Movie
James Cameron is an extremely talented storyteller. The first two Terminators are in his top 20 favorite movies of all time. He prefers Aliens to Alien, and he likes Titanic as an adult, even though he hated it as a kid. But Avatar has always been kind of annoying when it came to storytelling. Sure, the visual effects were impressive, and that meant a lot back in 2009. But story-wise? Well, I’m glad it lost to The Hurt Locker when it came to Best Picture said, James Cameron.
Avatar 2, 3, & 4 might be more innovative and exciting than the first one. Still, the film never had stars like Thanos separating his fingers and wiping away half of its characters, one of the main reasons we just enjoyed to see Endgame after that startling finale in Avengers: Infinity War. It has nothing like that going for it. I want to see it, we all want to see it, yeah, but to the guess, we won’t be rushing out of the house to watch it on big screens.
So, Avatar 2 will probably be calm and make a lot of money at the box office, but there’s no way in the world it’s going to make more money than Avengers: Endgame. Hopefully, Avatars 3 and 4 will come out on time, so we won’t have to wait over a decennary for the sequel. But if they are postponed, then at least we’ll always have Marvel to fill the gap.Copper is a metal that is widely used in electrical equipment and services. Like many electrical products, technological advances have resulted in these devices being phased out after redundancy. This leaves a large amount of copper available for producers to reuse at a lower price and is easier to obtain and process, unlike extraction.
This is only part of the reason why copper recycling is such a big industry worldwide. Copper is used in various adjustments that are always around you. This makes the nonferrous alloys a necessity and strengthens copper in such large quantities that it can be reused, and recycled.
Image Source: Google
Let's take a quick look at the benefits of copper recycling for both producers and consumers.
Low Cost For Manufacturers:
Unlike copper mining and processing, recycling is a much cheaper option. This saves the cost of buying or renting heavy equipment, the cost of shipping the extracted raw honey to the processor, and so on. When recycling copper, they are 20% lower than the yield.
Goods At A Lower Price:
The modern business practice believes that value creation is good enough. This means the part of the product processing history where value is added to the product and the resulting end-user experience. These features provide a premium product. However, cheaper components result in savings for the end-user because unit costs are reduced and pricing is a very competitive market for all goods.
Lower Environmental Costs:
Only honey can be recycled because it is a metal that can be reused and recycled, copper is disrupting the ongoing extraction of raw materials on the planet. Copper is a unique metal in that it is adaptable and flexible, and very easy to recycle in new avatars. Recycling copper is 20% cheaper than extracting, transporting, and processing copper..

Smite Tier List 2020 CriteriaWith well over 100 gods in total for players to choose from currently in Smite, it can be difficult to figure out who is the best of the best and who you are better off ignoring. As such, that is where we come in with our updated Smite tier list 2020. We have previously done a tier list in the past but with a new year for the strategic game comes a new era as well. New gods have been released in the time since the last tier list we did while existing gods had their stats and abilities boosted or even nerfed. As such, there are some characters that you might be surprised to see move up and down the list while exciting new entries like the recently released Heimdallr the Vigilant will shake up the metagame entirely. All in all, the Smite tier list 2020 isn’t too different from prior years but it has some key changes, nonetheless. For those who don’t know, the well over 100 gods are divided up into five distinct classes in the game: Warrior, Guardian, Mage, Assassin, and Hunter. These classes are self-explanatory on their own with the Guardian focused on tanking while the Assassin is sneaking around for quick kills. However, even still, it can be tough to figure out who you want to play as even if you already know what class you are interested in. After all, there are literally dozens upon dozens of gods to choose from for each of the classes. Our Smite tier list 2020 aims to give you an idea of who is the best in the game is so you can more easily figure out which Warrior, Mage, or so on that you would like to check out. The criteria that we have for this list is rather simple. When making this list, we took into consideration the overall strength of the god from their stats to their abilities as well as their synergy with the rest of the roster on a team, how useful they are in matches, how they compare to other gods in their class, and their general qualities that make them stand out. Without further ado, let’s go ahead and jump right in to look at our updated Smite tier list 2020 including every god released up to Heimdallr and each of them broken up into tiers from best to just good.
Smite Tier List 2020: SS TierWith godly beings from around the world all together in one package, it is no surprise that the typical S tier will simply not cut it for these divine characters. There are some truly unbelievably strong gods in Smite so, as such, we needed to create another tier known as the SS tier. These are the gods who can not only shape lands and cultures but the fate of matches themselves. Though you can certainly win matches without a SS god, you are one step closer to victory if you have one on your side. Even if you have no interest in these gods, it is best to know about them so you can prepare ahead of time.
Ao Kuang
Ao Kuang is known as one of the best gods for the middle lane for a reason. Kicking off this Smite Tier List is a Mage class god who. Therefore.
King Arthur like what Hel does. What makes him so great, though, is that the two stances can cover a range of situations that you’ll come across within the game. These two stances allow King Arthur to not only be a tank of sorts, despite his Warrior class, but he can deal massive area of effect damage, too. Couple this with his high mobility and you have one of, if not the, best gods on this entire Smite Tier List.
Merlin currently. You must contend with not just learning four abilities and a passive but several more because of his stance switching. Not only that, but they each work best against different gods. With Merlin, it’s all about keeping enemies on their toes. If you can constantly be using differs.
Smite Tier List 2020: S Tier
The S tier is your standard powerful and absolutely worth your time gods. Normally in most games, these would be the characters that would stand above the rest as the very best in the game. Even though there are a few characters that are just a bit more overpowered, the S tier is chock full of excellent characters to choose from. These are gods that you will see quite often in matches on your team and fighting against you because they are very popular in the community for their prowess. You can find the list of the S tier characters below but before we get into that, let’s go over the latest god Heimdallr.
HeimdallrHeimdallr is the most recent god to join the massive roster of characters that span well over 100 at this point. At the time of writing this, the Norse god has roughly settled into the correct placement for him. This Hunter class character is one of the strongest we have ever seen for the class. For starters, we have a Hunter who knows his prey and won’t let go of them. Just seeing an enemy god will power him up and ready him for the fight, and even if they run away, he’ll be able to see them for several seconds. The crazy part is that’s just his passive ability. As for his other abilities, he can consistently reveal other gods, damage them from a ways away and even use his ultimate to deal some devastating damage that uses the power of all of the existing realms in Norse mythology. This is one Hunter that you shouldn’t ignore.

Smite Tier List 2020: A TierWhen it comes to the A tier gods, these are the ones who you can count on in most combat situations. Though they are not yet powerful enough to make it into the S tier, they are amazing all on their own. With a bit of tweaking and boosting, they could easily rank among the best. You can find the single largest group of legendary gods in this group below:
-
- Isis
- Izanami
- Kukulkan
- Kuzenbo
- Medusa
- Mercury
- Neith
- Nemesis
- Ne Zha
- Nox
- Nu Wa
- Olorun

- The Morrigan
- Tyr
- Vamana
- Vulcan
- Xbalanque
- Xing Tian
- Zeus
- Zhong Kui
Smite Tier List 2020: B TierThe B tier gods shouldn’t be ignored just because they are in the second to last group on this tier list. These are still great gods and, if anything, it is a testament to how strong the characters are in Smite that there are still so many solid gods here. In the right hands, these can still rival the S and even SS tier characters.

Smite Tier List 2020: C TierFinally, we have the C tier. Though this is the final tier on this list, don’t let it fool you. Unlike just about every other game out there, we can confidently say that there is no bad god whatsoever in Smite. Every character in this tier is at least good, if not good. It just so happens that they happen to fall short of the other gods on this list for one reason or another. They could have only decent abilities or stats that keep them from reaching above the good quality. And just because a god is in this tier doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t consider playing them. We have seen countless C tier gods who dominate a match in the right hands. It just might take a little bit more time and attention to turn one of these gods into a force to be reckoned with.

Auto Trader has today confirmed the date at which searches for cars on mobile and tablet exceeded those made on a desktop. The ‘mobile tipping point’ took place in March 2013, twenty months earlier than forecast by Google in a March address made at the Starcom MediaVest Group’s mobility conference. Delegates there were told that the cross-over for all searches would likely take place on 4 December 2014.
Since March 2013, growth of mobile has continued apace. Latest figures from June 2014 reveal that mobile use now accounts for nearly two thirds of Auto Trader traffic. 63% of searches have now gone mobile (20% on tablet and 43% for mobile devices) compared with 37% for pc.
“The fact that mobile and tablet use has exceeded desktop should come as no surprise,” commented Auto Trader market research director Nick King. “What is more interesting is the rate of change and the fact that car buyers seem to be blazing a trail in the use of mobile devices. Nearly seven in every ten full-page advertisement views were made on tablet or mobile last month. That should be a rallying cry for dealers who question the value of optimising their websites for mobile devices.”
Auto Trader – monthly mobile, tablet and pc visitor statistics
In total more than 44.3 million visits to Auto Trader were made in June. Of these 19 million were made on mobile devices, with 8.7 million on tablet and 16.6 on pc. That represented a 21% rise in mobile use (from 15.7 million) compared with the same month in 2013 and 25% in tablet use (from 7 million).
By far the lion’s share of tablet traffic – 85% – comes from Apple iPad users; it’s high resolution serving to aid browsing the desktop version of the site. 17% of iPad users download the iPad Auto Trader app.
The figures showing growth in tablet use on Auto Trader, complement figures released recently by Kantar Media. These confirmed that 53% of tablet users are researching information on a product or service using their device, up from 44% six months agoDelhi Is Not Farby Ruskin Bond

Hi there my son is 11 as well. We have been on all kinds of things since he was diagnosed when he was 5. I find that the mornings and evenings can be hard.
I have always been told to give the meds 2 weeks and to see what happen or how they “adjust.” However, if it is too much to handle you may need to call his dr. and tell him the issues and see if you should keep trying or discontinue the meds. We tried one med before and the side effects where so awful for him that we pulled him off within 2 days.
For my son I find that the rebound effect is worse when he is on a long acting medication like Vvyance or Addreall Xr. We have put him on a short acting med that only lasts 4 hours and this helped with the rebound effect. Hope this helps!Products and Services. The world of concrete

April 5, 2010
April 5, 2010, Greencastle, Ind. — When it comes to tonight's national championship basketball game, who will Dan Quayle be rooting for? "My son graduated from Duke and Coach K [Mike Krzyzewski] is a friend and an all-world coach," the 44th Vice President of the United States was asked today in an online chat hosted by the Washington Post. "However, I have to go with Butler and their coach from DePauw, where I graduated many years ago." Quayle, a 1969 graduate of DePauw, added, "Gene Hackman needs to sit behind the Butler bench tonight."
Hackman portrayed the coach who led his underdog team to victory in the movie Hoosiers. Butler, which has won 25 straight games, is led by Brad Stevens, a 1999 DePauw graduate.
Quayle, who served as a U.S. Congressman and Senator before being tapped as George H.W. Bush's running mate in 1988, discussed a number of issues during the Post session, including whether a competitive third party will emerge. "The two party system has served America very well," says Quayle, now chairman of Cerberus Global Investments. "We always have political movements one way or another but the evolution of a lasting third party probably will not happen." (at right: Quayle visiting DePauw on October 26,
1990)
As far as potential Republican presidential contenders? "As we look to 2012, the names I see are Mitch Daniels, Mitt Romney, John Thune and Bobby Jindal," according to Quayle. "There are others who may emerge. You should watch the governor races in 2010 for possible contenders."
The full transcript can be found at the newspaper's Web site.
A member of DePauw's Athletic Hall of Fame, Dan Quayle captained the Tiger golf team. Learn more about him in this recent article.BackHeart

The inaugural Huajin Securities WTA Elite Trophy will commence on Tuesday. The introduction of this second tier tour final event has been controversial, with many airing their displeasure for the event, including players. Nevertheless, the field is quite strong, Venus Williams and Caroline Wozniacki are the headline acts.
Group A: (1) Venus Williams vs (7) Madison Keys
The opening match of the tournament will be an all American affair when Venus Williams comes up against Madison Keys. This is a critical match in Group A, the winner of this match is almost certain to progress to the semi-finals given Saisai Zheng is the other player in the group.
Madison Keys famously defeated Venus 6-3 4-6 6-4 at the quarter-final stage of the Australian Open earlier this year. I think this is a good match-up for Keys, she has all the power to match Venus and arguably has a clearly better upside at this stage in their careers.
Venus showed strong form throughout the Asian Swing as she made one last big push to reach the WTA Finals. I think Venus is likely to be a little burnt out at the moment at this stage of the year. This is a good opportunity for Keys. Madison has more to gain here.
Prediction: Madison Keys to defeat Venus Williams in 3 sets
Group C: (6) Sara Errani vs (9) Jelena Jankovic
Jelena Jankovic will be looking to claim her first victory over Sara Errani since 2010 when the 2 go head-to-head in the 2nd match of the day in Zhuhai. Errani has won the last 3 encounters between the pair, but 2 of those were her beloved clay.
Jankovic has shown good form towards to the end of the year, claiming 2 international titles during the Asian Swing including Hong Kong where she beat Venus Williams and Angelique Kerber.
Jankovic will be determined to defeat Errani given their recent record and should have the weapons to handle Errani on this surface. Jelena should way to defeat the Italian if she remains patient and waits for her opportunities.
Prediction: Jelena Jankovic to defeat Sara Errani in 2 sets
Group B: (8) Elina Svitolina vs (10) Andrea Petkovic
The final match of the day sees Elina Svitolina and Andrea Petkovic go head-to-head for the first time on the WTA tour. Elina and Andrea both arrive in Zhuhai in poor form and will desperate to turn that around and finish the year on a high.
This is a tough match to call, I’m going to side with Svitolina. The Ukrainian has been in Zhuhai training for quite some time and should be well placed to perform at a decent level. This is not a good match-up for Andrea, she will struggle to hit through Svitolina.“You come all this way to see the views and get out of breath? What a strange people you same name on Channel 4.
Walking the Himalayas was always going to be a more nebulous undertaking than walking the Nile. There’s no definite start and end point to the Himalayan range, and no unique line of travel. Wood’s route takes him well south of the mountaineering traverse carried out by Graeme Dingle & Peter Hillary in 1981 (detailed in their book First Across The Roof Of The World, which I’ve reviewed here). Dingle & Hillary’s route linked Kanchenjunga in Sikkim to K2 in Pakistan. Wood covers more of the range, from the Wakhan Corridor in Afghanistan to Gankhar Puensum in Bhutan, but by travelling at a lower level he avoids much weaving to-and-fro, so he actually covers less distance than Dingle and Hillary—a “mere” 1,700 miles compared to their 3,200 miles.
The book makes a fine companion to the television series. It records much that didn’t make it past the editing process for television, as well as providing space for Wood to give us a little history of the region, as well as some personal reminiscences. If I have a grumble, it’s the way the narrative blithely edits out the intermittent presence of a film crew, and indeed proceeds as if there’s no TV documentary involved at all. For instance, it’s difficult to believe that the “spontaneous” decision to hire a helicopter and fly off to look at Mount Everest didn’t have something to do with the involvement of a film director and producer lurking in the background. But Wood isn’t alone in this sort of thing—Gus Casely-Hayford managed to get right through his book, The Lost Kingdoms Of Africa, without ever mentioning the documentary film crew who were travelling with him.
Wood’s book, in contrast to Dingle and Hillary’s, isn’t really about the mountains at all. Apart from a high col at the start of the journey, and a nameless ridge at the end, he doesn’t do much deliberate mountain climbing; he walks on roads a lot of the time. Instead, he’s much more interested in the people he meets and the cultures he encounters along the way.
The book gives us all the major incidents that turned up on television—crossing wonky bridges and eroded paths, dealing with tense border guards, wading through crocodile-infested rivers, losing the route on rough ground at nightfall, trekking through the monsoon, evacuating a rapidly flooding camp at dead of night, and of course the near-fatal car crash that interrupted (and very nearly ended) the journey. But we also get to read about Wood’s anxious stay in Kabul before the journey started, holed up in a fortified safe-house under the care of a security consultant. Then there’s his audience with the Dalai Lama, in which the wily old sage quickly identified Wood’s journey as potentially good publicity for the Tibetan cause; and his meeting with the Hindu holy man Swami Chidanand Saraswatiji, whose PA reminded Wood, “Don’t forget to like us on Facebook.” We also get to hear a great deal more about Wood’s longstanding friendship with his Nepali walking companion and guide, Binod Pariyar.
Through it all, Wood comes across as the same cheerful, calm, reasonable person that he seems to be on television. There’s a suggestion in the book that he might have had enough of long-distance walking—but then, there was a suggestion at the start of the book that he’d had enough of long-distance walking. So watch this space, I think.
(Added March 2017: And so it turned out. I’ve now reviewed Wood’s next book, Walking the Americas. Here’s a link to the relevant post.)
Note: For interest, I’ve prepared the map below comparing the route taken by Wood with the earlier traverse by Dingle & Hillary. (Both routes were interrupted by problems with direct border crossings, necessitating detours to official crossing points, but Dingle & Hillary incurred a much bigger gap at the Kashmiri Line of Control.)

4 thoughts on “Levison Wood: Walking The Himalayas”
Will check out this book on amazon.ca. sounds good.
Can’t imagine anyone walking the Himalayas mostly on “roads”, which may be a rather loose description of the tracks that feature in the Himalayas ( in the Kumbu for sure )
His Walking the Nile is also excellent.
From the TV series, it’s clear that surfaced roads feature fairly frequently, complete with the danger from heavy truck and bus traffic. He strings together a lot of towns – Gilgit, Srinagar, Dharamsala, Shimla, Rishikesh, Pokhara, Kathmandu, Thimphu, so he’s walking along major transport arteries in many parts of the journey. He’s in the wilds mainly at the beginning (west of Gilgit), the end (east of Thimphu), and also in the remote western and eastern parts of Nepal.
I feel the title of this book is misleading. When one thinks of the Himalayas, one thinks of the high barren mountains above the tree line. For Indians, some of the most famous parts of the Himalayas include Gangotri, Kendar Nath, Gurudwara, etc and the sources of the Ganges. Wood takes a route that is very far from the true Himalayas walking along roads in tropical jungles hundreds of kilometers from the true Himalayan mountains. He performed an impressive physical feat – but he did not “Walk the Himayalays.”
And I agree that not mentioning the film crew was unforgivable. I had no idea until I read the acknowledgements.
This, and his repeated reference to “rattlesnakes” in Walking the Nile have made me rather dubious of this guy. I don’t think he’s an explorer-traveller in the old sense of the word. This feels like some light-weight, pseudo-adventure kind of travel writing.
He is, I suppose, rather lumbered by having to come up with a short themed title for the TV series – his third trip, Walking The Americas, is even more nebulously named, and even more misleading about what to expect from the journey.
It’s certainly a very different expedition from Dingle & Hillary’s hardcore traverse of the Himalayas.
I guess if we draw a line between Dingle & Hillary and Michael Palin, we could plot Wood somewhere along it, perhaps slightly towards the Palin end.
I very much enjoy the books (and the TV programmes) but, while they do contain the occasional daunting adventure when things go wrong, I certainly wouldn’t classify them as featuring any kind of exploration.February 13

High in the treetops above Renthia lies the kingdom of Aratay. It is far from the dangers that lurk on the forest floor below. Renthia is filled with spirits—fire, water, earth, air, and earth—of every shape, size, and form, seeking to do only two things: build and kill. Because of these inherently opposing desires to create and destroy, the spirits are forced to submit to the control of a single chosen human Queen. The Queen has magical powers and it is her duty to protect Araty from the spirits.
When Daleina was 10, spirits destroyed her village. The only things left were devastating destruction, her family, and a discovery that she, too, had fledgling magical power. Frustrated by the Queen’s failure, and determined to protect her family, Daleina enters the Academy. But no amount of training could ever prepare her for what she would face in her quest to be the next queen. New dangers test her courage and strength, forcing her to question whether she really is worthy of the role or if she will even survive to obtain it. As trust is broken and friendship is tested, the young girl is forced to face a dark future she never could have dreamed of with nothing but her determination to keep her alive.
BTSYA / Teen Reader (15):
The Queen of Blood is a thrilling fantasy that feels so real in its own magical way. Sarah Beth Durst creates this beautiful land in the trees where enchanted creatures come alive. This mesmerizing adventure is told from multiple points of view that intertwine to create this captivating story. Daleina’s story is one of courage, determination, and selflessness as she battles spirits and her own self-doubt. Ven’s story is one of strength, friendship, and hope as he fights for a better future. The Queen's story is one of sacrifice, trust, and acceptance as she struggles against her fears. Together, their stories, create this impossible-to-put-down book that will have you hanging on every last word.
This first book of The Queens of Renthia series is a phenomenal introduction to this new, enchanted world. Even alone, the book is one of a kind. This book was a fantasy story like no other with the sense of reality that it harnessed despite its fictional setting. The whole adventure feels real and endlessly captivating as the reader zips through the trees with Ven or soars above them with Daleina. Though this story does become slightly violent as the protagonist faces threatening dangers, her action-filled battles add to breathtaking adventure and the setting of a looming ominous forest.
This book is perfect for older fantasy lovers 13 years and up who love action and magic in faraway lands high up in the trees. This would also make the perfect gift for a fantasy-loving teen hungering for a new adventure they can take over and over again.
A thrilling adventure and fantastic but realistic writing come together in a unique, captivating fantasy that is impossible to put down once you start reading.
Some battle violence.
This is the start of a fantasy series where the setting is a tree and the threats live in the forest below.
This is a story meant for fun. Our reviewer uses several adjectives to describe Deleina and Van. Invite your readers to characterize them as well. If your readers love to visualize stories, why not create maps or drawings of Aratay and Renthia?

The Government heralded the move as a way to allow motorists “to fill their tanks with greener fuels”.
However, critics said it will do more harm than good.
Environmental campaign group Greenpeace said the new rules will “drive rainforest destruction and could actually accelerate global warming”.
Senior forests campaigner Belinda Fletcher explained: “Right now, rainforests are being destroyed to make way for biofuel crops in places like Indonesia.
“This destruction leads to massive greenhouse gas emissions and completely undermines the point of these so-called green fuels.”
The RSPB, Friends of the Earth and Oxfam have also voiced their concerns about the new law. Oxfam described it as “reckless”.
Despite the growing evidence against biofuel use, the Government pushed ahead and introduced the law as part of its Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation.
This obligation should see all UK road fuels contain 5% of biofuel by 2010, bringing the UK in line with European legislation.
However, motorists can still avoid putting biofuel into their vehicles.
In a move that was supposed to protect against fluctuations in biofuel prices, the Government has given suppliers the option to pay a ‘buy-out’ price in respect of some or all of their biofuel obligation.
In defence of the new law, which the Government says will save 2.5 million tonnes of CO2 by 2010, a Department for Transport spokesman said:  made.”
But Greenpeace pointed out that the reporting process is not robust enough.
“Suppliers are only required to ‘report’ the details of the crops they are using.
“This process can be easily manipulated to hide the true origin of environmentally damaging crops like palm oil,” said a spokesman.
Government ministers, including transport minister Jim Fitzpatrick, rallied to support the law amid the growing criticism.
He said: “We must do all we can to ensure biofuels are produced sustainably.
“We know people are concerned about the environmental risks associated with expanding biofuel production and we take those concerns very seriously.”

Trust is design’s great intangible. Once it is implicit, the project has the best possible chance of ending up beyond the client’s wildest dreams. It also ensures that the process is a joy every step of the way. With this Brazil-based couple, trust existed before the start, thanks to a shared connection with a one-time GRADE colleague. The confidence it engendered became the catalyst for every decision in the couple’s art-filled pied-à-terre in Sir Norman Foster’s tower in far-west Chelsea, practically on the Hudson River. For art lovers as passionate as these two, no other building and no other neighbourhood made sense.
With interior and exterior architecture as distinctive as Foster’s, it is natural to take advantage of the design cues and opportunities they provide. The sweep of the living room soffit profile, for instance, sparks many of the custom design details. The same is true for the pale, golden champagne tint of the structural framework. As for the panoramic views of the skyline, river and harbour, what could be more inspiring?
A coffee table of kiln-fused glass and cast bronze, designed by Stacklab, slips neatly into the living room. Along the window perimeter are a pair of Hervé Langlais club chairs and an Ox chair by Hans Wegner. Image: Richard Powers
The entry gallery, the through-line between the public and private areas, showcases just some of the art and iconic contemporary furnishings assembled over the course of an especially exciting design process. A stepped crown moulding incorporates the curve of the soffit, introducing a touch of tradition filtered through a modern perspective.
With ceilings leafed in white gold and walls panelled in ash bleached and stained to emphasise the open grain, the gallery is warm, luxurious and just texturally interesting enough to heighten the experience of the group of works it displays. They include pieces by Annie Morris, Josef Albers, Ingrid Donat, Perrin & Perrin, Dan Flavin and others we curated, including its centrepiece, Lucio Fontana’s Concetto Spaziale, a most brilliant finishing touch.
The living room encompasses two seating areas oriented to capture panoramic views that sweep east and south. Each grouping mixes pieces by some of the 20th century’s best-known makers with custom designs that enhance the art-above-all point of view. A captivating painting by Ellen Gallagher, the very first work selected for this project, informs the room’s elements from form to colour palette.
Stationary wall wings separate the living and dining rooms without a more formal closure; these incorporate the soffit profile, as do the details of the cowhide-lined built-in units. Over the dining table, a petal-like arrangement of suede-wrapped panels and delicate descending lights flowers on the ceiling. The library houses an ever-expanding collection of catalogues and art books, as well as comfortable seating and lighting for serious readers. The shelves float on a wall of fabric-wrapped panels set to reveal shadow lines created by a subtle undulation.
A backdrop for Dimorestudio’s sconces, the custom headboard reinterprets the curve of the soffit in yet another way. Overhead, Ingo Maurer’s Lil Luxury ceiling light introduces a touch of gold, repeated by Franck Evennou’s set of three nesting tables. Image: Richard Powers
In the master bedroom, black and gold accents highlight a tonal palette of creams, off-whites, light greys. A fantastic tangle of a lamp by Jean Royère spreads its vines across the hallway; its bold black lines prefigure those in the bedroom’s Matisse aquatint. Its curves, as well as Foster’s, influence the custom bedroom furnishings. The twin beds in the guest room pick up on the same detail.
It is rare and wonderful to share such trust with clients. When it happens, there’s no predicting what art can come of it. And not just the works of art themselves, but the art of furniture, of curating, of placement, and above all, the art of living.

The company produces Defenders that are unique, with each one being customised to suit each buyer's requirements. Engine options include 170bhp and 250bhp diesels, and petrol V8s ranging from 430bhp to 520bhp.
Other enhancements include brake, suspension and steering upgrades, re-trimmed interiors, better audio systems and reversing cameras. Twisted also produces its own exclusive parts for Defenders.
Twisted was originally a Land Rover tuning specialist and has since progressed in to producing complete, upgraded vehicles.

In line with McKinsey and Firm, that is additionally a profit for firms that must reconfigure their manufacturers after the actual fact. Nevertheless, being spontaneous is just not for everybody, even when they know it is going to be useful.
Some leaders discover it troublesome to maneuver ahead shortly, break issues up and transfer on. For them, a world with out stability is a world with out stability. Nevertheless, stability is just not all that issues. Typically instability offers the gas to drive innovation and break new floor.
Break guidelines to rule an trade
Take the unlikely success of Jason Hennessey.
He is now the CEO of an eight-figure digital advertising firm, however his fortune was barely set in stone. As a toddler rising up on the east coast, his household struggled with relentless monetary insecurity and well being care stress. Like so many different courageous entrepreneurs, the rockiness of his upbringing nurtured spirit and drive. In reality, it was the uncertainty of the longer term that made him embrace spontaneity and take dangers.
“I grew up because the son of a single mother or father who had critical medical issues at a younger age,” explains Hennessey. “It was an on a regular basis battle to say oneself day after day. However each morning introduced a way of accomplishment – and alternative. Because of a supportive household, I’ve seen that tomorrow you may’t be the place you might be right this moment. On the identical time, I spotted early on that if I wished to win in life, I needed to depend on spontaneous actions supported by instinct. In different phrases, I must suppose in a different way from everybody else. ”
One other approach of trying on the world – and search engine optimization
For Hennessey, “totally different” pondering meant seeing obstacles as alternatives.
After transferring to the west coast, he began a marriage DJ firm in Las Vegas. He barely allowed himself a low wage and put most of his earnings again into the startup. Realizing that purchasing advertisements in customary print publications wasn’t getting him leads, he went on-line.
It was Y2K’s time, an ideal second to discover search engine optimization to the fullest. So he turned a self-taught scholar of all issues digital. “Studying is absolutely the important thing to mastering one thing,” says Hennessey. “Skateboarding. Manufacture of handmade furnishings. Destroying the search engine optimization recreation. One thing. Spend 10,000 hours of coaching and expertise and you might be positive to grow to be an knowledgeable. ”
After devouring classes and books on the rising digital advertising scene, he cracked the algorithm code. Some would possibly counsel that he even broke it and despatched a plethora of prospects into his DJ enterprise pipeline. The corporate grew and remodeled into a bigger entity with larger attain and companies. He bought it at 29 for a tidy revenue that he instantly invested in his subsequent enterprise, a digital advertising company.
His method was new from the beginning.
True to his distinctive, instinctive, and unorthodox lifestyle and work, he eschewed conventional enterprise planning methods. For one, his company had a web site a lot additional in its lifespan. “It sounds loopy {that a} digital-based group would not begin with a strong website,” he admits.
“However here is the reality: Not having an internet presence did not maintain us again. We grew quickly within the first 12 months and made eight numbers with out the necessity for a separate location for the corporate. It was positively thought backward. And it has helped us differentiate prospects and concentrate on seeing them somewhat than posting our personal content material. ”
One other instance of Hennessey’s relentless pursuit of the sudden was his insistence on short-term contracts. To this present day, his crew works with month-to-month agreements. Whereas this subscription-style mannequin sounds tough or unpredictable, it ends in a retention charge of 97%. He explains, “I’ve all the time believed that you do not have to regulate your prospects if you’re doing all your job. They’re going to keep as a result of they respect that you’re the “actual factor”, not since you put them on a leash. ”
In fact, not all entrepreneurs have Hennessey’s pure predilection for zigzags when others are zigzagging. That is okay. Everybody can study from his instance if they’re excited by disrupting an trade, particularly after the financial and market uncertainty in 2020.
If an inexperienced younger enterprise proprietor may very well be Google primary for “marriage ceremony favors,” all is attainable. All it takes is the willingness to let go of the established order – and to simply accept the facility of a little bit spontaneity.If no probate is opened, how long does a creditor have to try to collect a debt from a deceased person?

There are some exceptions, but generally a creditor needs to assert themselves within the first 120 days. I am a little confused about how you are a creditor to his estate--did he owe you money in some fashion?
Him being on your title as tenants in common does not make you his creditor--it just means that he may have passed away owning a share of the property, which would have passed to his heirs. Since you had his heirs sign a quit claim they now do not own his share if they inherited it. So you are good to go.
If he did owe you money, then you would be a creditor to his estate. In that case see the dates below described in CA Probate Code Section 9100:
§ 9100: Creditors shall file a claim before expiration of the later of the following times:
- Four months (120 days) after the date letters are first issued to a personal representative (administrator/executor).

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tom Carper, Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, today released the following statement after meeting with President Biden, Vice President Harris, and Transportation Secretary Buttigieg to discuss transportation infrastructure legislation:
“By holding this bipartisan meeting today, President Biden made it clear that investing in our transportation is a top priority. The American people desperately want us to bring our roads, trains, and bridges out of the last century and into the future. And President Biden and I know that we need to do that in a way that builds back better, putting our transportation sector on a path to zero emissions and creating millions of good-paying jobs in the process.
“Reauthorizing our surface transportation programs is how we make this happen. A surface transportation reauthorization bill can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, create jobs to strengthen our economy, and move us to a cleaner, safer future. I’m currently putting together a bipartisan bill that does just that, and I’m glad it’s at the top of the Administration’s agenda. Our current authorization extension expires in September: there is no time to waste. Now, I’m looking forward to working with my colleagues in the House and in the Senate to get this done.”

Prof. S.-E. Al-Batran
PLATON is a network of German physicians which aims to improve the individualized, targeted therapy for patients in different cancer entities by bringing together molecular profiles, clinical data and study information. PLATON is conducted as an epidemiological platform trial organized under the patronage of the AIO – Arbeitsgemeinschaft Internistische Onkologie.
The key feature of PLATON is a shared infrastructure, where participating physicians view molecular profiling and clinical data of their patients and additionally have the opportunity to introduce currently recruiting clinical trials on their study-sites in Germany. The information exchange created by this interactive platform makes it possible to increase the likelihood that patients will be treated with the best possible individualised therapy and included in appropriate ongoing clinical trials.
To further increase the information content and thus achieve the best possible results, PLATON provides the opportunity to conduct Next Generation Sequencing for patients of participating physicians in certain sub-studies.
After an independent review, participating physicians can become PLATON investigators, allowing them to use the growing data sets for the evaluation of predictive and prognostic impacts of molecular alterations as well as analysis of other endpoints.
We are looking forward to welcoming you in the PLATON network. To become a participating physician please click here.

In the two previous articles of this series, “Quebec mortality rate under the French regime” and “The first French-Canadian centenarians in Quebec“, we successively mentioned the high mortality which afflicted our ancestors at all ages of life and the scarcity of people reaching extreme ages. Today, we will present some factors underlying these realities.
As a first step, we used the PRDH (What is the PRDH?) database to establish the list of native-born French-Canadians who reached the venerable age of 97 before 1850.
Deaths of Native-born French-Canadians at age 97 and older which occurred before 1850
Thirty-one people accomplished the feat, twenty-three women and eight men. Why such an imbalance in favor of women, when their life expectancy at age 25 is 2.5 years less than that of men?
It is that beyond the reproductive period, when mothers were at a significant risk of dying in childbirth, women have a survival advantage over their partners. We know that part of this benefit is biological because male mortality is higher than female mortality from the very beginning of life, including in-utero. This genetic difference is especially associated with a better resistance of women to biological aging, as well as an hormonal advantage.
Indeed, for example, estrogen facilitates the elimination of bad cholesterol and thus reduces the risk of heart problems; testosterone, on the other hand, is associated with violence and risk taking.
That said, regardless of sex, why do some individuals reach higher ages than their contemporaries? While we know that there is more to it than chance, no explanation of this reality is currently unanimous. The study of extreme cases of longevity does not really reveal much: the “little glasses of gin before dinner” and other recipes of the kind have no serious basis.
It is tempting to believe, however, that some individuals initially have an advantage over others; Is it not said that the best chance of living old is to have parents and grandparents who have themselves reached an old age?
In this regard, I submit to you the extraordinary family of Nicolas Lizotte and Marie-Madeliene Miville-Deschênes, who married on May 3, 1724 in La Pocatière. Out of the 5 French Canadians who became centenarians before 1850, two of them were born of this couple, and one of their sisters is also part of our above-mentioned list, since she died at 98 years of age!
And it doesn’t stop there! The father, Nicolas Lizotte, died at 98 years old, making him the second oldest French Canadian male who died before 1850. I don’t know about you, but I wouldn’t mind being a Lizotte right now!

August 2018Indoor 5G network, inside Glanbia Ireland’s multi-purpose dairy processing plant in Ballyragget, Co.Kilkenny, will bring improved indoor 5G coverage, low latency connectivity and data security improved in the largest Irish factory in Glanbia. The 5G solution will enable faster and more accurate maintenance tasks and provide richer analysis of plant processes, helping to reduce manual administration and increase manufacturing efficiency.
5G radio coverage will be provided by industry leader Ericsson Radio Dot System and combined with 5G spectrum from Three Ireland, Glanbia will test bespoke 5G use cases including augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality ( VR), and will test how 5G can provide improved indoor connectivity for their larger production facilities.
John Griffin, CEO of Ericsson Ireland, said: “5G offers the largest potential platform for innovation ever and this exciting strategic partnership between Three Ireland, Ericsson and Glanbia will unlock the real value of Industry 4.0 for the Irish manufacturing sector. From driving true digital transformation to increasing productivity and creating operational efficiencies, 5G can serve as the basis for Ireland to revolutionize critical industries and pave the way for innovation. and future economic growth.
Karl Duffy, Head of Business and Public Sector at Three Ireland, said: “The tailor-made opportunities and insights that 5G can bring to organizations and industries are really exciting for us at Three Ireland, offering a real change from 4G. We are delighted to partner with Glanbia Ireland and Ericsson on this initiative. This is the first indoor 5G network of its kind in Ireland and will offer real efficiency to Glanbia. The opportunity is there for companies of all sizes to create a pilot and evolve over time. Companies that act now will have a leading edge within their industry that cannot be underestimated.
Brian Farrell, Engineering Manager at Glanbia Ireland, Ballyragget, said: “We are delighted to be involved in this revolutionary initiative with Three Ireland and Ericsson. This allows us to bring to life some of the early lessons of our participation in an EU-funded Horizon 2020 5G project. It emphasizes the importance of networks as a catalyst for digital industrial transformation and it will accelerate for us the testing and adoption of some innovative Industry 4.0 use cases. “
Ericsson and Three Ireland first launched 5G together in 2020 and this next step in their strong partnership will demonstrate how 5G can be used in Irish manufacturing to develop other business use cases, which may term be applied in various sectors. The two companies are already working together to develop next-generation 5G consumer use cases through the global Ericsson Startup 5G program.

AFECA
SHARE - AND PROMOTE - YOUR EXPERTISE
AFECA is committed to establishing itself as a world-class training and briefing resource on all aspects of financial and economic crime in and affecting English-speaking Sub-Saharan Africa.
We are now looking to expand our database of ‘freelance’ trainers and subject matter experts.
If you believe you can usefully contribute to our quest and would be interested in undertaking occasional short-term assignments, we’d love to hear from you – whatever your current status (employed full-time, self-employed, retired, etc) or circumstances.
We do not employ a faculty of full-time trainers and tutors, as that would greatly constrain our ability to address the region’s very diverse contexts and specialist training/briefing needs.
We also recognize that there are many very talented practitioners with invaluable practical experience who are not looking to change careers, but who nevertheless wish to share their expertise as and when convenient short-term, ad hoc opportunities to do so arise.
WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR
We are looking for relevant, real-world expertise from a wide range of backgrounds.
For example, our database currently includes judges, lawyers, accountants, civil servants, police and customs officers, business executives, bankers, academics and researchers, game rangers, ICT and cyber technicians, compliance officers, psychologists, environmentalists and others.
We don’t much care whether you have a dozen academic qualifications or none at all, as long as you are among the best in your field and would like to share your expertise and experience.
We also appreciate that someone who has spent years working out of the public eye in remote locations may have just as much to contribute as someone who has achieved high office or won international acclaim.
We are looking for both trainers and experts - they are often very different. Trainers develop practical skills, as well as trainees’ confidence and judgment to use those skills effectively in different situations. Subject matter experts impart specialist knowledge, insights, policy advice, analysis and understanding. They are very good at explaining, but may not be very good at (or not interested in) training.
We are as keen to hear from those who can brief cabinet ministers and CEOs on major developments as we are interested in identifying those who can train middle management and front-line personnel on operational issues.
PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
The nature of assignments will vary very considerably, as each is tailored to the specific needs and circumstances of participants. For example, a briefing workshop for judges, CEOs or members of parliament will differ markedly from a training course for prosecutors, front-line investigators or compliance officers.
Training assignments also vary in duration – typically 2-5 days, but may be longer. Briefing assignments are usually much shorter – typically a day. While most assignments will be scheduled well in advance, some may be arranged at fairly short notice.
Assignments are conducted in a variety of locations across Sub-Sahara. All reasonable travel, accommodation and other expenses incurred in undertaking an assignment will be reimbursed.
All assignments are remunerated. The rate of remuneration will depend on the nature, duration and other features of each assignment.
There is no obligation to accept any particular assignment which you may be offered.
APPLICATION PROCESS
Interested? Please complete and submit the online Application Form, which can be accessed via the 'Trainer/Expert Application Form' tab below.
Submission of the form is merely an expression of interest and does not commit you in any way. It also does not constitute acceptance of you as an AFECA trainer/expert.
In due course, we will be in touch with further details about the selection and accreditation process. In particular, we may require you to provide referees and may also seek to verify the information you have provided. We will always obtain your consent before doing so. As part of the accreditation process, you may be required to attend and successfully complete an induction programme.
All information provided by you will be kept confidential and will not be disclosed to third parties.
QUERIES
Should you have any questions about any aspect of the application process, please submit these by email. We will respond as soon as practicable. Please do not phone.

#ScaryMary is one of the most awesome #catsofsteemit.
Her human, @manorvillemike, shares his home with eleven rescue cats, most of them the offspring of feral Mary. She's a nice enough cat - to her human. She has zero tolerance of other cats, though, shunning their company and stealing their food, or so Mike tells us each day with his delightful #catsnaps, my Drug of Choice in a world gone mad.
Mike just informed me of a book we cat-keepers should consider:.
But first, more about Scary Mary and her
servant slave:
Boss lady cat, Scary Mary opens up the new #catsnaps Community.....
Scary is the mother of five healthy cats now two plus years old....
Three live in the same house as her but get no attention from their mother. That is because Mary was an outside cat, separated from her kids for 9 months.
Attention all cat lovers ... Use the Tag #catsnaps when you have great pictures of your cats or any cat and have little to say about the pictures ... #catsnaps is looking for cat eye-candy ... NOW A COMMUNITY
Bobi the Bad is neutered,
not gonna contribute to the gene pool like Scary Mary did, but he looks so much like her, he could be hers (or the "spawn of the devil", or both, for all I know).

So far, so good, but after reading the reviews, I'm more-than-ever annoyed with Amazon. They often reject my reviews for following a guideline they put up years ago: try to be entertaining. Personalize it. Yeah. So my mention of a grandchild scoring favor with the new dog treats got rejected. I had to rewrite it and include an ingredients list before they accepted it. Meanwhile, a review like this (entertaining, to be sure) tells me NOTHING about the book itself, but it does tell me the reviewer needs to neuter his cat. Grumble, Grumble!

5.0 out of 5 stars - Perfect for the type-A cat owner
If you're like me, and you demand excellence from your pets, FELINESTEIN is the perfect guide. For many years I suspected that my cat wasn't living up to his potential. He would do little more than sleep on the windowsill and lick himself occasionally; he was using large quantities of catnip; he stopped associating with other cars; and he lost all interest in his favorite toys--the scratching post and the little rubbery thing on the end of a stick. I suspected that, deep down, he wanted more out of his life. He was tired of the humdrum existence, but was unable to express himself clearly.
Now, after just six months of using the puzzles in this book, my cat can open doors, flush toilets, play hide-and-seek, operate the remote control, and even has a rudimentary understanding of the answering machine. He shows more self-assuredness now with other cats, and--with his added confidence--has apparently impregnanted many of the neighborhood she-cats who previously wouldn't look at him.
The book is by no means a guidebook to TRAINING your cat; so, rest assured, your felinestein will remain as independent as ever. In fact, now that my cat can open doors, I haven't actually seen him for several days. I know he's in the house, because he goes through the refrigerator at night, and sometimes leaves a mess in the kitchen. But this is a small price to pay for the satisfaction of knowing that your cat is happier, more fulfilled, and better equipped for his life, both on the windowsill and out in the world.
Occupy and Entertain your cat.
Meh! I already play a few favorite games with our resident feline (who has zero interest in the Red Dot; he's smarter than he looks), but I could use ideas for new ways to keep him from getting restless and bored. Idleness being the devil's favorite sport (Proverbs 16:27 Idle
hands paws are the devil's workshop). Or as George Carlin put it,
Speaking of idle paws and devious minds, @manorvillemike want to keep an eye on his little black Betty:
Says another Amazon reviewer,
I bought this hoping to get some ideas on how to mentally stimulate my very intelligent cat. Unfortunately, this book really isn't useful unless you're a total cat novice. It gives really basic ideas about how to play with your cat, but if you've had cats before they're kind of "Well duh!" ideas. It's not a BAD book, just not what I needed.
I am so mad at Amazon
for allowing an apparently irresponsible cat owner to post a smart^ss review that tells us nothing about the book, while I keep getting clobbered because I'm stupid enough to continue buying/reviewing products via Amazon.
Quick, back to #catsnaps

10 Games to Entertain My Cat - Animal Wised
Playing with your cat is just as important as keeping them well fed and offering a comfortable bed to sleep. Without fun the animal will end up suffering from stress, anxiety or depression.To do this, it is advisable to set a schedule of games a day, and always follow the same routine to set a pattern.
Lack of games will generate boredom in cats, which in turn can develop stress and behavioral problems; like the destruction of furniture.
When we play with our kitten and constantly move our hands, we are indicating that this is the toy to bite. This will result in constant bites during adulthood.
Hide and Seek, Find the Prey, Follow the String - these are Bobi's faves.
It is good to let a cat play alone, but it is still better if we participate in the game. By playing with our feline we keep them entertained while strengthening their bond, increasing their confidence and preventing disorders and conditions like stress, boredom, loneliness or anxiety. Here are the funniest, simplest and cheapest games to play with your cat at home:
Hunt the prey!
No need to buy "cat fishing rods" - I make my own. A stick, a string.
Oooh, but I don't set an hour of play a day.
Remember that not winning can generate frustration in cats, so let them catch the prey from time to time to prevent this from happening and deem the game useless.
Aha! Here is one game I haven't tried yet, a variation on:
Find the ball!
Finding and bringing the ball is not just a game for dogs, cats also enjoy using these toys. To teach this exercise, follow these steps:
Find the ball that your partner likes best and throw it to begin their search.
At the same time, say "go look" to associate the act of searching with a command and reward them when they reach it.
Once this is accomplished, you can proceed to teach them to bring you the toy. To do this, when they have the ball in their mouth, call your cat to come to you, remove the toy softly and give them a treat so that they understand when they hand over the ball they receive a prize.
Slowly introduce the "let go" command and keep practicing until they do it alone.
And if you are one of those who prefer to make homemade toys, you can make yourself a ball with rope that will also allow your cat to file down their claws with it.
Ssssh, don't tell Mike, but Bobi the Bad has had his own Facebook page for years.
You always make great reviews Carol!
I believe cats get smarter as they get older and are around humans. My older cat Red seems to talk more now and lets me know when he wants something- which is quite frequent. :)
Bobi the bad with his own facebook page. Love it. 🐱 💗
Your cat Red is getting more vocal - not in the middle of the night, I hope! Bobi doesn't live by the clock. He's getting older, but smarter? Maybe in another nine years!
Thanks for reading and commenting. 🐱 💗
Bobi the Bad and Scary Mary do look alike. : ) Pachino loves to play with colorful shoelaces. I walk with one dragging on the floor behind me and he tries to catch it, and I drag it slowly around corners of anything, (stop and go while wiggling it). He catches it like it is prey. I laugh so hard when we do this. LOL just thinking about it. : )
Aw, Pachino!!
I haven't tried the shoelace game. I'll have to add it to Bobi's repertoire. He's as finicky about games as he is food. He has one brand, and only one, that he will eat without crying like a starvation case in front of the full dish. He likes very few games. Won't chase a ball or a laser dot. Loses interest in toys faster than an ADHD kid with a boring teacher. But he loves hide and seek and prey games. Hug Pachino for me!
I just read through this whole post.. Am exhausted. I usually only look at pictures and a few sentences. But since my name and cats were in it I managed to finish it...
Suggestion for Bobi... Get a live mouse for him to chase from time to time...
Checked your twitter with my "Lots & lots of cats" we got 2 likes ...yours & mine... lol 🙀🙀
Two likes on Twitter - ours - we liked each other 🙀🙀
You sound like my mom: she won't read long posts. And blocks of words without pictures to break it up? Not for her.
You could skim, you know... I'm sorry I worked you so hard! You started it though with the Felinestein suggestion. :)
Bobi has killed mice before. I still believe he's the villain who felled a ground squirrel when I let him outside one afternoon. It was him or Prince, and neither one ever 'fessed up.
At least Bobi has mellowed with age. His first year or two here were.... interesting.
How old is Bobi the Bad ?
He was 8 months old and had been at the pound for 3 months, in 2011... so I think he's age nine by now. I need to learn how to add text to generate memes like this one:
Cool meme/// try this, there are others out there....
Haha I love your kitties! ♥ Looks like they had a lot of fun. ;)
The kitties are mostly Mike's - Bobi stands alone. By choice. -_-
Thanks!Axios Reporter Ignores Sen. Whitehouse Hypocrisy on Special Interests & connections to ‘dark money’
By Joseph Vazquez
Axios must like propping up Democratic senators as crusaders against fossil fuel special interests while ignoring their own deep ties to special interests, including dark money.
Axios climate change and energy reporter Amy Harder praised how Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) was “calling on the incoming Biden administration to have the Justice Department investigate organizations that fossil-fuel companies have in the past funded.” Harder said Whitehouse was accusing these organizations of “propagating ‘climate denialism and climate obstruction and political ownership of the Republican Party.’”
Harder herself took aim at the conservative Heartland Institute, reportedly a Whitehouse target, and attacked it as “an organization known for pushing false information on climate change.” She stated that Whitehouse’s “focus for now at the federal level are organizations like Heartland.”
Nowhere did Harder mention Whitehouse’s hypocrisy on special interest funding when it comes to his own connections to dark money. The Capital Research Center (CRC) reported in November that Whitehouse himself “fundraises through ActBlue, the Left’s favorite ‘dark money’ machine.” CRC said that ActBlue’s “501(c)(3) and (c)(4) wings report their pass-through grants as a single, unidentifiable lump, so they don’t have to disclose which groups they passed money to or how much each group received.” In addition, Harder also ignored how Whitehouse had written an opinion piece for The Washington Post in 2015 actually arguing for RICO lawsuits to be brought against companies who disagreed with him on climate change.
Reporting any of Whitehouse’s connections to dark money or his crazy op-ed promoting RICO suits against companies he disagrees with would have undercut the anti-special interest and purist crusader images of Whitehouse that Harder was trying to push.
But Whitehouse has a history of railing against right-wing dark money while ignoring questions regarding his own connections to left-wing dark money.
The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board published an editorial in September headlined “Sheldon Whitehouse Goes Dark.” Whitehouse was invited to testify before a House Judiciary subcommittee to rail against right-wing “grimy swamps of dark money influence” on the courts, The Journal noted. He reportedly did this while refusing to answer questions about his own ties to Arabella Advisors. Arabella Advisors is a massive left-wing for-profit operation that oversees leftist nonprofit groups that have also tried to exert considerable influence on the courts. As the editorial concluded:
Mr. Whitehouse’s silence about his own ties to dark-money networks shows his goal isn’t to clean up politics. He wants to silence those who disagree with him, [emphasis added].
The Journal Editorial Board also noted prior to Whitehouse’s testimony before the House Judiciary subcommittee that Whitehouse had possible “ties to [the radical leftist] Demand Justice, which describes itself as a ‘project’ of the [Soros-funded dark money organization] Sixteen Thirty Fund and New Venture Fund. In 2018, Demand Justice spent some $5 million opposing Brett Kavanaugh.”
Demand Justice — an “affiliate” of Arabella Advisors — was reported in September to be spending seven figures on an ad buy in a last-ditch effort to derail President Donald Trump’s nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. The Journal reported that “[w]hen a Daily Caller reporter asked Mr. Whitehouse last year if Demand Justice and groups like it have donated to his campaign, the Senator replied, ‘hope so.’”
JunkScience.com founder Steve Milloy spoke to the MRC about Harder’s irresponsible reporting in not disclosing Whitehouse’s hypocrisy:
I’ve been interviewed by Axios’ Amy Harder. I don’t view her as an objective reporter. She’s a propagandist for climate bedwetting, masquerading as a journalist. None of this was a surprise since Axios itself is basically a spinoff of the left-wing Politico. That she would omit mention of Sen. Outhouse’s [Whitehouse] hypocrisy is no surprise.I was at an event sometimes last year, and one of the speakers talked about how he was not willing to control his wife financially by allowing her to work. He went further to tell us how he brainstormed for her and taught up business ideas for her since she was not going to be doing the regular 9 to 5. For me, that’s highly impressive and I doff my hat for him. Those are the kind of men that are not threatened by the success of their wife, rather they seek their good and push them to it. Their wife’s success is a plus to them. They don’t see it as a minus.
Later that year, I was somewhere, and I saw first hand how a husband was seeking his wife’s good in her business. He was telling her what to allow and what not to from those who will be doing business with her. He shared some tips and joined in doing some things. My heart was gladdened. You know why already.
While the examples I gave bothered more on business, and they were from men, seeking the good of your spouse is not limited to business and it is not only the men who are to seek the good of their wives. It goes both ways, and it cuts across all areas. I’ll touch on some.

Seek the spiritual good of your spouse. If it is only on this earth we have hope, we are of all men most miserable. If in the mathematics of the good yo seek for your spouse, the sum of their spiritual life is not added, your summation is equal to a zero. You seek the spiritual good of your spouse by spurring them to study the word and pray daily. You encourage your spouse to walk in righteousness and develop a personal relationship with God.You seek the spiritual good of your spouse by spurring them to study the word and pray daily.

You seek the good of their physical and financial health. “Beloved, wish above all things that your spouse will prosper and be in health even as their soul (spiritual life) prospers.” 3 John 1:2 (rephrased). See to their well-being and don’t have a controlling/manipulating/domineering mindset when it comes to finances. Create room for growth for them.
Seek the good of their relationships. Life does not revolve around you, their spouse. They need people outside you. Encourage your spouse to build and sustain healthy relationships.

A Titusville man who broke into a Titusville mosque and left a slab of raw bacon now faces 15 years in prison after pleading guilty to charges, the state attorney's office said.
Michael Wolfe, 37, will serve 15 years in state prison, followed by 15 years probation for the January 2016 crime at the Islamic Society of Central Florida Masjid Al-Munin Mosque in Titusville. Prosecutors said the agreement was reached after discussions with the Islamic Society of Central Florida and Titusville police.
“He entered a plea deal and plead guilty to vandalizing the mosque itself with hate crime enhancement, making it a felony,” said a spokesman for the State Attorney’s Office Todd Brown. “He waived his right to a pre-sentencing investigation.”
Details of a motive were not released.

English Braids Ltd is a privately owned British manufacturer of ropes, cords and braids. We were established in 1972 in order to supply rope and cord of varying constructions into the industrial marketplace.
The company was established in Malvern, Worcestershire and our current purpose built site, which includes our manufacturing facility as well as office functions, was acquired in 1979. The organisation grew and evolved from this point, with a strong emphasis on sales and customer service.
Our Commercial Marine product range is based on a combination of onshore, offshore and subsea, with all products designed to meet the environmental challenges in these extreme locations. Technical fibres such as Dyneema® and Technora® are found alongside more routine products manufactured from polypropylene and polyethylene. English Braids are heavily involved in the development of bespoke solutions for these demanding industries.
English Braids has established a network of partners throughout the UK and distribution channels throughout Europe, Asia and the Americas. The values of the company have been aimed at bringing a high-quality product to market. It has been our long standing opinion that people do not buy on price, but value for money. It is this messaging that has been key in the overall success of the company today.
The passion for British manufacturing has always been at the heart of our operation and therefore considerations to move production to other areas have always been rejected. The focus on quality and the lack of attention on commodity markets has seen English Braids become one of the best known names in the UK rope market and our products are used across a multitude of markets and sectors from leisure marine to subsea, offshore and commercial marine to winching and defense.

However, in the eastern region of the continent vaccine hesitancy has picked up the baton from the supply-related challenges during the first months of the vaccination drives in creating a major obstacle to the return of a semblance of normality.
Vaccine skepticism, especially in the context of the vaccines developed to provide protection against the coronavirus disease, can be attributed to a multitude of causes, with the differences between various demographics within rather than between populations also in need of being taken into account. In particular, it has become par for the course in two countries in Eastern Europe: Bulgaria and Romania. As of October 2021, these two states have been the laggards in the EU in terms of both first and second vaccine doses administered.
From a historical standpoint, both Bulgaria and Romania have seen quite a few periods of compromised sovereignty, notably those during which the countries found themselves under Ottoman tutelage, which has played a part in fostering a deep-seated distrust of the state. The reservations displayed toward the political leadership on the part of the general populace may spill over into the medical realm, reducing the likelihood of certain medical interventions gaining widespread acceptance. In 2016, Romania was significantly below the World Health Organization’s targets with regard to its vaccination rate for measles while levels of trust in the medical providers in Bulgaria are consistently quite low. Thus, with the COVID-19 vaccines being novel types of preventive medications and the tendency for vaccination campaigns to be perceived as top-down and state-driven endeavors, turning skeptics into believers appears to be an unusually daunting challenge.
The slump in the COVID-19 vaccinations is perhaps also to be imputed to the lack of a sufficiently strong fear factor, with a June 2021 YouGov survey revealing that Romania and Bulgaria occupy the top two spots among the EU countries when it comes to the number of citizens who express an agreement with the sentiment that the COVID-19 risk is overstated. This is in spite of the rather high per capita rates of fatal outcomes, notably among young people as well (who are somewhat more likely to underestimate the threat of the virus) in the two states. There does not necessarily appear to be a strong relationship between the actual health impacts of COVID-19 and the vaccine uptake of the population, as evidenced by success story New Zealand’s high degree of enthusiasm for vaccinations and the example of Germany where COVID-19 vaccination rates have actually been the lowest in provinces in the East, such as Thuringia and Saxony, which were among the most seriously affected during the previous waves of the pandemic. From a psychological standpoint, as pointed out by political scientist Ivan Krastev, Bulgaria and Romania’s ability to emerge relatively unscathed from the first wave in the spring of 2020 in comparison to countries such as Italy and Spain where the pandemic quickly became a shocking reality on the ground may have contributed to the lukewarm reactions to the vaccinations. Furthermore, in the case of these two Balkan countries, some of the concerns about the virus are arguably being ameliorated by the often mistaken belief among many people that they have already had an asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic case of the disease and made a recovery from it. The significant number of undetected (not officially registered with the authorities) COVID-19 cases in Bulgaria and the issues experienced in Romania when it comes to the accurate reporting of crucial numbers pertaining to mortality are probably an additional explanatory factor as to why regular citizens may unwittingly obtain a distorted picture with respect to the epidemiological situations in their countries, causing them to overestimate the speed with which their states are approaching the “herd immunity” threshold.
Another less frequently mentioned facet potentially hampering vaccination efforts concerns the political uncertainty and the effects of a rapidly emerging protest culture, which has been a feature of Bulgaria and Romania’s political landscapes since the early 2010s.
Romania’s culture of street movements is believed to have started establishing a foothold since the early 2010s. In each of the three years prior to the emergence of COVID-19, Romania experienced massive protests, frequently triggered by corruption issues and specific concerns regarding the judiciary, as in the case of those erupting against the Dăncilă Cabinet in the summer of 2019. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Romania has grappled with political gridlock and seen numerous participants protesting against the pandemic-related restrictions. After a promising start to the country’s vaccination campaign, the vaccination rate significantly slowed down during the summer, with the active involvement of political figures in advocating for the vaccines notably regarded by some analysts such as Costin Ciobanu as having a negative rather than a positive effect, which could be a reflection of the polarized political climate in Romania.
In the last ten years, Bulgaria has also seen a rise in citizen activism, with the country experiencing two major protest waves (in 2013-14 and 2020). The latter one began in July 2020 and was largely political in its scope, reflecting long-standing grievances with the policies of the third Borisov government. While the protests were organic in nature and drew support from many segments of society that were far from inclined to peddle conspiracy theories regarding the virus, in the autumn of 2021 there was a spillover in the direction of vocal opposition to the pandemic control measures. This was evidenced by the burning of face masks during some demonstrations – an action which was criticized by cultural anthropologist Ivaylo Ditchev for threatening the idea of national solidarity in the face of the pandemic. Some sources also lambasted the protesters for going one step further by creating a dividing line between themselves and those supporting compliance with the COVID-19 measures, implicitly labeling the latter as encouragers for the Borisov government. In the spring of 2020 there was a high degree of support for the first lockdown in Bulgaria, but by the third quarter of the year the government’s legitimacy had largely eroded, to an extent due to the tense political climate in the country, which inevitably had a negative impact on the public perceptions of the vaccination campaign that began during the Borisov administration.
When a nation finds itself in the throes of a global pandemic, an inclination to take part in major demonstrations, even if for perfectly legitimate causes, may cause the social fabric to begin to unravel and pave the way for the adoption of a discordant tone among the public institutions. Mixed messaging, resulting from a government’s desire to placate as many competing interest groups as possible may actually further reduce the levels of public trust, an essential ingredient for a successful public health response (a major component of which is the administering of vaccines) to a respiratory virus. The pressure from the street may also make political parties less inclined to compromise in order not to be perceived as sell-outs, worsening the prospects for stable governance, as evidenced by Bulgaria’s experience with three different governments (two of them caretaker ones) in 2021. A provisional government with a restricted mandate, especially if it is perceived to be favorable to a particular part of the political spectrum, as in the case of Bulgaria, may find it more difficult to strike the right chord with the electorate in terms of popularizing a vaccination campaign.
Vaccine hesitancy is a concerning phenomenon, especially due to the extremely serious physical and mental toll that COVID-19 exerts on populations, the lack of a truly reliable and accessible treatment, as well as the possibility of more infectious vaccine-resistant variants cropping up. Still, it is by no means an immutable state of affairs that does not render itself to change. For instance, during the initial stages of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign France was frequently cited as a paragon of vaccine skepticism in Western Europe, but has as of September 2021 one of the highest proportions of people on the continent with a completed vaccination regimen against the coronavirus. Thus, with a fourth COVID-19 wave pushing health systems to the brink, there is hope that countries such as Bulgaria and Romania will muster up a spirit of national unity that transcends the political cleavages, which is likely to significantly reduce the potency of vaccine skepticism.

Each Catapres 100 tablet contains 36. Dexamethasone comes as a tablet and a solution to take by mouth. The incidence and types of adverse events were similar in Simulect® -treated and placebo-treated patients. Both adult and pediatric patients were included in five studies [ 4, 10, 11, 25, 27]; the rest included patients ≥16 years old [ 15, 26].
First of all, you should understand the very fact that Asian Europeans is definitely a conservative culture. Consequently they are very cautious with regards to meeting someone new. If you come from America, for example , afterward it might seem that there is no issue with Far eastern European young women. However , that is totally wrong.

From the publisher—?
In yet another foray into the world of young women in historical times who flaunt the “rules” of the day and pursue lives of their own creation, Fanny Newcomb enters the scene. Fanny is a bright, appealing teacher of immigrant women, attempting to help them attain better lives in a city that has its own brand of shadiness.
Fanny doesn’t believe it when Karl, a German carpenter of her acquaintance is accused of murdering Nora, an Irish prostitute (maybe) and one of Fanny’s favorite students. Neither her beau or the local police detective want to really listen to what she has to say so Fanny enlists the aid of her employers, the Giddings sisters, to make their way through the seediest and most dangerous parts of New Orleans in search of the truth, eventually gaining a little help from the reluctant Lawrence Decatur and Detective Daniel Crenshaw.
Fanny and the sisters, Olive and Sylvia, are a smart and endearing trio and I thoroughly enjoyed their intrepid adventures in pursuit of justice. They’re especially appealing in their determination to live life by their own rules rather than being hemmed in by the ruthless requirements of the Victorian period and I also appreciated the author’s skillful evocation of New Orleans in its wild and wooly days. I really hope that more adventures are to come.

There was a time not so long ago when I could pull poison ivy out of the garden with my bare hands. Other than a single bout with the weed in my 20s — in which barefoot dune walking made the soles of my feet hurt more than itch — I seemed impervious.
Then came mid-life. Now, if I so much as brush a leaf, an angry red welt will appear on my skin about a week later. And, it won’t go away. It itches and itches to the point I’ve sought medical attention.
It’s gotten so bad, I’ve taken two courses of action this summer. One, I’m avoiding the garden. I, in fact, suggested to my husband that we destroy a large section and simply start over. I’m thinking flame throwers, wall-to-wall artificial turf and lots and lot of plastic liner and plastic mulch. We could throw in a single, well-mannered plant every five feet or so and call it a day.
He says that’s the histamines talking and refuses to help. At least in that way. Instead, he intends to wait for cooler weather to come this weekend and to himself go out there in enough clothes to enter a radioactive zone. The battle is clearly on.
Having failed on the flame-thrower tack, I’ve also been experimenting with various skin concoctions intended to help with the rash I already have. While safely indoors, I’ve pureed wild plants (jewel weed) and used a variety of OTC skin ointments and foods (mainly oats) known for their skin-calming ability.
Good news! I have finally found something that works. Yogurt. I’ve long used yogurt on my face. (Those alpha-hydroxy potions aging women pay big bucks for start in nature.) It turns out, if I slather on a generous layer of plain yogurt and let it dry, I’m itch free for about eight hours. Long enough to work. Long enough to sleep.
My husband, the science guy who makes our family’s yogurt, is certainly on board with this, as it is yet more evidence that his recipe reigns supreme. “I’d like to see some tutti-frutti, gelatin-loaded supermarket blend cure affliction,” he’s no doubt thinking.
Anyway, the only downside is that I have a chalky, white coating on one ankle at the moment. It’s doesn’t look any worse than the calamine lotion that some kids used to wear all summer I keep telling myself. The truth is, at this point, I don’t even care if it does.
P.S. If anyone has advice on eradicating P.I. in a cottage-style garden (dense, dense plantings) or eliminating P.I. rash, please share!

Good to know! Thanks

A long-running grant program is one option for adding a K-9 arson tool to fire or police agencies
One reason arson is such a hard crime to land a conviction for is a lack of evidence. And the reason for that is twofold: Fire does a very good job of destroying evidence, as do firefighters in their efforts to affect rescues and strike the fire.
To the best of their abilities, fire investigators will record images from the scene, take witness statements, clear the debris to look for the point of origin and fire path, and collect samples for lab testing. Yet, the national average conviction rate for arson is a paltry 10%.
One way to significantly boost the likelihood of a conviction is using K-9s trained to detect the presence of accelerants. But owning and operating such a K-9 is an expensive and complicated proposition.
To explain that process in greater detail, two experts made an hour-long presentation at the Congressional Fire Service's annual symposium, complete with a K-9 demonstration. The presentation coincided with National Arson Awareness Week.
"Having an accelerant-detection K-9 levels the playing field," said Heather Paul, who works on State Farm's Arson Dog Program. "The prosecution rate goes up significantly when an arson dog points to accelerants."
Since 1993, State Farm has been giving fire and police agencies grants to establish arson dog teams. The company has funded more than 360 teams so far at about $25,000 per team.
Team building
The dogs, Labradors or Labrador-Golden Retriever mixes, are either rescued from shelters or are dropouts from other work programs like assisting those with disabilities. They have to be high-energy and good with people, as they will spend much of their time doing fire prevention work at schools and public events.
"We want that dog to be excited to work," Paul said.
To be selected for the grant, agencies have to meet several criteria and may even go on a waiting list for several years. Among the criteria is a minimum of 50 structure fires per year; volunteer fire departments and private investigators are excluded. However, several departments, say within a county, can apply if the team will be shared across the region.
"It takes a special person to be part of this program," Paul said. "It's not for everyone."
Once awarded the grant, Paul Gallagher pairs the handler with a dog based on the dog's traits and the handler's living situation. Gallagher owns Maine Specialty Dogs and is a retired police officer.
All of the new teams go through 200 hours of training at Gallagher's facility in Maine. The dogs also go through an annual recertification process.
The courts place more value on evidence when the dog and the trainer are certified, Gallagher said. In the recertification process, the dogs are tested on blind samples sent by an outside lab — neither Gallagher or the handler knows which samples are hot. A dog is only allowed two errors before being removed from the program.
A dog's life
In addition to detecting accelerant samples on scene, which are sent to a lab for confirmation, arson dogs have also picked the arsonists out of crowds if they have traces of the accelerant on their bodies or clothes. They've also extracted confessions by simply being on scene, Paul said.
One of the myths about arson dogs is that their work leads to injury and cancer. Gallagher said that while it is up to the handler to decide scene safety, most dogs are injured at home — they live with their handlers during their service and through retirement.
They did experiment with putting boots on the dogs during investigations, he said, but that led to the dogs focusing more on what was on their feet than on sniffing out accelerants.
The dogs are not any more susceptible to cancer than other dogs, he said. Their average life span is 15 years.
The dogs can work 10 to 12 years, but are pulled out of service when they begin to show signs of slowing. It is important to let the dog enjoy some years of retirement, Paul said.
And at present, there's no signs of these K-9s being replaced by machines.
Try as they might, scientists have not figured out a way to replicate the accuracy of the arson dog's nose, Gallagher said. "We don't know how they do it."We are excited to announce that we’re taking part in a specialized trade show this year.

I’ve got some news, actually. Both my phone and my computer have spontaneously decided to die last Friday. They must have been plotting behind my back. Physics says that there are no zero-probability events, so I shouldn’t be so surprised, but it still strikes me as odd. Hm. Regardless, I’m stuck with my tiny surface and have to spend a lot of unexpected $$$ on devices. I hate buying devices. And moving files. And setting up things. Such a waste of time, seriously. I hope it won’t affect the comic but if it does – well, I think my excuse is pretty solid.
Apart from this unfortunate turn of events, I started querying my first novel! So I’m searching for literary agents that take adult fantasy and please keep your fingers crossed. It will take months before I know anything because it usually takes an agent a month or three to even reply to a query. By 2022 I won’t have any fingernails to chew on anymore!
From reading, I started The Inheritance of Orquídea Divina, which sounds pretty interesting, and Terminal Boredom: Stories (not sure about this one yet).
Also, it’s October, and I still managed to get sunburned yesterday. Must be my vampire roots or something. This week has been full of unexplainable pains.

The George III period needlework map sampler crafted in three colours depicting England, Ireland, Wales and parts of Scotland with simulated map border, worked by Louisa Dawson and dated 1790, glazed and presented in an ebonised and gilded frame.
The forest green, fuchsia pink and inky blue threads in the picture are fully in tact with no areas of loss or moth. The colours have a general but slight fade that is wholly expected, and commensurate with age. There are two or three ring spots of stain.
Map samplers are highly interesting simply because they show the world as it was at the time. This example, in 1790, has various quirks such as mentioning the St Georges channel and the Isle of Lundy, and the fact that most of Scotland is ignored, Berwick and Edinburgh aside.
Britain itself in 1790 saw William Bligh arriving back in Britain with the first report of the Mutiny on the Bounty and the 91-mile Oxford Canal is opened, providing an important link between the River Thames at Oxford and Coventry in the English Midlands.
Elsewhere across the world in the year of 1790, France is divided into 83 départements, which cut across the former provinces in an attempt to dislodge regional loyalties based on noble ownership of land and Robert Gray is the first American to circumnavigate the Earth. American scientist and statesman Benjamin Franklin also died in 1790.

Imagine you had no online store. You have to manually book orders and all your sales, and then deliver the products to your customers by yourself and without a formal system in place. That would be a lot of work!
Luckily, you have an amazing solution that can launch your business online in no time. Just open an online eCommerce store by leveraging the power of WooCommerce, Shopify, Magento or Prestashop.
All of them are perfect for any business owner who wants to get their products into the hands of more people and to get traction online.
In this article, our emphasis will be on WooCommerce and Shopify because they hold around 27% and 20% of the market share respectively.
Magento follows them by holding 9% of the market share whereas all other eCommerce solutions combined hold 44% of the market share.
eCommerce Usage Distribution in the Top 1 Million Sites
(Distribution for websites using eCommerce technologies – source:BuiltWith)
Some people might jump to the conclusion that it is best to use Shopify for eCommerce stores, but you can’t underestimate the power of WooCommerce. It is still the king of the E-commerce market.
To create a professional store you will need the help of professional Ecommerce Store developers. They will help you understand the feature, compare them and develop, test and launch your store.
Besides that, they will also help to maintain your store once it starts getting you orders.
Both eCommerce solutions have inherent strengths and weaknesses so let us explore what they offer so that as a user, you can decide which one suits your budget and requirements.
Let’s dive in and try to understand the features and differences between the two.
Free vs Paid debate
For one thing, WooCommerce is free to use while Shopify requires a monthly fee. In both cases, developers will help you set up both, professionally.
WooCommerce together with WordPress is free but you will still require a server to host the website. So, you will have to buy a hosting plan to launch your website. This is a yearly expense together with domain name renewal.
Shopify, on the other hand, is a hosted solution. It means you do not have to go through the hassle of choosing a hosting provider and related stuff because that is provided by the Shopify platform. No doubt, you will have to pay them every month. So, if you consider hosting point then more or less you will be spending money in both cases.
NO free lunches and NO free hosting. Irrespective of a platform, you will have to pay for the hosting whether directly OR indirectly through monthly fees.
Ease of Customization using apps/plugins
An App or plugin provides you with a ready-made solution to add extra functionality to your website.
WooCommerce has tons of plugins, extensions and add-ons that can turn your website into the perfect online store. From adding in new features to wooing customers with customer loyalty programs, WooCommerce is a one-stop-shop for your eCommerce needs. The majority of the plugins are free.
On the other hand, Shopify also offers 2000+ free and paid apps that are systematically divided into various categories like SEO, Marketing etc.
You can customize your Shopify store using these apps.
So, here, more or less, both offer the same facility.
Custom design of your website
You create a website using two ways. Either you ask the designer to create a custom design based upon your requirements or you use a pre-built template to do the same. A custom-designed site stands out as compared to a template-based site. The reason being, template-based site distributes the same layout to every customer.
In the case of WooCommerce, you also have more control over the design because all of the components are open source software which means they’re customizable by anyone with a little PHP knowledge.
Shopify custom design OR custom design templates costs a lot. Shopify also lets you add custom HTML but only to your store’s homepage, which is obviously a limiting factor. The learning curve is high in the case of Shopify.
So, when using WordPress as your CMS (content management system) and WooCommerce as your eCommerce platform, there are endless possibilities for customization.
Payment Gateway Integration
Both WooCommerce and Shopify provides a long list of payment gateways. Neither will you notice one claiming the other’s inferior, but there are some differences to consider for those who want an external gateway that is not supported by their chosen platform.
Shopify doesn’t make it easy to switch out payment gateways. They’ll charge you extra if you want anything other than their default credit card gateway. Shopify charges 2% in fees if using third party services (on top what your vendor would be charging).
WooCommerce does not charge any additional fee when it comes to these types of payments. They are alway Free. Yes, your payment gateway provider will charge you according to their rules but you have nothing to pay to WooCommerce.
Control over your data
When you use WooCommerce, you have full control over everything. The website is sitting on the server you control. You can dig deeper in your database, make copies of the website to create a staging environment, provide a working copy of the site to your developer for bug fixing. The possibilities are unlimited.
Shopify, being a hosted solution, provides you limited access to certain features but at the same level as WooCommerce. While Shopify does give you access to all of your data, the live copy still sits on their servers. That means if they ever decided to close down or sell off Shopify for some reason, then suddenly its customers’ stores would be gone with them too.
Marketing Features/Tools
WooCommerce enables you to run email marketing campaigns through email marketing software like MailChimp, Klaviyo, Hubspot, Mailpoet etc.
These messages can be automated and personalized so your customers feel like they’re receiving a special message just for them.
Shopify too integrates with Constant Contact and a few other apps to help in the same. Here WooCommerce provides added advantage over Shopify.
Search Engine Optimization
WooCommerce integrates with best SEO plugins like Rank Math, Yoast, SEOPress, The SEO Framework etc.
Rank Math provides more options in their Free plugin. Feature-wise, it provides tons of features that a paid SEO app in Shopify will provide.
When it comes to do SEO for a website, WooCommerce wins the race.

If you will buy Shopify’s starter plan, you will pay them $29 per month plus 2% on transaction fees.
Additionally, the developer will charge for design and development if it will be a custom website.
Here is the total breakdown according to the plans they offer:
In the case of WooCommerce, you can start by buying a started hosting plan on Siteground, Blue Host, A2Hosting, Godaddy etc. It can cost you between $2.95 to $4.99 a month.
Additionally, each payment gateway will have different slabs. For custom development or a template-based design, the developer will charge his own fee.
For maintenance, if you can put a small effort into learning how to update the plugins and WordPress and edit pages, you will have to pay nothing to anyone for maintenance. There are tons of videos and articles which can help you learn quickly.
In the case of Shopify, the maintenance is done by their staff but that is charged within the monthly fee. As we said earlier, No free lunches.
WooCommerce vs Shopify (The final verdict – where they stand)
- Ease of Use: It is a tie
- Design and Themes: WooCoomerce
- Add On and Plugins: It is a tie
- Sales Features: Shopify
- Payments and Transactions Fee: It is a tie
- Marketing Tools: WooCommerce
- Search Engine Optimization: WooCommerce
- Customer Support: Shopify
- Plan and Pricing: WooCommerce
To sum up, if you are looking for a cost-effective solution to your online store, but you want full control of it, then WooCommerce might just be what you need!
On the other hand, if a busy lifestyle/schedule makes it hard for you to find time to plan out an entire web presence on your own, then the Shopify platform might be right up your alley because of its hassle-free approach.

It feels like there are a million things to do before planning the wedding, but if you focus on the big tasks the little details will begin to fall into place. There are 7 things you need to do before saying “I do” to keep your families, your partner, and yourself happy and well-prepared for the marriage road ahead. Plan to do them all to keep the rest of the wedding plans going smoothly.
1. Call your families
It’s perfectly acceptable, and even advisable, to notify your close family members by phone that you’ve become engaged. Notify your parents and immediate family members right away, then notify other close family and friends you wish to tell. The mother of the bride will have lots of planning to do as the wedding approaches, so traditionally she is notified first.
2. Set a Date
The day you get married has a huge amount of significance. Not only will the date appear on your invitations and wedding announcements, it may also be used in wedding day décor. Because the day you get married also represents your wedding anniversary, you may even have it engraved on your wedding rings.
Setting the date is, in effect, setting a deadline for the wedding planning, so give yourself as much time as possible. Choose a date that has some special significance, base it around you and your partner’s schedules, and plan for a day that’s most comfortable for guests. Every little detail is important.
Pick several dates that may work, and narrow down the options as you learn more about venues and guest availability. Take time to set a date that will be just perfect, but don’t put this off too long. It’s very important to get your venues booked as early as possible so you will be able to secure the day you really want.
3. Set a Budget
Don’t make any plans until you know how much you can spend. It’s easy to get carried away thinking about dresses, venues, and food, but is that really all you’re going to have? Remember that you may also want music, flowers, favors, a wedding cake, champagne, and table cloths. There’s a long list of wedding items that go with the big day. Talk to your parents and talk to your partner to figure out exactly how much you have to spend in round figures. Once you know how much you can spend, you can start making a comprehensive budget to follow while you make all the rest of your wedding plans.
4. Start the Guest List
Your guest list determines the size of your wedding, an important consideration when you’re picking venues and thinking about planning costs. Start with wedding party members and their partners, close family and friends and go from there. Will you include young children at the wedding? Should you invite your third grade teacher who inspired you? Writing the guest list often means making a lot of tough decisions. Think about who you want to be a part of your big day, and why, and go from there.
5. Book the Venues
Where do you want to get married? Some couples choose their wedding venue for sentimental reasons, perhaps getting married in the same place as their parents or grandparents. The decision may be based on proximity. What’s close to the two of you and your family members? Booking the venues for your wedding is a huge decision. Remember, where you’re getting married will be featured in every single picture.
a. Wedding ceremony
Traditional venues for wedding ceremonies include hotels, churches, beaches and outdoor gardens. Some couples may choose a more unique location, such as a museum or even a yacht. Choose a wedding ceremony venue based on affordability, guest seating, beauty and convenience.
b. Reception
You may not always book your wedding and reception in the same place. When looking for a reception venue, you need something that’s accessible to your various vendors, especially caterers. In addition to seating, you’ll want information about serving liquor and food in the reception venue.
6. Select an Officiant
Choosing an officiant is an important aspect of the wedding planning. If one member of the couple has a family member who is a member of the clergy or a justice of the peace, this choice may be easy. Church-going couples may choose an officiant who is already part of their religious community. But other couples who have no strong religious ties have to go in search of an officiant who will be right for them. Consider religious concerns for both members of the future marriage when making this decision, as well as cost.
7. RELAX!
Before walking down the aisle and saying “I do,” take a break! It’s so easy to get stressed out during wedding planning, and both of you may need to relax for a few days before taking the big plunge. Spending time apart is perfectly healthy at this time. Spend at least a few hours away from wedding planning. Don’t even think about the wedding! For brides, it’s a good idea to schedule a spa day or a movie night with the girls. The groom may want to enjoy a round of golf or go fishing with his close friends.
Settling on engagement rings is the easy part, because there’s a host of things to consider. If you plan the important things well, though, and take time in between to give yourself a little TLC, the wedding itself can go off without a hitch!

Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival announced Tuesday it would require festival-goers to provide proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test result upon entry as the delta variant continues to surge across the United States.
The deadline to get the second dose of a Moderna or Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine or single dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is Thursday, Aug. 19, the festival said in a statement.
This Aug. 19 deadline gives enough time, 14 days, for an individual to be considered fully vaccinated after getting the shot before Bonnaroo kicks off on Sept. 2, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
If you're not vaccinated, Bonnaroo said it will require a negative COVID-19 test result from a 72-hour window before arriving on festival grounds. This applies to people who lost their vaccination card or those who won't be vaccinated before the Aug. 19 deadline.
If you don't make the 72-hour window for COVID-19 testing, there will be onsite testing available for $40 upon entry to Bonnaroo.
While it's too late to get the first shot of a two-dose vaccine before Bonnaroo — since there is a required 21-28 day period in between vaccinations, plus 14 days after the second dose to be fully protected — there is still enough time to get the Johnson & Johnson shot, which only requires one jab.
The latest data from the CDC shows the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is 66.3% effective in clinical trials. The J&J vaccine is also 95% effective against death from the delta variant and up to 71% efficient against hospitalization, according to a study by Sisonke in South Africa that has not yet been peer-reviewed or published.

By Rev. Leo H. McCrary II – November 7, 2021
Taught From – Numbers 14:13-24
Introduction
In our lesson this week, we are going to continue to look at the fallout from the bad report of ten of the twelve spies that went into the land of Canaan. The bad report about the Promised Land has spread through the camp which led the people to doubt and question why the Lord would deliver them to a land that was no good and filled with mighty people. The people are now wanting new leadership that would lead them away from God’s blessing of the Promised Land and take them back to Egypt. God is not pleased with the people rejecting His blessing and so we see His response continue in our lesson today. Today’s lesson is being taught from Numbers 14:13-24.
Moses’ Plea to the Lord
Let us remember that in our lesson last week, the Lord said that He would strike the people with pestilence and disinherit them from the Promised Land because they were rejecting God’s blessing. The Lord also said to Moses that He would make a greater and mightier nation out of him (Num. 14:12). So, the Lord was telling Moses that He was ready to cast away the unfaithful ones.
What will others say?
So, our lesson opens today with Moses, after hearing what God had said to him, pleading on behalf of the people – essentially this is a prayer of intercession. I love when we get to look at prayers in the bible because we will see that prayer does not have to be puffed up as many think it has to be. I often tell people when they pray just to talk to God. No, it’s not like talking to a common person, and yes we should certainly be respectful, but at the end of the day, just talk – be yourself when you talk to the Lord. God is in a relationship with you (in fellowship) and He knows you very well so, you don’t have to change anything – be yourself..
We will see that Moses’ prayer was not puffed up nor was it Moses truly was a great spiritual leader for the people because he would often intercede on their behalf before the Lord. Moses starts off his plea by speaking to how the Egyptians would react to hearing news about God destroying the children of Israel (v. 13).
The Egyptians knew of God because of how the Lord had plagued them and led the children of Israel out of bondage. Not only that, let’s remember that Moses, when speaking on behalf of the Lord, said to Moses, “Let My people go, that they may serve Me in the wilderness.” So, it is certainly possible that if the Egyptians had heard of the destruction of the children of Israel, they would have mocked and laughed at the children of Israel and also mocked the Lord as well.
Not only that, the Egyptians certainly could have spread this word throughout the land which would lead to all the people mocking God (v. 14). We must remember that God had promised to Abraham that his descendants would inherit the land of Canaan. So, in a way, Moses is calling to God’s remembrance the promise that He had made to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob (Israel), and therefore, all the children of Israel. So, in a way, the destruction of the children of Israel by God would lead to the world mocking the Lord and His ability to keep His promises (vss. 15-16).
A call to remembrance
We will then see in Moses’ prayer, that He begins to call to the Lord’s remembrance the things that God had promised. Now, we often see this happen in scripture where someone calls to “remembrance” something that God has promised. Let us not think that God is a forgetful God because He is certainly not a forgetful God. The Lord is omniscient, which means He is all knowing. God knows all things past, present, and in the future so, He most definitely does not need to be reminded about anything so that He can remember.
So, why was Moses calling to remembrance to the Lord, His promise to Abraham if God is not forgetful? I believe Moses did it for the very same reason that I often do it when I pray to the Lord. I often ‘remind’ the Lord of the things that He has done for me, not because I believe God has forgotten, but to show that I remember what God has done for me. If you remember, the Lord was furious last week with the children of Israel because the people were rejecting Him and not remembering all that God had done for them (Num. 14:11-12).
So, to call to remembrance the things that God has done for you, is a sign of both humbleness and faith. I say humbleness because we are showing that we remember that God was the one who helped us or provided for us in our time of need. There are times where we can become too prideful which leads to us believing that we have done things for ourselves and not the Lord.
Moses’ supplication
In his supplication, we see Moses pray that the Lord be great (v. 17) and again Moses calls to remembrance something the Lord has said. Moses remembers the Lord saying that He is longsuffering (which is to say that He is patient) and abundant in His mercy to forgive iniquity and transgressions (v. 18). Again, Moses is calling to remembrance the things that God has promised and said because he is faithful and remembers these sayings faithfully. Not only does Moses remember the things that the Lord has said, but he trusts and believes in what God has said. Again, this is a sign of Moses’ faith.
Something that we will also note about this particular verse is that Moses does call to remembrance that the Lord is not going to let the guilty escape punishment. Moses says, “[God] by no means clears the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation (v. 18).”
What Moses has said here is exactly what the Lord said to him when He passed before Moses in the cleft of a rock. In the book of Exodus, we read the Lord proclaiming to Moses, ).”
Again, Moses was truly a man of faith to be able to recall these things that the Lord had said to him a couple years ago. Now, we will see why Moses was calling these things to remembrance in what he then asks of the Lord. In calling to remembrance these things, we’ll see Moses then ask the Lord, “Pardon the iniquity of this people, I pray, according to the greatness of Your mercy, just as You have forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now (v. 19).”
Moses is doing his very best to intercede on behalf of the children of Israel – he’s seeking their forgiveness from God. So, the question is, is God going to be faithful and keep His word? Moses is praying for God to be faithful and just! Now, we know that the Lord is both faithful and just and will forgive and cleanse any that come to Him of their unrighteousness (1 John 1:9).
The Lord’s answer
So, will the Lord forgive the people? We see God’s response to Moses and He says, “have pardoned, according to your word (v. 20).” God does not hesitate to pardon the people! Again, God is both faithful and just and He will forgive those that come to Him! Moses was a faithful servant of the Lord, but most importantly, he was the leader of the people. When the people did wrong, the Lord came straight to Moses and spoke to him about the people. Moses intercedes as a good spiritual leader, the Lord hears his prayer and answers immediately.
Now, just because the Lord pardons the people, we are going to see that it doesn’t mean that there won’t be any consequences for the people. We will see the Lord say that because of the bad report from the ten spies, He considered that they had tested Him ten times. Because they had tested Him ten times, God said that they – the ten spies – would not see the Promised Land because of their bad report. To add on to who would not see the Promised Land, the Lord included those who rejected Him (vss. 22-23).
So, the people would not be destroyed by the Lord – He pardoned them. Yet, we see that because they had rejected the Lord, God was not going to allow them to receive His blessing. Again, the Promised Land was God’s blessing to the people and because they were rejecting His blessing, God was not going to give it to them.
There are people living in our world today that have rejected the great blessing of heaven who the Lord pardons by not destroying them today – they are able to live and grace His earth. Yet, the day will come when God is not going to allow them to receive the great blessing of heaven because they have rejected it. Yet, we know that we who are faithful are not only pardoned of our sins, but we are forgiven and cleansed of our sins. Because we are of faith in the Lord, we will get to enter into the Lord’s heavenly kingdom that was promised to us.
At the end of our lesson, we’ll see that the Lord rewards Caleb with being able to enter into the Promised Land (v. 24). Caleb, the Lord states, had a different spirit compared to others, just as we have seen in recent lessons. Caleb’s faith would be rewarded and he would get to see the great blessing of the Lord.
For those that would ask about Joshua and whether or not he would get to enter into the Promised Land the answer to that question is that Joshua certainly did receive the blessing. In fact, as we learned in the last quarter of lessons, Joshua would lead the new generation of the children of Israel across the Jordan and into the land of Canaan. So, yes, the Lord is both faithful and just. God is certainly going to forgive those that seek His forgiveness. Yet, at the same time, those who reject Him, the Lord will also reject as well.TEKKEN 7: Originals Edition

More ideas: a fantastic readPictured: Dr. Deborah Money
When COVID-19 appeared in Canada in early 2020, public health officials looked to other countries’ experiences and knew one thing for sure – a time-sensitive, infectious disease informed response was critical to reduce transmission, mortality and negative impact. But with little data available, there was far more about this deadly virus that the healthcare sector did not know.
Once it became clear that COVID-19 was primarily a respiratory disease, obstetric alarm bells began ringing because pneumonia – also a respiratory disease – is the third leading cause of death in pregnant women. For healthcare practitioners, it’s troubling enough knowing that your patients are especially vulnerable to a highly contagious, potentially deadly disease. But the lack of empirical data meant that obstetricians had nowhere to turn to for guidance on treatment or protocols to keep their patients healthy and safe.
Dr. Deborah Money, Professor, Dept. of Obstetrics + Gynecology, Medicine + SPPH and a world-renowned clinician scientist from the Women’s Health Research Institute, immediately identified this knowledge gap as a critical problem – not only for her patients in British Columbia, but the world over.
Not one to be easily deterred, Dr. Money embraced the challenge and led the charge to fill in the gaps for her Canadian colleagues and the international obstetrics community. “I knew in my heart that if we didn’t pay attention to pregnant women at that time, nobody else was going to,” she recalled in an interview with the BC Women’s Health Foundation.
With iA Financial Group providing crucial seed funding, augmented by visionary and exemplary donor support, Dr. Money assembled a world-class research team, tasking them with creating a British Columbia surveillance program to fully understand COVID-19 in pregnancy. The trail-blazing project soon garnered national attention, receiving funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to create the CANCOVID-Preg Surveillance Project. CANCOVID brings together a Canadian network of reproductive infectious diseases experts, maternity care providers, public health officials, and researchers collecting data from all the provinces. The collaboration provides a robust, Canadian-centric picture of COVID-19 health outcomes for pregnant women that informs public health leadership and recommendations. Most significantly, in May 2021, the findings led public health authorities across Canada to prioritize pregnant women for COVID-19 vaccination, saving the lives of multiple mothers and newborns.
“The support from visionary donors and the BC Women’s Health Foundation early on in this project was instrumental in the successful launch of the pan-Canadian team and allowed us to leverage this funding to gain a total of $1.6 M from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) and the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) to support this timely, relevant work to understand the impact of the pandemic on pregnancy and infants.” – Dr. Deborah Money, Canadian Surveillance of COVID-19 in Pregnancy

Great great posts in here so far. Hope this thread maintains an even paced trickle of interesting tracks over time. I want to understand why this genre is so poo-pooed.
In one interview he said he’s inspired by ambient and dub techno but yea it’s more deep, ambient, hypnotic techno(italian, northen techno). I dont’t have dub techno feeling but love his tracks.
Whooaaa, that’s lovely.
I didn’t realize this genre was so pooh-poohed? I am a relatively recent newcomer to it and find that the blending of my favorite elements of dark-ish house and gritty Scientist dubs is just so fascinating.
Can’t believe RDJ as caustic window has a dub entry! How did I miss this?
1990! might sound less unusual referenced amongst all the derivatives that came after, but one of the first, most out there, primal and deepest. on a huge PA this ones vast.
I don’t know how unusual it is but I love how this track has that same vibe and slow progression without resorting to typical dub cliches.

I love both of these. It’s true that the West Mineral/Motion Ward catalogue is amazing. A new Pendant album just came out too.
One of my favs :
A little electro-ish which makes it appear detroit-ish in vibe
A little tech housy, but that just gives it some groove
More in the vein of your typical more ambient dub techno sound, but yet still atypical
Oscar Mulero has a more dark sound to his music, but I would still consider A track like this as dub techno
Lulu Rouge is a danish duo doing electronica with their past works having a clear dubby influence and a melancolic vibe to it. They’ve also worked with several great sounding vocalists
Helly Larson is sadly not with us anymore, and this is a tribute remix by Nadja Lind. I’m guessing that the very interesting breaky part starting after the middle part is hers

It’s certainly nothing new as far as PR goes, having first been introduced in 2006 by the good folk at Shift Communications via their PR-Sqared blog. Yet despite the two year lead time, the social media press release still hasn’t taken off in any major way.
One of the main reasons (in my opinion) is that there is too much conflicting information about the format, which leaves potential users unsure whether or not it offers any benefits. Which is a shame, since used properly the social media press release can be a vital part of any promotional campaign.
What is the Social Media Press Release?
At its heart, the format is simply a new spin on the more traditional press release. The main difference is how it uses the burgeoning social media networks and applications. Compared to a “static” press release, a social media one offers:
- Video and images
- Audio
- RSS feeds
- Social network sharing options to the likes of Friendfeed, Technorati, Twitter and more
Because of these types of features, social media press releases offer a much easier way for news to be digested through online feeds. This includes bloggers, who are becoming an ever more important source of breaking news – something that the PR and news industries need to accept more readily.
By interacting with a larger online audience (including bloggers), the chances of a news story being picked up by a large and targeted audience are increased. And for anyone still unsure about the power of bloggers, just look at the Associated Press debacle from a few months back, or the very recent BackUp Shotgun Rack controversy. So why the slow acceptance of the new release format?
Using Social Media and PR Effectively
One of the biggest reasons for the (currently) low uptake of the social media press release is that both businesses and PR professionals don’t understand the synergy between the new and existing press release formats.
With social media being such a buzz word, many companies are making the mistake that all they need is an online presence coupled with PR and everything will be just fine. PR agencies that have failed (or refused) to understand this new medium properly are also misinforming clients about what a social media PR campaign entails.
A social media press release will not form the one-cap-fits-all pitch of a proper PR campaign. Nor will it act as an easy way to increase your SEO visibility – a common mistake made when it comes to explaining what a social media press release can do.
Instead, this new press release format should be used as an excellent and complementary addition to a PR campaign – one which includes a traditional or search engine optimized press release distributed via online newswires. In effect, it should be used to build or enhance your brand via the tools offered by social media, with a more traditional PR campaign running alongside it.
Let’s Talk!
There’s a great debate going on over at the Hubspot marketing blog regarding the whole social media press release angle, and includes some interesting points of view from both detractors and supporters. These include Todd Defren, who came up with the first social media news release template, as well as Jason Kintzler, founder of Pitch Engine, a new website offering social media newsrooms and the option to create a free social media press release. It’s worth checking out.
Whatever your take is, whether you’re for or against, there’s no doubting that the social media press release offers a new spin for getting news out to relevant parties. While I’m most definitely in the “For” camp, I can also see why there is lingering doubt about its effectiveness. This is where it’s up to the founders and supporters of the format to show just why it can be so effective.
To do this, there needs to be a uniformed message – only then will understanding lead to acceptance.

Olive Lutheran Church, Hickory (2780 N. Center Street, Hickory). Speaker for the program is Mr. Kim Harris, Executive Director, Brookdale Hickory, Northeast.
Despite all the commercials for medical interventions, creams, “potions,” pills and surgeries, no one has figured out how to truly stop the clock. We age. And, these days, more of us are living longer. While those of us who are younger really can’t know what it’s like to be in our 80’s, 90’s or beyond, the April ACAP Hickory will offer an opportunity to experience aging. The goal of the program is to allow attendees to experience the limitations and challenges that often accompany aging so we may better understand what our loved ones experience, be more effective caregivers and advocates, and begin to prepare for our own elderhood.
Mr. Kim Harris, Executive Director of Brookdale Hickory, Northeast, will discuss typical challenges of elderhood and help attendees experience physical aspects of aging through a series of exercises that will simulate limited flexibility and feeling in hands, often experienced with arthritis; vision issues, from presbyopia to macular degeneration, cataract, diabetic eye disease and glaucoma; hearing loss as a result of years of loud noises and, sometimes, disease; and losing sense of smell and taste, a result of olfactory function decline and/or taste disorders that can affect an elder’s eating and nutrition as well as cause safety concerns when combined with vision limitations.
We hope you will join us! To register for this FREE program, please contact us at fhall@ACAPcommunity.org or, toll-free, 1-877-599-ACAP (2227)..

Given the abundance and variety of political scandals in the state, it’s hard to disagree..
Still, it’s hard to find empirical data that confirm Illinois as the king of crookedness. The U.S. Department of Justice tracks federal corruption convictions through its Public Integrity Section. Examinations of department data from several recent ten-year periods show that Illinois has mostly ranked among the top ten states in federal corruption convictions per capita, though two years ago it fell to an almost respectable 18th—which may demonstrate the limitations of such studies. In any case, these tallies reflect only the subset of wrongdoers cloddish enough to have gotten caught. And the cohort of crooks is merely the tip of the viceberg, so to speak, in a state where pitifully weak campaign finance and ethics laws are so easy to game legally. Considering the totality of government chicanery in Illinois—from the illegal to the merely questionable—the political consultant Don Rose concludes, “It’s fair to say we’re among two or three states that would vie for the honor [of most corrupt].”
But if that’s true, how did Illinois and Chicago get so good at being so bad? And why is the local political culture so slimy compared with, say, Wisconsin’s or Iowa’s? To find out, I consulted 20 or so historians, good-government advocates, and longtime political observers and insiders. Explaining why so many fools rush in to city, county, and state government in Illinois—and then never seem to leave unless led away in handcuffs—is “like finding the cure to the common cold,” says Cindi Canary, director of the Illinois Campaign for Political Reform. “It’s impossible to point to a definitive answer.” Nonetheless, she and other followers of the local political scene gamely offered some astute theories.
Old habits die hard.
About 180 years ago, a real-estate boom blossomed on the flat, marshy terrain at the mouth of the Chicago River, attracting speculators and hustlers seeking their fortunes. “Chicago got its start in the 1830s by people buying and selling land titles in a swamp,” says James Merriner, former political editor of the Chicago Sun-Times and author of several books on Illinois politics, including Grafters and Goo Goos, which chronicles Chicago’s history of corruption and reform. “So it was get rich quick, the ethos of the fast buck. That was the founding of Chicago and urban Illinois, and it has stayed with us.”
That spirit of unrestrained self-interest expressed itself in a particular kind of politician, one who saw government not as a noble calling but as an opportunity for advancement and enrichment. Politics was “a vocation, a business, a way to get ahead,” says Kent Redfield, a political science professor at the University of Illinois at Springfield. Instead of serving the public interest, government was “about power and control, personal advantage and personal gain.”
As Chicago grew in the 19th century and the boodle began to flow, opportunities for politicians to line their pockets multiplied. The city’s first corruption trial took place in 1869, resulting in jail sentences for four officials. Chicago gave the world the outlandishly corrupt First Ward aldermen “Bathhouse” John Coughlin and Michael “Hinky Dink” Kenna—who controlled police, zoning, and vice in their ward from the end of the 19th century to well into the next—and scores of other less colorful but still crooked characters.
Over time, the blurry line between public responsibility and private interest gained cultural acceptance, says Larry Bennett, a political science professor at DePaul University. The latest poster boy for that ethical ambiguity is Blagojevich, who seemingly saw the chance to auction off a U.S. Senate seat (for campaign cash or jobs for him and his wife) as a “[bleeping] golden” opportunity. “He just couldn’t get it through his head that there was a difference between advancing Rod and advancing the public good,” Bennett says. “He was just going about his business in the classic political way here, and at one time in Illinois, everyone bought into that.”
That’s where the money was.
Though greed is essential to a corrupt political system, it requires the nourishment of opportunity to thrive. And 19th-century Chicago, with its breakneck economic growth and bountiful vice, was a rich environment for ambitious opportunists. As the city boomed into a colossus that dominated Illinois, its political culture spread though the state. “The Chicago way became the Illinois way,” says Merriner.
Perhaps it’s no coincidence that other Midwestern states with agrarian economies and without big, booming industrial cities—think Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Iowa—developed governments that today are considered cleaner and more open than that of Illinois. “If you’re out on a farm, there isn’t all that much to be corrupt about,” says Gary MacDougal, a former corporate chief executive and a past chairman of the Illinois Republican Party. “You’re not looking for sewers and garbage pickup or inspections to get your liquor license or zoning changes to build a high-rise. If you look at the political activity in a big city, particularly one like Chicago, compared to the political activity in a farm state, there are far more opportunities for moderately paid state and city employees to control or affect large amounts of money. It’s that dynamic that creates corruption.”
While much of Illinois may have had more in common with Iowa than with Chicago, even areas downstate had what Redfield calls “a high-stakes economic culture.” There were private fortunes to be made—not to mention public jobs and contracts to hand out—building railroads, canals, bridges, and other projects. “This is a state where there’s been stuff to fight about,” Redfield says, which is why “there was a lot of corruption back in the economic development of Illinois. There were opportunities for the private sector to get advantages from government and for government to leverage its power.”
We ain’t ever been ready for reform.
From the post–Civil War era through the first few decades of the 20th century, a “criminal-political alliance” operated in many big cities in the United States, says Don Rose. In places like Chicago, he points out, “it was very hard to tell the politicians from the real crooks. You go back far enough, and it was the aldermen who ran all the vice in the city.”
In the late 19th century, that criminal-political alliance helped fuel the rise of political party machines. “The machine got money from gambling and prostitution that funded elections,” says Robert Lombardo, an assistant professor of criminal justice at Loyola University. Machines proved highly effective at getting out the vote on election day by rewarding supporters with patronage jobs and other spoils.
But in some cities, reform movements stirred to fight for more open and honest government. In states such as Wisconsin and Minnesota, progressive reformers won broad public support for laws that weakened political party machines. In Chicago, though, reformers never gained much traction—perhaps in part because of the city’s large population of immigrants, says Simpson. As waves of Irish, German, Jewish, and other immigrants arrived, the machine helped them find housing and jobs, favors that the grateful new citizens repaid at the ballot box.
Blame it on Scarface.
One reason Chicago may have resisted reform was that the Mob developed a greater presence here than elsewhere in the Midwest. Wayne Steger, who teaches political science at DePaul, speculates that organized crime created a “threat mechanism” that deterred reformers from pushing for changes that would have undercut the patronage system and the crooked politicians with ties to gangsters.
“Chicago boosters hate it when anyone mentions the name Al Capone,” says James Merriner. “[The Mob] was the disease of the 1920s, but we’ve never completely cured ourselves of that combination of organized crime and local government.”
“The Capone syndicate became the intermediaries between City Hall and the underworld,” says Lombardo. “That money [from organized crime] was used to fund the Cook County Democratic Party all the way up to the time of Richard J. Daley, [who] did not cooperate at all with the Mob, though he didn’t move against it, either.”
The Boss ruled.
By the end of World War II, most big-city machines were fading away or had already vanished, thanks to “reform movements backed by the business communities of those towns,” says Rose. “This never happened in Chicago.” Perhaps the key to the machine’s longevity in Chicago and Cook County was the political “genius” of Richard J. Daley, says Merriner. Daley, first elected in 1955, wanted to be remembered as a builder. O’Hare Airport, the Dan Ryan Expressway, and the University of Illinois at Chicago were just some of the major public-works projects built during his long reign. “Public works mean the construction trades get work, obviously, but also the bond lawyers, the underwriters,” says Merriner. “Everybody’s happy.” With so much money to be made, the business establishment had little motivation to push back against the corruption that kept the Democratic machine greased and running.
Divided we stood.
There may have been more to the corporate alliance with Daley than just contracts. During the fifties and sixties, thousands of blacks were moving from the South to Chicago and other big cities in the North. Members of the business establishment knew racial migration was transforming the city, and they feared the repercussions. They had an understanding with Daley that he would “do something about controlling the tide of the black population,” says Rose. “They were trying to keep the city white and keep the blacks away from downtown.” Daley, he says, “used city planning as a tool to stem the flow and protect downtown. That was the basis of the alliance between business and politics and the corruption that came with it.”
Rose theorizes that a similar “unspoken bargain between the machine and its constituencies” kept reform at bay under Richard M. Daley after he became mayor in 1989. Before he was elected, the city had endured the tumultuous and racially charged Council Wars during the tenure of Harold Washington, the city’s first African American mayor. Rose says there was little pressure for the younger Daley to clean up corruption because white voters saw him as a “bulwark” against the ascendancy of black political power in the city.
After the administration of Washington and of his successor, Eugene Sawyer, there was a view among whites that “racial divisiveness was destroying the city, that we needed to get back to stability,” says Laura Washington, a columnist for the Chicago Sun-Times. “And stability meant a white mayor who was going to make sure that the interests of ethnic whites were protected.” To Daley’s credit, says Rose, he turned out to be an inclusive mayor, under whose leadership racial and ethnic tensions ebbed.
The machine retooled.
Corruption continued to thrive locally, in part because the Democratic machine proved remarkably adaptable. “The constituents of the machine have changed,” says Merriner. “It used to be city and county payrollers and organized labor.” But the Shakman decrees curbed patronage, and the nature of politics changed. Being able to field a large army of precinct workers to get out the vote became less important than funding political campaigns to get out the message. “If you look at the contributors to Richard M. Daley, it’s lawyers and accountants and developers,” says Merriner. “They are the undergirders of the machine.”
Of course, most generous donors don’t give merely out of purity of heart. “Those large sums of money from all kinds of special interests—they’re invested for a purpose,” says Adlai Stevenson III, the former U.S. senator and two-time unsuccessful candidate for governor of Illinois. “Who’s going to invest in an honest politician?” Many donors expect to be rewarded with lucrative contracts, changes in policies that favor their interests, or other politically directed largesse. Until last year, Illinois was one of just a handful of states with almost no limits on campaign contributions, creating “tremendous potential for legalized bribery,” says Steger. Critics of the campaign finance reform passed last year by the General Assembly say Illinois remains the Wild West of campaign finance.
It’s all in the family.
The Daleys are the most visible example of another characteristic of local government: It’s a family business (with friends welcome, too). Just as the Flying Wallendas have their high wire, the Daleys have their government positions—as do the Strogers and the Madigans and the Hyneses. But it’s not just the dynasties for which public office has become a birthright. “I’m talking about the people whose grandfathers were precinct captains, and now they’re precinct captains,” says Dominic Pacyga, a political science professor at Columbia College. “The father worked for the waterworks; now his kids work for the waterworks; and his grandchildren are getting ready to work for the waterworks—or the fire department or the police department. So you get these families that have controlled large swaths of the city for a long time. It reaches way down deep into the political system, and it maintains itself. When you’re in power for so long, the downside of this autocracy is corruption and a system that begins to fail the people.”
Complexity is the devil’s handiwork..”
The target is soft.
Money seems to be at the root of almost every public corruption scandal that bursts into the news. And despite some minor tweaks to campaign finance and ethics laws, Illinois remains a place where campaign contributions can serve as legal graft and politicians still operate brazenly under troubling conflicts of interest. Despite the incremental ethics reforms, “we [still] have very, very weak to nonexistent disclosure and conflict-of-interest laws,” says Don Rose. And the resulting clouted contracts and conflicts of interest “would be called corruption by most definitions, except that it’s quite legal here,” he adds. Meanwhile, state and local prosecutors continue to lack important tools that their counterparts in most other states have, including the ability to deploy hidden listening devices in corruption investigations.
In short, the system allows wide latitude for misbehavior and misconduct with little threat of accountability. “If you’re a burglar and there’s a fancy house with its door wide open and nobody is around, it’s a lot easier [to rob it] than if there’s a security fence and bars on the window,” says Gary MacDougal. Think of Illinois as that vulnerable house—its doors ajar and no one keeping watch over the loot.
The hen house is guarded—by wolves.
Where are the public servants leading the charge to tighten this loose and leaky system? If such leaders exist, their voices are muffled. In Illinois, a handful of autocrats wield enormous power and brook little dissent. “States with strong political party organizations—like Illinois, New Jersey, and New York—have long resisted political reforms that would create transparency and limit the power of incumbents to get reelected,” says DePaul’s Steger.
When he wasn’t bulldozing Meigs Field, Mayor Daley was routinely steamrolling the Chicago City Council. And Mike Madigan, the longtime speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives, has exerted an iron grip on the state Democratic Party and legislative process. Under the state’s legislative rules, no bill can make it to the floor of the House without the speaker’s OK or to the floor of the Senate without approval from that chamber’s president. This centralized authority “enables party leaders to reward loyalists and penalize dissidents,” Steger says, adding that it also allows party leaders to “have a veto over any reforms that might weaken the party control over government.”
Scandal? What scandal?
When public corruption does get exposed—typically by investigative journalists or federal prosecutors—the response in Illinois tends to be tepid rather than aggressive. Several years ago, for example, Mike Tristano, then the chief of staff to the Illinois House Republican leader Lee Daniels, was indicted for illegally using legislative staffers for campaign work on the taxpayers’ dime. He wound up being sent to prison for a time, and that was the end of the episode. In Wisconsin, when a similar, albeit milder, scandal erupted involving the use of state resources for party leaders’ political activities, “the response of the Wisconsin legislature was to dramatically reduce the resources available to the legislative leaders—to really make an institutional change,” says Redfield. “In Illinois, we tend to get change when there’s scandal, but the negotiations aren’t about ‘How can we do the right thing?’ They’re about ‘What is the minimal response to make this thing go away?’”
You can’t fight the power.
OK, so the laws stink, and leaders regularly betray the public trust. Don’t the people themselves have a say? After all, when citizens in many other states don’t like a law, they can change it through a ballot initiative; and when people don’t like how their leaders are behaving, some states have a process for recall by voters.
Illinois does allow ballot initiatives, though the law is written so narrowly that “it’s very hard for citizens to exert control over the government,” says John Tillman, chief executive of the Illinois Policy Institute, a nonpartisan group that supports free-market principles. The same is true of recall efforts. On November 2nd, Illinois voters considered whether to amend the state constitution to allow for the recall of a governor. And though this magazine went to press before the results were known, the outcome hardly mattered—the amendment’s various requirements were so onerous that recall “wouldn’t actually work,” Tillman says. “It’s a great illustration of how they claim reform but it isn’t really reform.”
Incumbency is next to godliness.
Even if recall won’t work, don’t citizens still have the ultimate doomsday device for throwing the bums out—their vote on election day? Technically, yes, but the entrenched powers have tried valiantly to stifle competition and render that vote meaningless.
One way incumbents stack the odds in their favor is by designing legislative districts to produce the electoral results that they—not the voters—desire. Much ink has been spilled on the ludicrousness of Illinois’s redistricting process. If representatives from the two parties can’t agree on legislative boundaries when it’s time to redraw them, they resort to a “tiebreaker”—pulling a name out of a hat to determine which party gets sole power to design the new map. Lawmakers from the winning side have not seemed terribly interested in promoting competitive races, employing cartographic artifice to create districts with grotesque bulges connected by narrow, snaking corridors—usually assuring the outcome of races before the first vote is cast. Under the current legislative map, drawn in 2001, 45 percent of House and Senate races have been uncontested (not including this year’s November 2nd elections), according to CHANGE Illinois!, a coalition advocating political reforms. And in contested races over the past ten years, incumbents have won 98 percent of the time.
The voters consent.
It’s easy to fault public servants and criticize unsound laws, but ultimately the local political culture “comes down to what the voters will put up with,” says James Merriner. Over the years, Illinois voters have shown themselves to be a tolerant lot, viewing corruption as the grease that helps get things done. “It’s worked well enough for most of the people,” says Cindi Canary. “It’s been seen as the price you pay for relatively efficient government.”
That attitude has prevailed for so long, “it’s gotten built into the DNA,” says Patrick Collins, chairman of the Illinois Reform Commission and a former assistant U.S. attorney who led the prosecution in the corruption trial of the former governor George Ryan (now in prison). “We don’t push back and fight, so we get what we get.” Public corruption in Illinois “has gone on for generations, and people don’t think anything about it,” says Larry Bennett. “So it becomes common practice, no longer subject to ethical scrutiny.”
Indeed, some people treat the crookedness of local politics as a badge of honor—a perverse form of Chicago (or Illinois) exceptionalism. “In a masochistic sort of way, we’re proud of it,” says Adlai Stevenson III.
The same media that expose corruption as a wrong also celebrate it as spectacle. Patrick Collins remembers one day when Rod Blagojevich appeared in court seeking permission to travel to Costa Rica to appear on a TV reality show. “There was a gaggle of media outside the courtroom—more so than I had seen for any George Ryan [court appearance],” he recalls. Around that same time, Collins says, he and other members of the Illinois Reform Commission went to Springfield to present the commission’s proposals for cleaning up government. “I don’t think we had one TV camera down there,” he says.
Collins laments what he calls “the Sopranoization of corruption,” referring to the TV series about a New Jersey mobster. “Tony Soprano is very entertaining, and I used to love watching The Sopranos. But I’d have to check myself: Wait—this guy just beat somebody with a baseball bat. . . . We love the character and colorfulness of some of our crooks. It makes this stuff fun and interesting.”
With round two of the Blagojevich trial approaching, Collins fears its effect on a weary and jaded public: “If anything, people will say, ‘They’re all crooks. I don’t want any part of these guys.’ There is a sense that you can’t beat city hall. There’s apathy, a checkout from the system, and that’s the part that concerns me most.”
Is it possible that we have finally had enough—that the political slapstick isn’t so amusing anymore? There’s certainly nothing funny about the cost of corruption. Dick Simpson estimates that the “corruption tax” borne by taxpayers in Chicago and Illinois comes to a staggering $500 million a year, based on estimates of the costs of major scandals and the inflation in the cost of government caused by all those redundant payrollers and juicy contracts given to political cronies and campaign contributors.
There’s no shortage of ideas and proposals on ways to make state and local government more ethical, accountable, and transparent. All that’s missing is a mandate from the people to make it happen. Even then, reform wouldn’t come easily—or quickly. Simpson estimates the process could take 10 to 20 years.
But Don Rose sees glimmers that at least suggest conditions are ripening. For one thing, he says, race has ceased to be the major factor in city politics that it was when Daley was first elected. “There’s no counterforce to a citizen movement for reform the way race was for much of the last century,” he says. “When you remove race from the bargain, there’s a lot clearer thinking, and people begin to understand the corruption tax.”
As racial tensions have eased, voter anger has risen—witness Daley’s plunging approval ratings in Chicago, to a lowly 35 percent after his parking meter fiasco. That anger, Rose says, “might not have translated into an election defeat [if Daley had run for office again] next year, but it said that people were fed up. Who knows what we’re going to see if we get a different kind of city council and a different kind of mayor? I’m not saying at the moment that things are getting better. But things can get better. I see more hope now than I would have ten years ago.”

Re-polishing of existing pieces to improveKatherine Saunders loved Christmas. She wrote this article in 2018 as Publication Specialist of Guide to the Good. Her passing in 2020 leaves an empty space where joy once lived. But the ideas she shared in this article, and the delight she brought to everyday live on in her work and our memories.
by Katherine Saunders
A few weeks ago, I made my list of people to shop for this Christmas. I made a neat little checklist on my phone. I jotted down notes about potential gift ideas next to some names. When I finished, I opened Facebook to see what my friends were up to. And that’s when I saw the ‘The Ethical Hierarchy of Gift Purchasing’ graphic, shared by my friend Katie. This got me immediately going back to my Christmas shopping list to see how I could incorporate some of these concepts.
Being a guide to the good-er, I am already aware of shopping local and reducing waste. In my own life, I have been striving to cut down on the amount of possessions that I have that I do not need. This is not to say that I eschew the very thought of the big-box commercial Christmas. I did end up in Best Buy and on Amazon to purchase gifts for my fiancé. But I did consider the Ethical Hierarchy to see how it could fit for the other people on my list. And I found some benefits.
This year when I began my listmaking, I found myself thinking that half of the people on my list have everything they need and would have little use for more ‘things’. Take our good friend Bobby Bessey’s Nana from the video we shared for #seasonsgroundings the other day. The top two tiers of memories and time would have been perfect for her. One thing Katie mentioned that is not on this list, but would probably be at about the same levels as giving memories, was donating to charity on behalf of someone as a gift to them. I ended up using that idea – Unicef has a site where you can buy Survival gifts, and there are lots of local organizations that could use the boost at this time of year. This worked well for me for the people in my life that have little need or room for more things.
There are a couple of things that I was surprised to find were not on this list. One of them, as mentioned by my friend Katie, and highly supported by guide to the good, is shopping local. Again the idea that buying from within the community can often build stronger local connections. Another thing that I would add is giving consumable goods, which minimize waste. This could mean giving food and drink. I also often give bath bombs, which disappear once they are used. And while I get that it could still end up with the recipient accumulating more possessions, I would put a higher value on handmade items. To me, that is the same as giving your time; using your skills to create something for the person to enjoy. There is something special about receiving something made by someone you love.
In some ways, this graphic could come across as a bit of an “easier said than done” sort of situation. Not everybody has the skills to restore old furniture, for example. People have to balance desire within the means of time, finances, and capacity. This graphic is by no means a rulebook for Christmas. I simply saw this in the midst of my own whirlwind of Christmas gift planning, and found that I kept thinking about it as I scrolled through the next news stories in my feed. It helped me decide on some ways I could adjust my purchasing decisions for this year to better benefit the recipients, the planet, and ultimately, myself. And it gave me some alternatives just as my new gift ideas were starting to run out.

LEADERS
President: Kais Saied
Retired law professor Kais Saied won a landslide victory over media mogul Nabil Karoui in the October 2019 presidential election run-off.
Mr Saied, who was 61 when elected, campaigned on an anti-corruption platform, and appealed directly to young voters.
He has faced considerable criticism for his conservative views on homosexuality, women's rights and capital punishment, which was suspended in 1994.
The previous president, Beji Caid Essebsi, died in office in July, after winning the country's first free presidential election in December 2014.
Prime Minister: Hichem Mechichi
Parliament approved a new government led by Hichem Mechichi in September 2020, the third administration since elections the previous October.
Mr Mechichi's ministers are technocrats free of affiliation to political parties, tasked with reforming public finances at a time of economic crisis and political instability.
The new prime minister, a lawyer by training, served as interior minister in the outgoing government.".European Commission vice-president Maroš Šefčovič urged Britain on Sunday (21 November) to make a “big move” to break months of deadlock over post-Brexit arrangements in Northern Ireland that has threatened a trade war.
Šefčovič is set to meet UK Brexit minister David Frost in London on Friday for further negotiations, after talks broke up Friday with Britain saying there was “potential for momentum”.
But the UK has hinted it may still trigger a suspension clause in the so-called Northern Ireland protocol, which could spark a damaging trade war and dramatic unravelling in post-Brexit relations.
Brussels has repeatedly warned of “serious consequences” from such a move, suggesting the separate Brexit trade and cooperation deal could be pulled and tariffs imposed.
Months of talks, proposals and counter-proposals have failed to break the impasse, with Britain demanding the protocol is overhauled while the EU has insisted more modest changes offered in the summer can suffice.
“I hope that (the) UK will also now make the big move towards us because we really made far reaching proposals and put them on the table,” Šefčovič told the BBC.
“I’m sure that if Lord Frost and (the) UK would double their efforts and come to meet (us) halfway, we can resolve all the outstanding issues to the satisfaction of the people of Northern Ireland.”
‘Fix the problem’
Agreeing trading arrangements in Northern Ireland, which endured three decades of violence over British rule before a landmark peace deal in 1998, has proved thorny throughout the Brexit process.
The protocol mandates checks on goods heading into the UK province from mainland Great Britain — England, Scotland and Wales — at the internal Irish Sea border.
It was designed to prevent checks on goods heading into the European single market at the border with EU member Ireland, as an open frontier there was a key part of the 1998 peace agreement.
The UK says the protocol is unworkable, while there has been unrest from hardline unionists in Northern Ireland who say it cuts them off from the rest of Britain.
The EU has offered to cut checks on a range of goods heading to Northern Ireland but draws the line at a UK proposal to scrap European judicial oversight on disputes.
Writing in the Mail on Sunday newspaper, Frost said the current problems with the protocol “go to the heart of our territorial integrity, of what it means to be one country and one market”.
“I still hope the EU can show the ambition needed to fix the problem by agreement,” he added.
“If they can’t, of course we will have to safeguard our position in other ways.”Local Weather Resources

ALBANY, N.Y. - Members of New York's ethics commission voted overwhelmingly to rescind approval of former Gov. Andrew Cuomo's $5.1 million book deal Tuesday.
The committee's vote comes over a year since the October 2020 publication of Cuomo's book "American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic," which largely recounts the governor's once-daily press conferences last spring.
The former governor, who resigned in August amid findings he sexually harassed at least 11 women, is also facing scrutiny over the book deal from state Attorney General Letitia James, federal prosecutors and the state Assembly's Judiciary Committee, which is expected to soon release findings from a wide-ranging investigation of Cuomo's alleged abuses of power.
The staff of the New York ethics commission granted approval of Cuomo's deal in July 2020, when his special counsel Judith Mogul told the commission that Cuomo would not use any state personnel or resources to produce his book and that he would write it "entirely on his own time."
But Cuomo has since acknowledged that state employees helped with tasks including editing the manuscript. He's claimed that those employees were "volunteering."

That revelation led to members of the ethics commission voting 12-1 Tuesday to rescind because of Mogul's misstatements about Cuomo's book deal.
Republican Commissioner David McNamara said state property, resources and personnel were used to prepare, write, edit and publish the book "contrary to the representations" made on Cuomo's behalf.
RELATED: Cuomo's book deal under new scrutiny
And several ethics commissioners have said members of the commission should have reviewed Mogul's letter and voted on Cuomo's book deal, rather than commission staff.
Tuesday's vote means Cuomo will have to apply again for approval for his book deal.
McNamara and other commissioners have said they want to claw back at least some of Cuomo's book deal proceeds.
It's unclear whether the state could go after all the proceeds: Cuomo netted $1.5 million on the book last year, and donated $500,000 to the United Way of New York State and the rest into a trust for his three daughters.
RELATED: Cuomo set to earn $5 million from pandemic leadership book
Violations of the state's public officers law can lead to up to $10,000 fines and the value of any "compensation or benefit received as a result of such violation."
Cuomo's spokesperson Richard Azzopardi called the commission's vote politically motivated, and said elected officials often use staff for political and personal assistance. (See full statement below.)
Attorney Jim McGuire, who's representing Cuomo over allegations surrounding the book deal, said Cuomo will fight in court to prevent the ethics commission from enforcing its decision.
FOX 5 NY's Linda Schmidt interviewed Bill Hammond, a senior fellow with the Empire Center for Public Policy, an independent nonprofit think tank in Albany.
"It's OK that you write this book provided you don't use any state resources — meaning materials, supplies or employees and, of course, he used all of those things," Hammond said. "If they attempt to come after him for that money, there's going to be a legal fight. There's just no question in my mind."
Hammond said it is unclear if the state is entitled to the money or if Cuomo would possibly have to return the money to the book publisher.
"It's symbolic of how far the image of the former governor has changed," he said.
Statement from Rich Azzopardi, Spokesman for Andrew Cuomo
"These JCOPE members are acting outside the scope of their authority and are carrying the water of the politicians who appointed them. It is the height of hypocrisy for 'no government resources' would be used — consistent with that representation, people who volunteered on this project did so on their own time. Furthermore, the Governor cannot be held responsible for internal decisions over recusals and approvals made by JCOPE.
"They truly are a J-JOKE."

Approximately 85% of individuals will experience acne during their lifetime, most often during adolescence. (13) However, scientific literature reports that a growing number of adult females are affected by acne beyond adolescence. (3) One factor that commonly contributes to acne in women is an imbalance of hormones, particularly with androgens. (13)
Hormonal acne is more than just a cosmetic issue, as it may lead to psychological distress and be a sign of underlying endocrine (hormonal) disorders. (13) In this article, you’ll learn about hormonal acne causes and how to fix hormonal acne.
What is hormonal acne?
Acne vulgaris is an inflammatory condition that affects pilosebaceous units, which are found throughout the body and consist of a sebaceous (oil) gland and hair follicle. (8)(12) The skin condition is characterized by lesions, commonly referred to as zits or pimples, and possible scarring. (8)(13) Lesions commonly occur on the face, neck, shoulders, chest, and back. (8)
One of the causes of acne vulgaris is an increase in certain hormones known as androgens. (6) Androgen hormones increase the sebaceous glands’ secretion of sebum, an oily substance. (12) A healthy pilosebaceous unit will release the sebum through the skin’s follicle opening (pore) onto the skin surface. (8)
However, in the case of acne, increased sebum and certain skin cells called keratinocytes may block the skin’s pore, allowinge microbes to grow. Blocked follicles may burst and release pro-inflammatory chemicals, which stimulate inflammation of the skin. The sebum, skin cells, and microbes that are released, including Cutibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Malassezia furfur, contribute to this inflammatory process, resulting in the acne lesions. (8)(12)
Hormonal acne vs regular acne
It’s important to understand that various processes can cause acne. (13) Hormonal acne occurs as a result of androgen hormones that increase the production and secretion of sebum. (6)(13) The androgen hormones involved in sebum production and acne development include testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and androstenedione. (4)
In women, certain changes can increase the proportion of androgenic hormones in relation to estradiol (estrogen). For example, premenstrual, pregnancy, and perimenopausal changes are often associated with acne aggravation. (3)
Other processes that contribute to acne include:
- Complex mechanisms that involve the immune system (13)
- Irregular increase of keratinocyte cells and change in keratinization (a function of these cells) (6)(13)
- Overgrowth of Cutibacterium acnes bacteria (also referred to as Propionibacterium acnes) (6)(13)
Did you know?
It’s estimated that acne affects up to 50 million people in the U.S. annually. (6)
Male hormonal acne
According to research, adult women are more commonly affected by acne than men of all ages. (3) Androgen hormones may play a greater role in acne development seen in women, however, males can still experience hormonal acne. (11)
One study assessed the levels of various hormones in both men and women with acne compared to a control group without acne. The findings demonstrated that the female acne group had elevated levels of testosterone, DHEA, and cortisol, along with decreased estrogen. Males with acne had elevated cortisol levels, without differences in other hormones compared to the control group. (11) This suggests that cortisol commonly referred to as the “stress hormone”, may play a role in male hormonal acne.
What causes hormonal acne?
Hormonal acne causes may include:
- Certain health conditions (e.g., polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), hyperandrogenism) (12)(13)
- Hormonal changes (e.g., puberty, premenstrual period, pregnancy, perimenopausal period) (3)(12)
- Hormonal therapies (e.g., oral contraceptives, anti-androgen medications) (13)
Certain factors may aggravate acne, including:
How to get rid of hormonal acne
If you struggle with it, you’ve likely tried to find out how to fight hormonal acne. Certain hormonal medications, such as oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), are a common treatment. However, they are limited to use in women and have been associated with certain health risks. (6) While you should always discuss treatment options with your healthcare provider, we’ve outlined some dietary and lifestyle approaches to consider for hormonal acne.
Hormonal acne diet
There are several dietary factors that may exacerbate acne. Foods with a high glycemic load and index are known to increase levels of insulin, a hormone that is responsible for transporting blood glucose (sugar) into cells to be used as energy. Higher insulin levels, in turn, increase the level of androgen hormones, contributing to sebum production and acne. (7) Similarly, dairy products contain insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), a compound that stimulates the production of androgens in the body. (7)
Limit these foods in your diet by reducing dairy products and high-glycemic foods, such as breads, breakfast cereals, rice, snack foods, and sugars. (2) You can also increase your consumption of foods that help hormonal acne, including:
- Certain grains (e.g., oats)
- Healthy fats (e.g., flax seeds, olive oil, sardines, tuna, walnuts)
- Meats and liver
- Yellow and green vegetables (e.g., bell peppers, broccoli, cabbage, lettuce, spinach, squash) (9)
These foods are generally low-glycemic and contain nutrients that may help prevent acne, such as vitamins A, E, zinc, and essential fatty acids, by providing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory support. (9)
Hormonal acne and stress
Managing stress may help to control acne. (12) Stress has been shown to increase the release of pro-inflammatory compounds and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which increase cortisol levels. (3)
Home remedies to treat hormonal non-comedogenic (won’t clog pores)
- Shampoo your hair frequently
- Shave gently, and reduce the frequency of shaving if possible
- Use a gentle skin cleanser and avoid rough scrub pads when washing your skin (8)
Natural supplements including antioxidant vitamins, omega-3, and zinc may improve acne.
Best supplements for acne
Consider the following dietary supplements, which have been researched for their effects on acne. If you’re a patient, speak with your integrative healthcare practitioner before trying any new supplements.
Antioxidant vitamins: vitamin A and E
Vitamin A and E are both fat-soluble antioxidant vitamins that can protect against free radical damage and the inflammatory process that contributes to acne. (9) Low blood levels of these nutrients have been found in individuals with acne when compared to control groups. (7)(9) Vitamin A and E supplementation may regulate keratinization, and research suggests these vitamins have a synergistic effect, meaning that they may be more effective when combined. (9)
Omega-3 fatty acids
One of the dietary factors that impact inflammation levels in the body is the ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids. Increasing your consumption of omega-3s can improve acne by inhibiting the synthesis of pro-inflammatory molecules known as cytokines and lowering levels of IGF-1. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), an omega-3 found in fish oil, may be particularly effective at inhibiting inflammatory processes. (7)
Zinc
One study that assessed serum levels of zinc in individuals with varying acne severity and healthy controls found that zinc levels may be associated with the type of lesions and the severity of acne. (10) Zinc supplementation has been used in a variety of skin conditions and has been found to improve mild to moderate acne when applied topically (on the skin), as well as moderate to severe acne when taken orally as zinc sulphate and zinc gluconate. (5)
The bottom line
Acne is a complex condition that has various underlying causes, including hormonal changes seen in hormonal acne. Certain lifestyle approaches and supplements such as vitamin A, vitamin E, omega-3 fatty acids, and zinc may improve acne. Work with your integrative healthcare practitioner to identify and address individual factors contributing to hormonal acne.

The Seamus McFerran Cup made its way to Magheragallon last night after Gaoth Dobhair’s epic 0-13 to 0-12 final win over Scotstown in Omagh. Gaoth Dobhair needed extra time to see off the Monaghan champions.
“Youth and young energy,” was McGee’s response when asked what got his men over the line.
“They just kept going. I was blowing black smoke, but they kept going. They’re good footballers too.”
Having won a first Donegal SFC in 12 years in October, Gaoth Dobhair have now gone to new heights.
McGee said: “It’s a big day for the Gaoth Dobhair. I’m just a happy man.
“It’s nice to see a bit of reward.
“It’s a bit surreal. Ulster finals were never on our radar.’

And now, it appears The Sandlot will continue to live on, as it is reportedly being turned into a TV series, according to Slash/Film.
The original director David Mickey Evans recently appeared on the Rain Delay podcast to deliver the news. As Slash/Film reports, “He has sold a pitch for a television series sequel to the original movie that will bring all the original cast members back.”
While he didn't reveal any more details, Evans did say that it has been picked up by a streaming service. It's unclear if this is related to a Sandlot prequel, which Deadline reported last August was in development at 20th Century Fox. David Mickey Evans was also said to be working on that project. There were few details about it at the time, so it's possible the prequel has become this project.
It seems like the TV series would be a sequel, meaning we'd be checking in with the cast—Tom Guiry as Scotty Smalls, Mike Vitar as Benny Rodriguez, Patrick Renna as “Ham” Porter, Chauncey Leopardi as “Squints,” and Marty York as “Yeah-Yeah”—as adults.
As we know from the final scene of The Sandlot, the kids grow up to be pretty successful: Yeah Yeah developed bungie Jumping; Squints married Wendy Peppercorn and had nine kids; Ham became a professional wrestler named The Great Hambino; Benny "The Jet Rodriguez" went on to play for the Dodgers. And Smalls, well, he's a baseball announcer and still wore that stupid hat with the long brim.GENERAL INFORMATION:

The British Library holds (as a legal requirement) every published work in the UK. This includes all major maps produced by the Ordnance Survey and elsewhere, and anything published by HMSO.
What is held here
By legal requirement, anything ever commercially published has to be stored in the British Library. Consequently, they have an extensive collection of maps. Due to the destruction of the Ordnance Survey's archive facilities during World War II, they contain essential mapping information that is hard to find elsewhere. Access to the library is difficult, but rewarding.
How to use it
Come out of St Pancras or Euston station and follow signs. It's on the A501, but don't expect to be able to park anywhere.
Before you can access anything in the library, you must register for a reader's pass. The BL will give these out if they are reasonably sure you are looking for items that only they have, but you need to do your homework first! You cannot just turn up with some ID and expect to get in.
First, have a look at The British Library's online catalogue and make a note of the shelfmarks of items you want to have a look at.
Next, you need to pre-register for a reader's ticket. Follow the instructions, and print out the reader number that you are given with.
When you enter the BL, you'll be given a quick search by security. Reader's registration is upstairs to the Upper Ground floor and to the right. Give the clerk your printed out pre-registration form and complete the application using one of the available terminals. You'll be given a ticket number - when your number is called out, go to the desk where a clerk will give you a quick interview to check you really want to be here, and know what you're talking about, or whether you're just a confused numpty who thought you might be able to borrow the latest Mills & Boon and talk your way around not having a valid proof of address.
Ritchie turned up with the required ID, a printout of the pre-registration form and a list of shelfmarks, and got a pass almost immediately. Your mileage may vary.
Having obtained a pass, you will need to go to the locker room in the basement to drop off coats and bags. You are only allowed pencils, paper and clear plastic bags inside the BL - when you register for a pass, you'll be given a specific list of things you can't take in.
Facilities
The map room is on the third floor, and contains large tables for spreading out maps on, similar to the second floor in the National Archives. Once you're registered, you can wander up to a terminal and start ordering things. You need to add items to the reservation list first, which will check their availability, then you can click on "Request item" to get them.
The online catalogue is rather byzantine and unhelpful. Don't expect to be able to do nice searches like "MT photographs" that you can do in the National Archives that instantly retrieve potential treasures. Items take about 70 minutes to retrieve for storing, and you can only order 4 items at a time. However, you can at least reserve them the day before you visit. In fact, doing your homework before you go seems to be essential for visiting the BL.
The BL do not allow cameras at all, so don't pull out your iPhone and start snapping away.
There are a number of restaurants in the BL. Food is a bit nicer than the National Archives' cafe, but about twice as expensive.

We didn't get to see much of Arroyo during the regular season, as a swollen disk in his back limited him to a couple of appearances in the Cactus League. But he apparently got his work in while the team was away in Australia, and has pronounced himself fit and ready for the season, thereby continuing his long, ongoing streak of never having had to be put on the DL. That's kinda impressive, especially for a pitcher. I wonder what the modern record is? Anyway, we could certainly do with Arroyo delivering a similar kind of performance as the Giants' crafty veteran signing, Tim Hudson, did last night - as mentioned in the GDT, their costs were comparable.
Line-up reverts a bit, with Pollock and Owings returning at the bottom of the order, after having a night off yesterday. With it being a day game after a night game, no surprise that it gives Gosewisch his first start of the season, in place of Miguel Montero. Probably helps that Miggy has struggled against Timmeh in the past with a career line of .182/.224/.255. That's in a hefty 58 PAs too - he'll likely overtake Troy Tulowitzki (59 PA) this afternoon as the player with most experience against Lincecum. Oddly, though it's a day game, it's still the last NL action today. Indeed, could be that everything will be finished by the time ours gets under way, as the other games are all far East of us.
soco on his first recap of the year. At least it's a day game, so the new father will be able to get an early night. :)God’s appointed president | Citypress

At the time, Mogoeng had only been a judge of South Africa’s highest court for two years. Before that he had been an ordinary judge, the head of the Mahikeng High Court, in a small town in the northern part of the country. He had no constitutional law experience, had not appeared as an advocate before the appellate courts and had not published any academic papers. Naturally, Zuma appointed him.
His nomination to South Africa’s highest judicial office therefore baffled everyone.

Quris claims to have the first real option in its combination of AI with data from a “patient on a chip” that provides remarkably robust testing and automation, all at a considerably lower cost — no mouse required.
The company has raised a $9M seed round to go from pilot to production, and an all-star team of backers and advisors are a promising indicator that the approach has fundamental merit.
The basic idea makes perfect sense: build a better small-scale simulation of a human body and use it to gather data that a machine learning system can easily interpret. It’s easier said than done, of course, but no sooner did researchers say it than Quris started doing it.
The Israel-based company’s approach builds on a major study at Harvard concerning the use of so-called “organs on a chip.” These systems, still relatively new but established in the field, use a small amount of stem cell-derived tissue (“organoids”) as a test bed for drugs or treatments — providing a good idea of how, for example, a human liver might respond to a combination of substances.
What the Harvard researchers found is that by linking multiple organ-on-a-chip systems together (like liver to kidney to heart cells), you end up with a surprisingly effective simulation of the human body. There’s nothing like the real thing, of course, but this serial organoid system or “patient on a chip” could be a real alternative to mouse testing; that’s still the most common way of seeing how a treatment affects a complete organ system, despite the fact that substances that pass the mouse phase only succeed in human tests about ten percent of the time.
CEO and co-founder Isaac Bentwich said that as soon as that study came out, he and his colleagues recognized the potential and started working on what needed to be done in terms of engineering and AI in order to turn this from an experimental system to a scalable product. It’s not just a mouse replacement, either — it’s a (relatively) inexpensive method to do limited human testing without the humans, and without the uncertainty of mice.
A rendering of how the full scale automated “chip on chip” device will look.
“Say you’re a pharma company,” said Bentwich in an interview. “Do you want to wait until you’re at the brink of going to clinical testing to find out whether a molecule that looks good on paper is actually effective? You can make all the genomics discoveries you want, but it won’t get you past mice experiments, where it fails 90 percent of the time. This lets you pick the winning horse before you go to the race.”
Considering drug candidates can cost hundreds of millions to get to the clinical stage, it’s more than worth spending even a small fortune (think tens of millions) to weed out a few destined for failure. If the technique is accurate — and indications are that it is — then the risk is practically nil and it will pay for itself if even a single expensive dead end is avoided. In other words, Bentwich put it, this brings the “fail early, fail cheap” mentality of software to a domain where neither was really an option.
The Quris system uses what it calls a chip-on-chip technique, in other words multiple organoid systems (chips) in sequence (on another chip), but smaller and more efficient than state of the art lab systems by an order of magnitude. It would cost millions to run a hundred simulated humans the way Harvard’s researchers did it, but thousands to do so on Quris’s system, which uses less raw biological material, can be automated, and is accompanied by a well-trained machine learning model.
That’s the other aspect that Quris is playing up: that this unique set of data will drive a unique AI that understands and can help run and interpret the experiments. The AI is already being trained with existing and some upcoming drugs, learning what signals from the various sensors mean for the safety of the substance. That allows effective testing to be done with a handful of chips rather than, say, 500 mice.
The chips themselves aren’t all the same, either. By manipulating and selecting the stem cells and tissues carefully, different types of people and different conditions or phenotypes can be tested for. If a company has a drug that works well but causes side effects 10 percent of the time and they don’t know why, testing against different genetic predispositions or complicating factors in an automated setting may be able to find out what genetic factors lead to those side effects.
Members of the Quris team work in a lab.
Since the AI is aware of and cataloguing all this, it should get quite good at telling from a relatively small number of automated tests (think dozens, not thousands, and at a cost of thousands, not millions) whether a drug is a good candidate for human testing or not. Without the AI interpreting it, the data suddenly becomes a multi-PhD type of problem. But Bentwich was quick to note that they in no way anticipate eliminating the biological side and relying only on the AI. “It’s part of our philosophical and biological understanding that the AI has to work with a biological counterpart,” he said.
Robert Langer, co-founder of Moderna, is on the scientific advisory board, and told TechCrunch in the same interview that he concurred, and expects this technique to be adopted quickly, but not necessarily by the naturally conservative larger pharma companies.
“This does seem to be a very big opportunity,” he said. “I’ve had similar ideas in other areas of chemistry, that you can use AI to make these predictions. It certainly won’t replace testing but it narrows the possibilities, and my view is it would speed things up tremendously.”
It’s nice to have someone like Langer on your side (along with Nobel laureate Aaron Ciechanover), but Bentwich said that they’re relying more on their patent portfolio and first mover advantage to get a foot in the door. An agreement with the NY Stem Cell Foundation gives them special access to that organization’s stem cell workflow.
There are two prongs to the business model. One is providing the service to a pharma company of screening their drug candidates, with payment contingent on the results proving to be accurate — for example, a drug cleared by the system makes it to a given testing milestone as predicted. The other is to work on their own drugs; right now the company has a treatment for the Autism-linked Fragile X condition that it will be taking to clinical testing next year.
Bentwich pointed out that despite the proliferation of and investment in AI-powered drug discovery, few companies can claim to have a molecule resulting from their work entering clinical trials. This isn’t because they aren’t doing what they claim, for instance identifying molecules with certain bioreactivity or a method to manufacture them efficiently, but rather because there are so many other steps in the long discovery, testing, and approval process that the chance of making it through, while higher than it once was, is still very low.
The $9M seed round “funds us very well to finish the productization of the setup that we have, making it more efficient and automated, and testing the first hundred or thousand initial drugs to train the AI,” Bentwich said. The round was led by “Dr. Judith Richter and Dr. Kobi Richter, pioneers of cardiovascular intervention therapeutics, with participation from Moshe Yanai, a disruptive data-storage technology leader, and strategic angel investors,” as the press release puts it. A distinct lack of institutional capital — draw your own conclusions there.
Bentwich’s vision for the company is part of his general vision of “completely personalized medicine.” If the cost of stem cells continues to drop (already it has gone from millions to thousands), it would open up entirely new markets.
“It’ll no longer be just doing expensive experiments for pharma companies. In 5-10 years time this may well be what hundreds of millions of people are doing. If you think about it, it’s actually kind of barbaric how we’re living now,” he said. “You go to the pharmacist and they list the possible side effects, but you don’t know for sure. What, are you the guinea pig? The answer is: yes, we’re all guinea pigs. But this is a first step away from that.”
source: TechCrunchPrime Minister Janez Janša dismissed the statement by opposition Social Democrat (SD) leader Tanja Fajon that Slovenia is being stripped of dossiers that are part of its current EU Council presidency as he attended questions’ time with deputies in the National Assembly on Monday (18 October).
He said passing dossiers onto the next presiding country, in this case France, which takes over on 1 January, was usual.
“I would be happy if this happened, but this is not happening,” Janša told lawmakers about the remarks Fajon made on a Sunday evening show at the public broadcaster. Fajon, who is a member of the European Parliament, also said diplomats were happy that France will take over in January.
Replying to a question from Monika Gregorčič, an MP for the coalition Modern Centre Party (SMC), Janša said many dossiers had been passed onto Slovenia from the preceding presidencies, as the current presidency was the first fully operational one since the outbreak of COVID-19.
“A lot of dossiers from the past presidencies have been postponed for this semester. We have to deal with 50% more topics than we would otherwise,” the prime minister said.
He added that many topics were on the agenda for the second half of the presidency, although everything was overshadowed by the growing energy prices, which changed agendas.
Janša also talked about the recent informal EU-Western Balkans meeting, held in Slovenia, saying that “paradoxically, the greatest success was that we brought the word enlargement back to the concluding document, as this word was practically non-existent in documents in the last ten years”.
The prime minister said the majority of EU member states was inclined to enlargement towards the Western Balkans, while the leaders of the countries that opposed it believed that citizens of the candidate countries would represent a cheap labour force.
The Slovenian presidency did not manage to include a timetable for enlargement in the final document. “Slovenia proposed that enlargement in one way or another could be made in the coming ten years, which is possible.”
“All reforms can be implemented within this time,” he said, adding that “unfortunately, there was no consensus on that, although a large majority was for that and we continue working on it”.
[Edited by Zoran Radosavljevic]The Commission of Inquiry into Money Laundering in B.C. has been granted an extension to submit its final report by May 20, 2022 as opposed to next month.
The inquiry has already been delayed due to pandemic-related complications and now Commissioner Austin Cullen has been granted a second extension to accommodate late closing submissions following delays in testimony.
“Commission staff, commission counsel and the participants have all worked extremely hard to get to this stage in the proceedings. We are happy to have concluded the hearings process. Having reached that juncture, assessing the work ahead, it became clear we would not be able to conclude the final report in the limited time available before it was due,” said Cullen in a statement.
“With an extension to May 20, 2022, for the final report, we can ensure the report delivers analysis and recommendations commensurate with the importance of the issues,” added Cullen.
Part of the delay was to accommodate former B.C. Lottery Corporation anti-money laundering director and whistleblower Ross Alderson.
The inquiry has heard testimony about suspected money laundering in B.C.-regulated casinos, but also in sectors such as residential real estate, luxury vehicles and the financial sector.
The inquiry has explored methods to combat money laundering, such as corporate and property registries, better police enforcement, unexplained wealth orders and inter-governmental communication.
The commission stated that “although there has been considerable progress made in reviewing the voluminous record, preparing the final report remains a significant undertaking.
“The commission’s mandate, as determined by its terms of reference, is wide-ranging in its breadth and scope. It involves various sectors of the economy; a broad spectrum of enterprises, government and regulatory agencies and individuals; law enforcement agencies; professions; corporations; gaming enterprises; financial institutions; luxury goods; real estate and virtual assets. The mandate includes a review of important concepts such as quantification, privacy implications and money laundering and anti-money laundering initiatives in other jurisdictions around the globe.”Have you ever felt your car is turning more or less than your feed while cornering? It happens with most of us but we generally ignore it. Here we are talking about understeer and oversteer of the cars.
These are the terms related to the automobiles. One doesn’t understand these terms easily, as one thinks of it as a core concept of automobile engineering. But, it is quite easy to understand. In this article, we are going to discuss what these terms are about and how they affect the movement of a vehicle.
What is Understeering?
It is a condition when front tyres of car slip outwards in a corner due to excess speed. The car continuously moves straight even when the steering is moved for cornering. It appears to an observer outside that driver has not given sufficient steering for the turn.
Understeer occurs in the front wheels of the cars particularly when a car has front-wheel drive. When front-wheel-drive cars go through a corner it can be subjected under various loads due to braking, turning and simultaneously driving power from the engine. The front-wheel cannot withstand the forces at once and hence, they don’t turn as the feed given.
The most common cause of understeering is braking or suddenly accelerating into a corner. When you pressure the brake pedal hard, front wheels have to bear the load of the vehicle and also maintain the grip on the road. On top of it, when the steering feed is given, the wheels lack enough grip to turn.
Similarly, when the acceleration is given, the front wheels grip loses for steering. The more acceleration gives the lesser grip will be available for steering. Therefore, to stop understeering from happening, less or no acceleration and braking should be given while turning the vehicle.
What is oversteering?
This concept is similar to understeering but it happens when rear wheels lose the grip while taking a turn. The loss of grip makes the back of the car to move outwards. It occurs generally in rear-wheel-drive cars. The most common cause of oversteering is a wheel there is more than needed acceleration, wheels lose grip and begin to slide. Another reason for oversteering can be when we suddenly stop accelerating, this transfers the weight of the car to the front due to which rear wheels loses grip.
Oversteering when done in a controlled manner is called drifting. When have seen cars drifting around the corners in the rally races. It looks cool, car slithers around the corners while billowing smoke from its tyres. However, this might not look cool on the normal road, so we should look forward to the ways of controlling it.
In oversteer too it is recommended to slow down the car and do not accelerate or brake suddenly while taking a turn.
Apart from the above-mentioned factors, a car oversteer or understeer due to worn out tyres, slippery road surface and bad handling of the vehicle.Lower Mississippi River Dispatch No. 277

My weekly obsession? Lucite clutches. Chanel does no wrong when it comes to their accessories. I was so in love when I set my eyes on this PVC clutch that could damn near pay my rent for 4 months! In case you are wondering what the exact price is… $6,595.
I did a little research and discovered some options were reasonably tagged.Promotions

We believe that the nonprofit sector is a powerful catalyst for positive societal change, but will not realize its full potential until it maximizes the power of inclusion and diversity, starting in the boardroom. The DiverseForce On Boards program was founded in 2017 to address the lack of racial/ethnic diversity on nonprofit boards. Our program is designed to train professionals of color on board governance and to facilitate their placement on governing boards. The program curriculum focuses on three key areas:
Board Preparation - Participants gain in-depth training and preparation to serve on the governing board for nonprofit organizations. The curriculum covers board leadership and governance topics which include strategic planning, financial leadership, legal roles and responsibilities, fundraising, and more.
Leadership - Board participation is an excellent way to exercise leadership competence. Through our culturally-informed leadership "lunch & learns" with a certified executive leadership coach, participants develop a deeper understanding of their personal leadership style and how to prepare for more complex roles in any organization.
Inclusion & Diversity - Participants are empowered to be change agents on boards by helping organizations to be more culturally-align with the communities they serve. Inclusive and diverse teams make better decisions and can help to expand the networks of funders, volunteers, and other key stakeholders. Participants will learn steps to institutionalizing inclusivity and diversity.

The team was down double digits for most of the night but rallied their way to within 2 midway through the 4th quarter. They didn't have enough steam to keep the rally going though, and they came up short.
- Kenneth Faried is a baller. Hustle plays all day long. He's going to be a good one for a long time.
- Celtics biggest problem is that they can't hustle all day long. They can make a run, like they did in the 4th, but can't sustain it.
- Losing Paul Pierce to foul trouble didn't help either. Solid game for him with 22 points.
- KG put in another nice all around game and Rondo chipped in with another 16 assists. These games get forgotten because of the L.
- Ray Allen, 0-6 from the three point line. That doesn't help.

Oh well, on to the next city.CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA—Street preacher Sam Bethea watched an execution last night. He didn't know if the man was dead, but it looked that way.
"Brains," Bethea said. "Blood everywhere. They blew off the top of his head. And that's when I started saying my prayers."
Late this afternoon, a source told the local NBC affiliate that the victim had died.
Today, Bethea and others outside of the Omni Hotel milled about and sat on benches near where the shooting took place Wednesday night. They dismissed rumors that police fired the bullet that landed in the still-unnamed man's head.
"There was a lot of pushing and shoving," said Jerome, a homeless Army veteran who was feet away from the man who got shot. He didn't want to give his last name. "Then someone raised up with a gun. Pow!"
The shooting came during a particularly chaotic stretch last night when Jerome says police were simply overwhelmed by a large and raucous crowd of people protesting the fatal police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott—killed Friday holding a book or a gun, depending on which version of the story you believe. After over-running police, arguments and fights broke out among members of the crowd—Jerome attributed the eruption of violence to rival gang members being in close quarters—and someone pulled a gun. Then came the blood.
"Blew off the top of his head," Bethea said.
A man stepped in to help, Jerome and Bethea explained, but was pushed and punched away as the blood began pooling on the brick sidewalk. Jerome said the Good Samaritan was a news reporter who tried to perform CPR; Bethea thought he was a security guard. Whoever he was, he couldn't reach the victim. For whatever reason, some in the crowd around the man wanted him to bleed out. Then the police arrived.
Officers and citizens carried the man away to an armored police truck. He made it to the hospital alive. He died less than 24 hours later.
Jerome will head to a men's shelter downtown tonight, just in case things get as crazy as they were last night. Bethea will maintain his ministry on the corner outside the Omni Hotel, and he'll continue preaching to young men, who he says oftentimes don't want to hear it.
As he handed out lanyards reading "I love Jesus" on Thursday afternoon, one such man approached. "He was kicking in windows last night. I saw him on the news," Bethea alleged. "Let's see what he says."
"I had to go savage," the man told Bethea, laughing.
"Don't do savage," Bethea responded. "Do love."11.24.21 Market Update

A 61-year-old man with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and a remote history of cigarette use presented to the cardiology clinic for initial evaluation. Over the preceding 6 weeks, he noted onset of exertional fatigue associated with mild substernal chest heaviness that would resolve promptly with rest. He did not have symptoms of congestive heart failure and had no history of coronary artery disease, peripheral or cerebrovascular disease, or arrhythmia. His primary care physician had been treating him with aspirin, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, and metformin. He had recently been prescribed an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin drug) for modestly increased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglyceride levels. More recently, he had been prescribed sublingual nitroglycerin because of his chest discomfort; however, he had not yet taken any pills. His physical examination was notable only for an S4 gallop. He had no evidence of heart failure.
An office electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with borderline left ventricular hypertrophy without evidence of prior infarction or ischemia. Laboratory studies showed the following values: hemoglobin A1c, 6.8%; fasting glucose, 147 mg/dL; LDL cholesterol, 129 mg/dL; triglycerides, 230 mg/dL; and creatinine, 1.3 mg/dL. Coronary angiography showed a 90% stenosis of the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery and a 75% stenosis of a large second obtuse marginal branch of the circumflex coronary artery. The ejection fraction was estimated to be 57% on ventriculography without wall motion abnormality. Although both coronary lesions appeared amenable to percutaneous coronary intervention, after detailed discussion with the patient, the decision was made to proceed with coronary artery bypass graft surgery based on the accumulated data suggesting improved long-term outcomes with a surgical versus percutaneous approach. The patient underwent uncomplicated two-vessel bypass surgery, which included a left internal mammary artery graft to the LAD and a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal branch. The patient was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 4 without complications. At the 1-year follow-up, the patient had no symptoms, was working full-time, and had no exercise limitations. He continued to take aspirin daily, an ACE inhibitor, a beta blocking agent, and statin therapy, along with metformin for glucose management.Dental sleep medicine practitioners share strategies for ensuring obstructive sleep apnea patients who opt for oral appliance therapy are titrated in sleep centers.
Most Thursday and Friday nights, sleep technologists in northwest Arkansas can smell him coming.
“Whenever I go into the labs, I try to carry something for the sleep techs to eat. Chicken nuggets are my favorite. Whenever I can I try to feed the techs—I want them to love me!” says Ken Berley, DDS, JD, DABDSM.
“For Christmas, I take chocolate candy and popcorn treats for the techs too,” adds Berley, who enjoys privileges at four sleep labs near his Rogers, Ark, dental practice. “And, I’ll tell you what, the dentists who are not doing this are missing out.”
These treats are a small thing, but they help Berley, a dental sleep medicine practitioner as well as a licensed attorney-legal consultant to other dentists, cultivate an increasingly important relationship that all dentists who treat patients with oral appliances should develop: bidirectional access for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients from dentist’s chair to sleep center bed and vice versa. According to Berley, “A positive relationship with local sleep labs is a key factor in developing a successful referral practice.”: having the patient alert the clinician to subjective improvements, a low threshold that does not necessarily correlate to objective outcomes; having the patient perform one or more overnight sleep tests at home using a home sleep testing (HST) device while trying the oral appliance at different settings; and/or titrating the oral appliance overnight in a sleep disorders center bed, with a sleep tech gradually adjusting the settings until the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) reaches a clinically acceptable level—the latter generally regarded as the best option from both clinical and liability standpoints.
A challenge for many dentists lies in cultivating that bidirectional sleep lab relationship. Some approach sleep center managers only to find them hesitant to do overnight oral appliance studies in their labs. Sleep lab managers and sleep techs do face obstacles when accommodating in-lab polysomnography (PSG) for patients with oral appliances. These range from unfamiliarity with the myriad oral device makes and models to hesitation to awaken the patient multiple times to turn the device’s titration screw (which in most oral appliances is located inside the mouth, so it isn’t accessible when the patient is asleep) when they typically do positive airway pressure titrations that can be fully completed while the patient remains asleep.
Hence, the chicken nuggets. Berley, an ABSDM Diplomate, uses them as one tool to overcome hesitation to ensure oral appliance patients are welcome at local sleep centers. He employs many other techniques as well, including accepting the sleep centers’ CPAP-failing patients to his dental practice. “Understand, sleep labs are a great referral source,” says Berley. “The sleep techs will be in there with somebody who is not responding well to CPAP [continuous positive airway pressure], and they throw their mask across the room. It is important for the sleep techs to understand that I can help these patients.”
Titration Nuts & Bolts
For Berley to personally be present for every oral appliance titration, he requires that the patients schedule their sleep lab titration PSGs on Thursday or Friday nights as Berley does not see patients in his office on the following days. This strategy is one that other dentists can consider emulating. Berley attempts to schedule as many patients in a lab on a given night as possible, sometimes filling an entire sleep center with oral appliance patients alone.
The sleep techs do help with the titrations, but Berley typically makes the decision when to titrate. He has found that most techs want to titrate the appliance too frequently. “Every time the patient has an event they want to go into the room, wake that patient up, and do a titration. But you can’t do that. Since you must wake the patients up in order to titrate them, it is ideal to titrate the patients after observing a full REM cycle. Although that is not always the case if I am observing a significant number of events in stage 2, but I try to let the patient sleep until I see a full REM cycle.” The goal is to wake the patients up as few times as possible. Because of that, Berley uses in-office titration testing to get the patient as close to normal as possible before going back to the lab for final PSG.
“Many dentists want the techs to titrate their patients instead of doing it themselves,” continues Berley. “Been there, done that. It doesn’t work. If you have a really, really trained RPSGT, then maybe….But we have 153 FDA-approved oral appliances out there. And if you have a tech do the [titrations], I don’t care how specific your written instructions are, things can go wrong.
“I have frequently seen patients with one side of the appliance protruded and the other side retruded. The techs just don’t have the experience to handle the problems that occur with oral appliances, which often include: loose appliances that dislodge and must be tightened, Herbst screws coming loose, positional aids used incorrectly, and the need for new Herbst bars or other advancement issues. Techs just don’t have the training and sometimes the tools to consistently get good results when titrating these appliances.” In Berley’s opinion, titration of these appliances is the dentist’s responsibility. He rhetorically asks: If the dentist is not present in the lab and the titration fails or the study fails because of a lack of titration, who pays for the next study?
In Berley’s opinion, it is mandatory to use an HST or pulse oximetry for in-office titration to ensure that your patients’ AHI is below 10 before they are referred back for a final PSG. He says this allows for fewer in-lab appliance adjustments.
Berley shares his three main goals for oral appliance titrations: “Goal number 1: The patient must wear the oral appliance all night every night. Goal number 2 is to titrate the appliance adequately to eliminate the subjective symptoms. Goal number 3 is to titrate the appliance for maximum medical improvement and resolution of the objective symptoms. The problem is the patient has felt bad for so long they are going to start feeling better quickly after appliance insertion and the dentist may stop titrating the appliance too soon. Frequently, titration is terminated based on subjective symptoms and the patient’s objective symptoms remain unresolved. With HST-guided in-office titration which is confirmed and tweaked in a final PSG, consistently good results are obtainable.”
Here, it is important to note that dental insurance plans do not cover PSGs, or oral appliances for OSA for that matter. Instead, these services are covered by the patient’s medical insurance plan, including Medicare, and typically only when deemed a “medical necessity” by a sleep physician. While some dental sleep medicine practitioners opt to have their patients pay out-of-pocket for the oral appliance itself versus learning how to do medical insurance paperwork, having a patient pay out-of-pocket for a PSG will be cost-prohibitive for most. So dentists who do not yet have a plan for medical billing will need to develop one prior to sending oral appliances patients in-lab.
Berley believes that all dental sleep medicine procedures should be filed on the patient’s medical insurance (which may be Medicare). Because OSA is a medical condition, dentists should never attempt to file these procedures on the patient’s dental insurance. With simple instructions, any dental office can master filing medical insurance, Berley says. (Sleep Review’s view is the patient should have the option to file the device and any related services with their medical insurance. There are firms that specialize in medical billing for dentists to which dentists can outsource this work.)
An Alternate Approach: Provide Sleep Techs with a “Cheat Sheet”
In south Florida, Kenneth A. Mogell, DMD, DABDSM, realized early in his dental sleep medicine career that proper communication is essential between all of the disciplines “in the sleep community” including physicians, dentists, sleep techs, and respiratory therapists.
While he anticipated resistance from referring physicians to the idea of using oral appliance therapy on their patients with sleep apnea, he was taken aback by how many cited a lack of communication from dentists about their patients following past referrals. “I referred my patients to the dentist and they fall into a black hole and I never hear from them again!” one sleep physician lamented, says Mogell, a member of the Sleep Review editorial advisory board who recalled the incident in an article he penned in 2016.2
The colorful proclamation would help Mogell remember the lesson he’d learned about the value of multidisciplinary communication, which he determined to put into action as he began his practice.
He began writing letters periodically with updates on patient progress for physicians. Eventually, he would develop several templates for the letters to address the many communication needs of a thriving referral-based dental sleep practice, including a letter to request an oral appliance titration PSG. This letter purposely includes the make and model of the oral appliance, a photo of the appliance, what setting the appliance is currently on, and how many turn options remain.
What’s more, he gives each sleep lab a demonstration model of each oral appliance he employs, as well as the corresponding advancement wrench (in case the sleep-deprived patient forgets to bring theirs to the lab). Finally, he devised a “cheat sheet.” The laminated poster has a photo of each device Mogell uses in his practice, and under each photo is the device’s name and hints for how to titrate it. (For example, “Dorsal Fin Type: Every turn is 0.1 mm. 10 turns = 1 mm. Appliance can be advanced to 6.0 mm or 60 turns.”) He includes his phone number at the bottom and lets the sleep techs know he is “on call” remotely should questions or concerns arise.2
Utilizing HST Pre-Titration PSG
All of Berley and Mogell’s sleep apnea patients are referred to them by sleep physicians. Most of the patients have already failed CPAP.
Although dentists can’t diagnose sleep apnea, many use HST or pulse oximetry devices to conduct preliminary therapy efficacy checks. Some practitioners are adamantly opposed to dentists utilizing HST for any reason.3 But Berley finds that conducting titration HST studies is essential. “Frequently I am referred a patient who has an in-lab PSG that is obviously incorrect. This can be due to first night effect or any other reason. Those patients get an HST in their bed before we begin therapy. By the time the patient is referred to the lab for a follow-up PSG, they may have had several HSTs, depending on the severity of the patient. This allows for easy in-lab final titration.” In this way, by the time Berley refers patients to a physician for final PSG, he is aware the oral appliance is objectively working.
“All of my sleep physicians know that I have HST, and they encourage me to use it. Because once I get the patient ready to go to the sleep lab, it is a minor type of titration,” he says. “The basic titration occurs in my office to get them ready to go back to the sleep lab. And then it’s just one or two times I interrupt them in the night for titration.
“If you don’t get [patients] ready for a PSG with HST, you’re going to be too aggressive in the sleep lab when you are titrating them. You cannot advance a patient 3, 4, or 5 mm in the sleep lab; it’s too much.
“Ultimately, HST is a tool,” says Berley, who emphasizes that dentists should not be in the business of diagnosing OSA. “We want to be a part of the team who provide treatment for OSA. As a member of a healthcare team where the sleep physician is the quarterback, we all share liability for a bad outcome,” he says. “Remember, I am the dentist-attorney.”
