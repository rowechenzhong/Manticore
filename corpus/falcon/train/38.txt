Yesterday I attended the London launch for Service Cloud 2 from Salesforce.com. A weary but still ebullient Marc Benioff showed off his new book Behind the cloud – sure to be a bestseller if only for the copies his own company has purchased – and introduced a demo of Service Cloud 2.
There are several elements to Service Cloud 2, which puts customer service alongside CRM as a core Salesforce offering. Traditional call centres are last-century technology, says Benioff, and today’s customers go to Google, Facebook or Twitter before picking up the phone. Salesforce Knowledge is a multi-tenant knowledgebase – a specialist type of content management system – that hooks into a customer service online dashboard as well as being exposed to Google etc. Salesforce Answers is a:
complete, customisable website that facilitates question/answer style conversations between customers
complete, customisable website that facilitates question/answer style conversations between customers
The idea is to promote interaction with customers and to feedback customer knowledge (since they often provide the best support) into the knowledgebase. Salesforce Answers can be published as a Facebook site as well as on the Web. Another feature is the ability to monitor twitter, pick up what people are saying about your product, and intervene as appropriate. You can also have a twitter account to which customers can address queries.
If customers do in fact pick the phone, the same information along with customer details can be used to offer support.
We saw an impressive demo based on Dell.com’s Salesforce application – Dell is a big Salesforce customer and CEO Michael Dell a friend of Benioff. A customer calls in and all their details, purchase and support history pops up automatically based, presumably, on their incoming number. A few quick taps and the representative is able to answer their question. You would imagine that every competent call centre has a similar arrangement – having said which, we’ve all had experience of call centres where you are passed from rep to rep repeating our details and our problem with each new contact. We also saw a Facebook page and Twitter encounter where a customer got quick and accurate responses. Of course the demo problems were nice easy ones like “How do I fit more RAM”, not more intricate ones like “why does Windows freeze every third time I boot”.
The core of the Salesforce proposition is that multi-tenant applications are more cost-effective than traditional in-house IT. The most striking statistic Benioff offered is that they support 63,000 customers on just 1500 Dell PCs. “What a scam traditional IT is”, said Benioff, referring to the low utilisation of most in-house servers – though virtualisation also goes some way towards solving this problem.
One of Benioff’s tips for success is to bring customers and prospects together for informal marketing, and this launch was an example. It was hosted at the London Stock Exchange, a great location for a business-oriented presentation, and I was surrounded by men in suits, unlike the informal attire at the more technology-focussed events I attend.
At the party afterwards there was a piece of marketing genius. Smiling staff circulated the party with armfuls of Flip video cameras. Guests were asked to say something about Salesforce.com into the camera – questions like “How has using Salesforce impacted your business” – and to agree to allow their piece to be used in marketing. In return they got a camera. I wonder if the company will disclose that last piece of information alongside the comments?
Disclosure: I got a Flip too.
While most customers are positive, I did hear some grumbles as well. Cost is one: while you save on infrastructure cost, the Salesforce model is not necessarily cheap, and extras like training are a significant cost. I also heard how the system sometimes fails, not with downtime as such, but with things like scheduled data exports (for backup) failing to run; I presume these are resource hogs and get shunted out of the way to keep the system responsive for immediate transactions. I also heard that the platform now has its own legacy and that some things work in odd ways because they are too difficult to change.
Another worry is lack of control. If something goes wrong, there is nothing you can do beyond harrying support. One customer said it was like being on a train that is late. If you are between stations you cannot even get off the train.
Still, I believe the cloud is the future because of sheer economics; it is more cost-effective. Further, when it comes to multi-tenanted applications Salesforce.com is undoubtedly the leader in its segment.
I spoke to another customer about a particularly interesting use of the platform and will post about that separately.

This layout of Plymouth Green Crossings shows the location of a restaurant, labeled Building E, that the developer no longer wants to build, and the planned Phase 2 building in red where 12 more apartment units will be built above what the developer hopes will be a ground floor of interior parking.
Ryan J. Stanton | AnnArbor.com
The developer still wants to go forward with adding more apartments at the northwest corner of Plymouth and Green roads, but no longer wants to build a restaurant there.
Earl Ophoff, project manager from Midwestern Consulting LLC, appeared on behalf of the property owner for a meeting with the Planning Commission on Tuesday.
The Plymouth Green Crossings site plan was approved in 2006 for the construction of three mixed-use buildings, each including ground-floor retail and two upper floors of housing.
Also included in the approved Planned Unit Development site plan was a free-standing bank, a free-standing restaurant and garages for the apartments.
Earl Ophoff, senior associate and project manager for Midwestern Consulting, appears on behalf of the developer at Tuesday night's Planning Commission meeting.
Ryan J. Stanton | AnnArbor.com
Plymouth Green Crossings LLC is now requesting permission to amend the approved PUD to remove the restaurant from the plans, with the intention of converting a temporary parking area on the footprint of the restaurant to 26 spaces of permanent parking.
The developer also wants to remove the 7,000-square-foot limit on the amount of restaurant space allowed in the ground-floor retail space of the mixed-use buildings.
A total of 14,224 square feet of retail space exists in the ground floor of the two mixed-use buildings that have been constructed.
Lastly, the developer is asking the city to allow flexible uses on the ground floor of the third mixed-use building, which is yet to be built.
The top two floors will remain apartments, Ophoff said. But instead of using the ground floor for office, retail or restaurant, the developer now has plans for interior parking underneath the new apartments. That would add another 15 parking spaces, for 290 total on the site.
"The site's very difficult to see," Ophoff said explaining why the restaurant is being eliminated from the plans to make way for more parking. "There's a huge parking demand in this portion of the site. It just doesn't look like (a restaurant) is a marketable part of the site."
City Planner Jeff Kahan noted in a memo to the Planning Commission that restaurant uses typically require much more parking during peak periods than retail spaces.
City code requires 10 spaces per 1,000 square feet of restaurant space and about 3.25 spaces per 1,000 square feet of retail space. Kahan said restaurants can use the retail parking standard if they are part of a larger retail center.
No changes to the stormwater collection or detention system are proposed.
Ophoff said the third mixed-use building would remain identical to the two already built, with the exception that the developer wants flexibility to use first floor for either office/retail or parking.
The second and third floors of the existing mixed-use buildings include 23 apartments. The third building will add 12 more apartment units.
No action was taken at Tuesday's pre-petition conference. The developer plans to submit formal plans by the end of this month.
Plymouth Green Crossings started life as luxury loft condominiums. But as the mixed-use development was being built on Ann Arbor's northeast side, neighbor Pfizer Inc. closed its doors, the economy turned sour and the housing market grew soft.
And so Plymouth Green Crossings entered the market in 2009 as 1,400-square-foot, upscale apartments, running between $1,600 and $2,200 a month. As condos, they were going to be listed for around $300,000, an idea that still could be revisited.
"Once they started renting them, they went fast," Ophoff said Tuesday night, noting all of the units are filled and there's a waiting list.
Retail tenants that have moved into the ground floor spaces include Sweetwaters, Subway, Olga's Kitchen, a sushi restaurant, a fitness club and others.

A revision that increases the available parking? The bike-obsessed Planning Commission will never approve.
say it plain
Wed, Jun 20, 2012 : 4:11 p.m.
lol...and that's just *such* an appealing place for biking (NOT)... but, I'm sure it's to be encouraged there, because it fits in with the envisioned future of people getting to the 'entryways' of Ann Arbor via the highway right nearby there or via light rail someday, and then biking while inside the city. Of course, nobody has worked out a reasonable set of 'perimeter' roads that would prevent the hideous traffic we regularly have within the city itself, but, at least we have more bike lanes for the cars to dodge! It's true, though, parking in that development is not pleasant. Some of that is that it's not set up like Americans are used to seeing parking...wide open football field arrays with vast spaces for their giant vehicles... But that storage-shed pseudo-industrial look they have going is pretty heinous, that's for sure as well!

One one hand, it's sad to see this corner getting busier and busier, and more crowded with buildings encroaching upon the wetlands. I always used to really enjoy looking at the wetlands before the construction of that one ugly building that's right up against the wetlands. Now it's got an ugly building to compete with, and the cattails are getting out-competed by purple loose strife.... just sad to see the corner continue to change in ways I'd rather not see. I know "progress happens", but it's pretty rough to watch sometimes.

This is one of the ugliest buildings ever built in Ann Arbor. Every time I drive by this "thing" I'm shocked at how unappealing the entire design is. It's not modern, it's not high tech, it's not pretty whatsoever. And those garage/storage units... ugh! Please don't let them add on to this thing - it's bad enough as it is!

WASHINGTON, Oct. 27, 2003."
Talking with reporters during his return flight from Baghdad, Wolfowitz praised the courage and commitment of Iraqi people defying what he calls the "bitter- enders" of the Saddam Hussein regime and moving their country toward democracy.
He said he saw evidence of this commitment everywhere he went during the trip: among Iraqi police manning police stations in Kirkuk and Baghdad, at the Fatima al-Zahra Center for Women's Rights in Al Hillah, among Iraqi Civil Defense Corps soldiers in Tikrit and among all other Iraqis he met who are striving to build a free, secure Iraq.
Wolfowitz praised the bravery exhibited by the Iraqi Facilities Protection Service during his visit. Part of the Iraqi Civil Defense Corps, this service is credited with buffering the severity of the Oct. 26 terrorist attack on the Al Rasheed Hotel, where Wolfowitz was staying at the time.
Facilities Protection Service forces responded within minutes when 1st Armored Division soldiers sighted a suspicious generator trailer being moved into a park near the hotel. As a result, the perpetrators fled the scene before they could fully arm the launching device hidden inside, Wolfowitz said, calling the two Iraqi Facilities Protection Service members who suffered shrapnel injuries during the attack "real heroes."
Everywhere he went during the trip, Wolfowitz said, he was struck by the bravery exhibited by the Americans he met military and civilian alike.
"They were risking their lives and proud of what they are doing," he said. "They know what the mission is about. They know they are helping to build a new country. They know they are helping to make the world and America safer."
At the U.S. Army's 28th Combat Support Hospital, where those critically wounded in the Al Rasheed Hotel attack were evacuated, Wolfowitz said he was "truly encouraged" by the "courage and commitment" of the five people seriously wounded in the blast.
"There wasn't a single complaint among them," he said. "They were all proud of being there, proud of what they have accomplished."
Among the critically injured patients Wolfowitz visited was a British civilian from the Finance Ministry who the deputy secretary said "has just helped to get Saddam's face off the currency and get a new currency on the streets and is proud of what he has done."
Wolfowitz also visited a U.S. State Department secretary who recently volunteered for service in Iraq and has "no regrets and (is) proud of what she is doing," he said.
Another patient, a civilian from the U.S. Department of Labor who is helping the Iraqis establish a new Labor Ministry, "is proud of his work, with every reason to be," Wolfowitz said.
Similarly, the deputy secretary said a Defense Department civilian employee from the National Imagery and Mapping Agency, who received severe facial lacerations during the attack, "was just proud of what he was doing and amazingly upbeat."
Another patient, a U.S. Army colonel working in the Ministry of Health, was wearing an oxygen mask when Wolfowitz approached him in the intensive care unit to thank him for his service. When the deputy secretary learned that the officer had grown up in Beirut, Lebanon, he asked, "How do you feel about building a new Middle East?" and received a "thumbs up" sign. The colonel then asked the attending nurse to remove his oxygen mask so he could be photographed with Wolfowitz.
"I am inspired by their reaction (and) by their courage," the deputy secretary said.
He said the same level of commitment to and belief in their cause was evident today at the Coalition Provisional Authority. Staff members, many in tears after learning that a member of their staff had been killed in the hotel attack, quickly channeled their grief into getting back to the business at hand.
"We have people who, military and civilian, have volunteered to do a dangerous assignment because they know it's important," Wolfowitz said. "And I think everything they're learning when they are out here reinforces that commitment. It's just a wonderful spirit."Monadnock Waldorf School

One of the best parts about the Handcrafted Jewelry 2010 special issue, besides 25 really great mixed media projects, is the article 7 Easy Ways to Alter Metal. Metal magic experts, Brenda Sue Lansdowne, Jess Italia Lincoln, Gil Crosman Moore, Silvija & Taya Koschnick, and Beth Botak give great directions for using spray paint, gilder’s paste, embossing powder (to name a few) to completely change the look of different metals. These techniques could keep you entertained for a really long time and I can’t wait to try them all.

Melinda Barta’s two Beadwork technique DVDs, Herringbone Stitch—Basics and Beyond and Peyote Stitch—Basics and Beyond are the answer to my seed-bead prayers. Melinda shows stitch-by-stitch how to bead through all of the variations on these two popular stitches, taking the mystery out of building, shaping, and embellishing with seed beads. And just in case you’re like me and need repeats and refreshers, her DVDs are a foolproof way to master the many faces of Herringbone and Peyote stitches.

When one is faced with the daunting decision of what kind of gift they should give someone, very rarely is it a quick or easy task; unless, of course, you know specifically what the recipient desires.
My philosophy is to give something that I would use or want to keep for myself. On many occasions, one will find that item that suits a person very well and purchase it for a future occasion. I can remember Christmastime at my parents' home. No matter who came by to visit, mom had a gift for them. She loved to give.
We were taught early in life that it is better to give than to receive. I think that deep down inside I have held on to that theory. I love to give and see the look on people's faces. There is such a warm spirit that comes over you when you can bring a smile to someone's face or help improve the quality of their life with a gift.
How do you feel about giving to others? We can give in so many different ways.
There are just some gifts that money cannot buy. Have you vowed to give a gift that could potentially save a life? Have you ever heard of the movie, "Seven Pounds"? The plot of the movie takes different angles, which all lead to one end -- Tim Thomas, played by Will Smith, donates several of his organs and bone marrow to give life and help improve the lives of seven people.
Although I choose not to follow his example in the manner in which he gave, I did choose to give. I realized the importance of being an organ donor when my uncle needed a kidney and went through years of dialysis. We are thankful to God and the donor that he has received his kidney after more than 10 years of waiting and is doing fine.
Organ transplants save lives and improve the quality of life for many individuals every year.

Be the first to add a photo!Barack Obama was bulldozed at a recent rally in Mount Vernon, Iowa, thanks to a group of small business owners who teamed up to send him a message: We did build this, despite what you might think. The message is conveyed with a large red, white, and blue bulldozer with “Romney-Ryan 2012″ painted across the blade in front.
Along with greeting Obama at the recent rally, J.J. Scheckel Heavy Equipment Corporation’s bulldozer will be displayed at what they’re calling “strategic locations” for the next three weeks until Election Day 2012.
The idea was inspired in response to Barack Obama’s comments in July: “Look, if you’ve been successful, you didn’t get there on your own. You didn’t get there on your own. … If you’ve got a business — you didn’t build that. Somebody else made that happen.”
J.J. Scheckel employee Dick Steines drives the bulldozer and didn’t like Obama’s message anymore than did his boss, co-workers, and other small businesses who played a part in creating a piece of heavy equipment intended to bulldoze Barry in Iowa. Said Steins, “My boss built his business from scratch and he wants others to succeed.” “It’s the person you are who builds the business,” he went on.
Scheckel employees, with the help of other small businesses, painted the bulldozer, says Steins — and it’s already creating quite a stir, according to him. “I saw a lot of people looking in their rear-view mirrors like, ‘What the heck did I just pass?'” said Steins.
The vehicle made its debut at a pro-Romney rally in Mount Vernon, just blocks away from where Obama was set to speak later that night. The Romney rally also attracted College Republicans from the University of Northern Iowa. “We’re not happy with President Obama,” UNI student Christie Tague of Cedar Falls said. “I’m sick of hope. I haven’t seen any.”
Tague went on to cite several friends unable to find jobs after graduating thanks to Obama’s notion of hope and change that never materialized on his watch.Theme: "Stars Shine on Rodeo 67"

Syria: Cartoonist Ali Farzat Attacked
Read more about it here:
Bashar al-Assad has tried to silence a man whose quill and ink are likened to Damascus steel and the hardy blood of the Syrian people. He won't succeed.
I found myself on the verge of tears at this story- not from sorrow, but from anger- perhaps because I trade in ink myself, and certainly because freedom of expression is dear to me. If Farzat cannot lift his pen at present because a coward has broken his hands, I thought to do him the favor of drawing a cartoon for him.
I'd suggest that every cartoonist who can grasp a pen do likewise.

Ca’ d’Oro is a collection handcrafted in Germany that recently launched from Sieger by Fürstenberg. With graphic black and white patterns and fine burnished gold details, the geometric pieces will take the cake when it’s dinnertime.
The quatrefoil, a decorative element, becomes the center of the design and its form slightly resembles that of a flower.
Each piece features different geometric patterns from classic stripes, to squares, to circles, and other architectonic patterns. Use all of 35 pieces or only a couple at a time, but no matter what, this timeless set will quickly become an heirloom.
The name of the collection, Ca’ d’Oro, means “golden house”, and that was taken from the famous palazzo on the banks of the Grand Canal in Venice where Sieger had a second home and a deep connection. Therefore, the collection expresses those precious cherished moments we all have with our close family and friends.Needham Bank, with five branches throughout the greater Boston area has named John Whittaker assistant vice president, customer & marketing analytics, operating from the main office in Needham.

Any visitor to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City should stop by Gallery 599 on their tour of the museum. It's a small gallery, to get there you simply descend a small flight of stairs tucked away in the back corner of one of the large medieval galleries. Gallery 599 is located by the door to the Ratti Textile Center, which houses all of the textiles in The Met's collections. A rotating exhibition showcasing small samplings of The Met's textiles is featured in the display cases surrounding the door to the Ratti Textile Center. It's a quick pitstop on your tour of the museum and always well worth a visit as you get to see some rarely viewed textile treasures.
One of the most famous and persistent images of the eighteenth century is a woman with an enormous tall wig decorated with ribbons, feathers, and all manner of figurines. Known as the pouf, this tall hairstyle is often cited as a visual representation of the excess of the 18th century. But these tall hairstyles were not just an example of extreme elite fashion. Often times these hairstyles were an expression of patriotism, politics, and the latest trends in culture. Today we may express our personalities and taste by wearing a T-shirt bearing the image of our favorite band, sports team, or the flag of our country. In the late 18th century, aristocratic women did the same thing using their hair.
Fashion has always had a strong relationship with new technology. In the late eighteenth century, looms ran on punch cards to weave complex textile designs-- the very first computing technology. In the nineteenth century, the discovery of synthetic dyes allowed fabrics to take on bright, eye-popping colors. In the twentieth century, an enormous range of textiles made from synthetic materials, each with its own unique benefits, flushed the market. And in the twenty-first century, designers are using 3-D printers to create new and innovative designs.
Fashion has also always had strong ties with the media. New trends need to be disseminated around the world somehow, be it by illustrations, photographs, or film. These days we can log on to youtube and watch the latest runway shows instantly, but the relationship between film and fashion stretches much farther back in time.
"Seven hundred of the best dressed women of Chicago viewed the oddities of the latest styles of Paul Poiret, 'the high priest of color and the master builder of gowns,' as they strutted across the cinematographic screen at the Blackstone hotel yesterday."
"The spectators gave due attention to each gown, criticizing, studying, praising, wondering. There was ample opportunity for study, for some of the gowns were exhibited several times before the final reel had wound itself up.
"Perhaps the article that brought forth the most exclamations was a huge muff. A circular piece of white ermine ran around the front of it and as the wearer came closer into the camera's focus the comment grew.
"'What is that white circle?' 'Looks like a life preserver.' "No. it's [sic] an automobile tire.' Then the model stood perfectly still and the seven hundred laughed. It was ventured that seven hundred black muffs with white ermine circles will be worn in Chicago this winter.
"There were also a few colored slides showing Poiret's color combinations-- women in blue serge and green trimming, in scarlet and black, in purple and white, in pink with an overdress of white, and in other shades that caused several dressmakers a few gasps of delight."
In my work as curatorial assistant at the Chicago History Museum I was fortunate enough to study two beautiful court presentation gowns from the 1920s. I blogged about those dresses and the ritual of the court presentation on the Chicago History Museum Blog. But I also thought there was a bigger story to be told, and so I continue the story of these two gowns here on The Fashion Historian..
Hello dear readers!
To kick The Fashion Historian back into gear after this rather long hiatus I will be hosting this month's edition of Carnivalesque!
What is Carnivalesque? It's an interdisciplinary blog carnival for history blogs focusing on pre-modern history (to c. 1800). So if you would like to nominate a blog or a particular blog post to be included in this month's Carnivalesque, send me a message using the form here. Remember, the point is to be as interdisciplinary as possible so blogs focused on ANY part of history will be considered!
The carnival itself will be posted on July 26th. Happy nominating!!
As a fashion historian, I find that an interesting aspect of Disney is how the animated features serve as records of the visual culture of their day. The Disney Princesses, a successful sub-franchise launched by Disney in the late 1990s, are everywhere these days. They have not been without controversy, but they are certainly popular. They are also records of changing standards of beauty for women in the 20th century. This post series will discuss selected Disney Princesses, exploring how they embody the ideals of femininity of their time.

I recently read this article by Lisa Bloom, called How to Talk to Little Girls. It's a quick and interesting read but the gist of it is that the author recently met the five-year-old daughter of a friend, and had to stop herself from complimenting the little girl's appearance. Instead, she started talking about books, in the hopes that this little girl would learn that her mind is valued more than her appearance. Bloom also gives some troubling statistics about the girls and women of America:
.The second paragraph is the crux of her argument and I completely agree. We need to stop valuing women based solely on their appearance, and we need to teach girls to be happy with themselves, whatever shape or size they may be.."
"Alas, it was about girls and what they wore, and how their wardrobe choices defined their identities. But after Maya closed the final page, I steered the conversation to the deeper issues in the book: mean girls and peer pressure and not going along with the group."
This afternoon I was interviewed for a segment on AirTalk about the increasing informality of dress in today's society. This is an enormous topic with many contributing factors, but one thing the host mentioned is that in America, informality in dress could be connected to the (supposed) lack of a class system. I agreed, and believe that the mythological identity of America as a place where everyone is equal has been influential on our dress. I referenced an eighteenth-century portrait where one of America's founding fathers is dressed informally. The painting I was thinking of was this portrait of Paul Revere by John Singleton Copley.G-Technology G-RAID mini2 SSD review

2003 Chevrolet Monte Carlo • 128,000 miles
Engine overheats when I use the AC.
When the car overheats are any of your cooling fans running?If so which ones?
Fans seem to be running, but when the AC is turned on I hear a lot of clicking and the idle goes up and down. Also having trouble logging in and out.
Check and see if that clicking is the a/c compressor cycling on and off?Also when its overheating are both fans running on high?Is there a lot of air being pulled thru them?Have you checked the radiator and a/c condensor for being blocked with plastic bags debris like sand dirt animal fur etc?Sometimes it's hard to see the blockage of the fins. Also what size engine do you have?
Yes it is a 3.4 motor. The clicking is the AC compressor cycling on and off. The fans are running but do not seem to change speeds at all. Did not find anything blocking the radiater.
OK I just went out and checked out the fans behind the radiater. The one on the passenger side spins freely. The one on the drivers side does not spin at all.
If the fan motor is frozen up solid and wont turn then sounds like you have a bad fan motor I would replace it. Sounds like that is your problem causing thr overheating and a/c compressor to cycle from too high of pressure from the fan being inop.
I believe that is the problem. Thanks for the help. I remember having that replaced last october, I'll check to see if it is warranteed. Thanks again!
Your welcome thats what were here for keep me posted on if that fixs the problem.
Just got back from the shop that repaired the car last Oct. And they will fix it free of charge. It is the cooling fan assembly. I was very surprised they were so nice and apologetic. Thanks again your diagnosis was right on.
Your welcome thats what were here for. If you decide to make a donation please make sure you say this is for saturntech9 that way I get credit for it.

FAQs
Field Experience in General. For basic information about the field experience, consult the Field Experience Starter Kit or the MA in International Studies Handbook.
1. How long are international field experiences typically?
International field experiences should be at least 10 weeks. We recommend that you spend the entire period in one culture and at one time. Other arrangements, however, are possible. Consult with the Field Experience Supervisor.
2. I have already spent a period of time in an international setting (e.g. undergraduate study abroad, military service, professional activities). Does this count toward my international field experience? Remember that students don't receive credit for the time that they spend in an international setting. They receive credit for successful completion of the field experience portfolio. In exceptional cases, students will be allowed to use a prior field experience as the basis for their portfolio. Students with prior international experience may want to discuss this possibility with the MA in International Studies Field Experience Supervisor. 3. What are the necessary steps in applying for a visa to travel to another country? Assistance with visa procedures is available from the Office of International Affairs. Consult Ms. Rhonda Brown. 4. Can I purchase health insurance for the period that I will be out of the country? Low cost health insurance is available through the Office of International Affairs. 5. Are there any other formalities that I need to take care of before leaving on my field experience? You must complete and sign a liability waiver form before leaving. A copy is available on the MA in International Studies Director's personal web page or from the Office of International Affairs. 6. How do I receive credit for the two field experience classes? How will I be graded?
Students do not receive credit merely for the time they spend in an international experience, whether on an immersion program or an internship. They receive credit for completing the field experience portfolio satisfactorily under the supervision of the Field Experience Supervisor, who currently directs the MA in International Studies Program.
The grading criteria can be found in the MA in International Studies Handbook, which is available on-line.
7. If something goes wrong while doing the internship or study immersion, will I be able to communicate with MA in International Studies directors and seek help/guidance? You should report to the MA in International Studies Field Experience Supervisor at regular intervals during the field experience (e.g., by e-mail, fax, letter). An on-site supervisor is highly recommended where possible; this person can provide us with a second contact in case of an emergency. 8. When would be a good time to register for fall classes if I am in a location for the summer where there is no Internet access?
You can register for fall classes when you return from your internship. You should, however, have already discussed the courses that you plan to take with the MA in International Studies director before leaving for your internship or during your field experience if only be mail.
9. Does ECU provide students going overseas with any assistance in finding someone to sublet their apartments in Greenville?
ECU does not have any office that provides this assistance. Many students post announcements offering subleases on bulletin boards around campus. You can also inform the Graduate School Office of Student Services that you have an apartment available for sublease.
10. Will my immersion program instructors or by on-site field experience supervisors be willing to write me letters of recommendation?
Most likely they will. We suggest that you ask for such letters of recommendation before you return to the United States.
Study Abroad/Foreign Language Immersion
11. What kinds of classes are offered in immersion programs abroad?
Typical immersion programs focus on language and culture courses
12. Are the grades from a study abroad immersion program incorporated into my GPA? Can I receive (transfer) credit for study abroad courses?
Grades for courses transferred into the program do not count in your GPA. Credit can only be received for courses taken in an international setting if they are at the graduate level. You can transfer in a maximum of 6 graduate credits from an accredited institution.
13. If pursuing a non-thesis option, could I study abroad and take the required foreign language courses?
The courses required for the non-thesis option in Advanced Language and Culture are graduate courses. It is possible to take graduate level language, literature and culture courses at a foreign university. However, not many American universities have overseas graduate programs, and those that do may not allow students from other universities to take their courses for credit. It might be possible to enroll in graduate courses at foreign universities, but transferring credit might be difficult. You should consult with the MA in International Studies Director and the appropriate study abroad director in the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures.
14. Are the students typically undergraduates or graduate students? Are they all from ECU or from a variety of schools?
Most study abroad/language immersion programs are for undergraduates. Some programs, however, admit a range of students: undergraduates, graduate, non-degree, non-traditional. Typically the students come from a variety of schools.
15. Where will I be staying while studying abroad?
Participants of study abroad programs typically find housing of different sorts. Some programs house their students with families. Other programs provide rooms in residence halls. Other programs expect students to find their own accommodations, usually in shared apartments.
16. When would be the best time to have my language skills assessed?
You should have your language skills assessed initially as soon as you enter the MA in International Studies Program, but certainly before you undertake any immersion experience. You should have your skills assessed again as soon as you return from your immersion experience or your internship.
Top
Internships
17. What kinds of internships are available?
Internships can be with small companies, corporations, non-governmental organizations, or government agencies.
18. Can I expect to be paid by the organization/company sponsoring my internship?
Most internships are unpaid. You will be expected to pay your own transportation to the internship site and your lodging/meal expenses during your internship. You may even have to pay a fee if an agency or organization arranges an internship for you.
19. How do I find internship possibilities? How do I make the arrangements for an internship?
The MA in International Studies webpage lists a number of organizations that arrange internships as well as government agencies and non-governmental organizations. Check their web pages for more information.
20. Your ECU professors are also a good source of internship possibilities. Ask them for contacts within their professional network.
Another very important source of internship possibilities is your own network of connections, both personal and professional. Don't forget to ask your family
21. What internships are available for non-U.S. citizens? Which internships tend to require U.S. citizenship?
Citizenship requirements vary. You should check the websites of the organizations offering the internships for more information.
22. If the company/organization with which I intern offers me a position for another semester, could I return to the MAIS program after that time?
Yes.
23. If the internship runs over the beginning of fall/spring semester, will I be able to miss a couple of classes in order to complete the program?
You should arrange with the organization/company sponsoring your internship to complete it before the beginning of the following semester. It is unlikely that your professors will allow you to miss several weeks of a graduate-level course.
24. If the internship requires that I produce some form of final report, will I be able to incorporate it in my field experience portfolio?
Any documents or reports that you produce as part of your internship can be included as part of the documentation for your field experience portfolio. If your internship is part of a course for your concentration, your professor may allow you to use your report in his/her course.
Portfolio
25. What type of information should I collect during the field experience that is pertinent to the portfolio?
You should keep a journal during your field experience. This journal is not your portfolio, but it can serve as a basis for your portfolio essays. You should also collect any pertinent documentation, e.g., letters of recommendation from your on-site supervisors, reports/documents that you create while on your field experience, information about the organization with which you worked.
26. Should I be working on the portfolio while I am abroad, or should I just focus on gathering data to bring back home and work on the portfolio then? Write your background statement of intent for your field experience and have it reviewed and approved by the MA in International Studies Field Experience Supervisor before you leave. Also, plan to keep a weekly journal while you are abroad. Besides being a great keepsake, a thorough journal is vital to the process of creating your field experience portfolio. 27. How can I relate the different theories studied in class to my everyday experiences in a foreign country? One of the great challenges you face as a foreigner is connecting what you learn about the culture from books and other sources with your everyday experiences. Analytical writing relates the theoretical knowledge you gained from the classroom to your personal experiences in another culture. Use concepts, perspectives, theories, etc. from your core MA in International Studies courses in your analytical writing. Analytical writing transforms your understanding by placing your experiences in a coherent historical or theoretical framework. In analytical writing, you strive to explain why an experience took place or why you disagree with certain customs, rituals, or values. The exercise may help to resolve apparently contradictory observations and help you gain an understanding of "why things are as they are." 28. What is the deadline for turning in my portfolio?
You should not wait until you have written all your portfolio essays before turning in any work to the Field Experience Supervisor. You should submit drafts of the essays to her at regular intervals after you return from your field experience so that she can help you improve them. Multiple drafts are not only allowed, they are routine.
Currently incompletes for INTL 6930 and INTL 6940 must be removed within one year of the end of the semester in which you enroll in these courses.

New England Maple Chicken SaladPlans underway to remove ash trees
The city of Fairfield and Alliant Energy are partnering to remove ash trees from the city-owned parking.
Alliant Energy line clearance inspector Morgan Poole met with Fairfield public works superintendent Darrel Bisgard and city councilor Michael Halley Monday morning to discuss removing the ash trees. Some of the city’s ash trees are infected with the emerald ash borer, and the city believes it will lose all its ash trees to the insect in just a few years.
At Monday’s meeting, Poole said Alliant crews are willing to remove any infested ash tree that interferes with a power line, but will only remove trees approved by the city.
Halley said the city follows an unwritten rule of planting two trees for every tree it removes from the right-of-way. He said the city council plans to formalize this policy by updating the tree ordinance before spring. Residents who wish to plant in the right-of-way must contact city hall to receive a permit. This ensures no utility lines will be damaged and that the species of tree is appropriate for the location.
Bisgard, Halley and Poole studied a map that showed where ash trees are in the city right-of-way. It includes those growing into Alliant power lines. This map was produced by the Department of Natural Resources, and Alliant has plans to conduct its own inventory of the ash trees in town.
Halley said as the infested trees are removed around town, the branches will be ground into mulch while the larger pieces will be kept for firewood. The public works department is working with the Arbor Committee to develop a list of individuals who will take fallen trees. Anyone interested may contact city hall at 472-6193..
The city council has formally recommended residents not use insecticide to kill the ash borer because it harms other animals and because the insecticide lingers in the soil. Halley said the negative side effects of insecticide are not worth the benefits.
Burlington is about to ban its residents from using soil-drenching insecticides. Halley said no one has proposed such a ban in Fairfield, yet. He said such insecticides are not good for urban environments where the trees are close together.Jay C Hendrick, 87

ooha, okay, thanks for fixing that. OsierOAKLAND -- One day after Jean Quan got her share of Bronx cheers during a forum about the Occupy movement, both the mayor and forum organizers expressed no regrets about what transpired at the Commonwealth Club.
"When you're the mayor of the whole city, you have to talk to everybody," Quan said Friday. "It was a chance to talk and have a dialogue."
Quan, who was joined on the panel by three Occupy organizers and a professor, found herself in the cross hairs of audience members, many of whom had stayed at the encampments in Oakland and San Francisco.
Twice Occupy supporters shouted at Quan -- first to challenge her definition of an anarchist and later to demand her recall during an 80-minute panel discussion. Two audience members were escorted out of the forum.
It was the most raucous crowd Caroline Moriarity Sacks can recall during her seven years with the Commonwealth Club, but she still considered the event a success. "I don't regret doing it for one second," she said. "We fostered a debate."
Quan, who said Oakland has spent $5 million dealing with the Occupy encampment, offered no regret during the forum over evicting protesters from Frank H. Ogawa Plaza last month.
She praised them for furthering progressive goals like increasing taxes on the rich but criticized factions within Occupy Oakland for not disavowing violence or considering the needs of small business owners who she said suffered during the encampment.
"Chinatown immigrant restaurants are not the rich, and if you can't define the 99 percent better than that, that's a problem with the movement," she said.
The Occupy protests have damaged Quan politically, alienating her from both longtime progressive supporters angry that she twice ordered the Oakland camp evicted and from business leaders upset that she allowed the encampment to persist for weeks.
The mayor has especially become a lightning rod for Occupy participants, several of whom turned their back to her as she spoke and later led chants of "Recall Quan."
"Quan was treated in the way in which one could expect her to be treated," said UC Berkeley Linguistics Professor and fellow panelist George Lakoff. "Yeah, she got heckled, but it wasn't terrible heckling."
Lakoff urged Occupy supporters to take a page out of the tea party playbook and join Democratic Party organizations gearing up for elections. "If you can run an encampment, you can run a campaign," he told them.
Quan made little attempt to make inroads with adversaries in the audience.
When an audience member asked Quan if she thought her husband had engaged in "economic terrorism" by being present at the first port protest, the mayor said her husband was part of a group trying to prevent violence and added, "we've been political activists since we were teenagers. You can respect that or not."
Several panelists directed their comments to the mayor. Nadim Haida, who has participated at several Occupy encampments told Quan, "we're no long asking for your permission to tolerate or not tolerate anything. This is about a reclamation, an insurrection and taking back what is ours."

This project seeks to provide a fuller picture of the way that European Romantic texts functioned in American intellectual, cultural, and religious history by highlighting a group of “Cautious Romantics” that emerged as an alternative and conservative Romantic religious tradition in America between 1800 and the late 19th century. They retained a commitment to a settled social order and embraced the Trinitarian Christianity long since abandoned by the Transcendentalists and their Unitarian predecessors. This program will focus on how the Dana Family functions as a critical lens through which one can view the larger Cautious Romantic discourse.close
Between August 1918 and August 1919, Cohasset, Mass., native Margaret Hall served as a volunteer in the canteen service with the Red Cross in France. Using letters, diaries, and photographs, she created an unusual typescript, Letters and Photographs from the Battle Country, 1918-1919, when she returned home from the Great War. Pasted opposite the relevant sections of the narrative are roughly 281 photographs and other memorabilia. Starting in August 1918, Hall captured in rich detail her passage from New York to France, her pursuit of a Red Cross posting as close to the front as possible, and then her day-to-day experiences at a canteen at Châlons sur Marne, where she continued to work for a number of months following the Armistice in November 1918. Her photographs document a significant range of her war experience, from the quotidian life at Châlons sur Marne to the exploration of battlefields at Longwy and Verdun.

Young people fueled American democracy at its most popular. Between 1840 and 1900, children, youths and young adults turned out at rallies and elections, searching for identity, advancement, and fun. Many viewed the political system as a route to adulthood, during a period of major social instability. At the same time, politicians wooed first-time “virgin voters,” lobbied young women to influence the men in their lives, and recruited children as future partisans. Their interest helped bring about the highest voter turnouts in U.S. history. This project explores this fascinating and forgotten relationship between public politics and personal aspirations

this wiki
Imoen was a young female human who was raised in Candlekeep. She was also a Bhaalspawn, though this remained unrevealed for some time even after it was revealed that the other ward of Gorion living in Candlekeep was one. Imoen travelled with them for a time before the prophecy of the Bhaalspawn was fulfilled.
AppearanceEdit
Imoen was of slight build,[2] with long hair and pale skin.[3]
The GamesEdit
Imoen is a party NPC in the computer roleplaying games Baldur's Gate, Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn and Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal. She is the protagonist's first companion after Gorion's murder.
BiographyEdit
Imoen was the player character's closest friend and nearly only peer when they were growing up in Candlekeep. She was brought in much like them, an orphan adopted by Gorion, but ten years later in life. Of her past, even less is ever mentioned than of the protagonist's. She was close to Gorion, but preferred the company of the innkeeper Winthrop, possibly due to her own carefree and not very serious nature. She seems to have picked up thief skills even when already living in the citadel; a remark of hers suggests that she was in the habit of pickpocketing the monks there.
Imoen left Candlekeep at the same time as the protagonist, when both were about twenty. Gorion had received a letter from Elminster that warned him that Sarevok, who knew the player character was a Bhaalspawn, would move against them soon, and prompted them to leave to seek shelter elsewhere. Though she cannot have understood much of the letter, Imoen followed the pair after reading it, and witnessed Gorion's murder by Sarevok's hand. After this, she joined the protagonist and stuck with them faithfully until the end of the conflict with Sarevok.
During the campaign against Sarevok, the player character's Bhaalspawn nature was revealed, explaining both Sarevok's interest in them and their strange dreams and developing array of spell-like abilities. Imoen, however, was beset upon neither by Sarevok nor her own Bhaalspawn essence; her good cheer and innocence temporarily protected her from the influence of the latter, and almost no-one knew or suspected that she shared the taint. One person who did, or at least found out, was Jon Irenicus, who captured the whole party, killing or imprisoning the rest but conducting painful experiments on the protagonist and Imoen in a hideout below Waukeen's Promenade in Athkatla. His goal was to extract the two Bhaalspawn's divine souls to counter the curse put upon him and his ally Bodhi. He put Imoen through some mental torture, including forcing her to watch as he dissected her friend Khalid, in order to bring out the taint in her. This left her confused and with a peculiar fascination with death she herself found disturbing.
Before Irenicus could complete his experimentation, his hideout was attacked by Shadow Thieves, who rightly saw him as an ally to Bodhi's vampire thieves' guild that was competing with them. Irenicus proceeded to destroy most of them single-handedly in a prolonged battle, but right at the beginning of it, Imoen's cell was damaged, and she was able to slip free. She went on to let out the player character, and they escaped together. They also found Jaheira and Minsc of their old companions trapped nearby. The remaining two party members, Khalid and Dynaheir, had both been killed. Making their way through Irenicus's twisted dungeon, the group also ran into Yoshimo, who claimed to have been captured like they.
When the group finally made it out of the dungeon, it was to find Irenicus battling a number of assassins, after which he turned his attention to them. Imoen attacked him with magic just before a group of Cowled Wizards teleported in to stop the magical disturbance and arrest those responsible. After killing several of them in a matter of seconds, Irenicus conceded to go with them, but only under the condition that Imoen be taken as well. Since all arcane spellcasting in Athkatla without a license is forbidden, the wizards complied, teleporting away with their prisoners. The two were examined, pronounced deviants, and taken to Spellhold.
After languishing in the wizard asylum for some time, with no sign of rescue by the player character, Imoen was again approached by Irenicus, who by then had taken control of the entire institution. He set up a complicated, technical ritual that parted Imoen of the majority of her soul and infused it into Bodhi. Imoen was left nearly senseless, alternating between morbid dullness and aggression.
When, after a series of adventures, the protagonist finally arrived at Spellhold, the mage captured them and repeated the same process as he had done with Imoen, stealing their soul for himself. He then ordered Bodhi to dispose of their entire party and Imoen. Imoen regained her senses around this time and naturally asked to join the party again when a chance to escape presented itself. They got out of Spellhold because Bodhi wanted to hunt them for sport in the dungeons below but was driven away when the player character's uncontrolled taint caused them to transform in to the Slayer. Imoen, not possessed of such strong Bhaal essence or willpower, suffered no such dramatic effects. Her soul was eventually recovered when Bodhi was destroyed.
Imoen also appears in a number of the player character's dreams during Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn. At first, she seems to represent herself, speaking dreamily not unlike the way she does after Irenicus's treatment. During Irenicus's ritual to steal the player character's soul, she appears in a dream sequence where they have to lure a representation of Bhaal within themselves to her sight in order to defeat it, and seems to represent their own independent soul. Finally, after the player character has already turned into Slayer unwillingly, their dream features a version of Imoen that speaks for the uncontrolled taint within them, telling them to become a mindless killing machine; after this, the protagonist gains the ability to assume the form of the Slayer of their own will.
Imoen may, if so chosen, follow the protagonist on into Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal, or be summoned into their party in the Pocket Plane. There, she may also be used to donate an insignificantly small portion of her soul to resurrect Sarevok. During this story, her Bhaalspawn essence will finally begin to show the same way as her sibling's, in the form of disturbing dreams and urges and developing powers. (These show up through dialogues with the player character; in an unmodified version of the game, they don't activate properly.) At the end, she will willingly relinquish her share of the essence of Bhaal.
If Imoen is with the party at the end, her ending story tells she will go on her own first back to Candlekeep, but then further north, and eventually become both a Harper and an Archmage, associating with others like her such as Elminster and Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun, occasionally seen to be telling them to stop being such stick-in-the-muds. She grows in power and influence, spawning rumours that she founded her own thieves' guild which operated from Tethyr to Neverwinter - but when asked about it, she cheerfully avoids the subject.
Traits and AbilitiesEdit
Right from the first, Imoen is a very useful party member. In Baldur's Gate, she starts out as a 1st-level thief, meaning that the player is free to develop her thief skills as they see fit. She also has very good abilities overall, including high charisma that may be helpful in getting positive reactions from NPC's, and high intelligence that allows her to dual-class as a mage. In Baldur's Gate II, that's just what she has done, retaining enough thief skills to deal with traps and locks tolerably even as the difficulty of the game rises. As a mage, she will eventually grow truly powerful if taken through the game and expansion. Her level as mage does not lag much behind single-class wizards.
Imoen is cheerful and friendly, sometimes intentionally childish, and often annoying in a way befitting a little sister (though she's not significantly younger than the player character). Facing Irenicus and her Bhaalspawn essence makes her more troubled and uncertain, but the innocence that allowed her to avoid the effects of the taint never really disappears, even if she becomes more jaded at the same time. She's loyal to the player character and will usually stick with them no matter what, given the chance.
Voice ActingEdit
Imoen is voiced by Melissa Disney.

The NovelsEdit
Imoen grew up in Candlekeep together with Abdel Adrian, becoming friends with him in spite of his often cruel teasing of her. When he left out into the world to become a mercenary, she stayed behind. They met again at least after he had killed Sarevok, as they were both captured by Jon Irenicus and the Shadow Thieves. Irenicus was aware that they were Bhaalspawn and wished to turned them into avatars of Bhaal in order to use them to attack Suldanessellar. They found themselves imprisoned along with Jaheira who had been with Adrian, and some others whose reason for being present in the dungeon is not known. The deal between Irenicus and the Shadow Thieves went sour, there was some fighting, and Adrian escaped, but Imoen, Jaheira and Irenicus were all detained by the Cowled Wizards and taken to Spellhold. Adrian came to rescue them soon after, but ran straight into Irenicus's trap. Both he and Imoen were transformed into monsters that slaughtered everyone present except Jaheira, forcing Irenicus to flee. Imoen escaped the asylum with the two others, ending up in the Underdark. There, they encountered the silver dragon Adalon, who disguised them as drow so that they might infiltrate Ust Natha and recover her eggs. During their stay there, Phaere ordered Imoen to sleep with her, which she seemed to find quite palatable. After the three had escaped the Underdark, Imoen was eventually captured by Irenicus, who finally turned her into an avatar of Bhaal as per his plans and sent it to attack the elves of Suldanessellar. Fortunately, Adrian was able to save her by ripping the avatar to pieces, revealing her underneath. She subsequently helped call him back from "hell", which was achieved by calling his name and digging the ground until his head came up.
Later, after she had escaped and left Irenicus far behind her, Imoen joined Abdel in killing Illasera, a female Bhaalspawn, one of the five that wished to bring their father back after Sarevok's death. She was subsequently killed before all of the Five were destroyed.

And then I got to thinking. There’s a sixth way to really motivate your team.
Image by Steve Jurvetson
My thought focuses on and expands Jon’s point number 3 – Share The Vision.
When your company has a vision it is important that you share the vision and share it often. You need to make sure your team knows the direction of the company and where it will end up. Otherwise they’ll lose hope and start to wander.
But, as a leader, sharing the vision is only the first step in the right direction. You need to LIVE the vision.
If you’re not living out the vision, your team will notice. They’ll become disillusioned and discouraged.
They need you to step up to the plate.
“Leaders establish the vision for the future and set the strategy for getting there; they cause change. They motivate and inspire others to go in the right direction and they, along with everyone else, sacrifice to get there.”
— John Kotter
You need to model the vision for your team. Show them how it’s down.
As you model living the vision for your team, they’ll see it’s not just talk. They’ll see you mean business.
One by one, your team members will begin to step on board. Buy-in will begin to happen.
They’ll know that they’re not alone and that you’re willing to get dirty and do the tough work as well.
Your excitement and desire to see the vision fulfilled builds the motivation of those you lead.
Nothing, and I mean nothing, inspires and encourages the team like the leader joining in and taking part in the vision.
Become the leader that takes part in the battle he asks others to fight.
“Motivation is everything. You can do the work of two people, but you can’t be two people. Instead, you have to inspire the next guy down the line and get him to inspire his people.”
— Lee Iacocca
Question: How do you live out the vision you have laid out for your team? Please share your thoughts in the comment section below.Shocking Crowbar Mod

Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust runs Andover War Memorial Hospital, Basingstoke and North Hampshire Hospital and Royal Hampshire County Hospital and is supported by 500 volunteers at all three sites plus the Countess of Brecknock Hospice in Andover.
Chief executive Mary Edwards said: “We are extremely grateful to all of our volunteers for the difference they make to patients, and to the partner organisations such as Royal Voluntary Service, the League of Friends, the British Red Cross and Hospital Radio, whose volunteers also provide regular support.
“These tea parties are a small way of saying thank you.”
Adam Lamb has been volunteering in the outpatients department at Andover War Memorial Hospital for six months.
He started volunteering because he needed experience, which would help him get into university and make a start on his future career as a paramedic.
His role includes meeting and greeting patients, helping them find their way and making them feel welcome and reassured as they attend the hospital.
Adam said: “Every week I get a sense of achievement from my role.
“I’m proud to be a young person taking an active role within my community.
“I’ve gained really valuable experience in not only working within a hospital but working with people.”
Alan Jones and Les Levine volunteer at a drop-in hearing aid clinic within outpatients.
Both retired they wanted to be able to be involved in their local hospital and be able to give something back to their community.
Alan and Les meet patients when they arrive, carry out basic checks on hearing aids, change batteries and t a k e patients to see the audiologists.
Some former patients volunteer to assist the Foundation Trust’s therapists and nurses with cardiac rehabilitation exercise sessions. The presence of people who have been on a similar journey provides reassurance and confidence to patients who have had heart problems or surgery.
Cardiac rehabilitation is another example of where volunteering has helped someone gain relevant experience for a career – S a m a n t h a Meredith was qualified in sports science before she began volunteering in 2011, but has since gained her Cardiac Rehab Exercise Instructor qualification and is now employed by Hampshire Hospitals as a part time exercise instructor.

HUNTINGTON -- The Marshall University School of Medicine launched a taxi service on Feb. 1, three weeks after a 24-year-old female student was robbed and beaten while walking home from class.
The attack on Jan. 9 took place at 7 p.m. between the 1300 and 1400 blocks of 15th Street, as she walked home from the Erma Ora Byrd Clinic.
The free taxi service is available 24 hours a day and will be used on a trial basis for at least six months to determine how useful it is to the students. Students also have access to the Cabell Huntington Hospital's shuttle, along with a personal escort service to vehicles parked in the hospital lots after 2:30 a.m.
The taxi service is provided by Metro Tri State, which serves Huntington and the surrounding areas of Southern Ohio and Kentucky. The primary number is 740-451-4994, and the emergency number is 740-451-4995.
For more information, students can call Marie Veitia, the associate dean of Student Affairs, at 304-691-17.Current Ithaca College community members may contribute stories and comments as well as view additional topics by logging in.

THE BLU-RAY
Visual:
The AVC encoded image (2.35:1 aspect ratio) presentation is tasked with articulating the film's sensual and procedural cinematography, with the viewing experience bouncing back and forth from romance to examination. Colors are sustained in full, communicating the historical romance of Venice, while taking special note of costumes and beautiful people. Blues and reds are especially potent (Jolie's lips pop right off the screen, as they usually do), along with a lush amber glow, with confident shadow detail keeping the picture's extensive use of black in play, making sense out of evening adventures. Skintones are natural while sustaining that movie star glow. Detail is hearty, allowing a full survey of locations and ornate costuming. Gorgeous actors and gorgeous locations make for a satisfying HD event.
Audio:
The 5.1 DTS-HD mix truly embraces the nuances of the thriller genre, with a welcome blend of dialogue and scoring that keeps the audio activity perpetually on the move. Once the action heats up, the track heightens with an engrossing swirl of sound effects and generous Venice atmospherics, supplying a rich location experience while tightening the visuals once guns are drawn and chases begin. Verbal exchanges are warm and crisp, setting the appropriate mood with a slightly more circular feel, while office sequence benefit from busy surround activity. Low-end is useful to convey movement, but not deployed in full, while music stays fresh and supportive, selling tonal changes with confidence. DVS and French tracks are also included.
Subtitles:
English, English SDH, French, and Spanish subtitles are offered.
Extras:
The feature-length audio commentary from director Florian Henckel von Donnersmark was recorded on the film's opening day of theatrical release, so a true reflection on the entire moviemaking process is missing here. However, the filmmaker is a jovial fellow who confidently explores the formation of his film, pointing out location and casting quirks, while admitting a few geeky secrets that make the man instantly likable (e.g. Timothy Dalton was cast in a supporting role due to the director's love of "The Rocketeer," while some of the picture's science was cribbed from "321 Contact"). While it's a guarded conversation, the helmer provides a good amount of BTS information, while expressing what it's like to be around his two superstars. He also challenges viewers to find better train greenscreen work than what's viewed in the picture, surprisingly supplying an e-mail address that allows film fans an opportunity to prove him wrong. Brave.
"Canal Chats" (6:01) talks to cast and crew on the water, hyping up the splendor of Venice while speeding around the city on a boat. While the conversations are celebratory, talk switches to technical challenges, especially with a metropolis as complicated as Venice.
"A Gala Affair" (7:12) spotlights the work of production designer John Huttman, who turned Venice architectural wonder into a glamorous ball for the film's final act. Conversation eventually turns to costume design, exploring the purpose behind fabrics and the challenge of extras, while also touching on choreography and scoring.
"Action in Venice" (6:29) delves into the difficulty of staging conflict in the city, with special environmental demands hampering cinematic chaos, requiring the filmmaker to get creative when planning these special moments of pursuit.
"Bringing Glamour Back" (9:08) is a convincing summation of the production effort, with cast and crew interviews discussing the Venice experience. The concentration here is on classic Hollywood flair, with lavish locations meeting a romantic fantasy tone, supplied by enthusiastic film professionals.
"Tourist Destination: Travel the Canals of Venice" (3:17) is a flat-out valentine for the city, with cast and crew interviews spreading the love about the location.
"Alternate Animated Title Sequence" (2:14) is an odd and wisely cut bit of graphic summary, looking to give viewers a slightly more welcoming opener.
"Outtake Reel" (1:26) is a brief collection of mix-em-ups, displaying a few giggle fits and general camaraderie.
A Theatrical Trailer has not been included.
FINAL THOUGHTS
Puzzling identities, double-crosses, and rooftop chases? Perhaps. "The Tourist" is far more compelling in a playfully sensual state, fixating on chemistry rather than uninspired thriller mechanics.Kate felt guilty pulling up plants with produce still on them…but she could barely pass off fried green tomatoes to her family let alone frost bitten green tomatoes. Besides, the onset of fireplace season conveniently coincided with the onset of gardening boredom. The novelty had finally worn off.
This was only Kate’s second gardening attempt of her adult life. Still very naïve about this whole gardening thing, she figured it would provide her with the quiet, meditative time glaringly missing from her daily routine. That, and put a few fresh vegetables on the dinner table for her kids to whine about.
She envisioned gardening being an almost spiritual experience—silently praying for friends and reflecting on the miracles in nature as she thinned seedlings, picked peppers and poisoned insects.
Except now her children, who typically became invisible or comatose whenever the words, “I need your help.” were spoken; wanted to be super duper hands on helpers. Kate’s garden became, instead of a haven, a hotbed of activity.
The kids gave tours to their friends, the mailman and the meter reader. They developed a new and intense interest in soil content, the gestation period of eggplant and city watering restrictions. Without being asked, they picked ripe produce. They put out buckets when it rained and used them to water the garden. Without being asked. For the love of God, on their own accord, they even pulled weeds.
One day, Kate’s little suburban farmers schlepped into the freshly mopped kitchen with a colander full of lettuce and shoes full of mud. “Mom, the garden’s watered, fertilized and treated with Sevin dust. We tied up the tomato plants since they’re growing faster now and according to the Extension Agency, it’s time to plant pumpkin seeds. Where are they?”
So much for my peaceful garden paradise, Kate lamented, but ended her pity party early when she realized this was finally something she and the kids enjoyed doing together. Realizing how rare it was to have the three of them agree on a single activity, Kate went out and spent $100 on kids garden gloves, scaled down garden tools, hats, kid safe bug repellent, sunscreen and plant markers. She came home excited to bond with her children in the sacred soil of the earth.
But then it was too hot to garden. “The trick is to get out early in the morning when the air is still and the sun is low in the sky.” They said summer was for sleeping in.
And the bugs were really getting bad. “I bought you repellent. Use it.” They said it smelled funny and made them itch.
Plus it’s hard to get the dirt out from under their fingernails. “Use the gloves I got you.” They interfered with their grip. Besides, all their friends were going to the pool…couldn’t they join them? Kate conceded and sent them off with the hats and sunscreen….left once again in the solitude of her garden.
Best $100 she ever spent.Business Type: Trading Company Main Products: Ball pen,Roller pen,Fountain pen,Pencil,Pen parts Location: Zhejiang, China (Mainland) Year Established: 2010 Year start exporting: 2013 Number Of Employees: 101 - 200 People Total Annual Sales Volume: Above US$100 Million Main Markets: Oceania, Africa, South Asia, Domestic Market, North America Average Lead Time: 15 Day(s) Yiwu Troy Pen Co., Ltd., established in 1992, is located in Yiwu Commodity Market of China.

LAWRENCEVILLE - In the case of a natural disaster, the first 72 hours is crunch time.With spring peeking its flowery head over the horizon, officials with Gwinnett County Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency (EMA) are reminding citizens it's nearly the season of tornadoes, lightning, floods and the year's most unforgiving thunderstorms. The local EMA points to a National Weather Service initiative called "Severe Weather Awareness Week" as a one-stop shop for emergency wisdom. The weeklong observance, which begins today, encourages Georgians to practice emergency preparedness and response procedures - especially as they pertain to the critical first 72 hours. That's how long it could take emergency workers to reach you should bridges and roads give out in the face of floods, tornadoes or, later in the year, hurricanes, said Maj. Alan Doss, Gwinnett's EMA director. The observance kicks off with Family Preparedness Day, which Doss calls the "perfect time for every family to plan and rehearse what they should do during the first 72 hours of any severe, weather-related event or disaster." A good starting point, Doss said, is a statewide preparedness campaign - the Georgia EMA's "Ready Georgia" - that gives the imperative info residents need to make emergency supply kits, develop communication plans and stay attuned to potential threats. (Learn more at.) "The benefit of being self-sufficient for 72 hours is that your and your family can survive circumstances that might otherwise be tragic," Doss said. Following today's focus on the family awareness topic, Severe Weather Awareness Week shifts gears to examine NOAA Weather Radio (Monday), Thunderstorm Safety (Tuesday), Tornado Safety (Wednesday), Lightning Safety (Thursday), Flooding (Friday) and SKYWARN (Saturday.) For more information, contact the Gwinnett County EMA at 770-513-5227 or visit them online at.

"'I feel charged!" says the man in the electric chair. A great Guy Maddin film will do that to you - and make no mistake, this is one of his great ones. Maddin's mad melange of melodramatic ghosts and meddlesome mobsters frames a memory tour like none other, exploding two genres with one powerful pop. Jason Patric is homeriffic as Ulysses, a charismatic gangster whose violent personal odyssey returns him to his haunted home, therein to confront the restless spirits and animated bodies who haunt him." -- The Toronto Star
"3 1/2 Stars. Surreal, sensational and weird, the film is pure maddeningly, magic Maddin. Winnipeg's Guy Maddin remains the most innovative, maddeningly, magic Maddin. Winnipeg's Guy Maddin remains the most innovative, high-risk gambler in Canadian cinema." -- Toronto Sun
"At times as creepy as THE SHINING." -- Gavin Smith, Film Comment
"3 Stars." -- The Globe and Mail
"Everything you could possibly want from a Guy Maddin endeavour is intact, and when it peaks, KEYHOLE is a wildly unique and enthralling as his best work." -- Exclain.Ca
"3 Skulls" -- Fangoria
"There's certainly an aesthetic consistency to Maddin's surreal universe, which as always is a seductive place in which to get lost." -- The Hollywood Reporter
Director's Statement
Keyhole is a domestic Odyssey across carpets and floor tiles instead of across the sea. Here, in the old family home, the film can poetically study the emotionally complex importance of the house, everyone's house, and all the memories that haunt every nook and cranny of our childhood domiciles. The film is as much an autobiography of a house as anything else.
Ultimately, by embedding the entire drama in the house to which all my fictional family's memories are welded, I hope to divine the nature of the love we all have for our homes, and the love produced by our homes. These studies of the poetics of domestic space are contemplative themes, but the galloping narrative drive of the Odyssey enables me to employ a propulsive story. The gangsters-in-a-haunted-house genre, an admittedly rare, but not un-useful film niche -- the Bowery Boys' "Spooks Run Wild" comes to mind as an unlikely B-movie inspiration, one used by poet John Ashberry in his most recent collection of work -- has emerged as a most latently powerful device for transforming this meditative story into a most compellingly, hauntingly and universally true tale of domestic love and familial memory.
-- Guy Maddin, Director

P!
I can almost see the sadness in that one guards eyes, almost as if he is saying "Sir. Another one, please. May I have another bowl of porridge, sir? I want another one."
North Korean soldier thinking “They look well fed” and “Wish I could afford that camera” and “Open this window and I’ll defect!”
When did the Norks phase-in the full battle helmets in lieu of the previous commie soft caps as head gear?
Can you explain?
The NK has been making a lot of threats lately and their Dear Leader will keel over any day now, so of course the battle helmets are out. The soldiers are looking mighty thin too, even though their military-first policy would suggest they are among the better fed part of the masses.
Times are really, really lean in NK right now.
Bitter irony:
Many US cops might arrest people for simply taking photos of them.
Meanwhile, these insane DPRK guys are models of restraint.
Panmunjom is the area of the border where the buildings are used for joint talks and stuff. It is also a tourist attraction to walk in there and know you can be in two countries in that room.
Kind of hard to arrest people through a window in a separate country (or neutral territory)
Oh, thanks. The pictures didn’t make sense to me. I had no idea they could get that close. It is sad to see those poor people in that God-forsaken country.
I have been there. It is a tour of one of the conference rooms that lie across the border. Half the room is in the north. The SK troops go in and lock the door that exits to the north. Then the tour group is allowed to enter the building and step over to the north if they wish.
I think the POWs that survived captivity in North Korea would differ from your opinion.
Thanks for posting these very interesting pictures. A nice character study. I cannot read minds but it isn’t too much to conjecture what the Nork soldiers are thinking. The first and next to last pictures look like the same instant in time taken by two different cameras. The Nork soldier on the right surely is looking longingly at his well-fed enemies and the troop on the left in the next to last pix is probably thinking his fellow trooper is looking inside for too long and to wistfully. He knows because he too has done and thought the same but knows he cannot show it.
When I went, we all had to wear our service dress uniform. And all the Norks stood ramrod straight... and did not peer into the negotiating room.

What the 69-year-old woman did not know was that, a day before she found the letter in her mailbox, her granddaughter, Sherri Geddayev, and six other schoolgirls had been shot dead by a Jordanian soldier while they were on a field trip to the Israeli-Jordanian border. “When I saw the report on the TV, my first thoughts were about my granddaughter,” said Shvets. “I had a premonition that something terrible would happen.” It was not until five days after the 15-year-old from Beit Shemesh was shot that officials with the Jewish Agency in Russia were able to locate Sherri’s grandmother, who lives in a small village in southern Russia’s Krasnodar region that has no telephones. Shvets left this week for Israel to spend a few weeks with her daughter’s family in Beit Shemesh. The Geddayevs — Shlomo, 41, and Margalit, 35 — emigrated from the town of Bukhara in the central Asian republic of Uzbekistan five years ago. Sherri was their eldest child. Her sister, Vered, is 12. The family’s youngest, 2-year-old Daniel, was born in Israel. Three years ago, Shvets, a retired teacher of German, stayed for eight months with her daughter’s family. “Sherri was so happy to be in Israel,” Shvets said of that time. “The thing she loved best was to make Shabbat dinner for the family.” In her last letter, written 10 days before she died, Sherri told her grandmother that she would like to come to Russia to see her during summer vacation. “I don’t know why it happened to her,” Shvets said a few hours before departing to Israel. “I always wanted everyone to live in peace.”
News Brief‘Palentines Day’ Candidates Share Horror Stories With Morning Show
Forget Valentine’s Day, this year, we’re celebrating ‘Pal …
Baby’s Got a Baby
Dear KLAQ Morning Crew,
I think I have the worst Valentine’s breakup situation ever. I was dating my ex-girlfriend for over two years. During that two year relationship I did everything to be a part of her life and support her every move. I like to say first hand … I was and still am a very good guy, but being good to someone doesn’t really account for much these days “at least that’s what I just figured out.” The relationship was a very good relationship “so I thought.” I had always wondered why she never wanted me to meet her family. She told me that her father was very ill and that it would make him worse because he stressed out a lot. She also said he was against her dating because of her younger sister getting married at such a young age. So I didn’t want to push the issue. I am currently a student trying to go through the nursing program and my studies are very important to me, but I never let them take precedents over the chance to see her. So because our schedules were so busy, we saw each other maybe once or twice a week. All of a sudden she told me that she was more busy than ever and for three months, I had not seen her but we spoke and texted on the phone constantly. Our phone conversations were about how much we missed each other and how our day went and also other stuff. So it was normal I thought.
The holidays were coming up on us and prior to that we both were trying to get fit for the holidays because we wanted to surprise each other. Well I told her I lost weight but then I would gain it right back and I was frustrated. She said she was having the same results. I said I had to try harder to lose weight and she said she would try too. A week later she told me that she was feeling ill and had to go to the hospital because her blood pressure was very low. Later that night she told me that her doctor gave her medication to control her blood pressure and that more tests would be run to see what was wrong. So that whole week I didn’t see her. Then the following week she told me she had to go to the doctor again because she was having a bad reaction to the medication and was getting bloated. After going to the doctor she told me he said that the medication was not working for her and that she was diagnosed with sever constipation because of the medication. The next day she came to see me. I thought she looked as beautiful as ever and I was happy to see her. She said she was not feeling good and that she was feeling bloated and swollen. I said you don’t look swollen but you have only been taking the medication for a day so give it another day. We had a wonderful good time together that day. The very next day she was coming over every single day and I was so happy to see her. In my mind I was thinking our relationship is getting so much better. One night as I was at work I decide to Google her name just because her name is so different and there are not many names like hers. On the first search result I clicked on it, and I was like WTF!!! The results read that she and some guy were registered at Kohl’s for their baby. I was thinking at that this point there is no way someone with the same name as my girlfriend is having a baby. So I clicked on the link to the registration and It gave me her address. I was thinking … This can’t be right! The next day I didn’t know how to bring it up to her so I called her and everything went normal. I was in denial so I didn’t mention it. Something odd happened that day, we usually had a routine on how we text and talked on the phone but for some reason she wasn’t responding to my calls or text. Six hours later she calls me and tells me she loves me and she is so happy. She also said she had to go to the doctor’s and that she was busy all day. I asked her how the visit went. She told me that the doctor said she was fine no more meds.
Well, a week went by and then I saw her again everything was normal. I was excited to hear she was still feeling good and that the results of her blood test indicated that she didn’t have low blood pressure. The next day at work I couldn’t help myself so I Googled her name again and it read “Congratulations on your newborn. My mind was racing. I got an idea … even though her sister and I never met, I requested her friendship on Facebook. The very next day, I was accepted. I started looking at her post and there was a baby picture saying my new nephew – he’s so adorable. I read what people were posting in response to the picture and came across one that said “Is that your baby?” The sister replied “No, dumbass, that’s my sister’s.” The boy wrote “Which sister?” She said “The only one I have.”
I fell apart. I immediately excused myself from work and took the day off on my way driving home, I was so messed up I almost crashed a couple of times. I love her so much. Why? Why? I called her and asked her if that was true. She said “No, what are you talking about?” I told her “I found out you had a baby and didn’t tell me.” She said “No, it’s not true.” I then said the baby’s name to her and she said “What do you want me to do?” At that point, I couldn’t talk anymore. She said “Sorry.” I hung up. An hour later, I said “Why didn’t you tell me? and I saw on the Internet you are with someone else?” She said “Not anymore.” She said “Don’t worry, it’s not yours.” I told her I loved her and how could she do that? I didn’t get an answer. I told her this is not right I will still be with you no matter what. She said OK. Well form that point on I tried to think what and how I went wrong ( I still don’t know where I did). I kept going on Facebook to see if there were any new pictures of the baby and just find out what I could. One month later her sister took me off of her Facebook and then I sent her a message telling her I was sorry for invading her privacy and that all I wanted to do is be close to her sister because I love her. Two days later her sister tells me that my girlfriend is happy in love with her husband and please respect them so she can get on with her life and baby. I again apologized and said “Why is it she is still telling me she loves me and misses me? I just got a text from her this morning from her.” Then I said I will call her. So I called my girlfriend. She answered “Hi, babe.” I said, “I have to ask you a question. Are you married because your sister said you are?” She said “No, I’m not married. I said “Are you with this guy still? She said “Ummmm, yeah.” I said “So you love him?” She said, “Ummm, do I love him?? Ummm, yeah.” I said “So we are over, I take it?” She didn’t say anything. I said “I wish you the very best in everything you do and that life is good to you.” I also said “I wish you finish you school and please take care of the baby.” I felt my heart die. I never thought this was possible. I told her goodbye. We hung up.
Truck for a Home
Okay guys,
You guys wanna hear a true story about a heartbreak? Okay here it goes: This past December I got separated for my wife it was a 8 – 9-year relationship. We have children together. Well anyways, to make a long story short, I was a truck driver for 5 years over the road. During the course of those 5 years, she started developing some weird habits or should I say, some cheating habits. Every day she would not answer my phone calls between the hours of 5 p.m. to p.m. She always used the excuse that she was taking a nap or and let me not forget the kids would never be our apartment. She would always leave the kids at her parents house during this time so I finally got off the road got a local job in Paso only to discovered that she has been dating a military guy so her mother came up with a plot to take money from me and this is what happened: Her mother got a job in San Antonio so she told me that she wants me to take over her house, make a long story short, I buy into this and I spend 25k, yes $25,000 fixing the house up. Well, 5 months later her mom decides to come back to El Paso and when she did come back, she was under the impression that the house was still hers.
Guys, there are a lot of details that I am skipping out on to try and make the story shorter. Anyway, this lead to confrontation which later resulted in me being kicked out of the house and me living in my personal truck for two weeks. I hope I win.
‘Inbred Southern Morons’
I ended up living with this chick that left her husband and kids for me. After about 5 months she developed a wandering eye for other dudes, one in particular that she said was just a “friend.” She started to ping-pong back and forth between this douche and I. I eventually got him kicked out of the military while I stayed in. He moved back to Arkansas, she left me to move back to Louisiana. A few months later she said she wanted me back. Like a dumbass, I took her back. While we were broken up, I pursued one of her friends that she didn’t even keep in contact with and started hitting it. One drunken night she admitted to banging 5 guys while back in Louisiana, I stupidly told her I had one girl since her, her so-called friend. She flipped out and got me in trouble with the military that forced me back onto base dormitories while she stayed in the apartment I was PAYING for. A few days later, the Arkansas douche that started all this crap showed up to help pack her up and move her back to Louisiana. As a parting gift they left a video of them screwing on all my furniture that I owned. I hate inbred southern morons forever now.
Brain Tumor = Another Man
In 2007, I met my best friend and we grew closer and closer every year and eventually, in 2009 we started dating. I was madly deeply in love with her and my feelings for her kept growing stronger and deeper for her. In 2010, I proposed to her and had the wedding planned for mid 2011 spring. We began making plans to move into our own place and start a small family. In March 2011 she told me they found she had a brain tumor. I stuck with her through everything no matter what happened. However, in April she told me that it was all a lie she said she told me that because she thought it would push me away. She said she wanted to be with someone else. Just a couple of weeks away from our wedding, all our plans were nothing. She broke my heart, stomped on it and tore it into a million pieces. Since then I haven’t been able to feel the same way for another girl no matter how hard I try.
Hearts and Cars Cut in Half
I am stationed at Ft. Bliss. In 2010 when I came back from deployment at the end of January, I found out my now ex-wife was sleeping with people in my own company that didn’t deploy with us. One of which was in my platoon. She also had my car cut in half!! Literally cut in half. Now this was all right before V-Day and the day before was served with the divorce. Not the papers, the divorce decree. This was a huge shock to me as the whole time I was gone she was the doting wife. This was while I was stationed at Ft. Drum, NY. Although I have gotten over her, this incident has pretty much ruined V Day for me.
Birthday Breakup
Dear KLAQ Morning Show crew,
My ex girlfriend told me she was pregnant with her ex-boyfriend. I, of course, was the last to know and to make things worse, she told me on my birthday and also dumped me on that same day. That is my story.
While we feel for all you guys (and wow, ladies can be heartless bi*&hes!), we could only have one winner, which was “Inbred Southern Morons.” Hope the lapdances can erase the image of your ex banging another dude on your furniture, bro.WHAT A CREATIVE WEB WE'VE SCREENED
Now in its fifth year, the Independent Television Festival or ITVFest, as it prefers to be called keeps getting bigger and bigger, not to mention less television-y. It's the mother of all festivals for independently produced original TV pilots and web series, you know all those fantastically popular web series you’ve never heard of but everyone else has. The organizers are excited that this year almost three-fourths of the final selections are Internet-based shows. The fest is held over the course of a week, with 53 selections screening, plus themed panels covering casting, writing, pitching, getting sponsorship and much more. Opening night (Thurs., July 29) sees the Innovator Award presented to Illeana Douglas. If you've never heard of these "must-sees": Superman, The Source, 15 Minutes, Dan O'Neal (pictured), The Ballad of Mary and Ernie, Going to Pot, Four Angry Men, We're in the Band, Souvenirs, you probably still read books in print and think Twitter means to chirp continuously (like me).
July 29-Aug. 5,Athletics
during ancient times served a single purpose.
Through the gymnastic and Olympic programs, the Greek state sought
to equate the academic and physical curriculum.
It was the aim of Pericles, the famous Greek statesman, to develop
a sound mind in a healthy body.
Today,
in order to meet the needs of a dynamic society, the role of athletics in
the curriculum has changed considerably. Athletics serve to develop through proper coaching techniques
the following objectives:
An
Appreciation of Proper Health Habits
- It
is necessary to teach that health is one of our most important assets.
Proper
Attitudes of Sportsmanship
- In this area the coach seeks to implant proper moral, spiritual
and ethical patterns of conduct that will serve the athlete throughout his
life.
An
Appreciation For Teamwork
- Here the coach develops attitudes of self-denial, self-sacrifice,
subordination of individual desires, courage, loyalty, devotion to a cause
and the other attitudes necessary to the realization of a successful team
effort.
Proper
Attitudes Toward the Role of Victory and Defeat
- The coach must strive to develop proper attitudes in his
players toward both victory and defeat.
Although every team enjoys winning, each one must also know how to
face defeat. When one has
given fully to himself, there is no shame in defeat.
An
Understanding of Democracy in Action
- In this area the coach encourages the squad to select its leaders
and prepares plans that will enable the team to achieve its objectives.
Athletics
in our society provides one of the finest ways in which our young people
can develop into responsible men and women.
Seeds can be sown on the athletic fields that may well reap the
fruits of victory against internal and external foes that seek to destroy
the American way of life. This
being true, the athletic program should assume its rightful place in a
total school program and make its vital contributions to the development
of youth.

LISD Athletic DepartmentGood morning. I would like to assist you if I may.
If I may ask, who is generally the one who purchases the food for the household?
My parents do.
At about what time does your son wake up his grandfather?
Different times. This morning it was 6. It's been as early as 4.
Do your parents generally use their money to purchase the food, your money,or a collective of everyone's money?
Their money.
I would first recommend that you and your wife make the time to do some shopping on your own, using your own money to purchase the items that you approve of your children eating.
We do buy breakfast foods like oatmeal and cereal and that is one of the things we have told my dad, that doesn't seem to work.
Keep these items available, so that your parents have access to them, and explain to them (although I know you have tried already), but keep talking to them about how you do not want your children to be overweight, or suffer from diabetes (which is possible, even at their young age) as you and your father have.
4 am is quite early, however, if at all you can manage to wake up before your son, and your father, do it. Set your alarm, and wake early so that you can be the one to provide breakfast for your children.
Because these are your parents, they already feel that they have some sort of authority over their grandchildren. The fact that you live in their home and they provide most of the food doesn't help things either. I don't know your whole living situation, but the best way that you will be able to control the foods that your children eat, is to move in to your own home. This way, you are in complete control. Until this is possible, keep talking to dad about the importance of maintaining the health of your children; and whenever you can, set that alarm clock extra early.
Let me know if any of what I have provided is of assistance, or if you need more ideas or insight.
I think we are going to try to buy "approved" foods for my son, but I still am not sure if that is going to help. But it is the one thing that we have not tried.
This is very frustrating. We are trying to get my son to not come into our room at night and every time we succeed we wake up to find that he has eaten all that garbage.
I understand your frustration, I have experienced this same issue with my sons and their grandmother in the past.
It got better as I continued talking to her, and as I provided food that I approved of or them.
My son goes to bed at 8pm but wakes up between 4 and 9 am every morning so it's hard to know what time to get up and make breakfast. I don't want to wake him up to eat at 4 if he is going to sleep till 8.
I understand. If at all possible, without causing an issue between you and your father, see if there is any way that you can keep possession of the junk foods, say, in your room.
In trying to get your son to sleep in his own bed, and perhaps also helping the eating situation, try sleeping in his room with him for a few days, for the whole night. You sleep on the floor on a comforter or sleeping bad, etc, while he sleeps in his bed. That way, you wake up with him to provide him breakfast, and he also learns to sleep in his own bed.
I will try that.
After sleeping on the floor for a few days, move into a chair in his room, until he is asleep, and then a few days later, move the chair into the hallway, until he sleeps.
Give it a try, it may work. And still, if all else fails, don't hesitate to (either you or your wife) get in bed early, so that you can wake up early and beat your son and dad to the breakfast rush.
I'll try a few of those things. thanks
You are welcome. I mistakenly disabled my "ACCEPT" button when you attempted to accept previously. I will now make it available, and I thank you. If you have any other questions, on this or any other parenting issue, please let me know, I will be more than happy to try to be of assistance. I wish you all the best!
ThanksAmerican Bar Association

The Section's annual publication, "The State of Criminal Justice," gives a statistical snapshot of criminal justice issues such as those relating to drug offenses, crime rates, racial disparity in the justice system, and criminal court caseloads.
Both publications may be ordered through the ABA Service Center at (800) 285-2221. The Federalization report is $10.00 plus handling. Its product code is 509-0074. "The State of Criminal Justice" is $12.00, and its product code is 509-0073.

Neil Collins\'s Profile.
Overseeing a myriad of small investments was steady but dull, and in 2001 its board decided that the world of venture capital looked much more exciting. So it has proved, if not in quite the way the board expected.
Gearing up, and paying out 2 billion pounds in capital returns and share buy-backs, has left it woefully exposed. It’s market capitalisation, at 1.1 billion pounds, is only two-thirds of its flotation value 15 years ago, and it’s now on the brink of having to sell new shares at a fraction of the price it paid to buy them in.
The chart shows the sorry decline of the last few years, and the shares are on the slide again, down by a fifth so far this week, as it dithers over its proposed 700 million pound rights issue.
Please don’t call this a rescue, although given the looming debt repayment dates, it’s not far short, and 3i has already traded in the architect of its expansion for an older hand. The pain has been reflected in the price of the 430 million pound 3.625 per cent convertible bond redeemable in 2011, issued last year to replace an equally out-of-the-money eurobond.
At the turn of the year, the convertible price fell to 65 pounds per cent, as investors feared a default. The rights issue, when it comes, should prevent this disaster, although each downward lurch in the share price increases the dilution for the long-suffering holders.
Britain has no shortage of private equity groups, all looking for big deals to make their backers’ fortunes, while smaller companies remain starved of long-term capital. Perhaps 3i can use this issue to draw a line under its attempt to play in the big league, and return to its roots.Prev

About
Sunday, February 9, 1997 by Dave Winer.
Here's what I've learned in the last year about free speech and how it relates to technology and the new medium of the worldwide web.
The web is still about breaking rules. Editors want to give us deadlines. Software companies want to own their customers. Governments want to make the world safe for children, which really means isolating them.
These forces tend to control communication, to commercialize a medium, pave it over, snuff out individuality, catch your attention, hold it, and then destroy it.
Any editorial organization or software company could choose to jump over to the other side. Or could acknowledge other organizations that work differently. To facilitate free unedited (or lightly edited) speech. Or to define a community that empowers its developers and users instead of controlling them.
Or they could let new editorial organizations and software companies take their place.
It takes a lot of deals to become president of the United States. In turn, he makes deals with people in the software and publishing industries, whose goals, as a result, may not be complementary with your goals or mine.
It's all linked up. It's OK. Let's respect that. But let's remember that our ideas actually make a difference -- if we let them. My interests are linked up too. I need free speech in order to have free software, and vice versa. Not just free in theory, free in fact.
John Gilmore,, an entrepreneur, a board member at EFF, a friend, and a frequent guest on DaveNet, says:
"We haven't defeated the Communications Decency Act yet. It's been appealed to the Supreme Court and will be re-considered there.
"We lost Round One (in Congress), lost Round Two (the President), won Round Three (3-judge panel in Philadelphia), won Round Four (judge in NY), and are entering Round Five with the Supremes. We could still lose. And there are half a dozen similar bills in local legislatures in various states."
So who in Silicon Valley in 1997, will stand next to John Gilmore, a very smart and accomplished man, and call for the defeat of censorship on the Internet?
I see a huge connection between writing essays and writing software, when you let the web connect them. I like to attract independent people to my site, thinkers, writers, webmasters, script writers, software developers.
Other people specialize in broader audiences. That's OK. I want the most curious, high-energy, super smart people to experience and respond to my views and my software.
Put another way, anyone can appreciate Alta Vista, Pointcast, Four11, Suck, AOL, MSN, Excite or CNN. I want to associate with people who can *invent* the next Alta Vista, Pointcast, Four11, etc.
Listening is still a precious commodity. Nothing's changed there. If you want to make a contribution to making the world a better place, please listen to someone today, tomorrow -- every day. Have the courage to let them exceed your expectations.
If people don't listen to your story when you tell it, just act it out, act on your beliefs, and eventually the smart people will catch on, the lightbulb goes on, you make a new friend. This is the way functional markets, cultures and communities develop.
Some people will never hear you. That's the way it goes. Focus on the ones who do.
How remarkable the web is!
Websites are LANs but they are also documents. The documents we're creating today are unlike any that humans have ever produced. So revolutionary. So many barriers have been passed, have we noticed?
The most fundamental change is the idea of linking. A link is the ultimate salute, the highest form of respect. I'm going to share my flow. We're going to listen to someone else for a moment. I'm going to trust you to come back to me. Or not. I don't want to own your attention. I want you to listen to other people.
Being a web author is to be a flow-crafter. I place my links strategically. It's like designing the user experience of a software product. Hey, the navigation bars I'm putting at the top of my web pages today look a lot like menu bars. Stay tuned, if one of the browser vendors gives us the get-source hook that barrier will totally liquify.
I like writing. I move you this way then that way. I play with your intelligence, your emotions, your humor. I play with you!
So, come play with me and my friends!
A few days ago I rebuilt the 24 Hours of Democracy website and gave it a new home.
It links to over 1000 websites from last year, most are still there. Passionate and eloquent essays, some famous people, all explaining what freedom means to them.
Great pictures! George Burns, The Harley Mom and Justin Hall. Susan Kare contributed a page of graphics for use in the project.
A pretty website. And you can download the source code for the site for free.
Let's have fun!
I've known Rick Smolan for many years. He's a great photographer. He loves software. He thinks big. He does big too.
Last year Rick got caught off-guard in the web blackout. It seems like an accident, but I believe it was fate. What a turning point. How sharp the contrast was. Rick and I collided, in public, in a personal way. Ouch!
The best way to heal a public wound is to do it in public. Rick and I have been exchanging email, and decided we both wanted this. The result is on the web now.
I asked Rick to choose several of his favorite photographs from 24 Hours in Cyberspace and tell us why they're important to him. I've lightly edited his piece and posted it at:
Rick, welcome to my website! Photography is such an essential element in the web. I hope we get a chance to do more work together in the future.
And I'm glad we're friends again!
It's more fun that way...

The rural regions are differentiated by their agricultural production technologies. There are three households in each region, disaggregated by income level, for a total of 15 households. Each rural region has 6 agricultural production activities, which are destined to national commodity markets, plus one national livestock-forestry-fisheries sector. The urban region contains 14 other production sectors. Each rural region has its own agricultural labor and its own irrigated and non-irrigated land. The urban region employs 4 labor types: professional, white collar, blue collar and unskilled/informal. One capital factor is used by all regions.

No Unofficial Guide researchers are available to be in the Magic Kingdom today, but we’re working with Disney and others to see if we can get wait times from the park today. Unofficial Guide researchers and volunteers will be available starting Wednesday, through at least April 30, so we can compare wait time predictions and actuals for those days.
We’re getting lots of questions around what the different crowd levels mean, especially for those levels that don’t have an explicit wait time associated. We may need to re-do the 1-10 scale to be more specific about wait times. Drop me a line if you have comments or suggestions on what you’d like to see in a new scale. Also, we should be more clear about which park we’re using as the yardstick. I think the Magic Kingdom is the park most familiar to everyone, so we’re going to use that going forward.
Several readers have asked whether conventions and conferences impact wait times at WDW. I’ve charted every scheduled conference and convention in Orlando from now through the end of 2005 The y axis shows the number of conference participants. Thanks again to the Orlando Visitor and Convention Bureau for the raw data. In most cases, the number of conference participants is below 5,000, a relatively small number. And there are a host of factors that would lessen the impact of that many people on wait times in WDW, including:
- Most conference participants have conferences scheduled during the day
- Even if they had the day off, they’d probably not all go to the same theme park (or even a Disney park)
- They’d probably not arrive at the park(s) at the same time
- They’d probably not go on the same rides

One Response to “Disney Crowd Level Questions And Answers”
Oddly enough, their efforts will fail miserably and the new era will start as scheduled. In the few years that we have left in this era, we had better brace ourselves for some very difficult times ahead. It would be prudent and smart to find out what is being said about 2012 and how to prepare for it whether it be good or bad. It is always wise to be prepared instead of sorry, especially if you have kids to care for.Posted by Alexanderfromdenmark on March 28, 2009, at 8:30:24

Higher serotonin levels increase prolactin and decrease testosterone and lower metabolism. High dopamine levels on the other and lower prolactin and increase testosterone and metabolism. Which is the reason why SSRIs are also linked to low free testosterone, and possibly also thyroid function.

The Raiders went 0-10 last season and 1-9 in 2011, but Credeur is also the only coach to lead Lumberton to the playoffs in 2007 and 2008.
"It has been tough the last few years and when you're a competitor like he is it makes it tough," Lumberton ISD superintendent John Valastro said. "He has a set of expectations, the community has a set of expectations. He just felt, when he and I talked, this was the best thing for he and his family and the district.".- Over three million Catholic pilgrims from around the world attended the final Mass at World Youth Day on Sunday, making the 2013 event the largest of its kind since 1995..- Over three million Catholic pilgrims from around the world attended the final Mass at World Youth Day on Sunday, making the 2013 event the largest of its kind since 1995.
Crowds of pilgrims from dozens of countries thronged Copacabana Beach for the final World Youth Day Mass with Pope Francis July 28.
The mayor’s office of Rio di Janeiro estimated that 3.2 million people attended the final World Youth Day Mass at Copacabana Beach.
Another 3 million people attended the prayer vigil with the Pope on Saturday, according to the mayor’s office and police estimates.
The 1995 World Youth Day Mass with Pope John Paul II, held in Manila in the Philippines, remains the most attended. An estimated 4 to 5 million people attended that event.
Over 350,000 pilgrims registered for the event, with more than 200,000 from Brazil. About 20,000 pilgrims registered from Argentina, the Pope’s home country.
At least 9,500 U.S. youth from 650 groups attended the event, the U.S. bishops’ conference reports. Thirty-six U.S. bishops attended, including Cardinals Timothy Dolan of New York and Sean O’Malley of Boston and Archbishops Samuel Aquila of Denver, Charles Chaput of Philadelphia, Gustavo Garcia-Siller of San Antonio and Jerome Listecki of Milwaukee.
About two million attended World Youth Day events in Rome in 2000, while 1.6 million attended the global event at Czestochowa, Poland in 1991.
World Youth Day will return to Poland in 2016, when the city of Krakow will host. The first World Youth Day took place in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1987.

Aaron Rodgers Green Bay Packers Nike Team Color Limited Jersey - Green Shop Now!Out of the box, the iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad are powerful devices with plenty of built-in features to satisfy your daily requirements for productivity and fun. Whether you're thinking about buying an iPad, a longtime user of the iPhone, or a brand new user of the iPod touch, a refresher course in the basics will come in handy. Out of the box, here's what you get when you purchase an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch.
The iPhone and iPod touch are similar in appearance and have many of the same features (see graphic above right). Of course, the iPod touch does not have a built-in cell phone. In addition, there are minor differences in the placement of buttons and ports, which are indicated in this graphic.
Although much larger, the iPad has many similar hardware as the iPhone and iPod touch.
Features and specs described here are for the iPhone 4, iPod touch gen 4, and iPad.
Battery, Li-Polymer rechargeable (all devices):
Camera, front-facing (iPhone & iPod touch): The front-facing camera can shoot VGA quality video and still images.
Camera, rear-facing (iPhone & iPod touch) and LED Flash (iPhone 4 only): The iPhone 4's camera can take 5-megapixel still images; the iPod touch can take 720x960 pixel still images (less than one megapixel). Both devices can record video at up to 720p HD. Earlier versions of the iPod touch have no camera at all.
Multi-touch display (all devices): The iPhone and iPod touch have 3.5-inch diagonal color touch screens with 960x640 pixel resolution. The iPad has a 9.7-inch diagonal color touch screen with 1024x768 pixel resolution. The iPhone 4 uses Apple's new "Retina Display," which has 326 dots per inch resolution; about four times the number of pixels as previous iPhone screens. The multi-touch display lets you select apps, type messages, dial phone numbers, and otherwise interact with your iOS device.
Dock connector (all devices): The iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad have identical 30-pin iPod dock connector ports on the bottom edge of the devices that let you connect to your computer and sync data, music, videos, and other files using the USB cable that ships with the devices. You also charge the device with this port, using the AC power adapter that ships with the devices.
Headphone jack (all devices): This headphone jack is a standard 3.5mm audio jack that you find in most audio devices. You can use your own headphones, but if you want to talk and listen at the same time, you'll need to purchase an add-on adapter with a microphone.
Home button (all devices): It's your shortcut out of the app you're using and it takes you to the Home screen. Pressing the Home button again will take you to the Spotlight search screen. For more on what the Home button can do, see page 20.
Microphone (all devices): The iPhone uses an internal microphone found at the bottom right corner of the device. It serves many purposes including making phone calls, recording voice messages, using voice control and more. The 4G iPod touch also has this microphone, and you can use it to record video and sound.
Processor (all devices): A4 processor capable of running at 1-GHz (actual speed varies between device types).
RAM memory (all devices): Used to run iOS and apps. iPhone 4, iPod touch gen 4: 512MB; iPad: 256MB RAM.
Receiver (iPhone only): Place your ear close to this to listen to incoming calls. (You can also use the headphones that came with your iPhone.)
Ring/Silent switch (iPhone, iPad): On the iPhone, this switch toggles between activating the ringer or putting your phone is silent mode. Since this switch only silences the ringer, you can still listen to music through the phone's speakers. With iOS 4.3, the switch toggles between screen orientation lock and silencer. When in silent mode, you don't hear any of the beeps and other sounds associated with opening and using the apps. Like the iPhone, you can still listen to music.
SIM card tray (iPhone, iPad with Wi-Fi + 3G): The tray accepts a micro-SIM card, which is needed to connect to AT&T's GSM network. SIM cards are not used with Verizon's CDMA network. If you ever need to eject the SIM card, you can do so by inserting the end of a paper clip into the tiny hole on the side of your device.
Sleep/Wake button (all devices): This turns the screen on and off to conserve power. The iPhone will still receive calls with the screen off, and all devices will continue to play music. Pressing the button again or pressing the Home button will turn the screen back on. To turn off your device completely, press and hold down on the Sleep/Wake Button until "slide to power off" appears; then move the slide to the right. Turn your device back on by pressing and holding down on the Sleep/Wake button. Press the Sleep/Wake button once to silence an incoming call on your iPhone, and press it twice to send the call directly to voicemail.
Speaker (all devices): The speaker is located at the bottom left edge of the iPod touch and the bottom right edge of the iPhone and iPad. It projects speakerphone calls on the iPhone as well as music, movie audio, and other sounds on all devices.
Storage memory & price (all devices): All iOS devices come with built-in flash memory to store music, videos, data, and other files. Current models available: iPod touch 8GB ($$229), 32GB ($299), 64GB ($399); iPhone: 16GB ($199), 32GB ($299); iPad with Wi-Fi: 16GB ($499), 32GB ($599), 64GB ($699); iPad with Wi-Fi +3G: 16GB ($629), 32GB ($729), 64GB ($829). The iPhone price requires a new 2-year wireless service contract with AT&T or Verizon Wireless. The iPad is sold without a service contract, but to use the 3G capabilities you will need to purchase a monthly service contract.
Volume up and down buttons (all devices): These buttons control the volume of calls, sounds, and audio/video playback.
Dock connector USB cable (all devices): Connects your iOS device to the power adapter or to a Mac or PC computer for syncing.
Documentation (all devices): Minimal getting started instructions are included. You can download full user guides in PDF format from Apple's website (support.apple.com/manuals).
These standard white earbuds come
with many Apple products.
Earphones (iPhone, iPod touch): The iPod touch ships with a standard set of white stereo earphones that connect via cable to the headphone jack. The iPhone ships with earphones with a built in mic, which can be used for phone calls or to listen to music. The iPhone's earphones (shown above) have a remote control built onto the cable that lets you adjust volume, change music tracks, and answer and end calls. The remote has some neat control features built into it: To pause playback, squeeze the control once. To resume playback, squeeze it again. To skip to the next track, squeeze it twice. To go back to the previous track, squeeze it three times. To send an incoming call straight to voice mail without answering it, squeeze and hold for a few seconds. When you're on a call, you can switch to another incoming call by squeezing once. To switch back to the original call, squeeze and hold.
Power adapter (all devices): Wall socket power adapter to charge your iOS device.
Unless otherwise indicated, the following software is built into all current versions of the iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad.
Operating system: The "iPhone OS" was renamed "iOS" with the release of version 4.0. As of early March, 2011, the latest version was iOS 4.3. iOS is based on Mac OS X.

Commented, thanks. In the meantime Julian Bond had dropped in a comment about RDF being "write-only". Makes more sense if you know he was active around FOAF a while ago (did he add support to Ecademy? I forget). Although there are now quite a few RDF browser kind of tools, it still isn't obvious that anyone's reading & making good use of FOAF etc from places like Ecademy & LiveJournal. > >addressing approximately 1% (+- 1% ;)) of the Semantic Web potential and > >using an extremely good hacked method that's not based on standards. > Try to avoid talking about "potential" uses, it's a "shake head and > laughter" trigger in MF circles.

It could be argued that the microformats process actually produces more robust standards than traditional standards orgs, as they start with existing specs (iCalendar, vCard etc), their target representation is pretty mature (HTML) and they have a tight community loop to filter bad ideas. Whatever, bottom line is the microformats folks have been very successful at getting more data on the web, a key goal of the Semantic Web community. That's a win for everyone. But once there, what does one do with the data? We do need to demonstrate something more compelling than what tools like Operator can already do. As Benjamin suggests, integration & query are good bits. Cheers, Danny. -- on Thursday, 22 February 2007 13:35:39 UTC

IL - NorthfieldANZ has quietly offloaded its share of Gunns' debt in a move that critics say shows it was not confident about the prospects of a pulp mill sale.
The bank sold its reported $200 million share of the $446 million owed to secured creditors to an unidentified company in September.
The sale took place before receivers KordaMentha called for expressions of interest in remaining Gunns assets, including the stalled Tamar Valley pulp mill project.
ANZ confirmed the sale yesterday, saying it was ``no longer a part of the Gunns Ltd banking syndicate and not involved in providing financial support for the proposed Tamar Valley pulp mill''.
The bank had been the target of protests and boycott campaigns over its association with Gunns.
Bass Greens MHA Kim Booth said the sale showed that the bank had no confidence that a new proponent for the mill would be found.
``ANZ, when they sold out, revealed that they thought the chances of this pulp mill ever being built were zero, so they just cut and run,'' he said.
Mr Booth said he suspected the debt had been ``sold to corporate loan sharks, for a peppercorn'', and said KordaMentha should name its new lead creditor.
KordaMentha spokesman Mike Smith declined to name any creditors, but said the sale did not affect the liquidation process and the receivers would continue to act in the best interests of secured creditors.
Financial analyst Tony Gray said the transfer made it even less likely that unsecured creditors would see any of the $750 million owed to them by Gunns.
Mr Gray said a specialist debt firm, which was the most likely buyer for the debt, would have bought in at a heavy discount and would be interested in a quick profit.
Parliament yesterday passed legislation to extend the pulp mill permit to 2017, at the request of KordaMentha.

It took one game for Scotch Plains to get over a heartbreaking loss in the 2012 state playoffs.
Scotch Plains, long one of the state's top programs and No. 2 in The Star-Ledger's preseason Top 20, opened the season with a 9-0 victory over Parsippany Hills yesterday in Scotch Plains.
Scotch Plains fell to Millburn on penalty kicks in the Group 4 sectional semifinals last season when Scotch Plains was the top-ranked team in the state.
“People think that we graduated a couple of primetime guys, two of them are playing Division 1 right now, and that we’re going to drop off," Breznitsky said. “But I don’t think we dropped much at all.
“One of the things that we do exceptionally well, better than last year believe it or not, is our overlapping with our backs. Devin Glover on the left side and Michael Walsh on the right side there, I think Walsh as a right back had four assists, four or five assists, and he played a half a game.”
Junior forward Justin Rodriguez, who led Scotch Plains with three goals, believes that, if his team can continue to control the pace and possess the ball, the team has limitless potential.
“During the season we’re going to keep playing like that,” Rodriguez said. “We train like we want to play and we want to play hard. I think we’ll be able to play at this level all year.”
Scotch Plains will be challenged by a highly competitive schedule. The schedule includes a road game at rival Westfield on Sept. 19 and a home game against Bridgewater-Raritan on Sept. 28.
Coach Breznitsky also has his eye on an Oct. 5 matchup with Hunterdon Central as well as the county tournament in late October and the group tournament in early November.
"Our goals don't change," Breznitsky said. "We want to be contending for a championship every season. For now, we'll take it one game at a time."This season, nonconformist Martin Margiela offers an outlandish take on a Ray-Ban Shooter style sunglass frame.

March had all the makings of another dismal month for U.S. auto sales: Unemployment is rising, there's no bottom in sight for home prices, and even stocks' recent rally hasn't come close to erasing this year's losses. Then there's the desperate state of the automakers themselves: GM faces a government-mandated break up and Chrysler is under orders to make a deal with Italian automaker Fiat.
Ford may be widely regarded as the healthiest of the "Detroit Three" and the only one not currently on life support, but evidently that hasn't helped them overcome the recession's downward pull on sales.
Among Japanese car companies, Nissan said March sales fell 38 percent and Toyota reported a 39 percent decline in sales. Honda's sales dropped 36 percent last month, the company said.
The smaller players in the U.S. market also released their March figures. Subaru reported March sales fell 2.6 percent from last year. Strong demand for its Forester SUV blunted a big decline among its smaller cars. And Volkswagon said it sold 19.5 percent fewer cars last month than a year earlier, with its Jetta, Rabbit and Passat models all seeing big declines.A ROAD accident involving a van and a moped partially blocked Daws Heath Road in Rayleigh this morning.

A cyst (fluid-filled sac) can sometimes develop on the eyelid, or the eyelid can get inflamed or infected. Changes in the position of the eyelids, such as droopiness, often occur gradually with age.
These problems are usually nothing to worry about. However, see your GP if your eyes are watery or uncomfortable due to an eyelid problem, or if you are worried. Seek urgent medical advice if you also have pain in or around your eye or loss of vision.
The information below should give you an idea of what might be wrong, although it shouldn't be used to self-diagnose your condition.
It covers possible causes for the following eyelid problems, plus specific advice about what to. You can increase the chance of the cyst healing by holding a clean flannel warmed in hot water to the closed eye for five minutes. Repeat this three to four times a day for two weeks.
Speak to your GP if you have a large cyst that doesn't clear up after a couple of months. They can refer you to have it surgically drained. This is a simple procedure carried out under local anaesthetic (your eye area will be numbed). It takes just five minutes and doesn't leave a scar.
Also see your GP if the cyst becomes infected because you may need to take antibiotics to prevent a deep lid infection (cellulitis). include; an allergic reaction, shingles on the face and eye (usually with a rash), and other rare eye problems, which would cause other symptoms such as loss of vision.
Gritty or burning eyes are usually caused by an inflamed lid edge (blepharitis) or dry eye. Symptoms are usually worse in the morning or at the end of the day.
People with blepharitis also have an increased risk of getting meibomian cysts, also called chalazia, in their lid (see above).
Gritty, itchy or flaky lids are irritating, but rarely serious. You can reduce the irritation by keeping the lid clean and using artificial tears. Read about treating blepharitis.
Contact dermatitis is another possible cause of itchy or flaky lids. This is a type of eczema triggered when the skin comes into contact with something you are irritated by or allergic to. For example, your eyelids may be sore and itchy because you're allergic to the eye shadow you've been using or because you've been touching your eyes with fingers painted with nail polish. The condition usually clears up after you stop using the substance your skin is reacting to.
Just like anywhere else on the skin, lumps can occur on the eyelids. Many lumps are simple cysts (see above).
However, see your GP if the lump increases in size, changes colour, has an irregular shape or bleeds. It's possible that the lump could be skin cancer.
If the lump is skin cancer, it may need to be surgically removed. Most skin cancers are basal cell carcinomas and don't spread to other parts of the body, although they continue to grow on the lid.
Less commonly, the lump may be a squamous cell carcinoma, which rarely spreads to other parts of the body.
If the lump is dark in colour, it could be a melanoma, although this is relatively rare. A melanoma will need early treatment because it can spread to other parts of the body and can be dangerous..
See your GP immediately if ptosis comes on rapidly, over days or weeks, or if it's associated with other symptoms, such as headache or vision loss.
The lower eyelid can sometimes droop away from the eye and turn outwards. This is known as an ectropion.
Ectropion can affect just one or both of the lower eyelids. It's usually related to ageing, but can also be associated with sun-damaged facial skin.
In cases of mild ectropion, treatment isn't needed. However, if it's uncomfortable or causes your eye to continually water, surgery may be considered.
Read more about treating ectropion.
Entropion is where the eyelid rolls inwards. It usually affects the lower lids, but it can also affect the upper lids.. A corneal ulcer can form and become infected. Surgery may be needed to correct entropion if it's posing a risk to the health of your eye. This is carried out under local anaesthetic and usually takes less than an hour.
If you have entropion, you should discuss your treatment options with your GP. Consult your GP immediately if your eye becomes painful, red and you lose vision.
Flat yellow patches (plaques) over the upper or lower eyelids are called xanthelasma.
Although these plaques are harmless, they indicate you may have a high cholesterol level. See your GP to assess your risk factors for future blood vessel problems, such as heart attacks and strokes.
It's important to have treatment if you have high cholesterol, high blood sugar (diabetes) and high blood pressure. Stopping smoking will also help reduce your risk of developing future blood vessel problems.
It's quite common and normal for the eyelid to flicker or twitch occasionally, particularly when you're tired.
It's more unusual to have repeated spasms of excessive blinking and involuntary closure of the eyes. This is known as blepharospasm. Each spasm can last for a few seconds to a few minutes.
The exact cause of blepharospasm is unknown. However, the blinking and closure may be triggered by bright light, stress or tiredness.
Severe blepharospasm can be very disabling and embarrassing. However, an effective treatment is available. It involves having small injections of botulinum toxin (Botox) into the facial skin to provide relief. See your GP to discuss this.
Find out more about blepharospasm by reading the US National Eye Institute's facts about blepharospasm.♫

Paul Farrington, 31, was on an early release licence from prison for an earlier robbery in Rhyl when he robbed the Londis store in Ffordd Isa, Prestatyn, on March 9.
Mold Crown Court heard how he walked in during the afternoon and pretended to look in a fridge – but then ran at a young man who was sitting at the counter and the victim fell against a female assistant.
Farrington punched the man repeatedly and demanded in threatening and abusive terms that the woman should open the till.
When he was pushed away, Farrington again punched the young man as she frantically tried to open the till and begged the robber to leave him alone.
The woman was left crumpled on the floor and the male assistant suffered a suspected broken nose.
Farrington grabbed an estimated £200 from the till and helped himself to cigarettes before he fled, jumping into a waiting car shouting “go, go, go”.
The car was seen at the dry ski slope in Llandudno and later, Farrington drove far too quickly and aggressively at Rhos on Sea, forcing one woman driver who had a child in the car to make an emergency stop. He was arrested later that day at a service station at Llanddulas.
CCTV footage of the robbery was shown, and the court was told how the female victim had been left hysterical by the experience and suffered nightmares and flashbacks.
The young man who was simply helping out was left frightened and in pain.
Judge Niclas Parry jailed Farrington, of Rippleton Road in Manchester, for four and a half years for robbery and a further 14 months consecutive for dangerous driving. He received concurrent sentences for assault and driving while disqualified.
“You travelled from outside the area to carry out an attack on two, decent, hard-working people,” the judge said.
Farrington, the judge said, had an appalling record, including GBH with a weapon, arson, and a previous robbery at Rhyl when he mugged a man and got away with £3,000 cash.
Detective Sergeant Haydn Williams said: “Paul Farrington is a dangerous offender whose sentencing will send a clear message to those intent on breaking the law.”News & Analysis SunTrust Is First In Survey For Inbound Sales EE Times5/31/2007 07:00 PM EDT Post a comment NO RATINGSLogin to Rate Tweet SunTrust Bank ranked highest in the First Half 2007 O'Connor & Associates Industry Benchmark Report which measures the effectiveness of inbound sales agents. The agents are scored for their ability to handle prospective customers' inquiries about opening a checking account, a savings account/certificate of deposit or applying for a loan. Comerica, Wells Fargo, Citibank and U.S. Bank rounded out the top five banks in the survey. O'Connor & Associates conducts this survey of fifteen national and regional banks twice each year in March and August. The remaining banks in the survey are JPM Chase, Wachovia, Key Bank, Huntington Bank, Washington Mutual, National City, Amsouth, PNC, Wells Fargo and Commerce Bank (NJ). The top five survey leaders saw SunTrust Bank and Comerica maintaining first and second place respectively. Bank of America and Huntington Bank dropped from 3rd and 5th place to 7th and 11th place from their previous rankings. Citibank dropped to 3rd place while Wells Fargo moved into 2nd place in the survey. U.S. Bank, replacing Fifth Third in the survey, placed 5th in the ranking. The biggest drops in the surveys ranking were posted by Huntington Bank going from 5th place in the Second Half 2006 report to 11th place and PNC going from 7th place to 12th place in the First Half 2007 survey. Commerce Bank (NJ) had the biggest gain going from 15th place in the Second Half 2006 survey to 10th place for the First Half 2007 Industry Benchmark report. The "Industry Benchmark" score of 65.33% represents a total of 23,519 "yes" answers of the possible 36,000 total "yes" answers in the survey. Some key scores from the survey showed that only: 42% of the agents "Asked for Customer Name" and Just 32% "Used Customer Name" once they captured it; Only 11% "Mentioned Another Product or Service" (being offered by the bank); and Just 7% "Offered Additional Information" (regarding that other product or service) Only 59% "Offered Additional Assistance" to the prospect Only 23% "Offered Future Availability" and Only 39% of the agents actually "Asked for the Business." The most significant drop in the survey was for cross selling capability. The score posted by the agents represented a downturn of over (-100%) from a Second Half 2006 posting of 17.50% to 8.57% for the current survey. This score, according to O'Connor & Associates, represents a major shift in the ability of the inbound agent to assess the success of the call. When they suspect the prospect is not responding to the initial inquiry, they should use information from their initial ask probing questions exercise to shift the sales pitch to another product or service. If the agents are only trying to expand their sales initiative 8.5% of the time, then they are losing many opportunities for opening new accounts that are essential for organic growth. SunTrust posted a cross selling score of 54%. Another major downturn in the current survey was the agent's inability to "ask for the business" at the conclusion of the sales presentation. This score dropped 25% from the previous survey. Survey leader SunTrust "asked for the business" 79% of the time. The O'Connor & Associates Industry Benchmark rankings for the Second Half 2006 V.S. the First Half 2007 are shown below: Each bank is monitored 100 times during a thirty-day period. O'Connor & Associates' service evaluators complete a twenty-four-question form in seven categories of measurement using "yes" or "no" answer format to ensure objectivity. The categories measured are: customer reception, customer rapport, needs identification, professionalism, product knowledge, cross selling capability and closing which are recognized as being the attributes customers regard as essential to creating a positive buying atmosphere.

I love the more arcade-y or “casual” games on Vita, so long as they have some technological distinctiveness from their iOS/Android brethren. High quality audio assets, Near goodies, dual sticks, rear touch, AR, etc are all things that make me buy games on Vita even if I’ve bought them on other platforms previously.

Tears of joy as first miners are rescued
Latest update : 2010-10-13
Rescues have got underway for the 33 workers trapped for more than two months in Chile's San Jose mine, the first of whom reached the surface at 5:10 a.m. on Wednesday in a specially-made rescue capsule, to cheers and tears of joy.
Rescued first from the mine, near the city of Copiapo, on Wednesday morning was Florencio Avalos, who wore a helmet and sunglasses to protect him from the glare of bright lights after two months spent in dim lighting underground. He smiled broadly as he emerged to cheers and hugged his sobbing 7-year-old son, Bairon, and wife.
As the capsule came out of the manhole-sized opening for the first time, and Avalos stepped out, bystanders clapped and broke into a chant of ”Chi! Chi! Chi! Le! Le! Le!'' - the country's name.
Avalos looked, according to FRANCE 24’s special correspondent in Chile, Alexis Masciarelli, "clearly in very good shape."
A second miner, Mario Sepulveda Espina, was pulled to the surface about an hour later. After hugging his wife, Elvira, he jubilantly handed souvenir rocks to laughing rescuers.
Juan Illanes, 52, the third to be pulled out using the missile-like escape capsule, urged his fellow miners to be disciplined and organised while stuck half a mile underground.
He embraced his wife and then, beaming, was wheeled away for medical testing.
Carlos Mamani, the lone Bolivian among the 33 men trapped underground for 69 days was the fourth miner to be rescued. He told reporters on site that everyone at the mine knew it was dangerously overworked.
According to Masciarelli, all of the rescued miners will spend two days in a hospital for both medical and psychological examinations to see "how ready they will be to go back into the real world" after the trauma they have been through.
After that they will, as Mascarielli said, "start their new life as national heroes", facing intense media attention.
The rescue mission
Rescuers on Monday successfully tested a capsule, dubbed “Phoenix” after the mythical bird that rose from the ashes, after reinforcing part of the narrow escape shaft with metal casing to prevent rocks falling and blocking the exit.
Engineers say the final stage of the rescue is not without risk, but that the capsule managed well in the shaft on test runs. They expected a smooth extraction of the miners.
If all goes according to plan, each man’s journey to safety takes about 15 minutes. The miners can communicate with rescue teams via an intercom in the capsule.
They have been told to keep their eyes closed and have been given dark glasses to avoid damaging their eyesight after so long underground..

While we all believe children should have a fair start at life, the harsh reality is that not all children do. Afrika Tikkun is dedictaed to providing youth with equal opportunities to education and core services from cradle to career. We do not believe poverty should be a permanent state of being, which is why we aim to empower youth living in South African townships to break the poverty cycle.
Absolute poverty is something many of us cannot fathom, and unfortunately there are many who live it every day. There are a number of needs that are not met for many students such as adequate nutrition for learning.
Ubuntu
Ubuntu is one of Afrika Tikkun’s core philosophies. The essence of Ubuntu is about not living just for oneself but living for one another and putting the needs of the whole community first.
At Afrika Tikkun, we consider our employees, students, and their relatives as part of our family. Thank you, Global Giving community, for supporting our work through your generous donations and making it possible to move forward towards a more sustainable future.
Overcoming Obstacles
Despite the many successes, we still continuously struggle to raise the necessary funds required to change the lives of children and youth like Percy N., who's story is below. We do not let this discourage us because we know there are countless members of society that believe change is possible and uplifting those living in poverty is an achievable goal.
Thank you again for your support!
The Story of Percy N. Percy completed each year of his studying career successfully and after matriculating, he joined Afrika Tikkun for the after school activities. It was unfortunate that he could not proceed with his education to tertiary level as his family could not afford the fees. From being a beneficiary in our youth programmes, Percy’s skills as a leader was identified and he was offered employment as the assistant soccer coach at the Diepsloot centre. In addition to the above, towards the end of 2012 Percy was then chosen as one of the beneficiaries for the AFGRI Scholarship to study Agriculture in Mpumalanga. Then in 2013 he was again chosen to represent Afrika Tikkun at the Las Vegas Safelite Triathlon. This was his first time on a plane and first time ever travelling outside South Africa. The investment Afrika Tikkun has made in Percy’s life has not only changed his life forever, it has changed his outlook in life and has enabled him to increase his capability to act as a catalystde Park,

Filippo Lorenzin:I’d like to begin this interview by asking you to tell us about your first steps with digital media. When and how did you get interested in this topic?
Marcin Ramocki: I was trained as a painter. My interest in working with computers started in graduate school at the University of Pennsylvania MFA. I guess I found painting frustrating, mostly because the kind of painting everybody was doing was a very process-oriented, paint-centered modernist stuff… I liked process but not for the sake of process. I felt like I needed more control mapping out my concept. My first experiments were basically paintings on plexi with photoshop images printed on them… I initially used simple printmaking methods like Xerox transfer (which is a supersonic version of lithography) and then moved on to acrylic polymer transfer. So it was post-photographic semi-digital collage of sorts. My work from graduate school was dealing with self-portraiture and body, probably influenced by performer Nigel Rolfe who was one of my instructors, and some peers, like Chris White. Very soon after graduating, I moved on to moving image and Lingo programming..
Filippo Lorenzin: What role does the body – both virtual and “analog” – have in your artistic development? Has it been the center of many your works?.
Filippo Lorenzin: What are your plans for the future?
Marcin Ramocki: If I can find the time and money, I’d like to make one more feature documentary about dream interpretation in psychoanalysis. Those big projects are really rewarding (I made two documentaries, 8 BIT in 2006 and Brooklyn DIY in 2009) but they take a couple of years and a huge financial hardship. Until I can pull another one off I’m super psyched about working with more 3D animation loops.The. thought.

By JOHN WAWROW
BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP)."
Sibert has seen it from both sides after transferring to Dayton following two seasons at Ohio State.
"To be able to go out there and play with this group of guys, to be able to come up with this win, it's unbelievable," Sibert said.
Leave it to another transfer, Sanford, to secure the victory in a back-and-forth game that featured 15 lead changes between two schools separated by some 75 miles.
After Ohio State's Aaron Craft hit a reverse layup with 15.5 seconds remaining, the Flyers set up a play during a timeout with 10.8 seconds left.
Dayton inbounded the ball and worked it to Sanford on the right wing. Driving the lane without hesitation, he got a step on Craft and laid in a shot from about 4 feet away.
"No, I wasn't nervous," said Sanford, who transferred to Dayton from Georgetown. "We've drawn up a play like that, and I messed it up previously. But (coach Archie Miller) just kept his trust in me, and I'm just thankful that the shot went in."
Sanford finished with 10 points, while Dyshawn Pierre led Dayton with 12 points. For Miller, in his third year, the win came against his former mentor, Thad Matta.
The Flyers (24-10), of the Atlantic-10 Conference, who have won 11 of 13, advance to play Syracuse, the South Region's third seed on Saturday. The Orange routed Western Michigan 77-53 in their second-round game.
It's one and done for the Big Ten Conference Buckeyes (25-10), who were eliminated in the first game for only the third time in 26th tournament appearances. This season, Ohio State got off to a 15-0 start, and then stumbled down the stretch, splitting its final 20 games.
The loss marked the end for three seniors, including Craft, who were part of a team that had advanced past the third round in each of the previous three years.
Craft had a chance to pull out the win.
Driving the length of the court on the Buckeye's last possession, Craft bulled his way through three defenders only to have his 10-footer hit off the backboard and roll off the rim as the buzzer sounded. was fouled while hitting a 6-footer, and then completed the three-point play.
Miller was antsy right up to the final buzzer. Having spent two seasons at Ohio State, he was fully aware of Craft's ability to score clutch baskets.
 today."
The Flyers have shown a flare for dramatics this season.
Sanford's basket marked the third time the Flyers have won a game on a shot in the final 4 seconds.
Sibert hit a 3-pointer with 1 second left in an 81-80 win over IPFW on Nov. 9. Then there was Devin Oliver's buzzer-beater in an 83-80 overtime win at Ole Miss on Jan. 4.
"A lot of people were going to make a big case out of beating Thad, or beating Ohio State," Miller said. "We didn't get real complicated. It wasn't about Ohio State or where they're from, or blah, blah, blah. It was about us."

Hisham Matar’s second novel is a tale about the romantic love of a father and son for the same woman, as well as a compelling political story about the life in exile of an opponent of an oppressive Arab regime
“I, too, wanted secret meetings in Geneva, allies in Paris with whom I had watched history march and worked to change its course,” muses Nuri el-Alfi, the 14-year-old protagonist of Libyan expatriate Hisham Matar’s second novel. These thoughts of revolution take hold of the boy after dinner at a luxurious restaurant on the shores of Lake Geneva with his father, Kamal, a tense, secretive man who has escaped Muammar Gadhafi’s regime (although neither Gadhafi nor Libya appear in the book by name), and works underground with opposition groups to depose him. Why does it seem that exiled revolutionaries always seem to need expensive whiskey and fancy restaurants for inspiration, or at least as compensation for a failed uprising?
This book, however, is not the story of an unsuccessful revolution or of heroic revolutionaries. It is aimed at those who want to penetrate the hothouse of emotion behind revolution and feel for themselves the jumble of love, anger, romance and power that motivate the people who are eventually depicted in the media as heroes who changed the course of history.
The boy-man Nuri el-Alfi is involved in a romantic rivalry with his father that begins one pleasant summer on a beach in the Egyptian port city of Alexandria, where they move after Nuri’s mother dies. That’s the summer they both fall in love with a young Egyptian-British woman, Mona, who is there searching for her Egyptian roots. Kamal, a former adviser to the Libyan ruler, is 15 years older than Mona, while Nuri is 14 years younger. Within a short time, Kamal marries her, and Nuri gets a young stepmother, the object of his first serious crush. The rivalry continues for more than a decade, ending only after Kamal disappears mysteriously, apparently kidnapped and returned to his homeland by the Libyan regime.
But the book, which was published in English last year and is coming out now in Hebrew, is not merely the story of an impossible love triangle that just happens to take place in Alexandria. In fine and precise prose, Matar methodically builds a deepening love story, as well as a political one broken down into its emotional components, to the point that the story line, filled with plot twists, seems like it’s about to collapse under the weight of all these experiences.
Four cities
The people whose lives are charted in “Anatomy of a Disappearance” are not its only characters; the book is also about four cities. Geneva is the focus, a junction for the paths of the protagonists, the hub of Kamal’s secret activities and the place from which he is kidnapped. In addition to Alexandria, Cairo also plays a powerful role; it is where Nuri is born and where his mother and her family lived. Their unnamed homeland lies in the distance, unknown to Nuri except as the country of his admired father, who sends his son to England to study and forbids him to work until he has finished his education. “How is a young man to know himself if he is required to plunge into the first job offered him? Humility is not learned through humiliation,” the father explains to the son. And so London also enters the picture.
Each city has its place in constructing Nuri’s personality. The emotional chill of Geneva; London’s indifferent, minor-key elegance; the choking familial warmth of Cairo; and, of course, the setting for Nuri’s first love, Alexandria -- all contribute to the making of Nuri as a man of many experiences, but also as one who lacks roots.
The book is loosely based on Matar’s own life, as was his first novel, “In the Country of Men,” and it was completed just as the revolution in Libya began last year. Hisham Matar was born in New York in 1970 to a Libyan diplomat, Jaballa Matar, who was forced to flee the regime in 1979. From exile in Cairo, Matar’s father continued to oppose the Gadhafi government until he was kidnapped in 1990, apparently by Egyptian undercover agents. To this day no one knows what became of him. Several members of Matar’s family were executed by the Gadhafi regime, and when the uprising began, Matar, who studied architecture before turning to writing, started a campaign to enlist Western powers to attack and overthrow the dictator.
In his second novel Matar tries to be less overtly political and direct, and more contemplative. The beauty of his writing stems from the thin veil through which he describes his family’s tragedy and the skill with which he builds dramatic plot twists.
No less than it is about Matar’s own family, this book is also the story of the thousands of families of political activists in exile from Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Iran, cut off from their home countries while they conduct temporary lives, sometimes for decades. Some of them become absorbed by the daily grind of existence, some turn to business, and a handful continue in opposition movements, writing pamphlets or blogs and waving signs in front of their countries’ embassies.
Endless task
The dream of revolution that nourished Matar’s father and many other Libyan exiles is no longer relevant now that the revolution has taken place and the country’s guts have been spilled in the street, where they still lie scattered. Now the dream, albeit a distant one, is of a stable government. Violent and bloody power struggles threaten to tear the country apart, tribes are renewing old rivalries, and the ideal of democracy following closely on the heels of revolution is looking more and more like the stuff fantasy.
A year ago I met an Iranian exile who lives in London and spends most of his time working on an opposition website. “It’s an endless task,” he told me. “After all, even if we succeed in getting rid of the ayatollahs, we can’t be sure that their replacement will not see us, the revolutionary exiles, as a threat to the new regime.” Iraqi and Libyan political exiles who returned to their countries after their regimes were toppled know this dilemma well.
It is interesting to consider what the protagonist of Matar’s book, or the author’s actual father, would do today. Would he return to Libya to change the course of history, or keep waiting in Geneva or London to make sure he does not end up buried by history?

Doors guitarist Robby Krieger was the man behind some of the band's most successful songs including their anthemic single, Light My Fire and Gibson's signature definitely does his talent justice.
“I’ve always been drawn to a Gibson SG and Gibson guitars in general. I’ve always loved the way they look, they way they play and, of course, the sound. I love the fat sound of a Gibson … that’s how I like a guitar to sound.” – Robby Krieger, guitarist, The Doors
Here's what Gibson say; 'Robby Krieger is a genuine American icon, and Gibson Custom is proud to honor his legacy with the introduction of the new Inspired By Robby Krieger SG.
Blending several features from some of Krieger’s favorite SGs, the new Inspired By Robby Krieger SG is one of the most comfortable playing SGs to ever leave Gibson Custom.
Made of traditional solid mahogany and finished in his personal Aged Dark Heritage Cherry finish, the Krieger Inspired By model recreates the body of his beloved 1967 SG Standard, right down to the tiniest scratches, dings and belt rash.
The neck is also an SG one-piece mahogany neck, but with a hybrid neck profile modeled after the neck on a '61 SG Standard owned by a close friend and the neck on his personal ’67 SG Standard. Krieger’s signature sound is delivered through a pair of Gibson’s ’57 Classic pickups that release a warm, full tone with a balanced response, packing all the tremendous “PAF” humbucker crunch expected from a Gibson humbucker.
Everything else.'Zelda: A Link Between Worlds guide – Link’s Awakening
Part one of our complete Zelda: A Link Between Worlds guide, Link’s Awakening.
Link’s Awakening
Link’s House
Late for Work!
The legend begins with Link’s nightmare interrupted by knocking at his door. Can a hero ever catch a break? Turns out it’s Link’s good friend Gulley, who notifies our hero that he happens to be late for work, and that his papa is upset. Looks like you’re already in trouble! Get out of bed, smash some barrels for a Rupee or two and then follow Gulley outside.
Hyrule Field
Strange Statues
Upon going outside, Gulley will introduce you to a weather vane. These are checkpoints that allow you to save your game, and are marked on the world map when triggered. Try it out and spin the vane to save your progress.
Follow the Leader
Now it’s time to follow that rascal Gulley. Head left one screen and continue on Gulley’s trail north. Then take a left to meet up with Gulley and arrive at the Blacksmith’s house. Head inside the house and chat with the Blacksmith, his wife and the Captain. It seems like your punishment will have to wait, because Captain forgot his refurbished sword! The Blacksmith gives you an errand: Deliver the sword to the Captain.
Hyrule Castle
Aye Aye, Captain!
Grab ahold of the Captain’s Sword. The Blacksmith will inform you that the Captain headed to Hyrule Castle. Don’t worry if you’re not sure where that is – the Blacksmith will mark it on your world map and it’s not too far from here. Proceed up one screen, then take a right to arrive at Hyrule Castle. See the strange paintings on the castle walls? Something’s fishy here.
Talk to the guard at the main entrance of the castle. Unfortunately, it seems the Captain wandered off to the Sanctuary. The Sanctuary will be marked on your map, and is located just north of Hyrule Castle. The correct screen path is left, up and then right.
Sanctuary
No Time to Pray
At the Sanctuary’s entrance, you’ll encounter Dampe and Seres. Seres informs Link that the Captain is inside chatting with the Priest, and enters the Sanctuary. Suddenly, the Sanctuary’s doors slam shut, and you hear a shriek from inside! Dampe fails to open the doors and cannot get into the building. However, the graveyard digger mentions a secret passageway into the Sanctuary from the Graveyard, located just east of your location. It looks like you’ll have to borrow the Captain’s sword – whether you agree with Dampe or not!
Graveyard
Grave Searching
You now officially equip the Forgotten Sword. Use B to slash enemies or bushes in your way. When ready, head right one screen to arrive at the Graveyard. There, you’ll see a particular tombstone surrounded by multiple stones and guarded by two small trees. Slash the trees in the front, grab ahold of the tombstone (hold A) and then push it upward to reveal a hidden stairwell. Descend in the dark passage to discover a treasure chest. Open it to obtain the Lamp. Equip the Lamp from the menu screen – now you can see better!
Sanctuary’s Underground Passage
Ignite Thee
The door ahead of you is locked. The encrypted stone gives you a hint on how to open it; ignite the two unlit torches with your Lamp (by pressing Y) to open the path. This grants entry to the second room of the secret passage.
Need a Key
The second room is infested with rats. Save yourself from pressure and ignite the torches to improve your sight. Defend yourself with your sword and use it to vanquish your foes. The goal is to gain entry to the door in the northwest corner at the top of stairs, but it’s locked. Seems you need a key!
First, make sure to snag a Red Rupee from the chest on the first level (that equals 20 Rupees). Then, ascend the stairs and take a right from the locked door. Follow the cage platform and avoid a fall. This will lead you to another chest at the upper-central nook, which contains a small Key. Use that key to unlock the door. A Heart Piece rests on the upper-right nook in this room, but you won’t be able to access it right now.
Ghosts & Levers
Two Poes – or ghosts – guard the following hall. Strike them a couple times with your sword. Once they’re defeated, the door ahead will open. In the next corridor, you see two levers that you can pull on the left and right side walls. Pulling the right one pits you against some snake foes (which can easily be tamed). The left lever opens the door on top of the stairs that gives you access to the Sanctuary, where you’re treated to a lengthy cinema. Some unfortunate events ensue; a wicked wizard named Yuga turns Sere into a portrait, Link is left unconscious, and the Priest pleas to warn Princess Zelda. Shall we say, Deja vu?

Patti has acted as my real estate agent for Marin County for the about last six years. I have found her to be energetic, knowledgeable, friendly, efficient, professional, and highly intelligent. She lives and breathes real estate. Many agents approach their job from a hobby level perspective. Not Patti. For her real estate is a calling. She knows her market, and that's what a buyer/seller needs..
Patti helped my wife and I sell a property in Larkspur and buy a home in Novato and we felt like she always had out best interests at the forefront. She sold our house and got us a good deal on the purchase. We will definitely use her again. She was honest, personable and really knows the Marin County real estate market inside and out. She is very fast and responsive while being enthusiastic and dynamic.
Patti Cohn has been my realtor since 1990 representing me as either a buyer or a seller in 8 real estate transactions during those years. There is no one else I would trust as much to get a real estate transaction handled, completed, signed, sealed, and delivered with more integrity, timeliness, and professionalism. She is a total pro at what she does and I couldn't possibly recommend her any more highly..
I asked Patti to list my home in Stinson Beach after it was previously listed with a local broker. I gave Patti 4 months to complete the sale and she got it done. She was relentless in her pursuit and kept pushing until the sale closed. I recommend Patti very highly. She is aggressive, resourceful and a masterful negotiator.
Patti is local girl who has an instinctive knowledge of the Marin County market. She is always just a phone call away and will close the toughest deals we have. I wouldn't look anywhere else, she's our Go To Marin Realator!.2014-2015 Concert Season

Your wife would be subject to the sames earnings limits as those who are in early retirement
She is in her early 50's so she is not retirement age.
Yes, I know -but the earnings limits are the same
because she is under full retirement age
Approximately what would those earning be?
If she makes over $15,120 she is reduced $1 for every $2 above that amount
Where would I find those regulations? What keyword would I use?

You're welcome. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
I went to SS twice and got two different answers. I can retire now at 66.5, and defer my retirement until up to 70 so I get a better rate. And I can also get the retroactive amount for my children and wife up to 6 months. Another SS agent said that I must retire now and start receiving benefits to get the retroactive amount for my children and wife. Which is correct?
If you file and suspend, then you can get the benefits for your children and wife
Retroactrive too?
Yes, you should get retroactive benefitsLife after Assad looks ominous for Syria's Christian minority

Respected as one of East Timor's leading musicians, Ego Lemos is involved in a renewal of indigenous music and language in the world's newest nation. He is also trying to encourage the reintroduction of traditional agricultural techniques (he has co-written books on Timorese permaculture) that, he argues, will assist this poor nation's efforts to become genuinely independent. It's a huge task for the gifted musician, singer, songwriter and composer, whose simple and heartfelt music has taken him around the world for many years, with successful visits to the UK (supported by Oxfam), Japan, India, Brazil, New Zealand and Australia. In a significant cross-cultural indigenous musical collaboration, Ego recently joined rising Aboriginal music star Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu to stage a duet performance at the 2008 Darwin Festival. Australian audiences first saw Ego perform solo in mid-2007, then with his Timorese band Cinco do Oriente in mid-2008 at the Dreaming Festival, Australia's premier indigenous festival, in Queensland. Since 1990, Ego has also been in demand as a guest speaker, addressing conferences in more than 10 countries to speak on issues such as sustainable agriculture, peace, globalisation and East Timorese independence.Apartment and House Rentals, Studios,

So you'll have to excuse Nets announcer Ian Eagle for losing his cool—or, at least, sounding like he'd lost his cool—while calling the Nets game against the Celtics on Saturday night. Shortly after his broadcasting partner Mike Fratello gave an explanation concerning "slip screens" to all 16 people out there watching the Nets game at home on Saturday night, Eagle took it upon himself to point out that he felt the Czar's explanation had been a bunch of, as he put it, "gobbledygook."
"Can I make one point?" Eagle said after a foul on the court towards the end of the game. ."
The Czar explained that he didn't think he was patronizing at all and asked Eagle if he was in a bad mood. Eagle explained that he was working his second Nets game in two nights. And, after a few tense moments, they shared a laugh.
So, was there really beef between them during the game—or was this just a result of two guys realizing that they'd just wasted the last three hours of their lives watching the Nets lose yet again? Either way, it gives us at least one reason to tune into the Nets/Heat game tonight.

Raqmiyat, a leading UAE-based systems integrator, has announced the implementation of ‘WPS Connect’ for Citibank NA (Citi) in the UAE, which provided a platform for the global banking firm to adhere to regulatory requirements related to the UAE Ministry of Labour and Central Bank-mandated ‘Wages Protection System’ (WPS).
The interface covers all cycles contemplated under the WPS - from funding to payment of wages - and enables the banks’ corporate and retail accounts to participate in WPS.
Raqmiyat has successfully completed the implementation in four weeks, making Citi the first bank to deploy ‘WPS Connect’ and comply with the Ministry of Labour and Central Bank WPS regulations, while giving them the flexibility and scalability to meet customer requirements.
‘WPS Connect’ is a state of the art solution that comes with a browser-based architecture, making it easily deployable and scalable.
The solution also has a role-based system, which provides Citi’s personnel from specific departments’ access only to screens that they need to manage or are relevant to them.
Further, the software allows the bank to use its existing file transfer mechanisms, while providing adequate security to arrest any possible file tampering. Citi’s selection was based on the robust technology and in-depth functionality of ‘WPS Connect’, and Raqmiyat’s strong reputation and extensive experience in the banking, financial services and insurance sector.
.
Raqmiyat’s ‘WPS Connect’ is based on the exchange of stipulated file formats and offers added features such as salary reminder reports, automatic file transfer mechanism and database update. It also aids in the generation of key reports and provides an extensive audit trail mechanism. In addition to aiding its compliance to government regulations, ‘WPS Connect’ allows Citi to service employees who constitute their retail customer accounts as well as non-account holders through a prepaid card solution, thus helping the bank to cater to a wider cross-section of customers.
Raqmiyat offers high quality business and technology solutions through partnership with leading international IT companies. Experienced in deploying basic and complex IT solutions, the company has worked with over 42 UAE-based banks during their adoption of the widely successful ICCS solution.
The company also recently opened a state-of-the-art software development centre in Chennai, India to support its growing operations.Key things you need to know aboutDr. Buxton:

Indeed! Trivial but would be handy :)
I don't find it trivial at all. I came across this post looking for a way to include html in my agent signatures. My organization uses html image signatures, so it's rather important to us that this be implemented.
Glad to hear this, Walter. That's another vote for implementing this feature, which, in the scheme of much more complicated features Zendesk has added over time, this one should be an easy no-brainer, in my estimation.
It could be tough to implement because of the use of single and double quotations in html- my programming knowledge is limited- but I know that it could be complicated on the back-end for Zendesk engineers to implement, but what I have distaste for is when I see certain managers on this forum discounting a paid customer's requests (and I have no where to vent such frustration with Zendesk executives because they've hidden away their contact information).
So I'll give it some time. Zendesk has 11 months to retain me as a customer. This first year is being viewed as an evaluative period for us. If the product doesn't meet 3/4 of our needs, then it'll be time to move on.
I think this is similar/related to another forum request. There's several requests related to HTML in this section.
If you vote for this one below, signatures shouldn't be a problem any more.
Why is giving your customers ways to connect with you that work for them... trivial?

Agatha's first marriage, to Archibald Christie, ended in divorce in 1928. In the autumn of that year she booked a ticket on the Orient Express. From Baghdad she travelled on to Ur, to Leonard Woolley's excavations, widely published in England at that time. Visitors to Woolley's dig were discouraged, but Agatha was warmly received, the formidable Katharine Woolley being an admirer of her books. Agatha was entranced by the beauty of the desert and the life of the camp and took up Katharine's invitation to return early in 1930.
Katharine instructed Max Mallowan, one of Woolley's team, who had been absent the year before, to escort Agatha on a tour of local sights on the way back to Baghdad, and, when she had to return home urgently to her daughter Rosalind, who was ill, Max travelled with her to England. They kept in touch, Max came to stay in Devon, and in May 1930, he asked Agatha to marry him. After a month, she said yes.Edmonton, Alberta (November 5, 2009)– Recruit your crew and fight for the lost! Leading video game developer BioWare™, a division of Electronic Arts Inc.

Thus closed the reign of King John of Scotland, which had lasted three years and seven months, and a second interregnum began, though successive Regents continued to act in the name of the late King. The subsequent movements of the luckless ex-King may be traced in the Public Records of England. His first place of captivity was Hertford, where he remained till August, 1297. He was allowed to amuse himself in hunting, was provided with a suitable retinue, and received seventeen shillings a day for sustenance. From Hertford he was transferred to the greater security of the Tower. Even there he was not debarred from reasonable pleasure. His household contained two esquires, one huntsman and his page, a barber, a chaplain, a steward, a butler, two chamberlains, a clerk of the chapel, a washerwoman, and three lads. He had horses, no doubt, and mention is made of two greyhounds and ten hounds.
He remained an inmate of the Tower till August, 1299, when King Edward summoned him to his presence at Canterbury.

Despite leading the league with 66 wins last season and riding a wave of "Unbutu" all the way to Banner 17, they're not among the trendy picks for a title in 2008-09. Some have even gone as far as to suggest last year was a fluke, and that the aging Celtics won't be able to keep up with the younger, more athletic teams in the East.
"Oh, I don't care one way or the other," head coach Doc Rivers said. "We pick us. We picked us last year, too."
Since 1986, only eight different franchises have captured NBA titles, including back-to-back wins for the Lakers, Pistons and Rockets, plus a pair of three-peats by the Bulls. But no team's made a successful defense since the Lakers won three straight from 1999-2002. In Boston, there hasn't been a championship repeat since the Bill Russell days.
"The confidence has grown from winning a championship," Paul Pierce told NBA.com. "The guys love that feeling. For us to do it again would be a hell of an accomplishment, because a Celtics team hasn't done it in 40 years."
Boston still has its core in Paul Pierce, Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett. The trio of perennial All-Stars and potential Hall of Famers may be a year older, but they still have the desire to win. The first ring taught them it only makes you want another one even more.
"This is a new year. We have a new goal," Garnett said. "The three of us are very competitive. We're still hungry."
Aside from his basketball prowess, KG also has a knack for finding the perfect simile for any situation. Winning a championship is no different.
"It's like living in an apartment and finally getting that nice home," he said. "You defend your apartment, but some day you'll own a home. It's nice. You've got grass. You've got to cut it — front, back, side. You've got a lawn system. It's yours. You want them to stay off the grass. You don't want people coming through your yard, leaving trail marks."
The Celtics left marks all over the league last year, completing the best worst-to-first turnaround in NBA history. They engaged in grueling seven-games series against Atlanta and Cleveland before defeating Detroit in the Eastern Conference Finals, then blew out their nemesis Lakers in Game 6 of the NBA Finals for a title 22 years in the making.
The team that returns to the parquet tonight will feature many of the same names, including the same starting five from a year ago. Point guard Rajon Rondo and center Kendrick Perkins continue to grow and flourish around the Big Three.
"This is my ninth year starting a season, and this is the first time in my coaching career (having the same starters from a year before)," Rivers said. "So that's how rare it is, and it means a lot."
There were key losses as well. P.J. Brown retired once again, and James Posey cashed in and moved on to New Orleans. But bringing back almost an entire championship squad also puts a larger target on a team.
"We want to do it again," Rivers said. "It's pressure, but it's good pressure. The kind of pressure you want."
The division won't be the cakewalk it was last season. Elton Brand has joined an up-and-coming Philadelphia team, and former Pacer Jermaine O'Neal is now with the Toronto Raptors. With that type of improvement within the Atlantic, the Celtics will need some of their own as well, as hard as it might be to top last season.
Beyond that, they'll still have to contend with rising teams like Orlando and Atlanta, an improved Cleveland squad and the stalwarts from Detroit.
"The bottom line is we have to be a better team than we were last year to win it. We believe that," Rivers said. "To us, that's a process that we're going to have to go through all year to improve as a basketball team. And I think I have a group of guys that are willing to do that."
There's no doubt that Garnett is willing, and that's something that will again rub off on his teammates.
"He's a lot more intense this year," Pierce said. "I didn't think he could go to another level, but he has. It's infectious and you see it in practice — it's like we never won anything."
"After you win, you're motivated even more to win it again," he said.
Many of the Celtic greats who were always motivated toward the next championship will be in attendance at tonight's season-opener against the Cavaliers. They'll be part of the ceremony as these current Celtics raise No. 17 to the Garden rafters, and then immediately begin work on No. 18.
Winning a championship assures they'll forever be considered the best NBA team for at least one season, but to be remembered as one of the great Celtics teams is something that would mean a lot more.
"You look around at all the banners, all the great teams, all the great players that have been here, they all did it more than once," Pierce said, "and that's the challenge now."

In-depth interview is a qualitative research method in which experienced researchers conduct one-on-one interviews with the research objects using a semi-structured discussion guide.
Compared to focus groups, in-depth interviews are more flexible, confidential and thorough. Therefore, in-depth interview is often a good choice when the research objects are business leaders or professionals, etc., or when the respondents may be reluctant to share their opinions on the research topic.

The game was tight from the start as both teams were tied at the end of three of the four quarters, forcing the extra session. Even in overtime, neither team could break away from the other, forcing another OT. Finally, Ashe was able to outscore the Bears 6-4 to get the win.
In addition to his 25 points, Sheets added six rebounds and a steal. Connor Bowers finished the game with nine points, four rebounds, one assist, one steal and one block. Bradley Lucas had six points and game highs in rebounds (seven) and assists (four).

Hippocrates of Chios was a merchant who fell in with a pirate ship and lost all his possessions.

For he thought that from the quadrature of the lune the quadrature of the circle could also be calculated.33

Eudemus,35 however, in his History of Geometry says that Hippocrates did not demonstrate the quadrature of the lune on the side of a square36 but generally, as one might say.37 For every lune has an outer circumference equal to a semicircle or greater or less, and if Hippocrates squared the lune having an outer circumference equal to a semicircle and greater and less, the quadrature would appear to be proved generally.38 I shall set out what Eudemus wrote word for word, adding only for the sake of clearness a few things taken from Euclid's Elements on account of the summary style of Eudemus, who set out his proofs in abridged form in conformity with the ancient practice. He writes thus in the second book of the History of Geometry:
The quadratures of lunes, which seemed to belong to an uncommon class of propositions by reason of the close relationship to the circle, were first investigated by Hippocrates, and seemed to be set out in correct form; therefore we shall deal with them at length and go through them. He made his starting-point, and set out as the first of the theorems useful to this purpose, that similar segments of circles have the same ratios as the squares on their bases.39 And this he proved by showing that the squares on the diameters have the same ratios as the circles.40 Having first shown this he described in what way it was possible to square a lune whose outer circumference was a semicircle. He did this by circumscribing about a right-angled isosceles triangle a semicircle and about the base a segment of a circle similar to those cut off by the sides.41 Since the segment about the base is equal to the sum of those about the sides,42 it follows that when the part of the triangle above the segment about the base is added to both, the lune will be equal to the triangle.43
Therefore the lune, having been proved equal to the triangle, can be squared. In this way, taking a semicircle as the outer circumference of the lune, Hippocrates readily squared the lune.
32Philoponus was a sixth century CE philosopher and Christian theologian who studied the works of Greek philosophers, especially those of Aristotle, and wrote extensive commentaries on them. This excerpt comes from a commentary on Aristotle's Physics. A native of Egyptian Alexandria, he lives at the end of the period of Greek progress in the sciences.
33We will analyze in detail Hippocrates' quadrature of one type of lune in the next text below. It is enough for now to understand the point Philoponus makes here concerning the quadrature of the circle. For Hippocrates' work represented the first time that someone had determined the area of a figure with curved sides - in fact, with circular sides - and it was thought that the techniques he used for the quadrature of the lune might lead to a positive resolution to the quadrature of the circle. Alas, as we shall see below, this was never to be!
34Simplicius was another sixth century commentator on early Greek texts, notably on the works of Aristotle and Euclid. He was born in Cilicia, a Roman province which is today part of Turkey. He studied in Alexandria under a pupil of Proclus, and also at Athens at Plato's Academy.
35Eudemus of Rhodes lived in the late fourth century BCE and was the first historian of mathematics. He was a fellow student with Aristotle in Athens and authored histories of geometry, arithmetic and astronomy, none of which survive today. What we know of his work is based on references and quotes in other works like this commentary on Aristotle's Physics by Simplicius. Here Simplicius quotes from Eudemus' history of geometry. Because Eudemus is writing so much closer in time to Hippocrates and the other Greek geometers, he is considered a valuable historical source.
36By this, Simplicius means the quadrature of the lune constructed as follows: given a circle and an inscribed square, build the circle whose diameter is one of the sides of the square. The lune being described here is the one inside the second smaller circle and outside the larger.
37Simplicius seems to believe that Hippocrates had claimed to have successfully squared the circle as a result of his work on lunes, but the argument he gives does not accomplish this, so Simplicius is not to be trusted on this account.
38A lune has two boundary arcs; the line segment that joins the endpoints of these arcs forms a chord in each of the two circles. Simplicius is here describing the situation in which the arc of the outer circle is a semicircle, or is less than a semicircle, or more than a semicircle. If Hippocrates had successfully worked out the quadrature of the lune in all these cases, then by arranging that the outer arc of the lune increases to its greatest possible extent and the inner arc shrinks to a point, then the lune becomes a full circle and the quadrature of the circle would be resolved!
39A segment of a circle is any portion of the circle cut off by a single line. Segments are similar if the arcs that bound them come from equal central angles in their respective circles (the shaded areas labeled s and S in the figure below).
Thus, to say that "similar segments of circles have the same ratios as the squares on their bases" means that the ratio of the areas of the segments is the same as the ratio of the squares of the lengths of their straight line bases. In symbols, if one segment s has base b and the other segment S has base B, then
40This result (Elements, XII.2) is the key idea behind this quadrature. It says that if one circle c has diameter d and another circle C has diameter D, then
Draw the diameter d through one of the endpoints of b, then complete the triangle two of whose sides are b and d. (Refer to Figure 7.) Similarly, in circle C, draw diameter D through one of the endpoints of B, then complete the triangle two of whose sides are B and D. Then, on the one hand, similarity of the segments means that segment s is the same fraction of circle c that segment S is of circle C, or
41The semicircle circumscribed around the right triangle in Figure 9 forms the outer circumference of the lune. The inner circumference is formed by the arc of a second circle that makes a segment with the base PR of the triangle similar to the two segments between the semicircle and the other two sides PQ and QR of the triangle. Each of these three segments cuts off a 90 degree arc from its circle.
Simplicius described this lune as one ön the side of a square." To see that he is talking about the same lune as the one described by Eudemus, consider from the diagram below the entire circle that forms the inner circumference of this lune. The base of the semicircle that forms the outer circumference of the lune is one side of a square that can be inscribed in this inner circle. Thus, the lune can be seen to rest on neighboring vertices of a square inscribed in the circle that forms its inner circumference.
Figure 10
42This is determined by combining the result on ratios of similar segments with the Pythagorean theorem. Referring to this figure, the Pythagorean theorem says that (PQ)2 + (QR)2 = (PR)2. But b = PQ = QR is the common length of the base of the two small segments, and B = PR is the length of the base of the larger segment, so we can express this relation as b2 + b2 = B2, or in terms of ratios,
43Hippocrates' lune is comprised of both of the two small circular segments and the isosceles right triangle (see Figure 9). Since the sum of the two small segments is equal to the one larger one, and replacing the two smaller areas with the larger one produces the triangle PQR, Hippocrates has therefore shown that the lune equals the triangle!As you consider a stress fracture and findings of his father and adhering to a 2009 survey by the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) conducted by Washington provides specializes in two variations such as heel cupping for extra cervical causes.

Difficult issue.The to 1996—to install around 14 million land lines. Between 1996 and 2000, with the liberalization of the telecom sector, India’s installed capacity doubled to around 30 million lines. In the next five years, India’s telephone companies added another 90 million lines (of which 70 million were cell phone lines.)
Imagine if the government had continued to monopolize the sector and had continued the installation of capacity at the pre-1996 rate. It would have taken about 300 years—or till 2300—to reach today’s installed capacity. Astonishing things happen when the government gets out of the business of business, or at least allows the private sector to do its thing without trying to cripple it. Take another sector where the government allowed private firms to compete—the airlines. I recall those days where one was often reduced to begging a government employee at the airlines office for the privilege of being treated rudely by the airline staff on flights that more often than not delayed. Those were the days my friend, we thought would never end.
The license quota permit control regime was instituted with the express purpose of making sure that essential goods and services were affordable and available to the people and thus was the sole prerogative of the government. An admirable socialist goal of reaching the commanding heights of the economy. The outcome should not come as a surprise: shoddy goods and services, affordable and available to only those who had the clout and could bribe the officials. Bajaj scooters had a waiting time of 7 to 10 years! They were prized as dowry; want your homely daughter married soon, promise a scooter to sweeten the deal.
While the Indian economy has done better since the government has started relaxing its chokehold on it, there is much that is left undone. Until the bureaucrats and the politicians let go entirely, the Indian economy has a hard row to hoe. It is imperative that we ask and clearly understand what motivated the policy-makers to hobble the economy for so many decades. Without that frank enquiry, we may never fully understand which mistakes were made and therefore continue to stumble into the same traps.
By now, even the minimally awake observer may conclude that the private sector can do business better than the public sector can. For instance, India’s private sector uses capital very efficiently. Lee Kuan Yew points it out in his lecture (see part 1 here and part 2 here of my commentary):
A factor worth noting: India gets a much better economic return for the investment it makes in its economy because India’s private sector capital efficiency is high. If India opens up fully to FDIs, the results will be profitable for the investor and add considerable employment and added GDP growth for India. With jobs there will be a trickle down of wealth to millions of Indian workers, as there has been in East Asia.
Globally, there is a savings glut which is looking for investment opportunities. India would be the destination of this massive investment but the economy needs liberalization. If I am asked what I thought of the liberalization of the Indian economy, I would echo Gandhi (the home-grown one) and say, “I think it would be a good idea.”
The liberalization so far is too little but I sincerely hope it is not too late. LKY points to some stellar examples—they are miniscule in the context of the Indian economy but they are indicative of what is possible.?
Why indeed. The Indian private sector can do much better but can’t. Why? Here is my conjecture on what LKY thinks is the reason: the mendacity, greed and ignorance of Indian politicians. LKY is a shrewd observer, of course. But even dim-witted people have realized that when it comes to greed Indian politicians are a class apart. Exposing that greed, mendacity and ignorance is fast becoming a thriving cottage industry as evidenced by Tehelka and Cobrapost.
Being a scholar and a gentleman, he really could not come right out and tell the politicians to their face that they are the problem. So he used a well-worn technique of deflecting the blow by saying that it is politics that is to blame. More over, he did not present it as his own conclusion but let other well-known Indians speak:.
There you have it. The failing of the system are centered around politics. And who engage in politics? Therefore politicians. He said it to their face, however a bit more politely than I would have. He quotes Dr Singh’s interview in which Dr Singh pleads that his inability to govern arises from the coalition that he has clubbed together to do the job. But LKY does not let him off the hook.
Earlier this year, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh gave a wide-ranging interview to the McKinsey Quarterly. He rated his own government’s achievement as 6 out of 10, a performance he said was unsatisfactory. He acknowledged the need for better infrastructure, for more FDI, and also the need to move ahead in manufacturing. When asked whether the pace of implementation was fast enough, he replied:
” … ….. …. I do recognise that at times it gives our system the label that it is slow moving. In a world in which technology is changing at such a fast pace, where demand conditions change very fast, we need to look at a more innovative mechanism to cut down on this rigmarole of many tiers of decision-making processes.”
Prime Minister Singh added, “We are a coalition government and that limits our options in some ways.”
It is a sad sight: the Prime Minister of the country making excuses. Straight talk would be appreciated, instead of the mealy-mouthed equivocation emphasized above. Say, “our system is slow moving” instead of “at times it gives our system the label that it is slow moving.”
LKY responds to that excuse by rejecting it. He also rejects the notion that because India is a “democracy,” it is slow.
Politics is a fact of life in any country. And coalition politics is a fact of Indian political life.
It has been suggested that India’s.
I agree with LKY. Fundamentally, what we finally achieve is what we are willing to settle for. This true at all levels of organization. As individuals, we pretty much end up where we have set our goals. Our achievements reflect to an unusually large extent what we set out to do. At the aggregate level, the society we end up having is determined by what type of society we desire. It is a cultural thing: the obtained level of corruption, poverty, filth etc is determined by how our culture accepts, tolerates, and takes as normal certain levels of corruption, poverty, filth, etc. It is the tolerance of corruption, poverty, filth that allow them to exist to the extent that they do.
So he says that politicians cannot hide behind the excuse that politics is what explains the poor performance.
By way of example, Chinese politics have always been plagued by factionalism. China also has great regional diversity. Like India, China also has powerful vested bureaucratic interests. But Deng Xiaoping forged a basic consensus among all political factions and the bureaucracy on the economic development and the necessary opening up to the outside world to succeed. A similar consensus can be achieved in India.
Next he goes on to point out that we have some great opportunities which must be taken to their logical conclusion instead of half-hearted implementation.
The passage of the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) Bill by the Lok Sabha (Lower House of the Indian Parliament) in May this year was an important move. SEZs can finesse some difficult internal issues blocking liberalisation. Singapore has some experience with SEZs in China. If India thinks it useful, we are willing to share our experiences with you, building upon what we have done in the Bangalore International Technology Park. I must conclude with a word of caution. SEZs, once embarked upon, must be made to succeed, which means total and sustained commitment from politicians and bureaucrats at national, state and local levels.
When they succeed, they will have a powerful effect on the whole economy, give a boost of confidence and spark off a healthy competitive dynamic between different states and regions. Successful SEZs also will erode opposition to reforms because their benefits become self-evident, as has happened in China.
He concludes this part of his talk with a wonderful example of the mendacity of the communists. West Bengal, once upon a time the most valuable jewel in the Crown, is a basket case, now more known around the world as the “Gutter” (thanks to the tireless working of the “Saint of the Gutters” who enriched her own organization by show-casing the poverty of Bengal). How did this remarkably sorry transformation take place, you may ask. The secret sauce: communists.
A few months ago, in August, the communist Chief Minister of West Bengal was in Singapore to drum up investments for his state offering market incentives to attract investors. He said: “The lesson from the collapse of the Soviet Union and from China is that [India] must reform, perform or perish.” That very same month, members of his own party in Lok Sabha in New Delhi forced a retreat on India’s privatisation programme. This is India’s party politics.
Pondering the imponderables is next on LKY’s mind. He lets Prof Pranab Bardhan speak about the important distinctions which lie at the base of the differential performance of China and India.
There are some imponderables. American commentators believe that China’s political system is too rigid, that it does not have the flexibility of pluralistic politics and democracy with freedom of speech, the media, assembly and respect for human rights. So China will encounter severe problems and setbacks. Professor Pranab Bardhan of University of California, Berkeley, has explained the problem this way:
“China’s authoritarian system of government will likely be a major economic liability in the long run, regardless of its immediate implications for short-run policy decisions.
“But inequalities (particularly rural-urban) have been increasing in China, and those left behind are getting restive.
”With massive layoffs in the rust-belt provinces, arbitrary local levies on farmers, pervasive official corruption, and toxic industrial dumping, many in the countryside are highly agitated.
”.
Prof Bardhan’s assessment is that India’s ability to politically manage conflict better than China could be a reason to believe that India holds at least one good card in its hand.
LKY diplomatically states that he believes that China will learn how to manage conflict in time and that it is not realistic to imagine an unchanging Chinese political system. As he says in the conditional below, India will draw ahead in the longer term only if the Chinese make the mistake of not transforming their political structure.
If they are right, India will draw ahead in the longer term.
Such analyses assume that the Chinese political system will remain static. If China’s political structures do not adjust to accommodate the changes in its society resulting from high rates of growth, India will have an advantage because of its more flexible political system in the longer term.
But Bardhan also cautions: “India’s reform has been halting and hesitant. India’s heterogeneous society has been riddled with conflicts, but the system has by and large managed these. There are many severe pitfalls and roadblocks which India and China have to overcome.”
Both India and China are huge countries with vast populations and long histories. They have to evolve standards of governance that is consonant with their cultures and the spirit of their civilisations.
The implicit assumption of that last statement is that Indian and Chinese cultures are different. To me, cultural distinctions explain the varying performance of different groups of people. In some sense, it is a dismal conclusion because it means that to succeed, ultimately one must change a dysfunctional culture, and success is not going to be easy.
At stake is the future of one billion Indians. India must make up for much time lost. There is in fact already a strong political consensus between India’so’s government. India now has a strong, able and experienced team with Manmohan Singh as PM. The time has come for India’s next tryst with destiny.
The first tryst with destiny did not work out as planned, if you pardon the pun. Too much planning can lead to failure of plans. Indian leaders and policymakers have a seemingly hypocritical attitude towards the people. The people are assumed sophisticated enough to figure out who should rule the nation, but they are not smart enough to make simple day to day market decisions; for the latter, they have to have a patronizing government official in charge.
If I were the one making pretty speeches for the next tryst with destiny, I would recommend a few things such as trusting the people a bit more, and trusting the bureaucrats and politicians a bit less.
In the next and final bit I will summarize what I learnt from LKY’s speech.

InterAksyon.com
The online news portal of TV5
BEIJING - weeks out of public view, when he was apparently ill. Now he and other leaders risk being seen as hiding from a widespread hunger for Beijing to be tougher against Tokyo and other regional rivals.
"We think that the government is too soft and we want to show what we think," said Zhang Xin, one of the many thousands of protesters who converged on the Japanese embassy in Beijing over recent days to vent their rage.
He and tens of thousands of other patriotic demonstrators nation-wide have condemned Japan for buying a cluster of disputed islands in the East China Sea - an outpouring of patriotism that would have been both assuring and alarming to Chinese Communist Party leaders viewing videos and reports of the protests in their leafy, walled compound in central Beijing.
Assuring because the crowds so fervently embraced Beijing's message that it had a rightful claim over the islands, which Tokyo calls the Senkaku and Beijing calls the Diaoyu. Alarming because so many protesters were prepared to say publicly that they did not think their country's leaders had the strength to act on that claim.
"China should make its own demands as a great power," said Zhang, a 25-year-old wholesale food distributor. "I feel disappointed in the government. It's not democratic enough and doesn't heed our voice.
"I hope our leaders can catch up. There's no conflict between democracy and patriotism."
Many demonstrators held up portraits of Mao Zedong, the late Communist revolutionary leader who still serves as a default icon of unity and resolve in times of international tension.
But many protesters also invoked Mao as a sly rebuke to China's current rulers, including President Hu Jintao, who have not made any public statements about the crisis since Japan bought three of the five disputed islands from a private owner last week, triggering condemnation from Beijing.
"Mao was new China's first leader and he knew how to be tough on foreigners," said Shi Lei, 25, a seafood salesman from China's northeast. "If he were still alive we would be at war by now. Hu Jintao and those people are useless and impotent before Japan's provocations."
"Mao is our hero because he fought the Japanese and won," said Chi Lixin, a 29-year-old Beijing businessman. "Our leaders today talk only of peaceful diplomacy and look what happened. They are giving away our land."
Longer-term risks
That mixture of nationalism and frustration was echoed by many in the crowds in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other Chinese cities. Thousands of police and anti-riot troops are sure to prevent that frustration turning into protests against the government, and by Wednesday police were bundling away would-be demonstrators at the Japanese embassy in Beijing.
"Of course, there truly are problems with Japan, but at the same time the government has used this to bundle up a domestic discontent and export it to Japan," said Li Weidong, a political commentator and former magazine editor in Beijing.
"But it's trying to calibrate that venting. The government doesn't want to let this get out control."
The risks to Xi and other emerging leaders are longer term than street protests, said experts on Chinese politics.
The Chinese government is preoccupied with the leadership succession that will happen at a Communist Party congress set to open as early as next month. No firm date has been set.
That succession has been jolted by scandals and uncertainties, and the government is navigating the economy through an unexpectedly sharp slowdown in growth.
The breakdown of relations with Japan will add to that brew of uncertainties, and yet pent-up public demands for a tough response from China will make it harder for Beijing to settle for compromise without appearing weak at home.
"Certainly nobody wants to be viewed as soft on Japan," said Susan Shirk, a professor of China and regional relations at the University of California, San Diego.
Even if risks of military confrontation between Asia's two biggest economies remain scant, room for China to engage in diplomatic give-and-take has shrunk, narrowing the options for any early exit from the territorial dispute.
"Everybody is competing for promotion and having a reputation for being soft on Japan would be definitely bad for your prospects...," said Shirk, who was a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State during the Clinton administration.
Expectations grow on Xi
Chinese experts on Japan see rough times ahead.
.
For Xi, this new phase could be especially troublesome. He is virtually certain to succeed Hu Jintao as Communist chief this year and as president at a parliament session in March.
Like any new Chinese leader, Xi must try to establish his authority even while his predecessors retain considerable influence. In addition, there are widespread expectations that he will be more assertive and nimble than Hu, including abroad.
Chinese analysts and Western diplomats have said Xi is not the hardline, militarist nationalist of some portrayals. But activists campaigning for China to regain control of the disputed East China Sea islands said Xi would have to be more assertive than Hu in pressing Japan, or risk losing credibility.
Tong Zeng, president of the China Federation for Defending the Diaoyu Islands, cited a speech Xi gave in July.
In that speech at Beijing's elite Tsinghua University, Xi said China would "protect relations with nearby countries and broader regional stability, on the basis of staunchly defending its national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity", the Xinhua news agency reported at the time.
For Tong, the activist, that was a signal of a tougher line on the East China Sea islands and other territorial disputes.
"I believe that after he gets into office, the government will have a new policy on these issues," Tong said in an interview before the latest protests.
"Public opinion is overwhelmingly in favor of defending the Diaoyu islands, and so I think the government will have to intensify its efforts." (Additional reporting by Ben Blanchard and Sui-Lee Wee in Beijing and John Ruwitch in Shanghai)FisherMember Since 09 Feb 2011

September 2012
This month’s plant is a stunning shrub in the fall: Callicarpa americana, American beautyberry. During most of the growing season it is a regular-looking green shrub with a rather coarse and open growing habit. In summer, small white or light pink flowers form at the base of the pairs of leaves marching down the stems. So why grow this native plant over many other equally unassuming green shrubs? The answer is revealed in the fall when vibrant clumps of fat violet-colored fruits encircle the stems.
Beautyberry grows up to 8 feet high but can be pruned back to 1 or 2 feet each fall after fruit drop to control growth. Cut stems can be used—minus the leaves-- in floral arrangements. Because flowers and thereby the fruit is produced on new growth, a hard pruning will not affect next year’s fall display. It is a good shrub for natural areas or in a mass planting; the growth habit is denser with a sunnier location. It likes moist soil but will tolerate drought. This Callicarpa is disease and pest-free, easy to transplant and grows fast. Give it some space!
Callicarpa americana’s natural range is from Maryland south, but it is happy growing in our area. There also is a white-fruited variety, ‘Lactea.’
In addition to the native species, the Asian species Callicarpa dichotoma or Purple beautyberry, has vivid-colored berries, though not in such size or profusion as our native species. Its form is more graceful; the arching branches feature leaves growing in one plane along the stem rather than radiating around it. C. dichotoma, native to eastern and central China, Japan and Korea, was introduced to this country in 1857. It grows 4 to 5 feet high and 6 to 8 feet wide. It’s been designated a Gold Medal Plant by the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society which means it is an underused woody plant of exceptional merit.on Mar 5, 2013 @ 11:45 PMMar 5, 2013 @ 11:45 PM PublishedAFPTV Advisory 0400 GMTWe will file the following videos:-- TOP WORLD NEWS --+ CHAVEZ DEATHComing up:CARACAS: Monitoring situation after the death of Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez.

Old Victoria Hall gets new look and new name
Santa Barbara has a new jewel in its performing arts district.
The 80-year-old Victorian Hall Theatre just completed a $12 million dollar makeover.
It has 300 new seats, new lighting, a new sound system, an orchestra pit, a new entrance and a new name.
Campaign Co-Chair Derek Westen calls it the New Vic.
The transformation began when the Luria Family Trust bought the theatre from a number of non-profits that used to lease it month-to-month to the Ensemble Theatre Company.
Now the company has a permanent home.
A Curtain Up fundraising event starring Tyne Daily Saturday is already Sold Out.
But theater lovers can still by tickets to the after party and other shows.
A free event for children is being held next weekend.
The season opens with A Little Night Music starring screen legend Piper Laurie and Stephanie Zimbalist Dec. 5.

Relatively easy to develop for, web playable on just about every platform – how could it miss? But flash forward to a year later, and it’s far from the dominant programming language in gaming – and the folks behind Goko think they know why.
Launching today, Goko is a new destination for both consumers and developers to discover what HTML5 gaming is really all about. I recently had a chance to talk with Ted Griggs, Goko’s CEO and Co-Founder, and Brian Howell, their VP of marketing, to learn more.
“Everyone says HTML5 is going to be a great platform for games, but I don’t think anyone has really proved that yet,” says Griggs. And if anyone should know, it’s him. He was once one of the founders of Electric Gravity, which you probably know better by its post-Microsoft acquisition name: MSN Gaming Zone.
The problem with HTML5 gaming, according to Goko’s co-founder, has to do with a lack of tools and services for developers. “On iOS there’s Game Center, on Android there’s OpenFeint; so there are platforms that allow you to do player management, achievements, leaderboards – all that kind of stuff. But if you’re moving over to HTML5, there’s a hole. There’s nothing out there.” Similar systems already exist on the web for Flash gaming (Kongregate, for example), so it’s an idea that certainly has merit – but as it turns out, Goko wants to be more than just Kongregate for HTML5 games.
Dominion
“What we can offer Flash developers coming over (or other developers) is that, unlike aggregation sites that force you to put their game on their own site, the nirvana of HTML5 is being able to take that piece of content and publish it to multiple places,” says Howell. This means that, through Goko, publishers can take their games to a seemingly infinite number of storefronts – all while their players maintain the same experience. Leaderboards, in-app purchases – it all carries over from one location to another.
“Our platform allows a person on iOS to play a person on Android to play a person on Facebook… you now have the biggest audience. Particularly for board games, where you want to have as many people as possible because these are inherently social games where you play against other people, this is important.”
Speaking of board games, Goko is kicking things off with a biggie. Starting today, players who visit Goko.com will be treated to the only official digital adaptation of one of the most popular hobby board games of the last decade: Dominion. And even better, it’s free.
In fact, all games on Goko will be free. And for once, I don’t necessarily mean “free-ish.” While they’ll be monetized through in-app purchases, if Dominion is any indication you’ll be able to enjoy plenty of game without ever having to pay a dime. Players will have access to the full base game, including multiplayer and a new digital-exclusive campaign, absolutely free. And you can play as much as you want, too. There’s no energy bar here. The only thing they’re looking to sell are expansions. And unlike most games of this nature, if you want to play an expansion with your friends online, only one of you needs to own it.
Goko has licensed more than 150 card and board games from companies as notable as Mayfair, Rio Grande and Fantasy Flight, and of these, they already have 15 games in the pipeline. Two of them were developed in house – but the rest? Those were handled by developer partners. And with so many other licenses lined up, they’re no doubt hoping that more talented developers might be tempted to try out HTML5 and take the reins.
“Reiner Knizia’s Forbidden City
At launch, the service features four games: Dominion, All the Kings Men (a fast-paced multiplayer defense game), War Factory (a single player strategy experience), and a wholly original game from legendary board game designer Reiner Knizia, Forbidden City. “It’s a tile-laying game, kind of similar to Carcassonne. We’ve done it in an isometric view… and you’re building up the Forbidden Palace.”
After this, you should expect to see new games hit the service every few weeks. And while they’re not showing all the cards they have up their sleeve, we’ve been assured that Catan, Citadels, Empire Builder, Steam, Race For The Galaxy and Arena Assault are all on the way.
Citadels, in particular, seems as though it will be an interesting showcase for how you can monetize a board game that has few or no expansions. “If a game is really simple and has no expansions, we need to build a meta-game and other things around it that will allow it to be monetized well,” says Howell. “We took a page from Gardens of Time … we created an isometric city-building game that sits on top, and as you unlock different buildings in the city you get those cards in the game. Instead of having an energy mechanic that works over time, you have to go and play Citadels.” It’s a neat twist, and one that certainly sounds preferable to begging your friends for energy points. “I’ve played almost every iOS board game,” says Howell. “A lot of these are really fun games, but they just give you [the opportunity] to play the basic game over and over again. It can get tiring. You need to think about what other mechanics around it can keep it fresh, and how you can add more content.”
Dominion will have a similar element too; playing the single player campaign will unlock promo cards that you can’t buy in the store. Goko, it would seem, has placed a good deal of focus on bringing players back for more. And as any games-as-service developer will tell you, this business is all about retention.
With Dominion set to launch on Goko.com today, a lot of mobile gamers might be wondering if they’re getting the cold shoulder. Not quite, though you’ll have to wait a little longer to play Dominion on your iPhone or Android. “Those will be coming out 30 days or so after we launch from here, because we’re actually wrapping it in a native wrapper, kind of like what Netflix does with their HTML5 app in the [App] Store. That way we can publish it directly into the App Store, and we can also take advantage of Apple’s in-app payments and native things.”
Goko.com and mobile platforms won’t be the only places to play Goko releases, either. “We’ll be in Facebook, in the Windows 8 Store, in Google+; in particular [Google] Hangouts is really nice for these kind of games.” It sounds like wherever you want to play, Goko will be there too.
With so many great board game adaptations already available on so many different platforms, there’s no shortage of players interested in a truly social experience. By bringing a lot of the great games under one roof – a roof that houses every device you can imagine – Goko might have really hit on something. I’d spend more time thinking about it, but people have been waiting forever for me to take my turn in Dominion. So please, excuse me.Hall of Famer coming
Special guest is Bob Gibson
Some years, Tri-State Hot Stove League Vice President Paul Gries pulls his hair out trying to land a high-profile athlete as a special guest for the Night of Memories fundraiser for youth sports.
Not this year. Gries already has landed St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame pitcher Bob Gibson, former Cardinals relief pitcher and current Cardinals television broadcaster Al Hrabosky and Evansville native and former Cardinals pitcher Andy Benes for the 11th annual Night of Memories, which will take place Feb. 6 at the Vanderburgh 4-H Center.
“We’re way ahead of the game this year,” Gries said.
Gibson, Hrabosky and Benes will join Jamey Carroll, a Castle High School graduate and Cleveland Indians second baseman; Clint Barmes, a Vincennes Lincoln graduate and Colorado Rockies second baseman; plus Los Angeles Dodgers hitting coach Don Mattingly and Dodgers minor league outfielder Preston Mattingly, among others.
“We’re really excited because of Bob Gibson,” Gries said. “It’s kind of like Yogi Berra coming to Evansville, being the Hall of Famer that he is. You look at his resume and it’s kind of unbelievable some of the things that he has done in his career.”
Gibson, who was elected to the Hall in 1981, lifted the Cardinals to World Series titles in 1964 and ’67.
He was an eight-time All-Star, a two-time Cy Young winner and a member of Major League Baseball’s All-Century Team.
“The other thing is the local fan base for the St. Louis Cardinals is huge,” Gries said. “I think there are going to be a lot of people coming out and wanting his autograph. I think it’s going to be a big night for us. I think we’re going to be able to raise a lot of money for the community.”
Two years ago, the Hot Stove League donated $50,000 to put up a Habitat for Humanity home, which it also helped build.
This year, Don Mattingly and Carroll helped the Hot Stove League receive a $75,000 grant through the Major League Baseball fund to refurbish the Boys and Girls Club baseball field.
The Hot Stove League, which has already put $12,500 toward the field, must raise a total of $75,000 to match the Major League Baseball fund by Jan. 1.
“There are several other places that will donate some money,” Gries said. “I’m pretty sure we will be able to get the $75,000 within the next month and we will be able to make that field look really nice within the next eight to 12 months.”

app. Late Friday, Jetpac made it known per their Web site that Google acquired the company for an undiscovered sum and that it would cease support as of Sept. 15.
Jetpac's technology scans pixels in public Instagram photos to match up features in photos or surroundings. The app can identify blue skies or clouds, women who wear lipstick, or men with a mustache drinking a cup of coffee. The app serves up places that are most frequented in a city by a specific type of person such as a dog lover in Central Park.
Facebook acquired Instagram in 2012, for about $1 billion in cash and stock.
Aside from the Jetpac City Guide that provides insight into places types of people frequent, the company developed object recognition technology with the ability to recognize objects, shapes and texture like fur. It can combine these signals to identify breeds of plants and dogs.
Jetpac's app, Jetpac City Guides, was pulled from the App Store. The technology, based on deep learning and artificial intelligence, caught interest early on from former Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang, Khosla Ventures and Morado Venture partners. The company has secured $2.4 million in funding since 2012.
No word from Google on the company's plan for the technology.
When Jetpac rolled out the free City Guides app, the company's promotion began touting the technology's ability to analyze millions of photos on Instagram to determine the happiest cities in the United States. Take that technology and throw it into an ad-targeting platform that can analyze intent, and the advertising industry could see the germ of a seed that combines analytics, business intelligence and artificial intelligence to more accurately target advertisements across offline and online platforms.Even though migraines are quite common, they often go undiagnosed and under-treated for years. A technique called ID migraine is a simple set of three questions that can be a powerful way to detect migraines according to a study in the August 12, 2003 Neurology. Hundreds of headache sufferers were asked nine questions. Three of the questions turned out to be the most powerful at getting to the diagnosis.
Is there nausea?
Is there sensitivity to light?
Do the headaches limit your ability to work, study, or do what you want to do?
The people in the study were then evaluated by a neurologist for a formal diagnosis. In this study, 81 percent of those diagnosed with migraines had answered at least 2 of these ID questions “yes”. And 75 percent of those who answered at least two questions yes turned out to have migraines.
Adding more questions to the survey, including questions about auras, did not further improve the accuracy of the screening tool.
This study included both older adolescents and adults, but did not include pre-pubertal children. The power of the simple questions was consistent across all ages tested. Although we won’t know until a similar childhood study is done, I expect the same three questions would be useful in children — perhaps even more so, because nausea is even more common in childhood migraines.
For children, though, I would also add a question about family history. About 90 percent of children with common migraines have a family history of migraines, especially on the mother’s side of the family.
Even though most young children with migraines will outgrow them by the 10th birthday, all those with migraines deserve to have them identified and treated. These headaches can usually be quieted or prevented.'.

Majore has just returned from a visit to Abebe
Beleta, a relative who is much better-off than
him. They agreed that Abebe will rent half a
hectare of Melaku’s land. Melaku really
needs the cash he gets from this agreement, but
he also realizes that he will lose a future harvest
of banana and cotton—a major source of
income.
Melaku
Majore has an asset that
is considered valuable in his area: almost
three hectares of land, some of which is irrigated
by small rivers that flow from the highlands.
Unfortunately, two hectares are left fallow
because the soil is barren after many generations
of intensive use. Melaku only has one hectare
of productive land. The irrigated land is perfect
for growing bananas, while his rainfed land
is good for cotton. Selling these cash crops
is not a problem; there are plenty of traders
passing along the main road through his area
that are willing to buy them. Any surplus bananas
Melaku can usually sell to travellers on their
way to Arba Minch.
Unfortunately, Melaku’s expenses are quite high. His children are
only three and five years old—too young to help him in his fields,
so he has to hire contract labourers to cultivate the land. Right now,
he doesn’t have enough money to pay the extra hands. He doesn’t
even have enough to buy maize and sweet potato to feed his family. This
is why he is renting part of his productive land to Abebe.
Unlike Melaku, Abebe is a well-off farmer. He cultivates over three hectares
of land and has eight cows, six goats and several chickens. He also owns
two plough oxen, which he loans to Melaku in return for a share of the
harvest.
For two years now Melaku has taken care of two of Abebe’s cows.
In return he gets to keep half of the cows’ milk, which is a nice
addition to his family’s diet of maize, beans and sweet potato.
The food crops Melaku grows on his land are enough to feed his family
for around seven months each year. The other five months he has to buy
food.
Melaku is well aware of his poverty trap: “If I did not rent out
my land, I could sell more bananas and cotton. With that money I could
hire contract labourers to cultivate my land and buy pesticides, which
would result in more bananas and cotton of a better quality. I would
earn more, and then I could afford vaccines for my cattle and goats.
They would be healthy and I would be able to sell them for a higher price.
With that money I could buy an ox which I would fatten and sell before
Meskel. Just like Abebe does.”

Think about that statement for a moment. Is your library a happy place? Are customers happy when they are at the library? Are staff happy? Are you?
Smith's talk was inspiring, for sure, but what good is inspiration without thoughtful change? Throughout the whole rest of the weekend and my flight home, I found myself asking: What can I do? I came up with three ways I can shift my own mindset in an effort to foster that culture of optimism:
- I want to support remarkable, transformative experiences. I want the library to be an active, not a passive, place where customers from all walks of life are engaged. Engaged in conversation, leisure, exploration, play, discovery, story, learning... I want the library to be a place where kids (and everyone!) use their hands as well as their minds.
- I want to say "Yes!" Does someone have an idea? Will it further open our services to the people in our community? Let's give it a shot!
- I want to be the type of person who says, "That was awesome. How can we make it even better?" Innovation and keeping things fresh doesn't always mean reinventing the wheel. Sometimes it means looking at current services more deeply or from a new perspective to really mine the potential for excellence.
I am happy with those goals. But, lest you think this whole topic is too hunky-dory, too kumbaya and idealistic rainbows--What if my staff/boss/administrators just don't buy into innovation?--Smith had a response that I really liked. To paraphrase:.
I love that: let the optimistic people drive the bus. They are the majority, and through some thoughtful work, they can continue to make the library even better.
What can you do to foster a culture of optimism at your library?
I am grateful that'll be recapping my takeaways from the conference in a series of posts throughout the next two weeks.
I love this and have forwarded it to everyone I know. :) I have recently discovered your blog, and it is delightful. I borrowed your "early literacy" calendar idea for my library. My first calendar is for May, so I'll let you know how my patrons like it! Thanks for all you do.

I'm glad you're finding it useful, Michelle! And best of luck on the calendar--I hope it works as well with your customers as it does with ours!WALNUT CREEK -- The city's public works director will make the ultimate decisions on the fate of four employees on paid administrative leave after an internal investigation is completed into employees' knowledge of alleged child sexual abuse at the Lesher Center.
Heather Ballenger was appointed this week by City Manager Ken Nordhoff at the request of a City Council subcommittee, whose members recently hired a consultant to oversee the results of the internal investigation. That consultant is Mike Oliver, a former city manager for San Leandro and Oakley.
He will examine the investigation and then make recommendations to Ballenger, who will decide the futures of Lesher Center Manager Scott Denison; city Arts Director Barry Gordon; his deputy, Kevin Safine; and city Human Resources Manager Sally Rice.
Giving Ballenger this responsibility was necessary because a city employee, and not the council or an outside consultant, must make employment decisions about city personnel, said Mayor Pro Tem Kristina Lawson, a member of the subcommittee.
This responsibility would normally fall to the city manager, but the council stripped Nordhoff of his oversight of the situation and hired Oliver after learning Nordhoff knew of the Lesher situation earlier than he originally told council members.
The internal investigation focuses on allegations that the four administrators failed to alert Walnut Creek police after they fired an employee suspected of inappropriate sexual contact with teenage girls. The former employee, Jason Pedroza, has been charged with two felonies and two misdemeanors.
Employees found out about Pedroza after Danville police began investigating him, and though the employees are mandated reporters -- people required by law to tell police of any suspicions of child abuse -- the district attorney decided not to press charges.
The subcommittee, made up of Lawson and Councilman Bob Simmons, asked Nordhoff to choose an overseer with no ties to the investigation, Lawson said.
In an email to the entire city staff, Ballenger on Thursday wrote that she is committed to carrying out this role fairly, keeping in mind the city's responsibility to employees and the community.
"As you know, four employees are currently on administrative leave while this internal examination continues," she wrote. "I ask you to remember that placing an employee on administrative leave is not evidence of wrongdoing. It is a precautionary measure to ensure that the ongoing review is thorough and objective."
Ballenger also said the review of the city's handling of the Pedroza matter should be completed in the next two weeks That's the first timeline given for ending an investigation that started two months ago.
Nordhoff, Mayor Cindy Silva and Simmons did not respond to requests for comment.

My name is Tamara Patton, and thanks to the ever-generous Jeffrey, I’ll be a new guest contributor here. For those who’d like to know a little more about me and what I plan to offer, see the bottom of this post. For the rest who just want to hear something interesting about Parchin, keep reading…
Many of you know that the alleged high explosives testing site at Parchin remains a key element of the “structured approached” that the IAEA is proposing to resolve outstanding issues on Iran’s nuclear program. Experts in this area continue to debate whether this site is really worth the ultimatum – My colleague at SIPRI, Bob Kelley, recently gave his take in that debate, which was seconded soon after by Yousaf Butt.
As the debate continues, I thought it might be useful to take a closer look at how the many different dimensions we’ve been offered add up in the context of the site. I came upon some interesting discrepancies. Some of you know that I’m a fan of Google SketchUp — I gave the tool another go here.
Starting with the original drawing of the chamber (acquired by the AP and reportedly produced with information from an eyewitness), I was most struck by how off the reported dimensions seem in the context of the drawing. Jeffrey already remarked on the oddity of the Oompa Loompa-sized door in the cylinder. Another eyebrow-raiser is the diameter to length ratio of the cylinder (reported to be 4.6 m and 18.8 m respectively). In fact, as far as I could tell from modeling the photo in SketchUp, the length of the cylinder in the drawing is indicative of about 6 to 7 m – nowhere near the supposed 18.8 m figure. Maybe the artist was a Picasso fan, but the disproportion in the dimensions seems a little too pronounced to have been unintentional.
If you assume a 4.6 m cylinder diameter, the cylinder length depicted in the drawing indicates 6 to 7 m, not 18.8. (Patton, SketchUp).
A related discrepancy is the placement of the collar in the drawing versus the way its dimensions are described by Danilenko (i.e. the second source of possible dimension info). The press drawing seems to deliberately indicate that the collar is located at the rear of the cylinder. Danilenko, however, describes that “the external part of the central section of a length of 9 m is strengthened with a reinforced concrete square section of 7.6 x 7.6 m2”. The key word is central. Apparently, wrapped around the center of the 19 m long cylinder would be this massive concrete collar, with the cylinder protruding on either side of it.
Like this:
SketchUp model of Parchin, illustrating how Danilenko's design would look if it were in the building. Dimension estimates: building length (30 m); building width (15 m); building height (~12m) ; cylinder total length (19m); collar length (7.6 m). (Patton, SketchUp)
Modeling these dimensions within the dimensions of the building at Parchin (heights are very estimated since these shadows are on a slope), the view above is what I got (shown with average height humans for scale). So, is the information that came with the drawing actually at odds with Danilenko’s design?
Yes – and no.
If the length of the 19 m cylinder is partially covered in the center by the concrete collar, that leaves about 5.7 m of cylinder exposed on each side of the collar. Interestingly, this is MUCH closer to the cylinder length that the original drawing depicts, seen here from similar viewpoints:
So in this infamous drawing, are we maybe just seeing half the picture? It is an interesting thought, though it seems unlikely that an “eyewitness” would have missed the other half of the 19m cylinder sticking out the back.
As far as the likeliness of Danilenko’s design being used for the accused hydrodynamic testing, there seems to be some growing agreement that the concrete collar (especially if placed around the cylinder’s center) would interfere with the devices needed to make a hydrotest test useful, such as high speed optical cameras, flash x-ray systems, and neutron detectors. On top of this, as you can see from the SketchUp model, there’s not a whole lot of extra space in the building to support this kind of infrastructure once we use the dimensions described in the media and by Danilenko.
A final dimension of interest at the site is the heavy earth berm immediately south of the main building, which the IAEA says is indicative of the “probable use of high explosives in the chamber”. Based on modeling off of shadows in the October 2012 Google Earth satellite image, I estimate that it is around 9-12 m tall, so very nearly the height of the building (estimated to be around 12-15 m tall). It’s also about 6 m thick, 24 m from end to end, and located 4 to 5 m away from the main building.
While this may seem like a large berm at first glance, it pales in comparison to the many other much larger berms in the greater Parchin complex. These berms are also significantly wider, surround entire buildings, and they are sloped on both sides. From the shadow casted by the berm in question, it is evident that it has a flat face nearest the building.
Strangely, the height to width ratio is almost exactly what is required for earth-bermed explosive storage magazines (i.e. a 3:2 slope), as illustrated in the figures in this report, though I can’t think of any sane reason for storing ammunition this close to a structure. (Ignore this! Or see the comments for some better info.)
Bob Kelley says that small, narrow berms like the one in question are more likely used to shield radiation beams like those from an industrial x-ray machine or accelerator. He says that if the beam is collimated then you only need to shield where it is pointed. This makes sense. However, a remaining consideration is that unlike the closely packed buildings that the larger berms in the area are protecting, the site in question is much more isolated, and the berm is protecting the only two buildings around that would need to be protected. I think this prevents us from completely ruling out an explosive shielding purpose for this berm.
In brief, I think that the numbers we’ve been presented in terms of dimensions for this site at Parchin bear closer scrutiny. The two main sources of information don’t quite add up, and even if they did, the resultant design isn’t appropriate for hydrotests according to folks who know how those work. If there are any berm experts out there, I hope you’ll give your opinion – this berm is an anomaly amongst others at Parchin, and further investigation could result in a fun new rabbit hole to dive into.
(Here’s that introduction I promised: As you might be able to tell, my favorite area of work resides at the very tiny area of overlap between the worlds of arms control and digital art. Modeling has been very useful for wringing a third dimension of information out of satellite images and ground-view photographs, and I’m grateful to folks like Frank Pabian who have paved the way in this area . I’m hoping to push that tool into some new directions through modeling some new sites and hardware. I’m also excited about exploring new applications of other geospatial and data visualization tools for our field. In short, these sorts of projects, experiments, and ideas are what I’d like to share, and I look forward to hearing what you think. -TP)

Another excellent piece, Tamara, welcome aboard!
Your skills with Sketchup make your points much easier to understand and certainly enhance the conversation.
A couple of thoughts..,
As for the eyewitness account, if said witness had only been allowed to look into the building or perhaps even only caught a quick glimpse through an open door, they might well have only seen half of the chamber and so described it as they did. As your model shows, from the perspective of someone standing at one end of the building it would be impossible to see the other half of the cylinder without walking around the concrete collar.
As for the “Collar” itself, I wonder if it might not be a concrete shell or room that contains the instrumentation. I don’t know how sensitive this type of equipment is to dust and environmental conditions, but it would make sense to build a small sheltered area to protect the instruments rather than trying to control the environment in the whole building.
Something else I just noticed, that yellow pipe. Where does it go? As far as I can see in the satellite images, it doesn’t leave the building, which infers that it goes to some piece of equipment inside the already cramped space. Of course, we’re assuming it really is a pipe and not just a cable rack that has been misinterpreted as a pipe, but still.
yousaf | February 3, 2013
This may be the alleged water feed of the alleged tank, for wash-down. If the alleged tank exists, of course.
And, of course, even if it exists it may not have necessarily involved nuclear materials (we are talking 10 years ago) so may not be relevant to the IAEA.
The other thing that is interesting is that the dimensions of a tank mentioned by Danilenko in his book is exactly the same as the supposed dimensions of alleged tank, same diameter and tank in the book has 19m instead of 18.8m.
Worthy of Curveball himself.
Tamara | February 3, 2013
Thanks, Cthippo. It’s an interesting thought about the equipment being embedded in the collar. From conversations with folks, some think this could be possible (i.e. having “windows” in the collar to allow access for measurement tools), though not exactly plausible since the more holes you put in the collar, the less good it is for “reinforcing” the chamber as Danilenko describes. I also thought the same about the eyewitness only getting a glance at the thing from this one angle – but this puts even more holes in the intelligence that came with the drawing, as Bob Kelley pointed out to me. If the person had only had a one shot glance, he would have said it looked like the chamber was maybe 5m by 20m, not 4.6 by 18.8!
Denis | February 2, 2013
Tamara, brilliant work. Thank you. I am so pleased to see a technical discussion of the Pink Site at this level of detail. I hope with your expertise this will be a helpful didactic exercise in modeling and satellite photo interpretation, if you don’t object to sharing your skills w/ some of us rank amateur Google-heads.
Because I am so long winded, I’d like to break my comment in half, as the two halves are really distinct issues. One is about the history and significance of the “berm” and the other is about whether or not it’s a berm at all.
I would like to review the history because it is relevant as to whether or not what we are looking at is a “berm,” and, if it is a berm, what that means.
Mr. David Albright is revered by the US main-stream media as an ex-IAEA expert with a sharp eye for picking out potential Israeli targets. On Mar13.2012 he published an ISIS report that identified a “suspicious” area (35°33’30.77″ N 51°47’07.06″ E) that is near Parchin, and I emphasize “near” because it is not at Parchin (35°31’19.11″ N 51°46’16.92″ E) nor is it at the Parchin Military Complex, even though the ISIS report says otherwise.
This area, which I refer to as “the Pink Site” in honor of Mr. Albright’s later revelations, is much closer to (and hence more likely to be associated with) a hydroelectric dam project and a mining operation than it is to Parchin or PMC. The dam and the mine are just 2 km north of the Pink Site.
I make this distinction between the Pink Site and Parchin because by labeling a set of isolated buildings “Parchin” or as part of the PMC one immediately starts pushing bias-buttons, and pushed bias-buttons result in contorted interpretations of what satellite images show.
At any rate Mr. Albright made a big deal over the same berm that is the subject of your analysis, which is why you are analyzing it. The reason for all this interest in a berm is that the berm is being pitched as some sort of evidence that the adjacent building to the north is or was being used to carry out high-explosive tests related to the development of nuclear weapons.
This berm-as-a-smoking-gun theory originated from an IAEA Safeguard Report of Nov08.2011. Paragraph 49 of that report cites mysterious, unidentified “Member States” for the allegation that “[a] large earth berm was subsequently constructed between the building containing the cylinder and a neighbouring building, indicating the probable use of high explosives in the chamber,” as you note in your post.
And that sentence is the sum total of the publicly available “evidence” supporting the myth that the berm you are analyzing is diagnostic of dastardly goings on at the Pink Site. I call it a myth because the statement is, on its face, absurd. If a berm next to a building is a smoking gun, then the entire Parchin area would be covered in smoke so thick you’d not even be able to see pink-covered buildings from GeoEye.
Many, if not most, buildings in that area are bounded on at least one side by a berm. There are too many examples to inventory, but look at these buildings just north of the Pink Site – 35°34’37.55″ N 51°46’42.06″ E. And look at these buildings just south of it – 35°32’25.88″ N 51°47’07.94″ E. Bermed buildings abound in Parchin. The presence of a berm next to a building is indicative of nothing. This area was an active flood plain before the dam was built.
I thought I’d throw that bit of thorny berm-history out there because how much credit one gives to the ISIS assertions will determine whether or not one sees any berm at all. Next I’d like to get down to the nitty-gritty of your model.
Denis | February 3, 2013
wind, cont’d.
You speculate on the basis of your model that the Pink Site berm is the right size and slope for an ammunition dump, citing Tancreto et al. Below I take issue with this speculation based on dimensions, but here I question the speculation based on logic and my experience working around ammo dumps at Camp Lejuene and Camp Pendleton. I have a pretty good idea what an ammo bunker looks like and where they are placed, and from my experience they don’t look like that Pink Site berm, and they aren’t placed within a couple feet of buildings.
I would suggest that if you want to see what appears to be ammo dump bunkers in the greater Parchin metropolitan area, look at these bunkers about 4 km SW of PMC: 35°30’26.11″ N 51°43’11.87″ E. While these structures could be mass graves or really big gopher mounds, they are surrounded by a perimeter wall and guard towers and are what I would expect an ammo bunker to look like from my experience. Besides graves and gopher mounds are not usually ventilated like these structures are. I’d bet some money there’s ordinance in them.
Furthermore, does it make sense that a bunker used to hold ammo would be placed essentially right on top of a building where high-explosive tests are taking place? For instance, the Tancreto article you cite recommends that the “Inhabited Building Distance” should be 500-700 feet from the type of US bunkers you have compared the Pink Site berm to. And that is inhabited buildings; it is not buildings in which explosives are being detonated. And does it make sense that such a bunker housing ammo would be used to protect an adjacent building from blasts from explosive tests? This is just not adding up.
As for the dimensions of the berm, I know you are an expert in these techniques, and I have been fascinated with your online seminar discussing them, so I know I am way out of my depth here. But perhaps by offering the following simple analysis you would be good enough to sort me out if I’m wrong and further explain your conclusions.
In a few of the historical GE shots of the Pink Site, one has a good clean look at the shadow of the building and the shadow of the west corner of the berm. In most of the shots the bunker shadow is obscured by the building, but if you look at GE Mar04.2004, Sep12.2010, and Oct03.2012, you get measurable shadows and the building shadow is distinct from the berm shadow with respect to the western corners of both structures. The second to last mock-up diagram in your post shows what I am talking about. The two corner-shadows are obvious in that sketch.
If one measures the distance from the NW corner of the building to its respective corner shadow, and if one measures the W corner of the main part of the berm (not the wing) to its respective corner shadow, the ratio of these two measurements will be the ratio of the height of the building to the berm. I have done this for historical views of Mar04.2004, Sep12.2010, and Oct03.2012 and the ratios were 1.95, 2.09 and 1.76, respectively. Not bad agreement from 4000 feet up and photos spanning 12 years. Based on this quick calculation, the height of this berm is about 50% the height of the building it is next to. In fact, just eye-balling the shadows you can see that the berm is just about the same height as the small building directly to the south. On this evidence, I believe your estimate that the berm is the same height as the building it is next to – the one north of it – is excessive.
But, more importantly, I would question whether we are even looking at a berm, Mr. Albright’s sharp eye notwithstanding. My own tired old eyes tell me that this is no berm or bunker at all. What we are looking at is a wall made of concrete or other light material that is about 0.7-1.0 meter thick, at least to the limits of GE’s resolution. If you look at the Mar04.2004 GE shot, which is nearly directly overhead, you can see both the N and S faces of the wall.
That we are looking at a wall is also clearly seen in the GE views of Mar04.2004, Mar20.2009, and Sep22.2010 – the Mar.2009 view is the clearest. It’s a wall running approximately E-W with short wings at either end sloping toward the SW and SE.
Furthermore, there is no sloped land to the south of the wall. I see just flat surface. It looks like a smoothed parking area to me, which would explain the total lack of vegetation from 2004 to the present. The Oct.2012 photo is ambiguous because there has been some earth-moving going on, but based on earlier shots I don’t think once can conclude with any degree of objectivity that the dirt to the south of the wall is sloped or that it forms a bunker or berm.
Your exploratory modeling takes a pretty skeptical approach to this Pink Site thing, and that’s good. But a lot of people seem to be easily convinced by GeoEye shots interpreted by cable-news experts. Satellite photos are amenable to a strong power-of-suggestion phenom, and when an arms control expert who claims to be an ex-IAEA inspector tells the world there’s a berm at “Parchin” that is the same durn berm the IAEA says is a smoking-gun, next thing ya’ know, everybody’s peering at a wall on GE thinking it’s a berm or a bunker, and the next thing ya’ know after that F-16s are bombing it, and away we go. Again.

Tamara | February 3, 2013
Denis, thanks very much for your insight on the “berm”. Happy to give a brief rundown of how I got my height estimates. It would be helpful to see how you’re measuring the shadows to get your ratios – The measurement should be from the tip of the shadow to the corresponding point at the base (not the roof) of each structure. In general, I stayed away from this approach due to the difficulty of determining where the base points are. Because of the satellite’s angle, it’s particularly difficult to see where the berm’s shadow would end against the base of the berm. Same goes for the main building, though you can sort of make out the edge of the base along its northernmost side in some images (especially in the Oct 2012 and Sept 2010 images). Also, because these shadows are on a sloped hillside, I couldn’t use the method I described in the youtube video (i.e. the sun azimuth calculation) since this relies on the accuracy of manual shadow measurements. What I did instead (for both the buildings and the berm) is construct the objects such that their simulated shadows casted in SketchUp match the shadows on the satellite image. If you squint at the images of my model (especially the direct overhead shot), you can see where the clear lines of the simulated shadows are intersecting the more blurry shadows on the satellite image – the matchup isn’t perfect in all areas, but it’s as close as the software will allow. Because SketchUp incorporates Google Earth’s terrain data, this method is the most likely to give adequate height results, although it relies completely on the accuracy of Google Earth’s terrain data, which I’ve heard can be shoddy in some areas (though supposedly it’s improving overall). Measuring the completed model, if you measure from the western edge of the berm (ground to tip), you get a 9m height, if you measure from the eastern edge, you get 12m, hence my stated range. The building is definitely taller, though I wouldn’t say by 50%. From it’s western edge, the model indicates that it’s 12m tall; from its eastern edge, 15m. So in either case, modeling indicates that the building is about 3 m taller than the berm. I hope this makes sense.
I definitely take your point on the unlikeliness of ammo storage here so close to the building – just meant to point out that in my perusing, this was the only framework I came across that was similar to the “berm” in question. I see now though that I got the slope comparison wrong – the magazine is 3:2 (x:y), and the berm is 2:3 if you accept my 6m:9m estimate. In this respect, it makes a lot more sense that this taller, more narrow structure could be an earth-reinforced wall as you and Raj suggested – more so than any kind of storage. Especially when we look at the bunker field you pointed out – these are wider (and seem to be shorter, though I haven’t taken the time to measure closely) than the berm/wall at the “Pink Site”. But if it is ‘just’ a wall – do you think that at all diminishes its possible role as a shield from high explosives?
Denis | February 5, 2013
Tamara – Sorry to take so long to respond you your response yesterday.
OK, I think I have a pretty good idea of your technique and it’s obvious that we are on slightly different tacks. You are looking for actual, absolute linear distances to tussle with the question of what could fit in that building. All I am looking for the relative heights of the blast wall and the building.
So your data are more useful but harder to get and dirtier. My data are a lot less useful generally, but cleaner. I mean, the measurements I take are wide open and there’s no guessing about where the base of the wall starts or where the bottom of the building is, etc. All of those pesky unknowns drop out of the calculation when taking the ratios.
The line I get when I measure from the corner of the roof to it’s respective shadow point, is the hypotenuse of a right triangle. The vertical of that triangle is the height of the building at the corner and the angle opposite that is the sun elevation angle.
The other line I get is the hypotenuse of a right triangle in which the vertical is the height of the blast wall, and the angle opposite that is also the solar elevation angle. The analogous angles of these two triangles are all equal, so the ratio of these two hypotenuses will equal the ratio of the heights of the building/blast wall. This ratio is about 2.
I guess one could argue that the hypotenuses I am looking at are skewed because the satellite is not exactly over the triangles. Yes, but any skewing of the hypotenuses due to the satellite angle will drop out too because it is the same for both triangles. So, I’m pretty confident about the heights being about 2:1. But then again, I’m confident about a lot of things I get wrong.
One doesn’t really need to do any measurements or calculations to determine this ratio of heights. You can see it just by eye-balling the shadows. If that blast wall were as high the building, the corner shadow of the blast wall would be even with the SW corner shadow of the building. Not even close.
You suggest that these measurements are complicated b/c the shadows are falling on sloped terrain – I don’t see that. The shadows are falling on the paved area bordering the western side of the building, at least on the views I am using to get my measurements. The Oct.2012 view is in a lot of ways the worst one to be working with as far that blast wall goes. Mar20.2009 or Sep22.2010 show it best.
You also note using Google’s terrain data via Sketch Up. I presume those elevation tools are the same as using the elevation tool and elevation profile in GE. We are only looking at a couple of feet difference in this area as best I can tell, and I wouldn’t trust the GE elevation data to that resolution. For instance, I read the elevation to be about 3972 ft. over most of the area around the S end of the building. But I measure the W side of the building (3975 ft) to be 9 ft. higher than the E side (3966 ft.) at the mid-point of the building. No way.
GE also says that the rough area to the W of the building is increasing in elevation, which would mean that open culvert is directing water toward the building. I don’t buy that either. So I don’t think the GE elevation data are sufficiently precise for this sort of work, which may be why your conclusions are so different from mine regarding the relative heights.
It looks to me like the west side of the building is level where the paved portion is [in earlier GE photos], then drops slightly to a shallow ravine, and then rises sharply 30 ft or more. This could be important. This area has not been disturbed in any of the GE photos going back to 2004. Bob Kelley has suggested that if IAEA wanted to find traces of nuclear goofing around, they would find it in this area, and so why would IRI go to all the trouble Albright is suggesting to “clean up” the rest.
You’ve noticed my dropping the term “berm.” I don’t know who first applied that word, IAEA or Albright, but the evidence for a berm is next to none, at least as I understand “berm.” I go with Raj here 100%. It’s a wall about 1 m. thick. The term “blast” seems appropriate only because this wall has wings at either end, angled back toward the SW and SE, like a blast wall. The Mar20.2009 shot is the best view of the wings.
So my take is that this is a blast wall – just high enough to protect that small building to the south. This sounds more like a site for testing jet or missile engines, doesn’t it? Sure doesn’t look like a flood-control wall or hand-ball wall, eh?
So, to my mind, the question becomes what would they be doing in there that would require a blast wall only toward at one end? I mean, this doesn’t smell like containment of radioactivity. Anon talks about “blast effects”, but I take a blast to go out in all directions. This looks more like it’s blocking a directed force, like a jet engine exhaust.
Look at 7 km almost due W of the Pink Site. There are a series of interesting double-buildings that are all tightly surrounded by walls. Here: 35°32’52.70″ N 51°42’39.23″ E I count 5 of these doublets, and they are easily visible from 30,000 ft. 400 m. W of the northern most of these double buildings is what looks like an elevator shaft or cave entrance. If I were IAEA, that’s where I’d look. Forget the Pink Site.

Sun angle and satellite angle will change for both measurements since both are taken at geographically different locations. The logic would not hold water if the roof is protruding out from the building as is generally observed in slanted roofs especially here.
If it was only a wall without the earth support, then it would show a shadow of the inclined portion on the Eastern side.
Tamara | February 5, 2013
Thanks, Denis – I think we’ll have to agree to disagree on the method for now. Measuring to the roof tip won’t get you anywhere – GE measures distances horizontally, and a hypotenuse would of course be sloped.
If you want to keep to the ratio approach, I think you need to make sure both of your lines are at nearly the same angle (i.e. along a very similar sun azimuth), otherwise you’re skewing the comparison. The sun azimuth angle of the September 2010 image is 151.17 degrees. If you use this angle to guide your line placement, you’ll be guided to the corresponding base point against the object which is casting the shadow corners.
Here’s my placement:
The ratio comes out to 1.19 for this image. Granted, the sun azimuth in actuality will be very slightly different for each object, but given this short distance between the objects, I think it’s best to just stick to the overall image azimuth.
RAJ47 | February 5, 2013
Tamara
Here your mensuration is absolutely incorrect.
You are measuring the building from its base which is at a step higher than the ground on which shadow is falling.
You are measuring shadow of the roof top which happens to be protruding out from the building (clearly observed in the image you posted on imageshack).
You are measuring the blast wall shadow from top of the wall and not the base.
According to your type of mensuration, the correct ratio would certainly be around 1:2.
RAJ47 | February 6, 2013
Check this comparison of shadows on your pic.
I have also added two yellow lines to compare the width of building and width of roof.
Length of both yellow lines are equal. And both red lines are equal also equal to your red line.
Tamara | February 6, 2013
Raj, I don’t think this is worth argument, since as I mentioned in the beginning, this is not a good method for this site (due to the obviously many ways you can argue for adjusting the line placements). With the photo I posted, I was illustrating the azimuth concept for Denis.
The 3D modeling approach (combining GE and SU) is a better way, since you are forced to replicate the entire shadow perimeter versus choosing a few arbitrary points. This method has yielded great results in the past, which is why I’m still using it.
The BEST way as some have mentioned would be to purchase an image product with better elevation data if it’s decided that heights are critical to the analysis. I agree that the nature of the terrain at this particular site may warrant this more robust approach.
More importantly, what would be the significance (if any) if the wall was 50% the height of the building versus 75% as I suggested? I’m interested in Denis’ suggestion that this layout could be used for testing jet or missile engines due to the need for protecting against a directed force. If experts in that area think it’s plausible, that would be a new argument for needing this type of narrow, earth-reinforced wall, versus past expert claims that this structure is most likely useful for shielding directional radiation from an industrial x-ray machine/accelerator.
Denis | February 7, 2013
Tamara, I agree, we’d be best just to chalk our trigonometric differences up to differences and let it go at that.
But one doesn’t need any trigonometry to see the sizes of the shadows. Aint’ no way that wall can be 80% the height of the building and cast a shadow that is only 50% as long..
It’s beyond any reasonable doubt that it’s a wall with two sloping wings, and just eye-balling the shadows there’s no doubt in my mind that the height of the wall is about the same as the building to the south and about 50% of the building to the north.
Here is the shot with my lines added.
It’s just really impossible for two structures of the same height standing next to each other to throw shadows of differing lengths. I’m sure some Greek must have made that point somewhere.
Now, as to whether there is sloped ground on the south side of the wall, one could look at it either way. I see a flat surface there, but I can see how others would see a graded slope. To me, that partial wall-shadow on the south face in the Mar.2004 photo suggests flat ground.
Like I said before, it doesn’t look like a hand-ball wall, but, on reflection, that’s as good a guess as any I’ve seen. If we want to take Albright’s bait and think dark and dastardly things, then maybe it’s for a firing squad, in which case in addition to the IAEA we should demand the UN send in the UN Human Rights Council. I’ll stick with hand-ball.
Nor is there any a priori reason to conclude the function of the wall is associated with what’s going on in the north building. Maybe it is associated with the south bldg. and is protecting the north building.
@Raj “Sun angle and satellite angle will change for both measurements since both are taken at geographically different locations.”
Well, I guess I wouldn’t consider structures that are a few meters apart as being “at geographically different locations” with respect to the sun, which is 1.5×10^11 m away, the satellite, which is on the order of 5×10^5 m away. The differences in these angles will be too small to matter.
RAJ47 | February 7, 2013
Denis
You said
.”
The shadow you measure is to the North/NW of the wall.
I would like to see any straight object throwing shadows on both North and South side, even partial.
The shadows in pptx posted by me clearly show how they differ in size.
RAJ47 | February 3, 2013
Here is my reading of the ‘oddly shaped berm’ which can be called blast proof wall. Pardon my bad drawing.
The size is approximately 1m thick concrete wall supported by compressed earth/stone & earth. The total thickness at bottom is approximately 9m at the top would be 2-4m. The length of main wall is 16m and total with inclined walls on sides is 24m. Height certainly lesser than the building.
Such walls are generally used to prevent blast effects being transmitted to other buildings nearby.
No, they are not used to shield radiation. Radiation can be stopped by thinner metal walls invisible to outside world.
The ISIS has published reports with latest satellite imagery of 1/17/2013.
yousaf | February 3, 2013
In that report ISIS argues that the IAEA should invoke “special inspections” to gain access to the site, instead of pressing for a 3rd voluntary inspection of Parchin. (The first 2 visits found nothing incriminating).
This is a good idea: let the IAEA call for special inspections if the evidence is solid enough to warrant such.
Tamara | February 3, 2013
Thanks, Raj, the drawings are helpful – do you happen to have any sources on ‘blast proof walls’ that you’re able to share here?
Dan | February 4, 2013
Just a couple of questions.
I would highly suggest moving out of the Google Earth and Google Sketch realm as the accuracy of your work reflects the limited data you are accessing.
Why not move towards an ArcGIS environment with higher resolution as well as DEM data modeling? I understand the open-source approach you are taking yet you are working with data that is 90m SRTM at best. Your estimations are based off of resolutions which require something of greater fidelity.
Again. Moving off of Google Earth will vastly improve the veracity of your assumptions. I am surprised Frank Pabian is referenced as paving the way for this kind of work since this methodology is like using a cleaver for surgery.
Tamara | February 4, 2013
Dan, I think I make it pretty clear in the post & comments that these are estimates (not assumptions) based on free software. I also point out that the height estimates are especially uncertain for this particular site given Google Earth’s terrain data issues and the seemingly sloped landscape here.
In my work, whenever necessary, I use better elevation data along with ENVI to test the Google Earth/SketchUp results. GE/SU aren’t perfect, but they can still be valuable free estimation tools when used with care. Alas, I’m not able to purchase pricey TIFFs and DEMs for voluntary blog work, but if you’ve got the bucks, please go for it!
RAJ47 | February 5, 2013
Dan & Tamara
The DETD resolution is generally 900, 90 and 30 meters depending upon what level (0, 1 and 2) data you are using.
It does not gel well with high resolution satellite imagery and hence you end up getting wrong heights.
Someone can get hold of latest data for this location from OV-104 or 105, then the measurements would certainly be accurate.
In this case, the area is carved out of mountain side. So the elevation data would be much less accurate.
Cyrus | February 4, 2013
This nitty gritty speculation about the height of buildings etc. misses the broader point: Do we actually know if nuclear material were diverted for use in this supposed explosion test chamber? No. In fact, to the contrary, the IAEA has consistently stated that there has been no diversion of nuclear material for nonpeaceful uses. The latest IAEA report itself says that the alleged activities in Parchin were “nuclear-related” rather than nuclear. Iran is perfectly free to investigate whatever it wants without telling the IAEA as long as there has been no diversion of nuclear material, and there is no safeguards requirement for Iran to report non-nuclear experiments or studies. This is aside from the fact that the IAEA was already allowed to visit Parchin twice, and conducted environmental sampling which turned up no indications of fissile material. So other than pure speculation, what actual basis does Albright or the IAEA have to demand access to Parchin? None.
I’m sure we can all obtain google earth photos of the terrain in any NPT signatory country, located buildings and berms and walls, then proceed to speculate about the possible things that may be hidden behind these structures. But that’s not proof of anything. Hell, its not even a decent allegation. Regarding Albright, note that he first claimed the Parchin should be checked simply because it was deemed by him to be a “logical candidate” for nuclear weapons testing — and that’s all. Following the initial IAEA inspection of Parchin, which found nothing, he demanded that the IAEA visit Parchin again and this time check another location, simply because there was “construction going on” there. That’s all.
Tamara | February 4, 2013
The closest the IAEA seems to come to claiming the possible use of nuclear materials at this particular site is tied to the issue of hydrodynamic testing in the alleged chamber (seen in section C.7 in the Annex of the Nov. 2011 report). The language is artfully fudged to avoid saying they expect to find nuclear materials at the site, especially since hydrotests can be done with surrogate material. In light of this, I think it’s important to continue to vet as much as possible the claims about the reported chamber’s suitability for hydrotesting in particular.
Denis | February 5, 2013
I’m with you, Cy.
Ultimately, the question is whether or not there is enough “stuff” in these aggregate sat photos of the Pink Site to justify IAEA or anyone else demanding to have a look. I think that question has to be resolved on the basis of treaty obligations and not what some unidentified “Member States” say they see in the photos.
ISIS has said a couple of times that there is a sat photo from 2000 of this building being “built around” a cylinder. That photo would be the smoking gun, but ISIS, so far as I know, has never published it. The earliest photo I have ever seen of the Pink Site is Mar.2004, GE. I’d be grateful if anyone can direct me to the 2000 photo.
Finally, look at that Jan.2013 shot in the ISIS report that Raj links to. That is stupendous! As of Oct.2012 it looked like they were tearing this site down, but no, they’ve been renovating. They are rebuilding the fence, repaving the drive, the black tarps are off the buildings and they look like they have new roofs. All of the mounds of dirt to the east have been smoothed out and they’ll probably be planting tulips since spring is coming. Next they will be inviting us all over for tea and biscuits to celebrate the re-opening of . . . ????
Johnboy | February 5, 2013
“Next they will be inviting us all over for tea and biscuits to celebrate the re-opening of . . . ????”
Does anyone else have this nagging suspicion that the reason why the IAEA is “asking” to visit Parchin (rather than demanding a “special inspection”)is because they aren’t absolutely sure that Iran isn’t just pulling their chain?
You know, draping those Pink Tarps over buildings, doin’ all that landscaping, etc., etc. for no other reason than that They Know This Will Drive David Albright’s Brain Into Meltdown….
Cthippo | February 5, 2013
I’ve always wondered about that, not inly in the context of Iran, but especially North Korea. Why not continuously do things that look suspicious, get everybody worked up into a lather, then invite them in to look at an empty building.
If I was Kim Jong Un I would have a group that did nothing but drill large holes in the ground and run cabling into them, while another group set up reviewing stands nearby. Do this all over the country. Every time someone needed a new well they would get a hole suitable for testing bombs in. That way, when you actually want to test something, no one knows which hole to look for it in.
Cyrus | February 5, 2013
Tamara — even if Iran had conducted hydrotesting in this alleged chamber, the fact is that unless it involved undeclared fissile material, and unless it was “non-peaceful”, then Iran would not be in violation of any NPT obligation or safeguard.
NPT signatories are perfectly free to quite legally conduct whatever experiments they want, even if these are directly relevant to making and launching nuclear weapons — UNLESS there is an undeclared diversion of nuclear material involved.
So EVEN ASSUMING that Iran conducted such tests in such a chamber, the IAEA has no authority to demand access UNLESS they can show that there was undeclared nuclear material involved.
And there is thus far zero evidence of any nuclear material having been used there. Quite the contrary, the IAEA has consistently stated that all nuclear material in Iran has been accounted for. And, considering the potential for contamination of not just the chamber but the entire building it is located in, and the fact that no traces of fissile material have been found there in the last 2 visits, then there is no reason whatsoever to simply assume that any nuclear material was used. Therefore, the IAEA simply has no authority to demand access to Parchin. And yet the Iranians allowed the inspectors in twice already, and have said they’ll let them again as long as 1- they’re allowed to see the evidence that they’re supposed to refute, and 2- there is a modalities agreement in force which will put an end to the potentially endless cycle of speculation leading to demands for extra-legal access that we’ve witnessed thus far. Why have these Iranian concerns been ignored? Because the entire Parchin story is a redherring intended to be used to scaremonger about Iran, that’s why.
RAJ47 | February 5, 2013
Denis
Here is the March 2000 image on page 4
Cyrus | February 5, 2013
Cthippo — You ask why Iran just doesn’t allow the inspectors in again to resolve this issue but (aside from the fact that Iran has stated its concerns that the IAEA is sharing intelligence on Iran with the US, just as the Iraqi “weapons inspectors” turned out to be infiltrated by the CIA) your argument rests on an assumption that a third visit to Parchin by the IAEA would in fact resolve the issue — but I’m sure Albright can find a building, wall, or closet someplace else in Iran then proceed to scaremonger about how it is yet another “logical candidate” for hidden nuclear weapons work.
Iran already allowed the IAEA to visit Parchin twice, even though they were not obligated to do so. They made the entire Parchin area available and let the inspectors select the sites they wanted to visit. So how many more times is this supposed to be repeated? Would ANY country allow foreign inspectors to just traipse around in their military bases with no justifiable reason? Did the world suddenly rewrite the IAEA Statutes and safeguards to grant unlimited powers of inspection to the IAEA…when it comes to Iran specifically? No.
Even Hans Blix pointed this out:
“Any country, I think, would be rather reluctant to let international inspectors to go anywhere in a military site,” Mr. Blix told Al Jazeera English… “In a way, the Iranians have been more open than most other countries would be.”
And
“The selection [of target buildings] did not take place in advance, it took place just when we arrived, so all of Parchin was available,” recalls Heinonen, who led those past inspections. “When we drove there and arrived, we told them which building.”
Ultimately, the “wonks” need to come to terms with a fact: You’re all very gifted and well-informed about the technicalities of nuclear proliferation and can draw lovely pictures from satelite images etc. However, the issue is NOT about nuclear weapons and never was. You’ve been misdirected. This is fundamentally a POLITICAL dispute between the US and Iran, in which the nuclear issue is simply being used as a pretext for for a broader POLITICAL agenda: imposing regime change on Iran – just as “WMDs in Iraq” was a lie and a pretext for a policy of imposing regime change there.
And as long as that’s the case, no amount of inspections or other technical measures will ever resolve the issue.
In short, this isn’t about Parchin at all.
Heck, even the US doesn’t accuse Iran of making nukes, but instead accuses Iran of having the “intention to acquire the capability” to make nukes at some indefinite point in the future. And since future intentions cannot be “inspected” nor disproven by the IAEA, no amount of access to Iranian facilities will resolve this standoff until the underlying political agenda is resolved.
Tamara | February 5, 2013
I agree with many (though not all) of your legal points, Cyrus. The point of my post (and those “lovely” pictures) is to critically test the elements being put forth in the media as ‘incriminating evidence’ for this site. Since the IAEA is leveraging the notion that the alleged chamber can be used for hydrotesting – which could possibly include nuclear materials – as a reason for needing a visit, I don’t think examining that claim here from a technical standpoint is a bad thing. I’m new here, but I always thought the blogger’s creed was “read the post before you bash it.”
Denis | February 5, 2013
I probably have 100 hours into analyzing this blinkin’ Pink Site, not because I believe Mr. Albright’s characterizations, but because I am totally skeptical. As I said, I agree with Cyrus. And as I also said, I am delighted to see Tamara, or anyone, dissecting this thing in such detail. Seems to me that Cyrus and Tamara represent two sides of the proverbial coin, a 50 rial piece in this case, I guess.
If this was a compound in the desert outside of Bakersfield, CA purported to belong to the SPCA, the task of trying to confirm that with GE images would still be a fascinating project technically. But with the Pink Site, given the political implications – including those Cyrus raises – I lie in bed and wonder things like: “Why the hell would they have a blast wall next to that building so far away from the military complex?” That question is 20% political and 80% non-contextual curiosity.
The ISIS reports are fascinating and well written, but in the end they have contributed nothing more than gross speculation. The approach has been: “Oh, lookee there!! That building could be a bomb site and so the world should demand a look inside.” One way to throw cold water on this nonsense is to analyze those sat photos objectively, which is why Tamara’s trigonometric analysis and modeling are so welcome. If the dimensions of the building are not consistent with Albright’s speculations, then end of story – and that has political ramifications, both in terms of justifying targeting Iran and ISIS/IAEA’s credibility. OTOH, if the dimensions of the building are consistent with Albright’s speculations, then it doesn’t mean squat. The Middle East is full of buildings of that size.
The intellectual and technical challenge of determining what is going on there is fascinating aside from any political implications. For a private, myopic, agoraphobic individual like me to be able to sit here in my office in Vancouver in my slippers and measure the width of a building in Iran 16,000 km away boggles my mind. I don’t even need a tape measure. And when Tamara brings to the table techniques for determining the height, my ability to suspend disbelief begins to shut down. She doesn’t need a tape measure either. Pythagoras would be all over this; why shouldn’t we?
Cthippo | February 6, 2013
I didn’t ask why Iran doesn’t let the IAEA in, I asked rhetorically why nations under the international community’s microscope don’t build suspicious looking sites, leak data to generate hype and fearmongering, and then let inspectors in to see empty buildings. This kind of intentional maskirovka (sp?) would quickly discredit the IAEA and intelligence agencies who try to influence public opinion by selectively leaking juicy rumors.
I fully agree that this is not about the possibility of an Iranian bomb, but rather about certain hardliners in the US who will accept nothing less than forcible regime change and certain factions in Israel who define their security in terms of denying the rights of others. In neither case are these groups a majority, but in both cases their views carry enough weight that they can’t be ignored by those seeking to end the conflict.
It must be said that certain folks in Iran aren’t making the search for a deal any easier with their rhetoric and refusal to admit that yeah, they probably had a program a few years back.
That’s why I don’t see any sort of meaningful agreement coming about in the foreseeable future. The moderates on both sides who want to resolve the conflict and move towards more normal relations have their hands tied, again on both sides, by hard liners who define victory as the absence of compromise. As I’ve said before, I think the status quo will remain in place until the sanctions decay naturally.
Cyrus | February 7, 2013
Tamara – I wasn’t bashing anything. Just saying that really, all this is beside the point. Sure we can spent time analyzing and either endorsing or debunking media claims about Iranian nuclear weapons programs — but that risks giving legitimacy to the claim that this standoff actually has something to do with nuclear weapons. Just pointing out that it doesn’t. Not really.
Cheryl Rofer | February 6, 2013
Tamara, nice work. I’m trying to figure out what we know about Parchin and how we know it, absent the personal attacks and unsupported assumptions that have marred too much of the discussion. Reconstructions like this are useful in trying to understand the available information.
Something that I have noticed on the overhead photos and your reconstruction is that this berm is quite tall and narrow. I suspect that it must be constructed of concrete, rammed earth, or some cohesive material rather than soil, because its sides seem to exceed the angle of repose for soil. Have you looked into that?
robert kelley | February 7, 2013
I think Tamara’s point about the berm is actaully pretty simple. The IAEA report says:
A large earth berm was subsequently constructed between the building containing the cylinder and a
neighbouring building, indicating the probable use of high explosives in the chamber.
Parchin is a huge ammuniton plant and if you take the time to look around the site it is clear that the berm at the alleged testing area is tiny, not large. It has a concrete wall on one side abutting a driveway that goes along the south of the building and it protects an extremely small angle of hazard unlike other berms at Parchin that are clearly related to high explosive operations.
So why does the IAEA claim it is a large berm when a cursory examination of the site suggests it is the smallest berm at Parchin? And why do they claim it is a probable indicator of high explsoive operations when that is only one possibility given its small protection angle and small size? A berm as a beam stop for an industrial accelerator or x-ray machine is equally good explanation. Overreaching the limits of satellite imagery is a bad idea. Tamara is being very careful and professional in raising these questions with quantitative assessments.
RAJ47 | February 7, 2013
Robert
How do you know it is the smallest berm at Parchin?
By cursory examination of what? Satellite imagery of course.
Satellite imagery interpretation is not cursory examination but a complete science.
For you a size of 24m length, 9m width and about 6-9m height might be smallest but for others it is large.
Overreaching the limits of satellite imagery is not a bad idea but overreaching the limits of imagination is certainly a bad idea.
Denis | February 7, 2013
@Robert “So why does the IAEA claim it is a large berm when a cursory examination of the site suggests it is the smallest berm at Parchin? ”
Bingo! Therein lies the problem — IAEA never claimed that this structure we’re all peering at is the “large berm” they were talking about. That was Albright who said this is the spot Amano fingered.
IAEA, Nov.2011, Annex: “A large earth berm was subsequently constructed between the building containing the cylinder and a neighbouring building, indicating the probable use of high explosives in the chamber.”
ISIS Mar13.12 “ISIS has identified in commercial satellite imagery a building on the Parchin site in Iran that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) wants to visit because it contains, or used to contain, a high-explosive test chamber (see figure 1).. ”
IAEA said they “identified” a building with a large berm; Albright somehow concluded that it’s this particular building and this particular berm. As a couple of us have been ranting for about 4 days, and as Bob seems to agree, this is not a “large berm.” Ergo, this cannot be whatever building Amano was talking about.
The IAEA 2011 report further identified the building as being “at the Parchin military complex.” And Albright parroted that line in his Mar.2012 expose’ — “within the Parchin military site.” But again I would argue this Pink Site is not “at the Parchin military complex;” it’s 4km away from the PMC. It’s a lot closer to the hydroelectric site.
Tamara, you need to write this up and publish it somewhere Bibi will see it so he’ll take this Pink Site off the target list.
Denis | February 7, 2013
@Raj: “For you a size of 24m length, 9m width and about 6-9m height might be smallest but for others it is large.”
9m width???? If that wall is 9m wide, I wear a size 200 shoe. You must mean 0.9 m wide, in which case, yes, it would be quite small for a “berm.”
Here is a series of GE images of just the blast wall.
It seems to me that wall is changing shape. The angle of the W. wing particularly seems to be variable. See photo B vs photo C.
Raj, you raised the very good point about my guess that some of the photos show a shadow on the S side of the wing. Agreed, that couldn’t be a cast shadow from the sun. Might be a contour shadow from light back-reflected off the side of the building.
If not shadow, what do you think that dark border on the south side could be?
RAJ47 | February 8, 2013
Denis
You & Robert both are not imagery analysts, for sure.
You, for one, do not know/understand satellite imagery at all.
I rest my case.
Denis | February 8, 2013
Raj, with respect to your observation that I am not an “imagery analyst” I can only say that your capacity for stating the obvious is truly nonpareil. Well, almost. This example of an equally helpful observation comes to mind:
Donnie: Dude, your phone’s ringing.
Dude: Thanks, Donnie.
But this still begs the question of how you are able to conclude that the blast wall is 9m wide.
You have also characterized this site as “the area is carved out of mountain side,” which is clearly not correct. It is lying on a flood plain.
Cyrus | February 7, 2013
Cthippo — why should we expect Iran ‘admit’ a pre-2003 nuclear weapons program when thus far all the publicly known evidence of such a program has been debunked, be it the “neutron initiator” document leaked to Oliver Kamm of the Times, or the “AP graph” or the “hemispherical metal” documents?
Lets remember that while the IAEA welcomed the 2007 NIE conclusion that there was no current nuclear weapons program in Iran, they did NOT endorse the claim that such a program existed prior to 2003 either. Quite the opposite, the IAEA said: “With respect to a recent media report, the IAEA reiterates that it has no concrete proof that there is or has been a nuclear weapon programme in Iran.”
Ara Barsamian | February 8, 2013
Parchin synonimous with “beating a dead horse”, and taking us off on a tangent with pseudo-technical “facts” and exagerations.
Parchin is completely irrelevant to the issue at hand of what do we want of Iran now?
Or are we just looking at a pretext to bomb them back to the stone age, no matter what?66 results for "birmingham

Tired of the commercialism of Christmas? Buying presents? Getting together with relatives? Cornerstone Baptist Church, 29635 C.R. 10, is offering an all-church series, “From Humbug to Hallelujah: Learning Lessons from ‘A Christmas Carol.’” Together, they’re preparing for a Christmas without regrets by learning from the true Spirit of the season. Information: 262-1331.
Ecumenical Advent Centering Prayer services will take place at 7 p.m. Monday and Dec. 17 in the Koinonia Room at College Mennonite Church, 1900 S. Main St., Goshen. Good parking is available on the south side of the church, and signs on the doors will guide you to the proper place. The service begins promptly and will last about one half hour, followed by tea and fellowship for all who wish to stay a bit longer. Advent season is opportunity to surrender one’s grip on the old, the past, the “way it has to be,” and to receive and accept the gift of the Christ. This guided prayer time offers space and time for the gift of Christ to be received.
Advent worship services at College Mennonite Church, 1900 S. Main St., will focus on the humble and simple question people asked John the Baptist, “What should we do?” As hearts and lives are prepared for the coming of Christ, all will participate together in the rituals of Advent, seeking to answer that question together as the body of Christ.
Resources for Advent devotionals to use at home can be found at (click “Family Advent Devotional” in the “News Update” box). Special holiday services include: Christmas pageant, 9:30 a.m. Dec. 16 in the sanctuary. Children and middle-school students will present a Christmas pageant, first telling the story of the nativity and then the story of the magi. “A Night for Rejoicing” Christmas cantata, 3 p.m. in the sanctuary. This festive collection of original music and lyrics, along with many familiar and well-loved Christmas carols, was written by Lee and Susan Dengler, who serve on the pastoral team.

The Black Swan Take 2: Sinthomosexual, Immigrants, Monster Girls and some other thoughts
by Johannes on Dec.31, 2010, under Uncategorized
I keep going back to The Black Swan and mulling it over, finding shortcomings in my first post. The biggest flaw in my first reading of the movie I think is the ease by which I equated Thomas, teh choreographer, with Father, ie socialiaty and hierarchy. I read Nina’s unwillingness to comply with getting fucked, becoming natural as a way of eluding this Father’s demand for her to be fucked, to become “natural” like Lily, to become part of the social order.
But then I started thinking: The director is not the typical father! He’s the head of a ballet troupe, hardly the most masculine, typical social hierarchy! Furthermore, he exemplifies in every way my mantra “The immigrant is kitsch”: He’s a foreigner (speaks with an accent, is an expert at ballet, that highly artificial, highly European artform, as opposed to the American Movie), both lecherous and gay-ish (dandy outfits, but funny and threatening.

Pretty Little Lions
by John Dermot Woods on Dec.30, 2010, under Uncategorized
A couple of months ago I did an interview with Blaise Larmee, and Blaise, or his ideas, sparked some kind of debate in the comments thread, a debate which I didn’t quite understand (I think I was ignorant of much of the context). So Johannes and I decided to each read (or re-read, in my case) and write a consideration of his book Young Lions and try to figure out what’s up. I’ll get it started with my thoughts:
Young Lions is a study in prettiness. The child actors conducting the narrative, the intentional and sweeping pencil lines, the orchestrated heartbreak are graceful and beautiful. But all of this prettiness is saved from itself, from refinement and glossiness and a good sanding down that might make you overlook it by the generous use of omission, erasure, hole-poking, and breaking shit up. The book is a stylish object, full of stylish people putting on stylish shows, and is one of the more intelligent discussions of the role of style in creation that I’ve encountered in a while. Much like Kenneth Burke was able to explain human relations by framing our interactions as a stage play, Larmee puts his kids in boxes, little theatres, and conducts them, while the whole time they consider and question the very play that they are acting in. Larmee’s four characters, all members of a conceptual art group that views itself and its membership as if it’s a rock band, are placed in contained spaces and set to interact as we might do with figures in a diorama. The spaces are sometimes conducted as if films (with background music) or the book of a play (with scene titles), or even as a venue in which to watch a film (as in the closing panel of the the “New Museum” section). The book’s cover itself, a step away from the “craftiness” of comics and towards the mechanical of books, questions the medium’s conventions of presentation. Many of Larmee’s choices court questions if not controversy (dipping one foot into the pond of tweeness, but yanking it out before he gets too deep), including his choice to include a single blurb on the book’s back cover, from David Heatley, a cartoonist who, unfairly, is best known for voluntarily putting pink boxes of his characters’ genitalia when Big Publishing reprinted his work.
Young Lions invites perusal and rereading. Its lightness is part of it. The clip of the narrative, and flow of pages pull the reader through, encourage page-flipping, like a salaryman might rifle through a chunky manga album on the Chuo line at rush hour (it seems like Larmee has taken some lessons from Frank Santoro’s discussions of mathematical models and proper page structure). From the first page, Young Lions presents itself as a remarkably conventional narrative, with a crisis presented immediately (their art group is failing), a love triangle quickly introduced, and the need for a journey (a road trip to Florida) to bring about resolution. Where Larmee distinguishes himself is the strangeness with which he conducts his story. Just as he balances his perfect pencil lines that carve out pretty young cheeks and self-conscious coifs with smudgy palimpsests and completely absent lines where the white space begs for definition, he confounds his narrative with subtle steps into the fantastic, meta-fictional conceits that usefully demand critical consideration, and by leaving straight-up gaps and holes. This is where the richness and mystery is contained in Young Lions, not in the magic of the characters’ performances. (As the groups’ seeming leader, and only apparent adult, Wilson says, “Art becomes magic when it has nothing left to hide.”) Larmee’s continued attention to the concept of Yoko Ono creates a particularly compelling, and almost eerie, subtext of a hidden world beneath the one he is showing us, a world accessed in the whispers of passers-by and through the tenuous connection of cellular communication.

INTERSTATE
I don’t even pretend with the alarm going off I just gun it the fuck out of there. I’m weaving in and out of traffic in a tux with security in pursuit. The streets are wet with panic. I could eat shit any second. I don’t even really know how to handle a motorcycle I’m just doing it. All that matters right now is that I never stop. Not with this mannequin’s arms bent around my waist. There is like an entire generation in her face. Staring off forever at what has happened, at what’s to come. This is my responsibility. All the failures and dreams of an entire generation and I can’t find the interstate.

More Books of the Year: Kate Zambreno
by Johannes on Dec.28, 2010, under Uncategorized, O Fallen Angel is more of a grotesque parade of certain social “types” and clichés taken to their furthest degree. The book reminds me of early Robert Crumb, a great deal of Jeff Koons, and even some of John Waters, other artists fascinated by the kitschy, grotesque underbelly of American culture. And like those artists, Zambreno finds this kitsch exhilarating. The overriding tone of the novel is oddly joyful; and while the book is very funny, it’s not coolly so–in fact, there is nothing cool or classical about this book at all, and the novel in general brings to my mind certain Dogma 95 films where the camera plunges right into the action, making it purposely difficult to get our bearings. There are no establishing shots here.”
.]..It’s also emblematic of the battle Lindsay Anderson, the seminal director who helped usher British cinema into the spectral, socially conscious’60s, would fight his entire life — and one that his lifelong friend Gavin Lambert, an expat British screenwriter and novelist, is singularly equipped to tell. Opening with their schooldays at Cheltenham College (savagely parodied in “If…”) and Oxford, where Anderson launched the film journal Sequence, Lambert chronicles the obstinately uncompromising career of this pioneer of the British stage and screen. In Lambert’s telling, Anderson never abandoned the tenets of “Stand Up! Stand Up!,” his famous Sequence screed against the “baffled idealism” of the 1950s and the “philistinism that shrinks from art because art presents a challenge.” So challenging and unconventional were Anderson’s feature films that he only managed to make six of them in his lifetime. Lambert charts Anderson’s rise as a critic, a docu filmmaker and theater and film director chronicling what Lambert calls “the strange, dead, culturally isolated landscape of post-war Britain.” In films like “The Sporting Life,” “O Lucky Man!” and “Brittania Hospital,” Anderson captured the tumult of his era through a blend of Brechtian and surrealist devices, a sharp class-consciousness and a wry, deliberate, poetic style often reminiscent of the films of his unlikely hero, John Ford. A tender and nuanced portrait of the filmmaker emerges here that doesn’t shrink from his often contentious, difficult and self-doubting behavior — qualities the openly gay Lambert at times attributes to Anderson’s straitjacketed homosexuality. But Anderson is also shown to be generous and enormously loyal to a circle of devoted acquaintances — a dysfunctional family of actors and writers, including the suicidal thesps Jill Bennett and Rachel Roberts and various family members who stayed with him intermittently at his London home. It’s a portrait that’s interwoven with Lambert’s own divergent path through the British theater and international film biz. In 1956, Lambert lit out for Hollywood, with an assignment from Nicholas Ray to rewrite “Bigger Than Life” at Fox. Thus began a career in exile as Lambert turned out several novels; such scripts as “Sons and Lovers” and “Inside Daisy Clover,” based on his novel; and books on George Cukor and Norma Shearer. Lambert’s short but intense relationship with Ray, sometimes sexual, sometimes not, is the springboard for a series of Lambert’s reminiscences of other Hollywood legends with whom he rubbed shoulders in the waning days of the studio system — including Cukor, James Whale and Josef von Sternberg, as well as Christopher Isherwood and Tennessee Williams — before quitting L.A. for an extended sojourn in Tangiers. Lambert’s recollection of these encounters, written in an often vague and gossipy tone, as if he’s filling out a photo album, is the weakest dimension of the book. But Lambert’s Hollywood vantage point is also his strongest asset, providing a filter on Anderson’s uniquely uneasy relationship with the drab British society that appears in his films. Unlike his friend, Anderson never considered leaving England. “The bond of love-hate was too strong,” Lambert writes, “and stimulated his finest work.”

Suggestion Eleven: Control the Borders
By David Brin, Ph.D.... act swiftly to regain control over the borders of the United States. In fact, I will lay heavy odds that he does it very soon..
It sounds counter-intuitive, of course, and neither political party ever spoke up about it much. But the reasons are simple. Democrats like legal immigration, which results in lots of new voters and new union workers, while illegals drain resources, get embroiled (against their will) into crime, and prevent domestic programs from achieving full effectiveness. On the other hand, Republicans -- well, not your neighbors, but some influential people near the top of the party -- like access to pools of cheap, undocumented labor that won't talk back. Only when border state citizens began getting riled did the GOP start talking tough about immigration. And talk, for the most part, is all they ever did., and doing so in an orderly and rational way -- one that is both generous and in keeping with our own best interests.

At the highest dose of 10 milligrams, 72 percent of patients taking the drug daily had a 20-percent reduction in joint swelling after 24 weeks, 44 percent had a 50-percent drop and 28 percent had a 70-percent decline, Wilmington, Del.-based Incyte said in a prepared statement. By comparison, 32 percent of patients taking placebos had a 20-percent drop in inflammation, 13 percent had a 50-percent decline and 3 percent had a 70-percent drop, the company said.
The drug, previously known as INCB28050, will be called LY3009104, and Indianapolis-based Lilly will be responsible for future clinical trials, Incyte said in its statement. Headache, upper respiratory tract infections, and diarrhea were the most frequently reported side effects mentioned by the 125 patients who took part in the study, the company said.
Lilly paid $90 million in 2009 to acquire the global rights to the treatment in a bid to beef up its pipeline of medications for autoimmune diseases. If the drug makes it to market, Lilly could pay another $665 million to Incyte for reaching various milestones along the way.
The latest study results suggest that “the compound has the potential to become a welcome addition” to current therapies, said Maria Greenwald, a Palm Desert, Calif., rheumatologist who led the study. The findings were released Thursday at the American College of Rheumatology meeting in Atlanta.
In rheumatoid arthritis, the body’s immune system attacks itself, causing joint inflammation and swelling that can lead to progressive destruction of the joints. The disease affects about 1 percent of the world’s population.
The pill is one of a family of experimental treatments for rheumatoid arthritis targeting a protein called JAK that leads to joint destruction. Pfizer Inc. also reported results showing an experimental JAK-targeted medicine that reduced pain and inflammation in a trial released at the rheumatology meeting.
Three biotechnology companies are developing JAK drugs: Incyte, Rigel Pharmaceuticals Inc. of San Francisco, Calif., and Cambridge, Mass.-based Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc.10:00 am, City Council Chambers

The Lakers are learning all about "Lin-sanity," trailing the New York Knicks while second-year point guard Jeremy Lin rips through them.
Lin has 18 points and five assists for the Knicks, who lead at halftime, 49-41, Friday at Madison Square Garden.
The Lakers (15-11) haven't been very solid in any phase of the game, shooting 34% and committing nine turnovers. Kobe Bryant has 10 points on one-for-six shooting.
Andrew Bynum has two points on one-for-five shooting. Derek Fisher and Steve Blake have each missed four of five shots so far.
The Knicks (11-15) are playing without two starters: Carmelo Anthony is sidelined by a strained groin and Amare Stoudemire is away from the team because his brother died earlier this week.

Kitchen Countertops that are Beautiful and Easy to Maintain
The kitchen is the busiest room in your home, often serving as the center of your family’s home life. It’s the place where you prepare a delicious dinner for your family, sign your son’s field trip permission slip, or simply catch up over a cup of coffee. When you think of your kitchen, does it fill you with satisfaction and pride or does it make you think about all of the changes you want to make?
When it comes down to it, nothing reinvigorates a tired old kitchen like new kitchen countertops, and nothing better completes a new kitchen than a countertop that is both durable and decorative. New kitchen countertops can renew the overall look of your existing kitchen or make a bold statement in the dream kitchen you’ve been designing. That said, replacing only the counters is selling your kitchen remodel short. For this reason, Long Kitchens offers kitchen countertop replacement as part of a larger kitchen remodeling project.
When you’re choosing the right countertops for your kitchen, there are certainly a variety of factors to consider including price, style, ease of maintenance, and more. Long Kitchens offers a variety of low-maintenance countertop options at a range of different price points. Premium countertop materials include:
High-definition laminate: Today’s high-definition architectural laminate offers customers the perfect combination of style and affordability. Made to withstand the day-to-day use of a busy home kitchen, high-definition architectural laminate is the choice to make when you’re looking for a surface that is decorative, durable and functional.
100% acrylic solid surface: Kitchen countertops made of 100% acrylic solid surface are nonporous – meaning that they’re incredibly easy to clean. They are also less susceptible to hard water stains, and don’t harbor bacteria. Acrylic solid surface counter tops also come in a virtually limitless array of colors, so you’re certain to find the countertop that fits your style just right.
93% pure crystal quartz: Quartz is becoming a more popular choice among homeowners due to its resilient properties and ease of maintenance. Long Kitchens has several types of quartz countertops (also called engineered stone countertops) from which to choose. In fact, quartz is actually stronger and more scratch resistant than granite, making it the optimal choice for those customers searching for a luxurious look that lasts a long time.

The first of the meetings will take place from 5:30-7 p.m. Monday, April 8, during the City Council’s work study session at the Howard Miller Community Center, 14 S. Church St. A second meeting will be held from 6-7:30 p.m. Thursday, April 11, at the community center.
“These meetings will be identical in nature,” city marketing director Abby deRoo said. “Two dates have been offered to allow flexibility for attendees.”
Development of the splash pad has been identified as a top goal for both the City Council and downtown business leaders for this year. The city has set aside $100,000 in its park improvement fund for the $350,000 project under the proposed city budget for the new fiscal year that starts in July.
Another $50,000 in funding is expected to come from the Zeeland Board of Public Works, and a fundraising campaign is planned to raise the remaining costs, officials said.
City officials and project engineers recently met with sixth-grade students from Zeeland Christian School to get their ideas for the splash pad. The students are working on the project for a project management learning program.

The best sports-related TV show of all time was “Learning the Ropes,” starring the late Lyle Alzado. By day, Lyle was a school teacher, and by night, he was a masked professional wrestler. Lyle taught us life’s lessons, both in and out of the ring. Each week there was a special guest wrestler from the NWA. My favorite episode was the one where Ivan Kolof guest starred.

January 13 - February 10, 2012
Kinship has been curated in conjunction with Calvin College's Wake Up Weekend, an annual animal advocacy event organized by faculty of Calvin College. Over the years the artists assembled for this exhibition have produced works concerned with the welfare of our planet and those we share it with. While many of the pieces in this show do not speak overtly to issues of animal rights, all serve to illustrate how deeply we connect to our non-human relatives.
The exhibition was curated by GVSU Art and Design Professor Brett Colley, and.

Both tablets are said to run Android 2.2 out of the starting gate – something much appreciated after a stream of tablet devices being introduced with Android 1.5 and 1.6 – and will be focused on multimedia use. It’s believed to be running on a chipset from the ARM family and will have 3G integrated for on-the-go connectivity.
Just as we knew before, both tablets will be available in Q4 of this year.

— They’re daring you to put money on the Overeem/Fujita fight. Don’t do it. Don’t convice yourself that a Fujita upset is possible, and don’t even put Overeem in your parlay. The upside is just too small.
— Let’s talk underdogs. Masanori Kanehara is a whopping +350, which would make sense if he was facing a prime Kid Yamamoto. He’s not. Yamamoto hasn’t won a fight in two years, and looked not-quite-himself in his return fight against Joe Warren at Dream.9, which followed 15 months of injury-related inactivity. Meanwhile, Kanehara went 4-1 this year, scoring wins over tough challengers like Michihiro Omigawa and Chan Sung Jung. If Yamamoto still isn’t back to 100%, Kanehara has a chance to grind out an upset.
— At +250, Ikuhisa Minowa might also be worth a look if you’ve got some balls. The oddsmakers are assuming that Sokoudjou will steamroll him with strikes, which is probably the most likely outcome. But Minowa got to the Super Hulk finals by leg-locking bigger guys with weak submission defense, and the African Assassin falls into that category. Plus, nobody can defend Minowaman’s drunken style.
— Kazuo Misaki looks like a safe favorite bet considering Melvin Manhoef has stopped training his ground game altogether, and you can lay money down on Mach Sakurai, Hideo Tokoro, and Katsuyori Shibata with relative confidence as well. Of course, you’ll save the heavy favorites for your parlay. Speaking of which…
— Official CagePotato Parlay: Aoki + Kawajiri + Sakurai + Shibata. We’ll leave Ishii out of it because it’s his first MMA fight and anything can happen. If you think experience will trump youth, feel free to toss a Hail Mary bet down on Yoshida. What do we care, it’s your money, not ours.

Hi,
The Donut VoiceDialer is far from ideal for in-car use because it requires users to confirm their selection by tapping on the screen. My idea is to enhance it so that it can be hands-free from start to finish.
I was looking at VoiceDialerActivity.java and the most interesting part is the function onRecognitionSuccess(), which starts at line 383:
/**
* Called by the {@link RecognizerEngine} when is succeeds. If there is
* only one item, then the Intent is dispatched immediately.
* If there are more, then an AlertDialog is displayed and the user is
* prompted to select.
* @param intents a list of Intents corresponding to the sentences.
*/
public void onRecognitionSuccess(final Intent[] intents)
We could modify it so that if there is more than one item, it reads the items out loud and then does another recognition cycle among those items.
Once the user's voice matches a single item, we can execute this pre-existing code (which is commented out for some reason):
// only one item, so just launch
/*
if (intents.length == 1 && mVoiceDialerTester == null)
{
// start the Intent
startActivityHelp(intents[0]);
finish();
return;
}
*/
What do you think?
For now, my main problem is that I have never developed for Android and my default compilation of the Donut branch does not generate a VoiceDialer.apk file in /mydroid/out/target/product/generic/system/app/, where I had expected it to be.
When I compile, I get the following:
target R.java/Manifest.java: VoiceDialer (out/target/common/obj/APPS/VoiceDialer_intermediates/src/R.stamp)
target Java: VoiceDialer (out/target/common/obj/APPS/VoiceDialer_intermediates/classes)
Note: Some input files use or override a deprecated API.
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:deprecation for details.
Note: packages/apps/VoiceDialer/src/com/android/voicedialer/RecognizerEngine.java uses unchecked or unsafe operations.
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.
After that Dex and Package don't do anything with the VoiceDialer app and the compilation goes on to other packages.
Any ideas?

With this book, you will learn about how cockroaches can survive for a week in a decapitated state; how most wines probably contain ground-up rodent; how giraffes legs are so powerful and flexible, they can kick in all four directions and even take the head off of a lion.
Along with these facts you will get McNeal’s witty and often hilarious commentary. At a list price of $12.95, this little number is the ultimate bathroom reader!

I have always thought long distance relationships were hard, but i never really even knew how hard they could be. My boyfriend and I both thought he bould not be deployed while he the army was putting him through college.. but we were wrong. He will be in iraq for a year, and hopefully I will be here, not the mental hospital, i feel like im going insane and it has only been one week. He hears about his friends, whose girlfriends dump them while they are overseas, and he is afraid thats what i will do, but i am here for him, this is just so hard.
That is what makes it almost even harder, we have only been together for 6 months, but that doesnt mean i care about him any less than people who have been together for years. (everyone assumes that when they hear that we havent even been together for a year yet)<br />
<br />
We have been good friends for a long time. This is definatley a test in our relationship, but Im so completley in love with him.
how long have you been dating before he deployed?
how long have you been dating before he deployed?
Thank you:) He tells me all the time about his friends, whose wives left them while they were overseas, which is awful when they are already so stressed out, someof them even commit suicide because of all the stress. josh had to take a suicide class while he was in training. I love him soo much, i just wish this year would go by really fast o it would be over with!<br />
He will be in Baghdad, that would be really neat if they did know each other !
It is very hard... but it's so rewarding. When he gets comfortable being out there it will get easier. Where is he located? my husband is also in Iraq, but he's at the end of his tour. He's in the Army. Maybe they know each other. Girl believe me, there isnt a day that goes by that I wish he was home. But I know that he'll be okay and he'll be home soon. Stay strong, because it does get trying at times and there are times that you'd rather give up and let him go. But believe me it's MUCH worse for them out there. My husband was telling me about soilders losing their girlfriends, even wives once they get out there. That just means that they weren't meant to be apart of this very perstigous club. It takes a special person, to date a military person. Stay strong, lean on your friends and family for support and drop by here every now and again to vent. We are all going through it and know what you're going through.<br />
<br />
Stay strong and Committed.<br />
<br />
God bless
thank you so much, i feel like he is all i talk about, and all i ever think about. im trying to be as supportive as i can for him, i know that alot of soldiers dont get that, some girls just give up on their boyfriends when they hear that they will be leaving, and im not doing that! i love him soo much
girl...it is hard trying to survive a deployment...im trying to survive my first one as well and im not going to lie there are days were i just really do not want to get out of bed...the only thing that really keeps me going is hearing from him and knowing that his r and r is almost hear and praying...just stay strong for him...let him know that you love him and that you are here for him and that you will be here for him when he comes home...im here for you if you need to talk or vent or what ever all you have to do is message me...everything will be ok...cause i know what you are going through...just keep your head up...KIPP students gain an additional eight to 11 months of learning in reading and math over three years, compared to students in nearby middle schools,say Mathematica researchers. Student attrition doesn’t explain KIPP’s success, they write in Education Next.
KIPP middle schools and the district-run schools nearby have similar attrition patterns: Lower achievers are more likely at both kinds of schools.
What’s different is that KIPP schools admit fewer transfers in seventh and eighth grade and late entrants tend to be higher achieving than those who started in fifth grade.
However, most KIPP gains occur in the first year, before anyone’s left or transferred, say the Mathematica analysts.
Compared to feeder elementary schools, KIPP students are more likely to be black or Latino and low-income. They are slightly less likely to be English Learners or in special education. Prior achievement is the same.
However, it’s hard to measure “parent characteristics, prior motivation, or student behavior,” the researchers write. “For example, KIPP students might benefit from attending school with peers who are especially motivated to accept KIPP’s academic and behavioral demands.”
If that’s the case, then it raises the question of whether KIPP would be better utilized as a one-year program. It also raises the question of why that one year would make such a difference, while subsequent years in the same program seem roughly on par with the average public school.
As just about everyone knows, losing weight is relatively easy. Keeping it off is hard. Maybe something like that is going on here.
Or maybe the better analogy is getting in shape. If an out of shape person starts an exercise program, and sticks with it for a year, the improvement will be pretty impressive. But later years may not show much improvement at all.
Attrition certainly is not the only reason for KIPP’s success but equally certainly it is one reason. To a large extent, the people who leave are the people who are tired of eating less, tired of working out four days a week, tired of long school days and lots of work. They are the ones who will relapse and will take some of their classmates with them.kids

The money donated this year will pay for next year's flags, on our 30th anniversary.-life. Without this most generous donation, the flag project's fundraising would have to continue much longer. Thanks to management and owners of KINY/KSUP radio stations, for public service announcements publicizing our fundraising efforts.

Song of the Forgotten Rose Original lyrics for "Theme for Young Love" A Wedding Poem by S. Pena Young
In the Garden of Life, Midnight hid the Scarlet Rose. Wilted and torn, She cried to the heavens, Petals upturned, Imploring of God, That Grace come down from the mountain.
In this land journeyed a stalwart traveler. Alone, He had conquered roads forgotten. This path had led him through Hills and valleys. His search for Beauty.
God, Looking down upon creation, Saw what they could not see. Hope in the hands of the Great Orchestrator, In the form of a rose and a man.
Buried, In the shadows, The wanderer stumbled and fell On roots he could not see. Lying among weeds, His eyes alighted on Beauty.
For there, near his outstretched hand, Shone a Rose in moon's pale gleam. Tenderly he touched her tearstained petals.
A thousand lonely nights erased. A thousand lonely nights erased in a single moment Of Love's sweet embrace.Webcast: Oracle's SuperCluster M6-32 December 4

What life is for
I've always had my doubts
But never more than now
I'm down inside this hole that I've dug
Trying to suppose
And never climbing out
I'm falling into pieces
Waiting on the best years of my life
Yeah maybe there's a reason
There's only hesitation in my sights
I find
The State of unknown is sublime
Just fine
Confessing away your time
I only ask that you define
'Cause something isn't feeling right this time
Into Pieces, Roark
I'm starving. That has been the first thought in my head every morning for the last two weeks. Because of Ma's "diet," I've lost 3 pounds and she says it's a good thing; that I should be thanking her. But when I complain and tell her that I'm always hungry, and that I'm constantly feeling faint, she just brushes it off and says it's a "side affect" and that I'll be fine. That my body is just reacting and in due time it will get used to the feeling. I don't think so though.
I love her, I do. But, I know that this "diet" is wrong and it's not healthy. Lately I found myself hating her. I mean if it was healthy then why has she been in and out of the hospital? And aren't diets supposed to make you feel good? They're not supposed to make you feel like crap and they're not supposed to make you look in the mirror and start wondering if you really are fat. The day after talking with Andrew, I immediately went on the diet. I can't have any smoothies or soft drinks of any kind. No burgers, no fries, no chocolate, no candy, and most of all, no sugar cubes. I hated her for that one. I knew that the only reason she wouldn't let me have them is because it was just something else that reminded her of daddy. And of course…we couldn't have that.
I rolled over in bed, and stared up at my ceiling and began counting cracks. I got to five and then let my eyes roam over the ceiling looking for more. I didn't find any. Bringing my legs to my chest, I closed my eyes and savored the feeling of comfort and silence. A mixture of feelings tumbled in waves over me and I confusingly looked down at my hands as if I would find the answer there. I liked order, familiarity, and following rules. But now, I found myself wishing that I could just do something that I normally wouldn't do; something that I knew my ma wouldn't like. I was beginning to get bored of the same things over and over. Shoving the thought aside, I forced myself to get out of my bed and dressed. I took my time however. When I finally made my way into the kitchen, my ma was already downstairs and had already eaten.
"Ah, there ya are," Ma grinned, "I was beginning to wonder where ya were."
Shrugging my shoulders, I pulled out an orange and began eating it as my ma watched with approving eyes. As I was finishing it up, my stomach growled and I sadly remembered what a McDonald's hamburger and a Double Trouble Tango Mango tasted like. Yummy. I thought hard for a minute and decided that if I was going to break some rules they would be under legal terms and nothing too crazy. I thought of Malayshia and how she would be proud of me. Malayshia…of course!
"Hey Ma," I started cautiously, "I was wondering if I could go hang out with Malayshia today?"
Ma looked at me and then repeated my question to herself, evaluating it as if she were looking for any signs of trouble.
"Well…I suppose. You haven't been out for two weeks and you've been sticking to the rules pretty well. I guess that would be fine, but remember. If ya going to be eatin' don't eat too many carbs unless you want to get fat again."
I smiled through gritted teeth and muttered a "yes ma'am."
Turning around, I grabbed a banana and said, "I'll be home around 4:00," and slammed the front door behind me.
Finally, free, I thought with satisfaction.
I dumped the banana in a bin near by and made my way over to Mrs. Wilson's salon. I practically skipped there as I mentally patted myself on the back for getting out of the house. As I opened the door, hair chemicals, the scents of shampoo's and conditioners, and cold air hit my face, making me feel slightly light headed.
"Hi! How are you doing? Darling, you look absolutely gorgeous!" Mrs. Wilson greeted me as I sat down in a chair nearby.
"I'm great, you?" I shouted at Mrs. Wilson while she continued to blow dry her customers hair. Malayshia's mom is great, but she tends to yell…like, all the time. She acts as if she's deaf, but she's the one that knows all the gossip and "breaking news" in our town. I wonder how that works…
"I'm fantastic! Oh, I just dyed Malayshia's hair and she's just combing it right now. She'll be out in a minute. You know, you should shop more. Yesterday, I went shopping and found these great bras. Malayshia was with me and got some too. But we found some cute little push up bras that you should try!"
And…she's practically open about everything, even if that means embarrassing you.
"Uh…t-that, yeah. I'll, uh, look into that. Thanks."
"Roxxi, I've missed you so much!" Malayshia greeted me as she came out of the backroom (finally). I looked at her hair, which had been dyed a red, and smiled.
"You're hair looks great," I complimented her.
"Aw, thanks."
I waited as Malayshia grabbed her things and said bye to her ma. Then, we were outside on our way to the park. I listened to her talk on and on about how happy she was that we were hanging out finally, that she couldn't believe my mother, and that she was in love (What is this, the 20th time?) with this guy Robby.
We sat in the swings when we got to the park and neither of us said anything for a couple of minutes. Finally though, I spoke up. "I feel like I'm starving all the time."
Malayshia looked me over and shrugged hesitantly. "No offense or anything, but you don't look so good either. You look sick. Like your mother always does."
And I didn't take it as an insult because I knew it was true. "I don't wanna be like my ma. So, let's go get something to eat."
Malayshia's eyes twinkled, "Is Roxxi, my best friend, actually thinking of breaking a rule? I'm so proud of you!" she said, nudging me playfully.
I laughed and then we walked over to Hamburger Love, a fast food restaurant, and had some burgers. Afterwards, Malayshia and I began walking back to her mother's salon.
"You know, Robby, he's such a great guy. He's really sweet and funny." Malayshia said, "And…well, we've been dating for about 2 months now. He's only 17 and I trust him a lot."
I don't know what made my stomach lurch. I briefly pondered if it could have been the burger, but I knew it wasn't. Then I realized it was the way that Malayshia was talking about Robby that was making me feel nervous.
"Anyway," Malayshia continued, "I really like him. So, I've decided that I'm going to have sex with him."
I inhaled sharply and then began coughing as I choked on my own spit. After I regained my breath, I looked over at Malayshia. "Are you serious?"
"Yeah. I really love him Roxxi."
Staring at her, I stopped walking. "Come on Malayshia, you've been in "love" so many times now that I've lost track. How is Robby different from all of the other guys?"
She gasped and I wondered if I had actually said that. But then I realized what a mistake it was when Malayshia's brown eyes turned cold and she spat out, "What makes you think you know anything? Come on Roxxi, you don't even like guys. At least I actually have a life. The most exciting thing that has ever happened to you is when you got your hair highlighted."
I stood there, shocked by the sting of her words.
"So, maybe when you have a little bit more experience and you know what you're talking about, maybe then you can come to me and tell me what the hell you think. When you do, call me, but until then, I don't want your opinion."
Normally, I would have let it go. I would've just walked away and let her have the last word. But her words had stung and I was sick of being pushed around, "You know what Malayshia, fuck you, yeah I said it. And just because I don't go around sucking every guys face off doesn't mean that I can't have an opinion-"
"Come on, you've never even talked to a guy without me being there!" Malayshia screamed, dismissing the fact that I had just insulted her and said a curse word in one sentence.
"Andrew."
"What?"
"Andrew and I talk."
Malayshia moved a little closer to me now and said, "What? What do you mean? I introduced you guys for the first time at Bonnie's Stupid Coffee Shop. As far as I know, you guys haven't muttered a word to each other since then."
"Well, you're wrong. We've met two or three times and talked for a little," I don't know why I didn't shut up after that. But next thing I know I say, "He even bought me a smoothie," like it's supposed to mean something, and that's when I know that I should've just kept my mouth shut.
Malayshia pushed me and stood angrily across from me. "What, why didn't you tell me? How could you keep that from me? I thought we were friends."
I stood there quietly, not sure what to say. Finally, I said stupidly, "We are friends."
She scrunched up her nose at that and then actually started laughing. "No, no you're wrong, because if you were my friend, you would've told me. Friends don't keep things from each other."
I scoffed, "Come on Malayshia, don't be ridiculous. I know that you don't tell me everything. This isn't third grade. We're going into our first year of high school-"
"We are not doing anything. Screw you," Malayshia yelled and with that, she walked away in the direction of her mother's salon.
I stood still, astonished. I was hurt and angry. Checking my cell, it was only 2:00 and I didn't want to go home. So I went to the only place I knew I could go.
Standing in front of the entrance to the lake, I tapped my foot anxiously. Somehow, I knew he was already there, like he was just waiting. You know the feeling? Like, you can feel a certain persons presence right before they're standing in front of you and you know that they know that you'll be there too? Consciously, I straightened out my hair that was down and put a swab of lip-gloss on.
Walking through the gate, I picked out the tree here he had given me the smoothie and then sat under it. And I just stared at the lake, its muddy water gazing back at me.
I waited and waited and waited.
Exasperatedly, I looked at my cell and saw that it was almost 3:00. Angrily, I brushed away my stupid tears and got up. For good measure, I kicked the tree. What had I been thinking, I had actually thought that he'd be here waiting for me? I continued to mentally chastise myself and eventually I began talking to myself out loud.
"What's wrong with me? Did I think I had magic powers or something? I am the stupidest girl on the face of this planet!" Wiping my tears away, I got up angrily and began walking towards the exit when I felt him. Literally. He pulled me back, his hands around my waist, and whispered in my ear, "Sorry I kept you waiting." I shivered. He smiled and turned me around.
"Where have you been?" I bravely asked, as if we had had one of our scheduled meetings.
"Where have I been? You're the one who's been gone for two weeks," Andrew stated rather irritated. He sat underneath the tree and I sat next to him. He reached over and wiped the tears off of my face.
"I'm sorry I made you cry."
I gently pulled his hands away from my face, "You didn't make me cry."
Andrew leaned forward, "Then who did?"
His turquoise eyes held my ordinary blue ones for a minute before I pulled my eyes away.
"You can tell me anything you know," Andrew stated.
"Your hair looks nice. I see you dyed it brown. Very nice, yes, very nice," I chirped up, trying to steer the conversation.
"Good try," He caught on, "And yes I did dye it brown, but that doesn't matter. You can tell me anything."
Still looking down, I asked, "Can I?"
He cupped my face and nodded. "Well…" I started.
I told him everything. From why we moved here, to my ma's health and the diet she put me on, and all through the fight that Malayshia and I had had. Everything. I didn't leave a single thing out. After I was finished, Andrew said, "It's not true. You're not fat. I think you're beautiful. And Malayshia, she's just confused right now. I'm sure she didn't mean to hurt you. As for your mother. She's just crazy."
I laughed and nodded my head in agreement. It was amazing how with just a few words he seemed to be able to fix everything and to make it better. "I've told you everything. Now you have to tell me everything."
Andrew shifted and looked at me. "What's there to tell? My father and I moved back to our old house and we'll be here for a little while."
"What do you mean your old house? This house has been abandoned for ten years."
"Yeah, well, ten years ago my father, mother, and I lived here. But then we moved to California. Now, we're back. Well, my dad and I anyway."
"Where's your ma?" I asked cautiously.
"My parents got a divorce. She still lives in California somewhere."
"Oh."
There was a silence for a couple of minutes. And then out of sheer habit, I pulled out my cell phone and looked at the time.
"What is it?" Andrew asks.
"It's 5:00. My ma is goin' to kill me! I told her I'd be home around four o' clock."
Andrew chuckled, "Remember what you said about rebelling a little? Well…instead of running home, hang out with me. Stay out as long as you want."
I looked back at him not sure what to say. "But-"
"Roxxi, you said you wanted to do something that your mother wouldn't like. This is it. It's harmless and it's legal."
It felt like I was standing on a jumping board, and I had to make a decision fast and soon before the fat kid behind me got impatient and pushed me in. Either I jumped or I got off. Either I stayed out late or I went home like a little mama's girl.
"Okay."
He smiled and pulled me towards him.
"What do you say we go somewhere?"
Nervously, I looked up at him. "Where?"
"There's a concert up in Miami. The Button Pushers have come and I already have tickets. What do you say?"
"Miami is three hours, almost four, away from here," I exclaimed, "If we go, we'll get there around 8. And then the concert itself will last about 2 to 3 hours. Oh, and then the three hour drive back. We'll get back around 2:00 in the morning!"
"Okay, okay," Andrew said, "Too much for a first time rebel. I understand."
I calmed down and sighed. I felt bad that I had freaked out like that, but staying out until 2:00 didn't have much of an appeal to me. I wasn't ready to go that extreme. "You can go though," I told Andrew, hoping that he wasn't angry.
Andrew smiled. "Nah, it's okay. I'd rather hang out with you."
Looking down at the ground, I hoped that he couldn't see my red cheeks. "Okay. I'll hang out with you until 8:00. Is that good?"
"That's great."
The next three hours, Andrew I talked about anything and everything. Like, some of the things I found out about him were; his favorite color was green, he loved scary movies, his favorite types of music were rock and jazz, he'd been a vegetarian for two years, he loved my Texas accent, and he thought I was the most beautiful girl he'd ever met. There's more, but who cares, Andrew thought I was beautiful! Insert thousands of smiles here.
Before we knew it, it was 8:00. I ran home all the way, smiling like an idiot.
The last two weeks have been bliss. Everyday, I've spent with Andrew and each night, I come home later and later. The latest I've gone home is 10:00. Call me a sissy, but that's amazing for me. Andrew doesn't understand why I'm so…obedient. But I guess it's just because…well, I'm her only child. After the divorce, she was a mess; always calling on me to do the simplest things. I just don't want to disappoint her, but then I realized that I barely even had a life. I was so wrapped up in trying to be her good little daughter that I barely got out and had fun. Anyway, I've figured, it's time to have some fun.
I haven't been so hungry either. Andrew began sneaking me some food. Don't get me wrong, my ma is upset about my coming home late and the "strange" fact that I haven't been losing weight; it's been staying at my original weight, 106. She just doesn't know what to do anymore. She calls up Malayshia's mother asking her where I am, but it's no use. I haven't seen or spoken to Malayshia since our argument. Honestly, I haven't missed her.
Andrew and I sat next to each other silently, our arms innocently touching.
"Andrew?" I broke the silence.
"Hmm?"
"What are we?"
"Humans," He replied, chuckling at his own lame joke. "What do you mean?"
I paused. What did I mean? Was I going to ask him if we were going out? If I was his girlfriend? No. I couldn't do that. I liked what we had. I didn't want to mess that up with a silly question; he'd never date a girl like me. No use in asking.
"Never mind."
Andrew looked at me and began saying something, but then stopped. "Hey Roxxi, what about going to a concert with me to see Button Pushers up in Miam?"
I thought about it. Going to my first concert with Andrew would certainly be fun. "When is it?"
"Tomorrow night."
I nodded my head, smiling, "I'd love to."
Andrew smiled in reply and we spent the next hour joking around and laughing. We even went for a swim. This time, I was fully clothed, and I had a pink shirt on.
Quietly, my feet hit the stairs as I prayed to the stars that my ma and nana were sleep. I'm almost to the top and I'm smiling, because I believe that I'm not going to have another confrontation (as in argument) with my ma, when I feel somebody grasp my hand.
When I turned around, relief flowed through me and I was so happy I didn't know what to do.
"Hey Nana," I whispered, "What are you doing?"
She smiled at me and I could tell that she was having another one of her moments. "Jim, honey, you came home. What took you so long? Why'd you leave me Jim?"
Immediately, I felt a pain in the back of my throat, the kind that you get when you're trying to not cry. No matter how hard I tried though, the tears started coming down my face. "Nana, I'm not Papa. I'm Roxxi, your granddaughter."
"Jim, it's been almost a year since I've seen you. We have a lot of catching up to do. Let's go sit down and I'll make you a coffee, just the way you like it," Nana insisted. I pulled back. I was so sick of this. I knew I should be more patient, but doesn't she understand? Papa is dead. Ten months ago when Papa died, Nana took the news well. Maybe a little too well. When ma had told her, she'd gone into their room for hours. When she finally came out, she had a calm expression on her face. My ma asked her if she was okay and she simply said, "Of course." I asked Ma if Nana would be fine and she replied with a curt nod and told me over and over that I wasn't to mention Papa at all.
Then the funeral.
One person after the other constantly saying sorry and giving each one of us pity faces. While my mother and I cried, my nana stood to the side dazed and confused.
"Why are people crying?" She'd ask my ma over and over, always forgetting what the answer was. Finally, the funeral was coming to an end-all speeches made, all hands shook, and then unexpectedly Nana stood up. I flicked my eyes over to Ma. "Should Nana really be allowed to say something? She's going crazy!" I told her with my eyes. Ma look at me hopelessly, not sure what to do, and shrugged her shoulders.
I tapped my foot anxiously.
"Ya'll," My nana started. Everybody turned top look at her, "Whatcha crying for? Jim isn't gone. He'll be back. Just ya'll see. He'll be back. He's just gone on a little business trip…" She trailed off. "He'll be back."
Everybody looked at her in horror and then in sadness. People came up to us again, and gave us hugs, only this time they suggested doctors. We all went home physically and emotionally exhausted.
After that, things only got worse with Nana. She began forgetting the simplest things and then there were days where she didn't know where she was. When we went to a doctor, we were told that she had a mild case of Alzheimer's and that it would get worse as time passed.
Now, I stood at the top of the stairs. I realized that she was broken. All she wanted was Papa back. I did too. We'd been really close; he understood me. We were opposites. I was shy and timid. He was loud and out going. I sighed and take Nana's hand. As we were walking to her bedroom I tried to think of what to say as Nana continued prattling along about what's new. When she was finally in bed, I sat down right next to her and murmured, "Nana, it's me, Roxxi."
She looked at me confusingly and then, "Yes baby girl, I know who are." I glanced at her again and realized that she was out of it; she was in one of her lucid moments. "You should rest Nana." I got up to leave, but she pulled me back onto the bed, "Won't you give me a hug goodnight?"
I smiled and gave her a hug. As I was pulling away, she took hold of my face with her hands and quietly whispered, "No matter what or who I forget, always remember, that I love you. G'night."
As I pulled on my pj's and climbed into bed, I silently said a prayer to the stars and to whoever was listening, for Nana and Andrew.
wow. I am so proud of myself for finally getting a chapter out(: Well, please review and tell me what you think. I know it's going slow, but don't worry, I am going to be updating a lot more. This chapter is basically a draft. I went over it and edited it, but I'm not sure I got all of my mistakes. I'm having some trouble with my tense, so please bear with me; I usually don't, but for some reason I keep going between present and past. It's irritating! Anywhoo, the next chapter will be up next week. Please be patient with me.

The Post reports that Gov. Bill Ritter said, “We thought that people would be willing to pay 3 cents on a dollar candy bar.” While I do not know who the “we” to whom he refers is, I do know that I am not a part of the “people” to whom he refers.
Why is our governor so reticent, reluctant and reclusive about bringing it out in the open and letting we, the people, vote on it? Is that not what we are supposed to do on any tax increase, instead of hiding it, obfuscating it and deceiving us about it? That’s what happened with the vehicle “fee” that is a de facto tax to supposedly fix our roads.
Governor, take care, lest you fritter away the good will of even we Democratic taxpayer/voters, as our re-election decision for you is less than a year away now.

Re: “Governor’s proposal to tax candy and soda,” Nov. 18 letter to the editor.
A 3 cent per dollar tax on a non-essential food products hardly constitutes a major infringement of personal liberty, as letter-writer Gina Liggett suggests. Such hysterical proclamations would be laughable were they not so utterly out of proportion to the matter at hand. Keeping in mind that we’re in the midst of a serious recession, and the state budget shortfall is profound, I hardly think Gov. Bill Ritter’s proposal is unreasonable, much less arrogant.
Would you rather pay a few pennies more for a candy bar and have services such as restaurant health inspectors, bridges that don’t fall down, and at least a marginally educated populace? Or is the idea of spending a bit of money for the public good too much?

You can buy mole mixes but they are usually high in fat. This version is not, and a blender makes it easy to prepare. Instead of traditional turkey or chicken, this recipe pairs mole with creamy pinto beans. Eat it with salad and rice, fresh polenta, whole-wheat tortillas, or use as a filling for enchiladas.
Food as MedicineThe tomatoes in this recipe provide lycopene, a potent antioxidant that has been found to be protective against colorectal, prostate, breast, endometrial, lung and pancreatic cancers.
Mole Sauce:
3 large tomatoes, chunked (OR about 2 cup canned, drained tomatoes from a 28-oz. can, or 1/4 cup tomato paste and 2/3 cup water)
1/2 cup vegetarian broth
1 green pepper, seeded and diced
3 tablespoons each unsweetened organic cocoa and roasted sesame seeds (or 1 1/2 tablespoons tahini)
2 tablespoons masa harina (Mexican corn tortilla flour)
2 tablespoons raisins
1 1/2 tablespoons good, dark chile powder (preferably ancho chile powder)
3 cloves garlic, peeled
1 teaspoons each salt and sugar or alternate
1/2 teaspoons ground anise
1/4 teaspoons ground coriander
1/8 teaspoons cinnamon
Dash each of pepper and ground cloves or allspice
1 1/2 cups vegetarian broth
3 cans (or 4 1/2 cups cooked) pinto beans, drained
Note: If you are serving this with rice, put a pot of long grain rice on to cook before starting the recipe.
1. In a blender, mix all of the ingredients except the last 1 1/2 cups of broth and the beans. Blend until very smooth. Add the remaining broth and blend again.
2. Pour the sauce over the beans in a nonstick pot or skillet and simmer, covered, for 15-20 minutes. Variation: Mole sauce (simmered first for 15-20 minutes) can also be served over browned seitan, tofu, tempeh, reconstituted textured vegetable protein chunks, or your favorite cooked vegetarian "cutlet."

Recipe from "20 Minutes to Dinner" by Bryanna Clark Grogan (The Book Publishing Co., 1997)Green Bay Swimming Teams Cruise Past Valpo
By: Ryan Hartwig (@RyanHartwig)
GreenBayPhoenix.com
GREEN BAY, Wis. (GreenBayPhoenix.com) - In their final meet prior to departing for their annual winter training trip in Venice, Fla., the Green Bay men's and women's swimming and diving teams picked up dual victories over Horizon League foe Valparaiso Saturday afternoon at the Dorschel Natatorium.
Both Green Bay squads had a winner in 12 of the meet's 14 swimming events, as the Phoenix women earned a 151-98 victory and the men won 157-87.
Coming off a record-breaking performance at the Iowa Hawkeye Invitational last weekend, sophomore Kendra Rottier (Green Bay, Wis.) won three events for the Phoenix women on Saturday. Rottier began her day with a win in the 1000-yard freestyle (10:38.59) before taking the 200 butterfly (2:09.38) and aiding a victory in the meet-closing 200 free relay (1:40.12).
Junior Emilee Harry (Sheboygan, Wis.) was also part of three wins for the Phoenix women, joining Rottier in the 200 free relay, while also winning the 100 free (53.59) and swimming on the victorious 200 medley relay squad (1:50.88) in the meet's opening event.
Other multi-event winners on the women's side were senior Amy Burback (Waunakee, Wis.) and junior Heather Bodin (Maple Grove, Minn.). Burback placed first in both the 100 breaststroke (1:06.75) and the 500 freestyle (5:10.82), while Bodin took the 200 free (1:58.55) and the 200 IM (2:11.61).
On the men's side, freshman Ben Loeffelholz (Dubuque, Iowa) won a pair of individual events, taking home wins in the 200 free (1:48.91) and 100 butterfly (53.84). Classmate Ryan Korslin (Wisconsin Rapids, Wis.) and sophomore Robert Miner (Madison, Wis.) were also two-time winners, as both were part of the winning 200 medley relay (1:37.00), while Korslin won the 100 breaststroke (59.82) and Miner took the 500 free (4:54.36).
Sophomore Cole Hackney (Highlands Ranch, Colo.) also earned a pair of wins for the Phoenix men, leading off the winning 200 free relay (1:28.15) and also touching in first in the 100 free (48.42).
Despite only competing against themselves, the Green Bay divers also turned a number of strong performances on Saturday. Men's senior Daniel Pogue (Chisholm, Minn.) accumulated a personal best score of 347.25 in the 3-meter event, while junior Mitchell Spaeth (Fredonia, Wis.) also posted a career best 315.45 on the high board.
On the women's side, sophomore Carrie Dinelli (Northbrook, Ill.) was consistent on both boards, scoring a 234.90 on the 1-meter and a 233.25 on the 3-meter. Dinelli's 1-meter total was the highest of her collegiate career.
After finishing finals next week, the Green Bay men's and women's swimming and diving squads will depart for their annual training trip in Venice, Fla., on Monday, Jan. 2 and will return on Wednesday, Jan. 11. The Phoenix teams will compete in a dual meet with Illinois Wesleyan after arriving in Florida on Jan. 2.

Mayor Jim West: Older daddy type seeks city's forgiveness; be butch, No PNP
Anti-gay Spokane mayor Jim West has announced that he won't be stepping down from his mayoral duties, despite child molestation allegations and claims that he offered gifts, including jobs at City Hall, to lure young men on Gay.com.
According to AP reports, this morning West asked Spokane residents for their understanding and to accept his apology. He didn't elaborate as to what he was apologizing for, but we think it has something to do with claims that he shaved ten years off his online age, and ten pounds off his "x-pics."
Embattled Spokane Mayor Won't Resign [AP via WashingtonPost.com]
"How may times do the anti-gay force guys have to get caught in gay trysts before everybody just realizes they're all gay. If you want to meet gay dudes, start cruising the anti-gay buffet, because it's out there baby.

I looked through the anthology in the store, looks pretty useful. If only I'd had that when making my Ubese character.
Color pictures of every alien in the book!
I bought the Rebellion Era Sourcebook about a week ago, just because it looked like an interesting read. Very much worth the money, I've GOT to get my hands on the other sourcebooks now;)
Picked up SW Gamer #5 too. I was impressed with #6 but #5 is even better so far. Maybe that's just because it has a villian theme to it....
I've enjoyed those two issues so much I've decided to subscribe to it....

Dayton-area companies looking for subcontractor work on the Hollywood Dayton Raceway project will soon get a good look at bidding opportunities.
Penn National Gaming and Turner Construction Co., which was chosen as the construction manager for the project, will hold a community outreach event on Nov. 15 from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. at the Ramada Plaza Hotel on Wagner Ford Road in Dayton. The event is geared toward local companies including minority-owned, women-owned and veteran-owned businesses.
In an invitation to potential subcontractors, Turner and Penn say upcoming bid opportunities include excavation, grading, site utilities, foundations and structural steel work.
Bob Tenenbaum, a spokesperson for Penn National, said the event agenda is still being finalized, but it will cover general project information, basic scheduling (when bid packs can be expected), the prequalification process and the introduction of key project team members. The Dayton Area Chamber of Commerce Minority Business Partnership and The South Central Ohio Minority Supplier Development Council will also be part of the event.
RSVP’s should be sent to Kathleen Duesing at kduesing@tcco.com or (513) 721-4224.
New York-based Turner will run the project out of its Cincinnati office, Tenenbaum said.
No date has been set for the groundbreaking because Penn National is still waiting for the Ohio Racing Commission to finalize the rules allowing relocation of racetracks and to act on its application to relocate the company’s Toledo track to Dayton.
The "racino" — which will feature video slots and harness racing — is expected to create 1,000 jobs locally.
Completion is scheduled for some time in 2014, the same time frame that Penn National had when the project was announced, Tenenbaum said.
The $200 million project will be located on the site of an abandoned Delphi Automotive plant near Wagner Ford and Needmore roads in North Dayton.Thanks! Why are you flagging this item?

SOURCE: "The Action of Lust," in Such Is My Love: A Study of Shakespeare's Sonnets, The University of Chicago Press, 1985, pp. 155-88.
In the following excerpt, Pequigney observes the mechanisms of lust in Shakespeare's Sonnets 127-32 and 144-7.
Possibly no single poem in Shakespeare's sonnet sequence is more imperative for understanding it holistically than Sonnet 129, "The expense of spirit." This key sonnet defines the central theme of Part II as lust, [and] sheds light on its arrangement of sonnets. . . . This sonnet is the third one of Part II, and the first two—127 and 128—prepare the way for it in the course of introducing the secondary subject of the Sonnets, the liaison with the mistress.
The protagonist is already infatuated with her in Sonnet 127. Nothing is said about how or when they met. He does not address her directly here but launches into that stock-in-trade...Note: To protect the privacy of our members, e-mail addresses have been removed from the archived messages.

The word for cat sounds the same regardless of the language family--Uralic, Indo European, Hamitic/Nubian, Semitic, Basque, Chinese....so many different languages, but not all languages call a cat what sounds like the word 'cat' or they call it a puss. But why is a cat called cat or puss in different language groups around the world? And how did you pick your cat's name--or your dog's name? For example, in Arabic a kitten is a kitt, and a cat is a khatt, pronounced 'cat' but with the 'kh' sound like a 'k' but further back in the throat. And a cat in so many languages is either a puss/pussy or a cat/kitti. You also may wish to check out how cats 'talk' in different languages, "What Do Cats Say in Different Languages?"
Here's the history of cat names. Look at the origin in ancient times for the word 'cat.' We often call a cat 'puss' as in the children's story titled Puss 'N Boots. The word 'puss' used for 'cat' comes from the ancient Egyptian word 'pasht,' meaning cat. It was pronounced in Egypt, Persia, and all over the ancient Middle East as "Pishk" east of the Nile and "Pasht" west of the Nile. And today the word survives as Pishik in Yiddish and modern Persian (Farsi). Was there once a universal language to refer to a cat, whether the cat breed was domesticated or wild?
It comes from a proto language that once included Indo-European and also Afro-Asiatic (Hamitic/Semitic). We often call a cat 'puss'or pussy cat. Guess how old that word for cat or cat's names is? Pash and kat come from the Indo-European languages, but in some Semitic languages or in other tongues from different language groups, a cat also is called a cat or a khat or a qat or a pasht. But how did the Samoan word for cat, a pusi come into being? Or Ilocano:(Phillipine dialect) word pusa for pussy cat?
Pasht, for cat, later evolved to Bast and then to Bastet, another cat-headed goddess in Egypt. In ancient Iraq and Persia (Iran) the word for cat was Pishik. In Arabic cat is kitt and khatte. See how the word for cat, held in high esteem and worshipped in the ancient middle east, is pronounced the same--either cat or pus (pishk) in Indo European, Semitic languages, Hamitic, Basque, and other languages.
Some of the words for cat point to a proto-language spoken 10,000 years ago in which a lot of people had the same word for 'cat.' Chai is the Chinese word for 'cat'. So the word for cat could be used in languages that existed before Indo-European or Hamitic-Semitic language groups were around. Even the non-Indo European Basque word 'catua' for cat or the Hamitic Nubian word for cat, 'katiska' seems to put emphasis on the sound of 'cat.'
Here's the word for cat in other languages
Persian: Pushak (Pishik)
Old Yiddish: Pishika (teenage female cat, sometimes used to call someone a teenager) Modern Yiddish: ketzl, katz; a kitten is a ketzleh; a Pisha is a teenage male cat.

Integrated oil behemoth Exxon Mobil Corporation (
XOM
) on Thursday said its second quarter profit surged 84% from last
year, aided by higher oil selling prices and an improvement in its
refining business.
The Irving, TX-based company reported second quarter net income
of $7.56 billion, or $1.60 per share, compared with $4.09 billion,
or 85 cents per share, in the year-ago period.
On average, Wall Street analysts expected a smaller profit of
$1.46 per share for the quarter.
Exxon said its output rose 8% in the period, while profit in its
refining business more than doubled from last year.
Exxon shares rose 36 cents, or +0.6%, in premarket trading
Thursday.
The Bottom Line
We had removed shares of XOM from our "recommended" July 31,2008,
when shares traded at $84.38. The company has a dividend yield of
2.89%, based on last night's closing stock price of $60.91. The
stock has technical support in the $55 price area. If the stock can
firm up, we see overhead resistance around the $64 price level. We
would remain on the sidelines for now.

Well, it’s not completely free. To pay for the JiWire-powered service, the airlines are planning on running it as an ad-supported system. The hardware and software installed by third-parties will direct you to the Skytown Center online catalog. These retailers and advertisers would then cover the cost of your Wi-Fi connection.

The participants are set for two college football bowl games that generated an overall economic impact to the region of $30 million in 2010, according to the San Diego Bowl Game Association.
For the Bridgepoint Education Holiday Bowl on Dec. 28, the game pits the University of California Golden Bears against the University of Texas Longhorns. Cal finished the regular season with a 7-5 record, including a 4-5 mark in the Pacific 12 Conference. Texas was 7-5 overall, 4-4 in the Big 12 Conference.
In the San Diego County Credit Union Poinsettia Bowl on Dec. 21, the game features the Texas Christian University Horned Frogs vs. the Louisiana Tech University Bulldogs. TCU was 10-2 in the regular season and 7-0 in Mountain West Conference play, while Louisiana Tech was 8-4 overall and 6-1 in the Western Athletic Conference this season.
The nonprofit Bowl Game Association, which organizes the two postseason bowl games played annually at Qualcomm Stadium, announced the contestants this week.

The Philharmonic Wind Quintet of Berlin was founded in 1988, in the era of Herbert von Karajan. The ensemble has constantly received musical inspiration and stimulation from the Berlin Philharmoniker’s exceptionally productive and influential musical partnerships, with Karajan and his successors as principal conductor, Claudio Abbado and Sir Simon Rattle. As members of the orchestra, they have naturally also benefited from collaboration with the other great conductors of this period, from Leonard Bernstein, Carlos Kleiber and Sir John Barbirolli, by way of Günter Wand, Carlo Maria Giulini, Bernard Haitink and Riccardo Muti, to James Levine and Daniel Barenboim, to mention only a few.
Audiences worldwide are constantly astonished by the Philharmonic Wind Quintet’s variety of expression, its spectrum of tonal colours, and the stylistic assurance of its interpretations. Listeners and critics agree that the ensemble has succeeded in virtually redefining the sound of the classical wind quintet. Along with the entire breadth of the quintet literature, the ensemble’s repertoire includes works for augmented forces, for example the sextets by Janáček and Reinicke and the septets by Hindemith and Koechlin. In recent years, its collaborations with the pianists Stephen Hough, Jon Nakamatsu, Lars Vogt and Lilya Zilberstein have assumed increasing importance.
In addition, the members of the Philharmonic Wind Quintet have stepped up their teaching activities, and they have a special commitment to the youth orchestra system of Venezuela.
Henning Trog – Marion Reinhard
For 21 years the Berlin Philharmonic Wind Quintet performed unchanged in its original founding membership. Now, however, founding bassoonist Henning Trog has announced his retirement. After nearly 50 years performing on the world's most important stages, a full 41 of those years as a member of the Berlin Philharmonic itself, Henning has decided to turn his attention in the future to the nurturing and training of outstanding young bassoonists and chamber musicians around the world. A musician's musician and a veritable pillar of the ensemble, Henning Trog remains a true role model for all "Philharmoniker".
Naturally the challenge of replacing the irreplaceable is great. The quintet is delighted therefore to announce that Berlin Philharmonic colleague Marion Reinhard has become the ensemble's new bassoonist. With her own extensive wind quintet experience, as well as her years of membership in the Berlin Philharmonic, her appointment promises artistic continuity and the preservation of a unique sound. The ensemble looks forward to this exciting new artistic collaboration.Man Of The Century synopsis.‹ Back to Herrick surname

 up with me.”
Altman certainly worked at a tremendous pace during the 1970s, completing more than a dozen features. And they—the box office, the studios, the less broad-minded critics—certainly caught up with him as the 1980s began, driving him further than ever from the Hollywood system after Popeye (1980) underperformed and H.E.A.L.T.H. (1980) didn’t perform at all. Altman spent most of the eighties exploring the possibilities of video, producing and directing plays, and adapting stage works into low-budget movies. He didn’t return to full glory until The Player in 1992, an acerbic Hollywood satire that combined his nontraditional style—bravura zooms, overlapping sound, self-reflexive gestures—with a funny and suspenseful plot. He has remained a vigorous player ever since, with movies as varied as the epic Short Cuts (1993), the peculiar Prêt-à-porter (1994), and the popular Gosford Park (2001).
All this notwithstanding, the seventies remain Altman’s most successful decade, starting with M*A*S*H (1970) and McCabe and Mrs. Miller (1971) and peaking with Nashville (1975). His most idiosyncratic pictures of this period, from Images (1972) to Quintet (1979), are so wildly adventurous that it’s hard to imagine them having come from the American film industry, and impossible to imagine them being made with big-studio support today.
Not that American movies were as aesthetically tame between the late 1960s and the middle 1970s as they generally were before that time and have been since. The churning sociopolitical currents of the sixties, questioning traditional ideas in arenas from sex to civil rights, gave studios the notion that there were money and prestige to be gained by breaking cinema’s classical rules. This touched off a wave of exploratory filmmaking that was characterized at its most exciting by the improvisational urgency of Easy Rider (1969), the fierce genre revisionism of The Wild Bunch (1969), and the transcendental mysteries of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), among others. Pictures like these paved the way for Altman’s long-gestating originality to reach theatrical screens; and his diminishing clout after Nashville also took place in a wider cinematic context, as Jaws (1975) spewed gigantic profits and mass-marketed blockbusters became almost every studio exec’s ideal. It’s striking to recall that 3 Women came out the same year as Star Wars—and it’s far from surprising that the latter film became Hollywood’s new financial and cultural touchstone, as America moved toward a more conservative orientation, one that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg tapped into with uncanny precision.
Altman stood with the bravest filmmakers of the pre-Reagan years, and 3 Women stands with his boldest achievements of that remarkable time. He received a green light from Twentieth Century Fox not only without a finished screenplay but with an expressed desire to make the entire movie without one. He had literally dreamed up the project during a night of tossing and turning as his wife lay seriously ill in a hospital bed. While his dreams that night didn’t provide the film’s story, they gave him the specific vision of making a film called 3 Women starring Shelley Duvall and Sissy Spacek, set in the California desert, and centering on the theft of someone’s personality. He was raring to get started as soon as he woke up.
The first step was developing a fifty-page treatment with writer Patricia Resnick, who had to work Altman’s flyaway ideas into some kind of linear form. Next he got support from Fox, which was still hoping the maverick director would cook up another money-spinner like M*A*S*H. Then he headed for Palm Springs with his dream cast (so to speak) of Duvall and Spacek, plus Janice Rule as the third woman of the title. The dialogue—including Duvall’s ditzy chatter about color schemes and dating tips—was partly improvised, in keeping with the mood Altman hoped to evoke, at once dramatically elusive, thematically suggestive, and aesthetically controlled.
The finished product was well received, earning important awards—best actress for Duvall at the Cannes Film Festival and best supporting actress for Spacek from the New York Film Critics Circle—and garnering enough enthusiastic reviews to revive Altman’s career after the critical and commercial failure of Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull’s History Lesson (1976), his previous picture.
When asked whether he considers himself an “auteur” director, Altman has said he is to some degree a primary creator, in the sense implied by that term, and to some degree a “filter,” considering ideas offered by others as filmmaking proceeds. For a deeply personal project like 3 Women, his own instincts clearly take first place. Yet his dream would not have been effectively realized if he hadn’t been able to tune many collaborators in to his own intuitive wavelengths. This in itself makes 3 Women a quintessential specimen of Altman cinema, propelled by evanescent reveries of his own and inventive contributions from cast and crew.
In the end, 3 Women emerged as such a seamless weave of image, sound, story, and character that no plot summary can do it justice. Ideally, it should be watched and pondered more than once, since many moviegoers find the film so utterly outside the cinematic frameworks they’re familiar with that they wonder if its tenuous narrative (especially the deliberately indefinite ending) has passed them by, or isn’t really there in the first place.
The narrative is not only present, it is central to the film’s impact. This does not mean, however, that Altman hoped a conventional story would somehow emerge from the inchoate notions he had when principal photography began. “I’m trying to reach toward a picture that’s totally emotional, not narrative or intellectual,” he once told a journalist, “where an audience walks out and they can’t say anything about it except what they feel.” 3 Women doesn’t quite match that ambition, but no Altman movie comes closer.
Woman One is Pinky, played by Spacek as a stranger in a strange land who has traded the heat and dust of Texas for the heat and dust of California while remaining as clueless about life as she’s apparently always been. Woman Two is Millie, played by Duvall as a permanent adolescent who bats her eyes at every male in sight and sports a self-confidence so utterly misplaced that their sneering indifference never makes a dent. Woman Three is Willie, played by Rule as an enigmatic artist who paints morbid frescoes—of reptilian women and a threatening, dominating man—while waiting for her pregnancy to come to term. The only important male is Willie’s husband, Edgar, who spends his time swaggering, womanizing, and target shooting behind the local Dodge City saloon. The story moves through various plot developments on the way to its enigmatic ending, which presents a parody of American family life as desolate as it is surreal.
What does it all mean? That’s for every viewer to decide. In the final analysis, 3 Women is precisely what it sets out to be: a dream, full of images seen through physical veils like water and mirrors, metaphysical veils like the mercurial nature of meaning and understanding, and the stylistic veils of Altman’s desire to create a cinema rooted in allusion and emotion rather than surface realities caught with the camera’s allegedly objective eye.
Altman experts have tried to sum up his overall approach in various pithy phrases. Robert Kolker speaks of “radical surfaces,” for instance, while Robert T. Self invokes “subliminal reality.” While both formulations are useful as far as they go, 3 Women eludes all efforts at definitive interpretation. That’s what makes it essential viewing for moviegoers adventurous enough to follow Altman’s audacious quest for a new kind of moviemaking.

Using an American iPhone in Europe… without going broke
Note: This article was updated in March 2015 with new rates and information.
If you’re an American smartphone user getting ready to take a trip to Europe, you’ve likely been warned about using your phone abroad. After all, most American phone carriers’ rates for international calling and data use can be confusing, and misunderstanding your usage or phone setup could be a very costly mistake.
I recently returned from two weeks in Europe, one spent in Paris and one in Venice. This was a work trip, during which I visited about 90 hotels for EuroCheapo. I brought along my laptop, but what to do with my iPhone? Was there an economical way to use it in France and Italy? Should I pay for one of the international data packages offered by AT&T (my carrier)? Should I just leave the thing in New York?
Connecting with friends and travel companions is obviously aided by sending text messages. Those, however, don’t always work with American cell phones and, if they do, require an international phone connection. And if you turn on your connection, you could receive phone calls from home — which will cost you. But I’m getting ahead of myself…
I realized that my iPhone could be handy..

Great advice! We’re leaving Monday next week for Europe (UK, France & Paris) for 2 weeks. I have AT&T and the hubs has Verizon. We just want the ability to surf the web as we’re walking around and use google maps. We can wait for hotspots to check email but we don’t need the ability to talk on the phone. Should we just upgrade our date plans to the international plan? Will that give us access to the web and google maps as we’re wandering the streets of Florence?↓.
All you need now is a wifi connection and you can call or text anyone who also has Viber (doesn’t need to be launched on the other phone to be notified of the incoming call)..
P.S. Going to Viber’s website, I notice that they also have an app for Droid, Windows Mobile, Blackberry, Nokia and Bada (whatever that is).↓
Hi,
Your right instead of using Voice calls it’s cheaper to use VOIP calls on Viber or Skype.
In some places WiFi costs money or it’s hard to find places that provide WiFi in Albania (for example)…
So better for you to buy a pre-paid international SIM card from rental SIM cards companies (I familiar with Xcomglobal and iPhoneTrip, but there are many others)…
It’s worth looking into:)↓

I’m not American but my experience can still be useful.
When I’m in the US it’s the same principle. The US carrier charges my carrier for roaming and in turn my carrier charges me.
So I switch off my iphone in the US, except for a few minutes per day to get any SMS sent to me when it was switched off. This is free.
I don’t think I’m charged if the phone rings only.
In Rome the best thing to do if you want easy wifi access is to buy a dirt cheap pay as you go phone to have an Italian SIM card. It’s the law there to ask for an Italian sim card so businesses don’t really have a choice.
In France, no problemo at Mac Donald’s (please eat somewhere else though), same thing in Great Britain, forget Mac Donald’s in Germany (you’ll need a German SIM card) but other places may work because the law doesn’t require a German SIM card to identify you. You’ll also be fine in the Netherlands. Ok that’s about all I know for Europe.
You have great cheap prepaid plans within the US I must say. Perfect for travelers. Here in France Iphones have to be unlocked after 3 months by Apple. The request is made through your carrier. So my Iphone is ready for your US carriers. That’s swell.↓
Mirabelle, you seem to have the type of info I need. My daughter is going to Paris for a month in June. She wants to be able to text and call home. She has an iphone. I’m planning to get a new phone under my plan for her for use here and I’m told I can have Apple “unlock” the older phone and she could use it in France. Is a simcard the best way to go? I see prepaid simcards through Orange etc… She also is familiar with Skype. I am however not. Without a simcard in the old phone could she use skype through free wifi? I saw an entry above that said “calling” through Skype is very cheap. What do you suggest? Thx. Glen↓
Well, indeed Skype is cheap but she’ll have to rely on wifi and the quality of calls may be bad sometimes. She can use Skype to call you on your landline (or mobile), so you don’t have to know Skype but calls from Skype to Skype are free I believe.
Skype uses wifi so I don’t think she’ll need a SIM card just to activate the phone.
If in doubt remove the SIM card, start the phone and try skype on the iphone at home. If it works in the US, it’ll work here since it’s a hardware issue.
Orange, SFR and Bouygues are the main cellphone providers in France but there are others who use the network of the 3 big ones but are often cheaper.
Pay as you go is pretty expensive in France, compared with some countries.
For instance the French post office has a SIM card with 5€ credit (I don’t know if you can buy it in post offices though).
Other option: shops offering lots of different SIM cards like Phoneo or The Phone House, not just the big 3 providers but also Virgin Mobile etc.
Be careful that the SIM card can be used for international calls (most of them can) and how much international calls and SMS cost. They should all be compatible with the Iphone if you just need it to make calls and text.↓
I’m hoping someone can help me, as I’m horribly un-technical when it comes to my iPhone. I live in the US and my mobile phone plan is with Verizon, but I’d like to be able to use my phone in Europe to make and receive calls as well as texts whilst on holiday. What’s the most cost effective way of doing this without having to lease some “travel phone” from Verizon?↓
Get GoogleVoice and point your US cell phone number to it. It has the capacity to convert voice to text and you will receive an email transcript. With your phone in Airplane mode in Europe, connect to the Internet via WiFi and get your email. Then using Skype, you can return all the calls. VERY useful and easy!! BTW, GoogleVoice is FREE.↓
I’m studying abroad from Feb to May in Austria (plus traveling to other countries), and from a friend who studied in England and Greece (two separate semesters) told me that getting Skype credit was a great idea. So, I plan on using my iPhone as a glorified iTouch for Skyping home (both my Mom’s computer and my Nana’s home phone) and getting a local cell so I can call/text my classmates.
I’m not even going to attempt to jailbreak my phone, because I’m terrified I’d mess something up. It’s better than what I did when I was in London for 10 days. I got AT&T’s plan, and only had my Nana and Mom call me, and the bill was $500. Granted, I believe I went over my text limit, but either way, it was ridiculously expensive, and I’m not taking that chance again.↓
Most mobile companies should allow a locked iphone to use an overseas sim if you give them plenty of notice. I’ve heard AT&T & T-Mobile do this now in America, and Australian Telecoms allow this as well.
You can also head down to the nearest tech area of a major city and get the iphone unlocked.
Both scenarios should allow an overseas sim.↓
Be really careful with T-Mobile. They tell you that even if data roaming is turned off, you could still connect and you’ll have to pay. There are TWO data roaming things on my phone that must be disabled – Data roaming and Use packet data. We found that out after our trip to Munich:↓
Susan — I’m sure all the scenarios do get confusing. Will you have access to Wi-Fi? If yes, then set your phone to Airplane Mode. That cuts it off from cellular networks, and you only can use Wi-Fi.
You’ll have access to email. You can make calls if you get some kind of VOIP calling account, like Skype. Get a $10 credit, download the app to your phone, and you are good to go. Of course, no one will be able to call you unless you happen to be connected.↓
I am going to Ireland in November…I am so confused by reading all of this (senior citizen). I have a 3g iPhone and I get it that I can turn off my email but isn’t there a way to suspend my text, voicemail for 2 weeks? I just want to be able to check in daily with my husband. Thank you as any insight you can give me would be awsome.↓. It will cost me Incoming calls from the US: $ 1.15 / min. It will cost me: Outgoing to a Landline: $ 1.45 / min. Outgoing to a Cell Phone: $ 1.70 / min. Incoming text messages are free and outgoing are $0.60/message.↓
also I’m going to see him next week in Germany and Switzerland.
The plan: 1- airplane mode 2- buy $10 text and $25 lowest mb data plan = $35 3- use his phone for local german calls (hotels, emergencies etc)
This way I can keep it in airplane/wifi only for most of the time, switch over o regular when I reaaaally need to text or check the internet, and I get the best of both worlds for $35 bucks. Yay.
Thanks for all the posts!↓
i currently speak to my brother who lives in Germany with a free app on my iPhone 4 called Heytell. It’s like a walkie-talkie, records a brief message then uses Internet – so it would only work via wifi if you have data disabled. But if you found wifi for a minute you can “call” them free. Also any messages that they have sent you would be waiting for you when you open the app. Just DONT set it to “push data,” or you’ll be using int. roaming.
Heytell for the wifi win in a quick pinch.↓
I am going to France and Morocco next month..I do have the skype app on my iphone as well as Skype on my Macbook..I know about the airplane mode and turning Wifi on..What I do not know…I have several peps I am meeting that live in Europe that I will need to meet up with /communicate..Is there a way to either check my messages briefly on my iphone so I can call them back on my skype or either get messages from my iphone number forwarded to my skype ?↓
OK, I get the Airplane ON mode and then using WiFi spots to use Skype scenario. But unless there is some basic point i’m misunderstanding, that will only serve for outgoing calls. Anyone needing to contact you i.e. for an emergency would not be able to reach you, unless by coincidence they were using skype just when you happened to be in a WiFi spot.↓
That is the danger of putting your phone in airplane mode and leaving it there. People trying to get ahold of you in an emergency will be out of luck. You can purchase a pay as you go phone for dirt cheap on any corner in most cities…why not just get one and give your family and friends the number in case? Also, if you need to make European calls to friends you can do it until the minutes card you purchased runs out.↓
I got a Google Voice number (it’s free). Before you leave, forward your cell to your Google Voice and it will record and transcribe all your calls and they will be available on the Internet for you to retrieve for free any time you are able to access the Internet. There’s no advantage in getting messages from the U.S. in real time because of the time difference.↓
If that’s all you need to do, I’d suggest getting the Skype iPhone app, and purchasing a $10 credit (lowest available) in Skype minutes. Make sure you set phone to Airplane mode, WiFi only. Worked perfectly for me in Prague.↓
I am traveling to and around Lesser Poland (southern section around Krakow) for a week. I have an iPhone 3GS and will bring my laptop. The two hotels in which I’m staying offer free WiFi. I want to call the US just 3 or 4 times. What’s the best/cheapest route for me? Anyone have experience with Eastern European countries in terms of calls, WiFi, etc.?↓
Rather than forward your calls to a US based land line, forward your phone to Google Voice. It gives you a new phone number and your calls are recorded and transcribed and accessible via the Internet. Google Voice is free. If you forward to a US land line, you’ll incur charges accessing your voice mail.
As for free wi-fi spots, as I mentioned earlier, just wander around with your internet enabled phone until you find one. Almost all the unsecured ones I found were on private (personal) wireless routers.↓
I am going to Spain soon and I called ATT to find out what my best options were….here is what I decided to do:
1. I purchased for $10 the International text plan. This allows me to SEND 50 texts from my phone to any US phone number while abroad. I am able to receive as many texts as my current plan allows (mine is 200/mo) at no additional cost. The only problem with this is that your phone cannot be in airplane mode to send/receive texts and therefore is open for incoming calls which will cost you whether you answer them or not. To avoid this, simply forward your cell phone number to a US based land line, and also do not forget to diable any fetch/push settings on your phone. Also, (unless you are on wifi) avoid opening any apps that require data streams to work such as maps, Google, etc….I would make sure the phone is in airplane mode before opening ANY apps just to be safe. You can always reconnect to wifi once you have put the phone in airplane mode.
2. As for making the few calls I will need to make, there are several options, but all require a wifi connection. Skype is good and offers inexpensive international rates, but I have found an app that actually gives you some limited minutes for free: TextFree with Voice. It’s a free app in the app store and you can load it up with minutes just by trying other apps it recommends. I have 140 minutes banked up with it right now and that will be MORE than enough for my 10 day trip. Again, the only caveat here is that you must be on wifi in order to use it.
If anyone knows of any free wifi spots in Sitges Spain, I’d love to hear about them!↓
I plan on using my iPhone 3GS for SpeechTrans (translation service) in France as well as using the phone of GPS. I will be using Skype for phone calls.
Since both the GPS and the translator require internet access, I assume I have to buy a data plan from AT&T. Any idea of how big a data plan I need to buy for eight days?↓
I will be cycling the French and Swiss alps with a buddy in September. The previous suggestions for inexpensively using my iphone4 are invaluable, and I appreciate the comments that you all have made.
One questions: I am sure I will be able to get by for the 5-week trip using the wifi only method for connectivity. However, once in a while my friend and I get separated and need to make a phone call to locate each other. Of course, the per minute charge for these calls would be high, but only infrequently used. In this situation the wifi-only method cannot be used. What changes should I make in my phone settings on the spot so that I can make the occasional direct phone call to his rented phone without inadvertently downloading emails and phone messages thereby racking up a huge bill?
By the way, any comments from cyclists would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks↓
I am in the UK right now and I have turned off my data roam, disabled my international roaming/international calls, turned fetch off, and put my phone in airplane mode with wifi enabled; however, under time (I think this is what it is called) it says usage and the number keeps going up even when I have the phone in airplane mode. I reset the data tracker and those numbers are staying at zero (for the data) why is that one usage section under settings /general stating usage time? I dont want to get hit with a hge bill, help!↓
Hi, We are in Germany now, in the Kaiserslautern area and have had no success with finding wi-fi hotspots that we don’t need to pay for just out and about. The hotels have it, but most restaurants don’t provide the free wi-fi here and so we have had no success with the plan of going to lunch connect to internet and check email. Very frustrating as I was hoping to use this method until the 5 came out in Oct. Instead I will be getting the 4 in the next couple of days so I have some sort of internet access.
hope you have better luck in different areas.↓
SajMom and Wes Smith, you guys realize that the version of your iPhone will have ZERO impact on free wifi networks available to you in any country, right? The only things that could impact your Internet access (aside from the obvious…free wifi networks being available) is your data plan through your cell provider and their coverage in the area that you are visiting.
And since AT&T is outrageously expensive overseas, it’s probably a much cheaper option to either live off of the free wifi (if you can cope with it) or jailbreak AND unlock your phone so you can purchase a SIM card (with a data plan, of course) for the country you’re visiting.
If you choose the 2nd option, you should research the SIM provider to make sure their coverage is good, etc. If, however, you keep your iPhone’s software up-to-date (most recent iOS and firmware), then there’s a good chance that you will NOT be able to unlock your phone for usage on other cell provider’s networks.↓
Before leaving for Italy, I was informed by an AT&T representative that I would not be charged for incoming calls from the US to Italy because it was a US number calling a US number. I repeated what the person said to me because it sounded unreal. And it was. I came home to a bill of $118.00 of calls because I would call home and tell them to call me back because it was no charge. Just want to put this out there for anyone who so you don’t get mis-informed. I did purchase a text package for outgoing text messages. Incoming text messages were no charge. I think……↓
All good suggestions. Wifi is not quite as ubiquitous in Paris as in London. In London St. Pancras RR Station has wifi everywhere and free! In Paris, Starbucks, McDonalds, KFC though they don’t all work seamlessly. Each mairie (town hall) in each arrondissement (district) has free wifi during the day which often works. Some cafes have it as do some large hotel lobbies but very variable. Download a wifi finder app (free) from the App store. They are flat files and do not search real time wifi but most are up to date and worth a try. Once you are on wifi the iphone works very well with Skype. If you have an unlocked older phone (I have a Nokia) you can buy a sim card for about $10 or $20 in Paris (or London but works only in the country you buy it). Beware though that the rates both within France, EU and to the US are not cheap. Better than AT&T but much more than Skype. On the other hand you have a phone and a local number.↓
HI Enjoyed your thoughts on using an iphone in Europe ( I’m planning a trip for spring 2012 ).
A very scary thought that I could incur charges while my phone is ‘fetching’ and ‘pushing’ while I sleep, you offer some good ideas ( airplane ) etc., dumbing the iphone down to an ipod touch works for me as i use skype alot and can survive — I think — with FB and Skype. Did I read somewhere that skype and FB were merging? Maybe Skype credit for those calls would be nice too.
We’ll see. What I do rely on is internet access to get information needed while traveling.
Anyway … no I liked your idea about airplane mode. The trip is costly enough↓
The suggestions I have read have been very educational. I hope to use my Iphone using the tips suggested above in a few days during my European trip, but I need some help.
My situation doesn’t require that I call the US from Europe often, but be able to call and receive calls from numbers in Europe. We have rented a few apartments during our stay. I need to provide the owners with a contact number, and call them when we arrive.
Do I just buy Skype credit? Can I receive calls or do I need a number?
Do I get an online number with Skype? If so, I have to make it a US number and then am I, and the apartment owners, making long distance calls and wasting both my and their money?
I have read suggestions about getting a prepaid phone once I arrive, but as we are traveling to several different countries, this means changing SIM cards each time and still doesn’t give me a reliable number to be reached at.
Being able to communicate with my group in Europe would be nice, but doesn’t have to be in real time so Skype credit and online resources should work fine. Being able to call back home would be welcome, but i can get a calling card for that if neccessary. Having the ability to call and receive calls from my European hosts is my dilemna. Thank you for any help you can provide.↓
Just talked to AT&T. The airplane mode seems great unless you want to receive text, which might be important to you if you have someone in the country you are visiting needing to text you. Skype text will only work if you are in wifi. For $10 you can get 50 outgoing text and incoming text are on your normal plan (so I’m told). But airplane mode won’t work…here’s what ATT told me to do…turn fetch off and only fetch email when in WIFI, call fwd phone to US number…like house phone…skype etc, google voice etc. Turn data roaming off. So you can get text but won’t be hit with international roaming for calls or data. Should work. Any thoughts to the contrary?
Also, I wonder if people in the foreign country could send a text to a google voice number? Again, you won’t see it unless in Wifi so the text international plan seems nice.↓
Yes, Google Voice has text sending and receiving. The nice thing is, it keeps your texts so you can read them at your leisure.
I wonder if the people who post on here about want to be able to get texts in real time realize there’s a big time difference between North America and Europe? It would mean possibly getting texts when you’re sleeping and being woken up. Likewise, the other direction for the person you’re texting.
The last thing I want to do in Europe is having my phone ring or get a text while I’m in a museum or out enjoying the sites.↓
My spendthrift husband bought the AT&T data plan for an upcoming trip to France. Based on posts here I tried out the airplane wi-fi option at home on my iphone3 and it works perfectly for allowing wi-fi internet access but blocking text and data. My hubby will think I’m brilliant and my Facebook dependent teen will be able to keep in touch on the trip too. Thank you!!!!!↓
To pay almost nothing for your outgoing calls from Europe to the US, follow the directions about turning off data roaming and fetch and then turn on airplane mode. This will turn off wi-fi but then turn wi-fi back on, leaving the phone in airplane mode. Hot spots are everywhere, including in McDonalds. Use Skype for your voice connection and, Voila, you have very inexpensive outgoing voice calling without fear of other charges.↓
We are travelling to France and would like to use the iPhone 3G for occasional calls, but especially would like to use the map app/GPS to supplement paper maps when we’re driving. Do we need an international plan for that? I don’t think ti would work if the phone is on airplane mode. Any ideas? I think renting a GPS is quite pricey. Thanks!↓
Thanks, all, for the helpful advice. I’m still looking for a little clarification, though, if someone can oblige me.
The last time I went to Europe, cell phones may have existed but they were probably still big as bricks. This summer I’m headed to Germany for four weeks and would like to take my iPhone 3GS for the convenience of keeping in touch with family and friends via Skype, Facebook, etc. (using Airplane Mode with WiFi on, thanks to your excellent suggestions).
The group I’m going with plans to buy cheap phones and SIM cards when we get to Germany and use those to keep in touch. If I go ahead and get an AT&T international plan for my iPhone… and here’s my dumb question… will they be able to call me without using up all their minutes? It would be a local call for them, effectively, yes? I don’t mind joining the bandwagon and getting the PAYG phone, but it seems silly to have it PLUS the iPhone if a one-month international plan is going to cost me roughly the same.
Please advise, and point out any obvious logical flaws I’m not seeing. Thanks!↓
Squirrelhenge,
Why don’t you jailbreak and unlock your 3gs (free) and purchase a SIM card there. If your SIM card doesn’t include data, just disable data in the settings…then you can use data only when you’re connected to a wifi…so they can call you locally, and vice versa. If you’re using Skype, you could have your American phone number forwarded to your Skype number and your friends/family in the States can still reach you (on your phone) as if you were at home by using a local call. This is assuming you’re either connected to a wifi when they call, or data is included in your German SIM card. If you need more specific help with the jailbreak/unlock, post your iOS version and baseband version. And if you haven’t updated your phone recently, do NOT update. If you update, you might not be able to jailbreak and/or unlock (the important one) your phone. Jailbreaking /unlocking is not dangerous. If you run into issues, you simply put it in DFU mode and restore it….very simple. When you return from Germany, you can restore it and nobody will ever know it was jailbroken (including AT&T/Apple…not that it matters, since it’s not illegal to jailbreak). Or you can get an expensive international plan through AT&T.↓
I am headed to France for a vacation in a few weeks. I have 2 iphones – my original iphone3 which was configured for use with AT&T service, but now is disabled for cell usage. I still use it a little as an Ipod touch and wi-fi device and children are allowed to play with it :), and my replacement iphone4 which is currently my active cell phone on Verizon service. While in France, I will figure out some other way to make phone calls, I certainly don’t want to incur any roaming charges, and it sounds like my verizon phone won’t work at all anyway. But I would like to take advantage of wi-fi service where I can find it, to check email and so forth – perhaps to download travel maps and do some research, and so forth.
Am I better off to carry around the formerly at&t iphone3? or to carry around the iphone4/verizon in airplane mode with wi-fi enabled? Somehow the iphone3 seems safer since it is no longer associated with a phone number and service.
Are there any caveats? Such as possible scenarios where I could unwittingly rack up a bill that is larger than the cost of the trip?
Or is either of the scenarios unworkable for some reason?
thanks in advance for any feedback on this question.↓
Kay Casavant,
It really depends on how “connected” you want to be. If you don’t care if people are able to reach you, you can just take any of your iPhones and put it in airplane mode…then calls can be made/received via Skype (or other similar VoIP service) only when you are connected to a wifi service.
If you want to be reachable via at least some phone number at all times, you should jailbreak and unlock your old iPhone…then purchase a SIM card when you get to France. If your SIM card includes data, then you can always receive calls both with your French number and through Skype (you could have your American phone number forward calls to your Skype number so people can reach you with a local call). If your SIM card does NOT include data, then people will be able to reach you on your French number at any time, and on your Skype number only when you are connected to wifi.
FYI, there are some VoIP services that give you a phone number and allow FREE incoming calls, such as sipgate. Since it’s VoIP, the calls are sent over the Internet…so it doesn’t matter where you are in the world as long as you have an Internet (data) connection. If you sign up for that, you would need a VoIP app on your phone (I use one called fringe in combination with sipgate). Sipgate’s call quality is mediocre, and there is a lag (as there is with most VoIP services). But it’s FREE for incoming calls (and like 1 or 2 cents a minute for outgoing calls to US numbers…even though you’re in France). If you want simplicity though, go with Skype.↓
I agree with Tom, and I would go as far as saying: Don’t use your Iphone at all.
Bring your laptop and whenever you have free internet connection, make calls on Skype. Either Skype to Skype (free) or Skype Out (just a small charge). Here you can also do your email correspondence and browsing.
Then bring an old cellphone that has been “opened”. It must be a GSM phone, meaning a phone that has worked on the AT&T or T-Mobile system. The GSM system is everywhere in the world, except Japan. You cannot use a phone that has worked on Verizon, Sprint or Nextel.
Then, when you arrive in the country in Europe where you are going to spend the most time, buy a local SIM card and make inexpensive calls within the country you are in, or, at somewhat more expensive rates , country to country. You can also buy a “disposable” phone inexpensively.
Is this too complicated for you? Then pay the high charges from AT&T!!!!!!!!↓
Wow, I am heading to England and Scotland in August and have been trying to figure out a work around for the last month. These tips are super valuable.↓
I’m doing what Wayne stated. Works well for short term traveling or vacations.
AIRPLANE MODE is turned on to disable the cellular and WiFi radios. Then we only turn on the WiFi (via the settings menu of course) so the iPhone is now displaying an airplane where it used to display AT&T-(BARS) but the WiFi indicator is now on.
Now we see it’s time to travel around in search of open WiFi networks with your iPhone and connect to one. I cannot confirm what WiFI is currently available in europe but in Canada, certain cities have limited city-wide WiFi (within a certain geographical region) for about $7.00 a month. The cheapest AT&T data add on is $24.95 per handset. Are you doing the math?
Cellular Voice and Text Messaging will not work because we are in Airplane Mode…. However and we know if we turn off Airplane Mode the chances of our bill increasing exponentially is huge. Best workaround I found was to download the Skype App. Skype works by placing your voice call over the WiFi radio for almost free. It has a keypad just like the default iPhone keypad.
There are also free Apps from the App Store that allow text messaging over WiFi for free.
I paid approximately $7.00 for a month of WiFi service and $3.99 for a month of Skype last time I traveled abroad with my iPhone.
AT&T add-on data plans are $24.99-$199.99 depending on size.
AT&T International voice roaming is between roughly $.79 and $2.99 per minute depending on what International add-on plan you have selected.
AT&T Text Messaging abroad can be be between $.09 to $1.50 PER TEXT MESSAGE!
AT&T’s way requires you to get out your checkbook.
This way requires you to get to know your phones capabilities but saves you some ching !!!!!!!!!
Good Luck.
Hannah…….As for the Nokia unlock…..I’d call AT&T and ask them first. They’ve been known to give out unlock codes for specific phones if you tell them you’re moving for a few months. Keep asking.
The 6102i can be unlocked….google it.↓
I can’t speak to the iPad, as I don’t have one.
I have an AT&T 3G iPhone with the Skype app. It is not jailbroken. I was able to use it in Airplane mode, with wi-fi on and find a free wi-fi signal and call back to the United States. I was billed at the rate of $0.023 a minute, according to my call log. A 6 minute call from Italy cost me 20 cents. I have the Skype plan where I pay $10 as I go and it automatically recharges when it gets low.
I had Airplane mode on, wi-fi on (it defaults to off when you select airplane mode) and data transfer off. I just went to my wi-fi in settings and wandered around a neighborhood in Venice until I picked up an unlocked wi-fi router and made the calls.↓
So are you saying that if you use Skype on your Iphone3G or new Iphone when you are traveling that there is no international charge? Does you phone have to be on a particular setting to assure there are no charges involved, and I am assuming you must be in a WIFI area. Is this also true of the IPAD?↓
I have a 3G iPhone. I couldn’t connect on the Roma Wireless either. What I did was open by Settingsand turned on wi-fi in the Airplane mode. Then, while walking through Rome, I search for unlocked wireless routers and connected that way. Once I connected, I stopped and checked my mail and used Skype. Worked like a charm.↓
Depends on the iphone – if you have an older iphone, or a newer one with the appropriate older baseband, you can jailbreak it – AND you can unlock it to use a SIM card. That’s the reason I can’t, because my iphone 4 has the newer software (4.3.1) which can be jailbroken, but CAN’T be unlocked (yet), so I will have to use my iPad2 while there, since all ipads are unlocked, and can take SIM cards from Europe just fine. I’ve decided to use the iPad2, with local carrier SIM cards, and use skype to keep in touch with my office while away. Maybe they will figure out a software way to unlock my iphone before going in May, but I doubt it, and everyone has said to stay away from the “circuit board sandwich” sim cards and unlocking companies who promise to unlock your phone by using your IMEI numbers (which can easily be circumvented by Apple at any time). I’ll wait until a foolproof software unlocking program is developed, or, if not, just use my ipad exclusively while away.↓
yes you can use skype or google phones while in Europe on wi-fi without any additional cost from your carrier. Just pre-pay for your calls through there. Very cheap. make sure you aren’t using data roaming and all the other things. Wi-Fi only.
I’ve done it in France, Brussels, Netherlands, and Germany. (And probably India, but I don’t remember now as wi-fi isn’t as available to me when I travel there.)↓
That’s very simple look here↓
Dan – my iPhone had iOS 4.0.1 when I used “JailBreakMe.com”. This particular jailbreak also unlocked the phone automatically. I used a T-Mobil SIM card, and had no problem running MyWi. My phone could then become a wireless hotspot that my iPad and other computers, Macs and PCs, connected to via WiFi. No problem getting the iPad to connect to my iPhone’s WiFi network. I had no trouble back reinserting my ATT SIM card back in the US. I haven’t installed Skype on my iPad; I would think an iPhone would make a better Skype phone. I installed Skype on my iPhone in the US–any kind of installation will require some data downloading, and it’s much cheaper here. You can test Skype from the US, and if it works over WiFi here, it’ll work there. I’m not sure if the iPhone version of Skype can receive calls if you don’t leave Skype open with the phone on. If you just want to use your iPad, you don’t need to jailbreak it. They’re sold unlocked in the US, aren’t they? So you could use a European SIM card with a data plan in it right out of the box, if you find a non-contract data plan.↓
Byrrno, Thanks so much for the useful information.
I just jailbroke my iphone 4 (4.3.1) yesterday with the new jailbreak – works just fine. My question is: This is not an unlock, and they haven’t released one yet. When you ONLY jailbreak your iphone (not unlock it) does that mean that using a SIM from overseas won’t work? (ie. does the unlock affect the phone itself, the SIM or both?). I’ve never quite understood this. Someone told me (or I read) that jailbreaking alone will not allow you to use another SIM card successfully, that you need to have an unlock (of the phone itself) in order to use a SIM card from another carrier. Thanks.↓
Just got back from Italy, using my iPhone in Airplane mode and picking up wi-fi hotspots. (when you put it in airplane mode, wi-fi is turned off, so you have to turn it back on again).
I went to my Settings, and searched for unlocked wi-fis as I walked through Rome and Venice. When I connected, I was able to check my email and use my Skype app to make calls.
My phone is not jailbroken or unlocked. I used it as it, just in Airplane Mode with wi-fi on.↓
Wayne, Thanks. That answers my concern about Skype, and lets me know I can get by with Skype, and not have to get a sim card for voice. Still leaves the burning question about getting data sim card while in Europe, and whether the hotspot wireless tethering will work between the iphone and the ipad. Hope to hear from anyone who may have tried.↓
I forgot to mention that while I was in Europe I forward ALL my calls to my Google Voice number which automatically transcribed messages and made them available to listen to on the web. My daughter used this the entire 9 months she was working in Europe. That way, you don’t have to have your phone on at all when people call you. You can just log on to Google Voice and check your messages. It worked great because of the time difference where actual calls would be impracticle.↓
Thanks for your comments.
When you said you used it as a hotspot, did you also mean you used the newly implemented hotspot wireless tethering between the iphone2 and an ipad? This is what I’m trying to achieve in Europe for my trip. I know you can install MyWi, but I don’t want to use it in the states, because ATT is monitoring its use, and may cancel my unlimited data plan for ATT, should they decide to intervene. However, were you able to use MyWi in Europe, with a wirelessly tethered ipad?
Also, usually just jailbreaking the phone doesn’t unlock it, so you can remove the micro-sim card and intall another in Europe. What program (s) did you use to jailbreak AND unlock your phone, and did you have any trouble re-installing your ATT micro-sim card once you returned to the states? Others have cautioned that 4.3 or 4.3.1 may not be as easy to get to re-initialize again, and some have encountered problems trying to get it to work correctly again (either jailbroken or not), so I don’t want to take a chance on “bricking” my phone once I return to the states. I am still under Apple warranty, but don’t know whether jailbreaking is really “legal” as far as Apple is concerned (it is supposed to be, but that doesn’t keep Apple from trying to prevent it, as they are constantly trying to do).
I know data plans vs voice minute plans are variable in Europe, but having a “true” hotspot feature that works with a European Sim card would negate the need to get a separate data card (and jailbreak), my ipad2. Data would then flow between devices, and I would only be charged for the total minutes/data, which is certainly reasonable. If I can’t figure out how to do this, I will probably just leave my iphone off while in Europe, and use my ipad with a data card sim by itself (and maybe use Skype for calls?).
Do you have to install Skype on your ipad before going to Europe to make it work, and will it work once you jailbreak it and install a European sim card?
Lots of questions, and hopefully, anyone who has experience can help. Thanks again for your very helpful comments. Dan↓
Dan – I used my iPhone 4, iOS 4.0.1, as a hotspot last summer. I jailbroke it in the US (which unlocked it too), and bought a non-apple store app, “MyWi” ($20). This app let me turn my iPhone into a hotspot that at least 5 WiFi devices could connect to when I had my cellular connection working for data. I was using a T-Mobil SIM card, so ATT was not in the picture. I don’t think there is a good jailbreak yet for iOS 4.3, but one seems imminent. The hard part, once your phone is jailbroken, is finding a SIM card in Europe with a data plan that is affordable. My experience with T-Mobile in Germany was pricey but within reason; my experience with Orange Mobile in France was astronomically expensive (it used up my pre-paid minutes whenever the iPhone was turned on!).↓
You shouldn’t need a converter, because iphones are OK to work on 120 or 240 volt (most of Europe is 240 Volt). You will need a plug in adapter only (I am assuming the hotels will have one for my use, but they can be purchased (Radio Shack, Fry’s, etc) before you go. If you have appliances that can’t work on 240volt, then you may need a converter (look on each appliance and it should tell you – most modern appliances work OK on either voltage).↓
Yes, this is quite annoying about the Iphone. I travelled around Europe last year, looking forward to using my iphone as my guide. (In fact I got it for this purpose). Unfortunately there was never any wifi in sight. Only in big cities, big hotels and American coffee shops, all of which things I try to avoid when on holiday. Can’t change the sim card for a local one for the next 2 years. So it’s basically useless abroad. I am from Holland by the way. If anyone’s got an idea, to fix this problem would love to hear about it. Will then dedicate a post on my blog What’s up with Amsterdam about it for sure.↓
Tanja, Thanks for your comment. To clarify: where did you get your sim card – in the US or in Europe, and why can’t you get it “refilled” to use again while in Europe. I know that you can get a sim card in the US (for jailbroken/unlocked GSM phones) for roughly $45, with call minutes only, but have not found good information on European phone/data sim cards, which I would need in Europe. I looked into Boingo, but only could find one hotspot on my entire trip that was in any of my hotels, so don’t think I’ll do that at all. I really need a sim card that will work in my iPhone 4, and allow hotspotting for data usage, so my iPad2 will work seemlessly, and without having to have a separate sim card for the ipad. Hoping someone will offer this feature soon, so I can use it in May, when I’ll be in Germany/Switzerland, and Italy.↓
@Dan, I got the phone with a contract in the Netherlands. It cannot be unlocked.
This link: might be helpful to you.↓
I have an iPhone 4 and an iPad2. ATT iPhone 4 hotspot feature has just been implemented (for 4.3 iOS) and I would like to use the iPhone 4 as a hotspot in Germany, Switzerland, and Italy on an upcoming vacation. Has anyone had any experience with jailbreaking an iPhone 4 (with 4.3 iOs) so you can use your phone as a hotspot and connect your iPad to it? Can you get such a sim card that allows you to hotspot connect and pay for data usage (as well as make calls on a per-minute basis I assume), and only have to worry about one sim card for both the devices?
I got totally turned off with speaking with ATT, since data usage with Hotspot causes them to try to gouge you even more, with the explanation that “data” in Europe costs even more than “data” here in the states (and having unlimited data on my iPhone 4 does me no good whatsover). I will not be using ATT overseas at all as a consequence, and would appreciate any help.↓
Dan,
My experience is only on an iPhone 3gs, so I’m unaware if there is an app that cracks the hotspot feature so that AT&T cannot track the data. However, my phone has been a “hotspot” for quite a while (although I rarely use it) thanks to a jailbroken app called PdaNet, which creates an ad-hoc network (allows 2 wireless devices to communicate directly with each other) OR is tethered to the computer via USB to act like a modem. Using either option through PdaNet, AT&T does NOT see this as a separate type of data…they just see it as phone data usage. If you use the hotspot feature, the phone keeps tabs on the data usage via hotspot…meaning that a) they know you’re using the feature and b) they can bill you for your usage. Boo! So PdaNet is looking really good, right? Well, there are drawbacks: getting a successful connection between the phone/computer can be difficult at times (via ad-hoc wireless network…haven’t tried the tethered approach), I have no clue if this works on iPhone4 (although I don’t see why it wouldn’t…assuming your phone is jailbroken), and I’m not sure if iPad supports ad-hoc networking. Before your trip, I would jailbreak your iPhone (assuming there is an untethered jailbreak available), install PdaNet (or some other similar app), and test said app with your iPad (with cell service disabled) to ensure that you have Internet service on your iPad from your iPhone. If that is successful, then unlock your iPhone (so that other carrier’s SIM cards can be used with it…and this assuming they even have an unlock available for your specific iPhone model/iOS version). Test the unlock by borrowing a non-AT&T friend’s SIM card and seeing if you can call out and/or use the data service. If successful, you should be ready to rock-and-roll in Europe.
To answer your question about using the same SIM card for both the iPhone and iPad…this would work IF both the iPhone AND iPad were jailbroken AND unlocked and you switched the SIM card back and forth between the 2. So your better option is to try the data tethering first…as it would allow you to use both devices. Let me know what kind of deals your find in Italy as far as voice/data goes, please. I plan on going this summer. I can’t wait!↓
Anthony, Thanks very much for your input. I was actually hoping that someone has already tried this in Europe with Hotspot on the iPhone 4. I won’t travel until May, so hope to hear from anyone who may have tried this. I didn’t want to use the same sim card in both devices, rather hoping to just jailbreak and unlock my iPhone 4 when I get there, and use one sim card to unlock the hotspot in Europe, and wirelessly tether my iPad 2, so I don’t have to worry about looking for wifi spots along the way. I’ve also heard of good experiences with Boingo in Europe to get reasonable wifi spots at reasonable data rates, in case I decide to turn off my phone entirely (or just to have with me for wifi backup). I may decide to do this, and install Skype for emergency use.
Can you install Skype on your phone while in Europe, or do you have to do it before traveling? And does the jailbreaking done in Europe wipe out your Skype account if done in Europe? I’ve heard that they are very familiar with jailbreaking, and can do it quicker and easier than here, but, since they wouldn’t be re-installing any lost apps or programs, do you lose any such apps or programs once it is jailbreakon there?↓
Honestly, I came to Paris to work a few years ago and have ended up living here. What I recommend for my friends that come is just bring the phone you have, and go to the Phone House () and have them give you a temporary sim card that you will buy prepaid minutes for which you can find at any tabac (look for the sticker on the door that says SFR, ORANGE, BOUYGUES, or even VIRGIN). Of course, that means phone calls and texts only unless you want to pay the premium. and if your phone doesnt accept the sim and they aren’t able to unlock, you can get a really cheap phone that you can throw away at the end of your trip.
now. for BB and IPHONE as far as france goes, the people that I work with that travel internationally but have Paris as a home base and need to use their data services worldwide, they pay 100euros/month minimum for this service, and that’s with a contract- not prepaid.
good luck. xx↓
My wife is headed to Italy for two weeks with a girlfriend. She will have her iPhone 3gs with her and I’m trying to figure out the best way for her to be able to use it when needed. Having it in airplane mode is fine most of the time but she’ll need to send/receive texts at some point and would like to use her apps that are web based. As of this moment her phone isn’t jailbroken but that is an option I’m strongly considering for her. Does anyone have any suggestions for JB apps or programs that would make using her phone/data reasonable (or free)?↓
I have replaced my Nokia phone with an iphone 4 (AT&T contract). Just now, I turned on my old Nokia phone and it said “smart chip registration failed”
Could I take this Nokia phone to England & France and use it by buying a sim card? How would I get a telephone number? Is there a way to make it a pay as you go phone? I don’t need it to call the U.S.
I will only need to use the Nokia a few times to let people know I have arrived at a bus stop or train station. Would use a pay phone but they are becoming so scarce.
Having read all the helpful info about the iphone abroad, I think I’ll just pass and leave it at home.
Will appreciate any advice.↓
Bob
Yes. I have an old iphone that my son gave me that I use like an ipod touch. (It has no contract with any phone company.) I can even make telephone calls on it using Fring. Sipgate also has its own app on itunes that allows you to use it as a Voip phone assuming you have a telephone number through sipgate. I have used it both in the US and Europe over Wi-Fi networks.↓
Susan – If you want to use your iphone for navigation you will need to have an International data plan and I would expect that it would need to be a fairly expensive international data plan in order to use Google Maps and check sites. It has been suggested that you need a three month data plan for one month of travel because the European cell companies take their time billing AT&T. You can ask AT&T how much that will cost and how expensive a data plan you would need. It might be cheaper to buy a GPS to take along with you that has European maps. I bought a Garmin GPS with European and us maps two years ago for about $170 that has been very helpful traveling around Europe and the US.↓
This is all great information. My last 2 trips abroad I turned my phone off until I landed back in U.S. But I want to use my iPhone mainly for navigation and checking sites out during driving tour of French countryside in a few months. I am not versed in all the iPhone lingo. What us the recommended way to use phone exclusively for that purpose? Thanks!↓
You will have to jailbreak and unlock your iPhone(s) to allow them to work with other cell providers’ SIM cards. Unlocking it is really what allows it to work on other networks…the jailbreaking only allows non-approved apps to be installed on the phone. Anyway, you can jailbreak/unlock your phones regardless of if they are out of contract…because whether or not you temporarily suspend your service, you will eventually complete your contract. The purpose of the contract is to ensure AT&T recoups the money it used to subsidize the cost of the phone. If you keep your iPhone updated as far as iOS/firmware goes, you might not be able to unlock your phone. If that’s true, you’re only option is to use airport mode with wifi enabled…then using Skype or a SIP-based app. It’s actually possible to make free calls and receive free calls using SIP, but it is a pain to make outgoing calls. Basically you’d use Google Voice’s website from your phone to make calls…it will then call your SIP number/app (free incoming calls from sipgate – free app: fring) and then connect you to who you’re trying to call. The quality is mediocre, but you get what you pay for. Since one of your phones is out of contract, you might try stopping by a AT&T store one day and see if they will unlock the phone for you.↓
We are moving to Germany for 2 years, military. So, if you are military you can suspend your service for 2 – 18 month periods – this allows you to keep your phone numbers, allows you to reactive your service when you return to the states for family visits, and they waive fees. When you return to the states you can call 611 and get some sort of service.
My questions are: Am I able to use airplane mode while service is suspended?
If I jailbreak and get a German sim card for the phone what that will do to our suspended contract?
We have an old phone that is no longer under contract with AT&T and I was thinking of making that our german phone number with the new card from t-mobile for local calls and using the 3Gs in the wi-fi places for our skype back to the states.
Does that sound like a logical plan? Does anyone have a suggestion for doing it better?↓
As someone has already noted: download the free Skype app, set up an account
that allows you to access the US phone system at ~ 2 cents a minute and call back
to the US. Make sure airplane mode is ON, wifi is ON (because you will be using
voip through the internet to make your calls). Try it before you leave the US —
call your own phone.
I did this in Ireland in 2009 and it worked great. You do need WiFI access, but it
seemed to be easily available.
PS: I did this on my iTouch which is the same as an iPhone with airplane mode ON,
Wifi ON.↓
scriptat, if your iPhone is from Verizon, what is being discussed here about using an iPhone in Europe won’t apply to your kind of iPhone. AT&T’s iPhone can be used in Europe, but Verizon’s iPhone (which looks identical) has different network technology inside that won’t allow it to be used there. That is because Europe uses the GSM standard (so does AT&T) which covers about 220 countries, but Verizon uses CDMA cell phone techology which is used in about 40 countries. Check with Verizon.↓
I spent a week in Austria and Slovakia on business in Dec. 2010. the hotels had decent wifi. When I left home I placed Iphone in airplane mode. I purchased 10 dollars of credit with skype and had the app on my phone. I was able to make calls to the US for 2.3 cents a minute which was very handy. Do a little work before traveling abroad and make sure your hotel has wifi and find wifi hotspots and you can talk to friends and loved ones as much as you like.↓
I have a question that I don’t think has been raised yet:
If I have my iPhone in Airplane Mode and I have a Skype account and I’m in Italy at a wi-fi hotspot, what rate do I get charged if I call a U.S phone number from Italy using Skype?
Does Skype know where you are if you are connecting over the Internet? I see rates for calling Italy but none for calling from foreign countries back to the U.S. over the Internet.↓
When I use my american skype account to call local paris numbers when im living here in paris.. it charges me local rates.
I am an American using blackberry and living in Paris but traveling worldwide. I used to have iphone and i miss it like crazy. however, with my sfr plan it is very affordable to pay as I go around europe just topping off my account online. I pay probably 20euro/month when I stay in paris and up to 60/month in london or milan. my question is, I want an iphone but will only change when I find an affordable international unlimited calls/receiving and data plan.
do they exist?? …because for now anyways, all my friends have BBM.
hmm, let me know.↓
Anthony,
Yes, I agree with all you have said and nobody wants to pay more than one needs, but my comment was directed at Dmitri, who wondered if he can have a ‘holiday’ from his contract while travelling. This is simply not possible as if you have monthly contract fee, your choice of travelling is of no concern to your service provider, (you signed the contract) in fact if you have a contract you have already have had the cost of your phone subsidised by taking a contract in the first place. Which leads us onto the subject of unlocking……..but thats another topic altogether.
Us Americans need to wise up or start reading contracts before signing them, hence my ‘dumb’ comment. Anyways thanks, and I appreciate your reply.↓
Steve, Europeans think we’re dumb because we think we’re the center of the universe…and the world revolves around us and our needs. We show no interest in learning about other cultures. That aside, we are dumb for allowing AT&T (and other cell companies I’m sure) to rape us with outrageous international data fees and roaming fees. We don’t exactly have a choice to change those fees to something reasonable…otherwise we would. Then, maybe we wouldn’t have to find alternatives to getting screwed over by our cell company. Besides, the purpose of the contract is for the phone company to recoup the money that they spent to reduce the price of the phone for the consumer. Regardless of how we use our phones overseas, the cell company is still collecting their monthly bills for the duration of the contract…and therefore recouping their money. If you are living up to your contract obligations (paying your monthly bill for 2 years or whatever the length of your contract is), you should have the right to use your phone however you want…even if it means purchasing non-AT&T data or cell plans to use while you’re overseas. As far as Europeans are concerned, I’m pretty sure the smart ones also seek affordable alternatives…and still honor their contract while they’re abroad. But hey, you can keep getting gouged if you’d like.↓
Ah, crap. They changed the layout of the comments and now allow replies to specific posts…Steve Angel was replying to a previous post and not making a post directed to those seeking alternatives to AT&T’s outrageous fees. Sorry Steve. I received your post via e-mail and thought it was just a general post…not a reply.↓
I will be traveling to Italy with my husband and daughter in January. We have two iPhones, one a 3GS and one a 4. As we will only be there for 2 weeks, I am confused about getting the international data package from ATT. On earlier posts they said I would need to purchase 3 months. Is that correct?
Also, is it allowable for US citizens to buy disposable cell phones in Italy? I was told that they wouldn’t allow it.↓
I will be traveling to Paris with four other friends soon. I am very confused based on what I’ve read and AT&T advice. If the five of us are in Paris and are calling each other, do we dial the 011-33-(U.S. area code) ( cell phone number) or do we just dial 1-(US area code) and cell phone number!??↓
Why don’t you just buy one of those disposable phones when you get to Europe?↓
I just returned from a one month trip to europe. If you have an iphone or current itouch, if you will be staying in a hotel with wifi, are not needing to be contacted regularly or are willing to wait until you can sit in a cafe with wifi, then the cheapest way is to download the app Truphone. We paid for $15 before we left Canada and called from all over without any problems. I think we used up about 1/2 of that amount at approximately 2 cents a minute. If you need to be contacted, just have work, family or friends send a text then find a place to call from.↓
I just got back from Italy and here’s my advice. Buy the cheapo data package. It’s for times when you can’t access wi-fi and you have to use the web or check your e-mail. As long as you don’t spend all day doing it, you’ll use very little of the 20 MB.
Most hotels in Italy have free or cheap wi-fi, although sometimes you have to be in the lobby or close to the lobby to access it. Just make sure you turn data roaming off and put your phone back into airplane mode when you’re done.
For phone usage, buy a cheap phone in Italy and buy some time. I didn’t have to buy a phone as my cousin had a handful laying around, and the time is cheap. Having said that, I didn’t use it for international calls, so I have no insight on that issue.↓
mk — yes, that’s what I did in Prague with my iPhone. You can also make calls, if you want to get a Skype account, $10 minimum purchase.
Enjoy!↓
Warning: AT&T’s international data packages might be advertised at $30 to $200 per month, but they will tell you not to cancel it for two months after you return. Here’s what happened when I went to Europe using an overseas data package from AT&T:
They said, don’t cancel the overseas data plan for two months after you get back to the US otherwise the delay in billing will cause you to get billed at overseas roaming rates instead of it being included in the plan that you just paid for.
I asked them, if those extra two months of billing would be refunded when I canceled. Obviously, if it’s required to leave the plan active for two months after you return to get their stated prices then you won’t get billed for those extra two months. The person on the phone clearly said this.
I went to Europe with the phone–a Blackberry. I think I paid about $60 for the month. Like they warned me, I waited two months after I got back to cancel. They then told me that the extra months of billing couldn’t be refunded, and that they had no record that anyone told me that the extra months would be refunded. They also confirmed that if I had canceled the plan right when I got back I would have been charged expensive overseas roaming rates above the $60 I already paid AT&T for the month’s worth of data.
After a long, argument with several of their employees I asked them to put me through to their cancellation department to immediately cancel my entire phone plan. At that point the cancellation department backed off and refunded my $120.
So, expect to pay for 2 months of extra overseas data if you get their overseas data plan. I highly suspect what AT&T is doing is illegal, but good luck fighting it.
My advice is: don’t use AT&T, but if you do, turn off the phone service with AT&T while you’re away and just use WiFi for data. T-Mobile doesn’t have overseas data plans and most of Verizon’s phones aren’t GSM so they won’t work in Europe. The future is WiFi.↓
I am preparing to go to Europe for a few weeks. If I were to go into ‘airplane’ mode, could I still access the internet and use apps such as the ‘Skype’ App? This app would allow me to make calls/texts to other people using Skype anywhere in the world for free. In other words, if I need to stay in contact with someone back in the US I can do so for free via Skype. So, if I can still use this App in ‘airplane’ mode my problems would be solved.
Is this possible?↓
I’ve just been to Germany and France with my jailbroken iPhone 4. Mixed experiences! In Germany, I found a pre-paid T-Mobile card (Deutches Telekom) that charged by the minute (used up my pre-paid credit) for calls or for data. My total usage in Europe was 250 MB download and 25 MB upload, and it was mostly on this “T-Mobile Kart”, for which I paid a total of about 90 euros. 7 days in Germany. It was decent. However, I couldn’t recharge it online (I think). I bought recharge cards in sealed envelopes and was told that I could return them to any T-Mobile store in Germany before I left if I didn’t need to use them and still had my receipt.
In France, I went into an Orange Mobile store and quickly (too quickly) bought a pre-paid Orange Mobicart. I advise against this! Whenever your iPhone is on, and not in Airplane mode, it uses minutes! I couldn’t use this at all, though it cost me at least $50 before figuring out that it was outrageous.
I really missed being connected in France. I went to another cell phone store and with my limited French and the clerk’s limited English, I seemed to determine that Orange, SFR, and Bouyige (sp?) all had about the same prices, and that all pre-paid plans were extremely expensive in France.
If you just need to make a few calls, and be available for emergency contact by friends and family in the US, ATT’s plan is the easiest, and not that expensive for a couple minutes here and there. If you need data in Germany, check out the T-Moble Kart. Your phone needs to be unlocked; jailbreaking will do this, and maybe T-Mobile could do it for you (but I don’t know). If you need data in France, God help you! Try to get help from one of your friends who live in France. There is also a company that sells sim chips for roaming all over Europe
On another note, I bought MyWi for my jailbroken phone ($20), and it worked great (but not in France, where data was too expensive) – I used my T-Moble Kart to connect, turned on the MyWi tethering, turning my iPhone into a little wifi hotspot, and then connected my MacBook, my iPad, and the laptops of several friends. Since I was being charged by the minute, not by the GB or MB, it was sweet for all of us.
Skype for iPhone worked great, both in wifi connections and in Germany through the T-Mobile Kart.
I found and then lost a link to a company that sells sim chips that work across Europe; I thought it was too expensive (until I got to France!).↓
What an amazingly useful article and comment thread! I’m hoping to go to Austria in 2012 to follow the footsteps of my late father, who worked as a civilian employee of the Allied Occupation, helping administer the Marshall Plan, after leaving his US Army unit at war’s end.
I’d been hoping to find information on whether my iPhone (assuming I still have it in 18 months) would be usable. This is straightforward and clear.
Thanks to all!
Eric↓
Kristina,
You’ll have to do research for data plans in whatever country you’re going to. I’ve read that Orange has a cheap data plan for like $10/month for unlimited data. But I have no idea which countries that will work in, or even if the price is still that low.
Tina,
You should be able to jailbreak/unlock a 2g phone. Just be sure to be specific (mention 2g) when you do a google search for the jailbreak software…and the unlock. I don’t think your phone can handle some of the later iPhone OS versions though. Never had a 2g, so I’m not 100% sure what challenges you’re going to encounter. But there is a bunch of information out there. Like I said, be specific in your searches and make sure the articles you read are referring specifically to 2g iPhones.↓
Kristina,
You don’t need to take your phone apart…unless you’re trying to replace/fix hardware (like a broken screen, etc). I’ve never taken one apart. Anyway, to answer your actual question…
All you have to do is download the appropriate jailbreak program (determined by your computer’s operating system (Windows vs. Mac) and your iPhone’s OS (3.1.3). There are several options.
Once you jailbreak your phone, then you will run another piece of software to unlock your phone. The software that you use for this depends on what you used to jailbreak your phone. If you do a little research, you will find a wealth of information. Just make sure to be specific in your searches, such as “windows jailbreak 3.1.3″ or “blackra1n unlock 3.1.3″. (Blackra1n is one example of jailbreak software.)
Once your phone is jailbroken and unlocked, simply obtain a SIM card for phone/data or just data (you can use a VoIP program to get free calling…although it is rather complicated to get free VoIP calling…here are some keywords if you want to persue this: fring (app), google voice (sign up for free acct), gv mobile (app), and sipgate.com (free incoming VoIP calling). Research can get you up and running for free VoIP calling, but it is a pain and I don’t feel like trying to explain it (sorry). Anyway, once you obtain your SIM card, simply use a paperclip to pop the old SIM tray out (top of phone) and replace with the new SIM card. Good luck!↓
Anthony,
This sounds like a stupid question, but I haven’t updated my software in about a year, as my computer has an issue with itunes (it’s really strange, but nobody has been able to just remove the old version and add itunes all over again) and have no idea which version I have. How can I tell?
Thanks.↓
Hey Community!! I am headed to Europe next month for 3 months and I spoke to an AT&T rep and was made aware that you CAN pause your service for a max of six months, as long as you have been with AT&T for more than 6 months, but you must pay a $10 fee/month to maintain your phone number and of course, your contract will pick back up upon your arrival.
Check it out! Good luck and happy travels!
P.S. Anthony is right, UNLOCK the phone!↓
I went to Canada and had airplane mode enabled, and wifi on. 24 hours into the trip I got an email from AT&T with travel tips for my iPhone. How is it possible they knew I was out of the country? With no data being pinged off of international cell towers (hence airplane mode) was AT&T still seeing my wifi traffic coming from .CA addresses? Was the GPS I used being sent back to AT&T? Even worse, does AT&T sniff non-cellular data and are they able to tell where you are at all times even if the cell part of the phone is “disabled”?↓
I too had that misfortunate phone conversation with an ATT rep prior to taking my iphone to Prague this spring. I decided to forgo their expensive options and just kept the airplane mode on. Fortunately, my hotel offered free wifi so I had free access to my email. However, I did need to make a phone call back to the US but was unable to do so even after turning off the airplane mode. Fortunately, I happened upon a pay phone and utilized that instead. When I returned to the states and called ATT to find out why I couldn’t make calls from my iphone in Prague, I was told that I needed to first power off my phone and restart. I thought that a croc because I never had to do that with my LG or Blackberry when I used them in Europe years before.
I have since learned that I should have gotten the Skype app and would have been able to make cheap phone calls from my wifi enabled hotel room. Live and learn.↓
Jay, there is a small hole the size of a paper clip on the top of your iPhone. Push a paper clip into the hole and the tray that holds the sim card will slide out. Pay attention to the orientation so you don’t put it in backwards…although I don’t think that’s possible because one corner of the card is cut. Anyway, I read that Orange has/had a data plan for like $10/month for unlimited. No clue if that was a special price, or what countries it covered. Maybe someone on here can help you. Here’s the big catch though…I don’t think there’s a jailbreak for the latest version of iOS 4. You’ll have to do some research based on the version that you have installed on your phone. If you don’t have the SHSH blobs backed up in any way, and there isn’t a jailbreak available for your iOS version, then you won’t even be able to jailbreak (until a jailbreak is released for your version of iOS). So long story short, if your phone is completely up to date, you probably won’t be able to jailbreak it. You can send Apple a nice thank you note for helping AT&T to screw you if that’s the case.
Dmitri, wishful thinking. You signed a contract to pay every month for 2 or more years. What you can do is drop your calling plan to the lowest possible minutes, etc, for that month…and/or ask AT&T to credit you…but I doubt they will. If you do drop your calling plan to the lowest minutes, realize that you will lose all accumulated rollover minutes except for the amount equal to the anytime minutes of the calling plan that you drop to….something like that. If you get a good deal or credit from AT&T, let us know the details!
Eileen, you will first need to be able to jailbreak/unlock your phone…which you can’t do if your phone is completely up to date, as I don’t believe a jailbreak has been released for the latest version of iOS. If your iOS version is slightly older, you might be able to jailbreak and unlock. I’ll post a link at the bottom of this post that might help point you in the right direction. Finally, if you can’t secure a micro sim card, you can actually cut a normal sim card. Make sure that the metalic contact side looks identical before/after you cut. In other words, don’t cut the metal contacts. There are some tutorials online, or if you look around hard enough, you can probably find one at a cell shop in Europe. I’d think a razor blade, some hand-eye coordination, and some patience would be all you need. (look around for jailbreakme link on there)↓
Anthony – we will be going to France, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Prague and Italy soon. I like the sound of your ideas. I assume it will work with 3GS and 4.0 software? Now the silly ? – how do you open the phone to replace the SIM card? Is there a good all Europe card for data? Thanks!↓
Aww, another person content with a crippled iPhone (err, I mean iPod Touch). Sad! And thanks Dexter. It amazes me how fearful people are about jailbreaking their phone. lol I’ve had a jailbroken iPhone replaced by Apple under warranty for hardware problems…so it seems the fear is unfounded.↓
next time get a SKYPE account. you can made phone calls to anywhere on WI-FI. Skype OUT calls cost about 2 cents a min to a landline or cell phone anywhere. so for $10.00, you can sit in a coffee shop in Paris or your florence hotel, call your mommy in New York for 500 minutes.↓
Jeez Ellsass… I really enjoy using my iPhone in Airplane mode. Truphone is a great WIFI phone service, and it works perfectly for me.
I’ve used my iPhone in China, Hong Kong, Germany, England, Japan, Brazil, France, The Netherlands, Canada and Mexico.
Using it in Airplane mode has kept my mode of use as simple as possible.
Shouldn’t we be able to use the iPhone as we see fit? If I leave it at home, how am I going to use all the many other functions of the iPhone? The iPod, currency exchange, translator, notes, e-mail, etc?↓
Scott,
If you jailbreak your iPhone, you do have to wait to update your iPhone until they release the new jailbreak. However, with that being said, you will have so many features (and more) via the jailbreak that not even the latest update from Apple will provide. I had the ability to use multiple apps a year ago…and I’m not limited by Apple in terms of which apps I keep open or even how many I open. Obviously though, the more you open, the bigger the drain on the battery. I’m still running iOS 3.1.2. I didn’t update to 3.1.3 because they didn’t really change anything. As far as iOS4 goes, I’m not really worried about my phone showing a more “accurate” number of bars for reception…and I already have all of the other features that I want. Eventually I’ll update to iOS4, but I’m in no hurry.
Sometimes those updates can provide new “features,” but at a cost. Apparently iOS4 (or iPhone4) allows official data tethering…which is like $20/month from what I’ve read. Or you can jailbreak your iPhone and get unofficial data tethering and not get double-billed for your data. Hmmm….hard decision. Obviously everyone needs to make their own decision based on their needs. But jailbreaking is so easy, and you can undo it when you get back to the US if you’re worried about warranty stuff. Also, there is a way (you’d have to research it) to back up your SHSH blobs from your iPhone in case you decide you might want to jailbreak your phone. It does NOTHING to your phone…just saves some data from it that will allow it to be jailbroken in the future.
However, if you update before saving those SHSH blobs, you will lose the opportunity to jailbreak until a new jailbreak is released for that update. If you back up the SHSH blobs and then update, you can go back to the pre-update iOS and jailbreak it. Kinda confusing, I know. But if you know you’re going overseas in the near future, you might as well take a few minutes and back it up so you are at least much more likely to have the option to jailbreak in the future.↓
I think turning on airplane mode the whole time makes the whole point of an iPhone meaningless. Just leave it at home if you’re going to do that.
Since I’ve done a bit of research and used my iPhone overseas a bit, I wrote up all the options (and my opinions) here:↓
Not quite sure why everyone’s so afraid of Airplane Mode; I love it. I took my phone to Mexico with me and left it on Airplane mode the whole time.
Want to make calls? Find some wifi and use the handy (and free) Skype App. You can even buy credit with Skype and call land lines for significantly cheaper than making a call with your phone.
Plus, with Facebook (at least with my age range 18-25) it’s pretty easy to get messages to people without calling or using text messages. Skype also has instant messaging for free to other SKype users and you can use your credit to send text messages to cell phones internationally, once again, for much cheaper than AT&T.
The only problem with this situation is you need to find a Wifi base of operations, but if your hotel or a cafe nearby has internet, it’s easy to send messages to friends you’re meeting or to get information.↓
My husband and I traveled to the Philippines in June/July for a two week trip with our 2 year old and my in-laws. There were 10 Americans in our traveling party, including my husband’s parents, 2 siblings (plus a spouse and kids). We were not all staying together, instead the 10 of us were split among 3 local families.
We knew we would need to use our iPhones while traveling. I expected to want to check some email, use some of the apps we had (to find local things, read news, etc.), send a few texts either to those in our traveling party or the people we were visiting, as well as a few to my family in the states. Hubby and I both investigated how to do this without racking up a $1K bill in the weeks before our trip and got surprisingly different answers from At&T reps on the phone and online.
I ended up adding the following to our phones:
1. global text 50 packages to both phones: allowed us to each send/receive 50 texts for 5.99/mo. We each sent a lot of texts
2. I added the cheapest international calling plan (to get a slightly discounted rate) to my husband’s phone.
3. Planned to turn off data roaming, put phone on airplane mode and use our host’s in house wifi.
The plan was perfect. But it didn’t work. First, our family just did not plan our activities well enough in advance and we ended up making and receiving a ton of calls. Our other family members didn’t have access to their cell phones so we ended up making a ton of calls to local family trying to get through to them. It was a big waste and the total bill for the calls while roaming internationally was $193 for two weeks.
Second, my husband did NOT turn off his data roaming as he was supposed to, and instead was using it all the time. AT&T alerted us in the middle of the trip when our charges got crazy excessive and allowed us to add the $24.99 2MG data package to his phone and back date the start so it swallowed up that crazy expense, but I was still annoyed and I didn’t even know about the calls yet!
In the end we paid for the global text 50 package for both phones, and used it well and got our $12 worth from it. We also paid $3 or so for the international discount plan for calls and spent way too much making and recieving calls. We also paid $24.99 for the data plan and I’m not sure how much my husband used but we didn’t go over it. As for using wifi, it was hard to come by and not reliable even when it was offered. If we had to rely on it exclusivley we would have been very out of touch for most of the two weeks.
Next time we are buying and using locally purchased take and toss phones and skipping the iPhones for communicating at all, which is a huge bummer since they are such a great tool.↓
Being a Flight Attendant, I am VERY careful with my iPhone. My rule? Keep it simple.
I leave my iPhone in Airplane Mode, but have WIFI on. I also have Truphone, an internet based phone service similar to Skype, probably very compareable, but Turphone is what I’ve used most.
I do this in every country, always. Because I travel so extensively, everyone knows to leave a voicemail, which I can retrieve by calling through my Truphone.
I find WIFI is not always easy to find, but many hotels have free WIFI in their lobbies. Try surfing the web to find one before you leave home. Be respectful and remember: You don’t have to be a hotel guest to visit their lobby. You can also find a coffee joint with WIFI. Don’t forget that many public libraries, especially in Cananda and Europe, have free WIFI.
In Hong Kong, I buy an internet access card for $20HKD (about $2USD). WIFI seems to be everywhere!↓
I simply unlocked my phone, took out the ATT sim card, and put in a European one. I got all the data i need and I could make phone calls. When I went back to the states, I relocked the phone and put the ATT sim card back in.↓
AstroNee, were you paying someone to jailbreak and unlock your phone? Once your phone is restored using DFU mode, it’s like reformatting a harddrive on your computer…the jailbreak and unlock is undone (if you’re worried about warranty issues). My guess is that whoever attempted to jailbreak your phone didn’t use the proper software based on your OS version (and the proper unlock software based on your baseband version). I’m sorry he didn’t know what he was doing! $200/month is insane and would’ve been completely avoided if the jailbreak/unlock had been done properly.↓
Back from Europe, here’s what happened:
1) tried to jailbreak and unlock my old 3G, got nearly all the way through the process and it wouldn’t work. Guy gave me my $$ back but for all I know, it still shows up as having been done.
2) bought the AT&T international plan for ~$70/month as I knew I’d need the phone functions at least part of the time.
3) when I got to London, I found a dongle that worked great. It was 3.com, it worked fine with my MacBook Pro, so I didn’t need to worry about tethering.
4) Kept the phone on airplane mode most of the time. Only once or twice used a data app (which was too bad, because I had one that would tell me which Underground lines weren’t working, but I couldn’t use it).
5) The phone automatically switched to Orange in London, and occasionally another carrier when I traveled outside the city. I didn’t need to do anything to pick up the proper service.
6) The phone picked up Orange in Paris, but once I traveled to the Eastern part of France, it stopped working entirely. No service, no WiFi, etc, up in the mountains where I was.
7) AT&T charged me a little over $200 each month for my use of the phone. If you remove the $70 for the international plan, that was $130 for the very few calls I made. Not happiness, but not the over $1000 it could have been.
All in all, I was disappointed not to have my slick iPhone apps. I could’ve bought a cheap smartphone with a European SIM for much less. I bought the iPhone because of its cool apps, but couldn’t use them in Europe. However, I’m traveling within the US now, and it’s great to have my GPS, my Where-type apps, and other cool features.↓
Gizmo, if you jailbreak it and purchase PDANet (like $5 I think), and purchase a data plan (I read that Orange charges $11/month for unlimited data), you can use your iPhone as a secure hotspot for your laptop. I’ve used it before (just not overseas)…and it works beautifully. And it’s a HECK of a lot cheaper than MiFi! To be fair though, I don’t know about the data rate…we could be comparing apples to oranges. If you’re just using the computer for casual browsing though (not downloading HD movies, etc), the PDANet app will be plenty fast enough (assuming your provider has coverage in that location of course)…it’ll probably be on par with a low-to-average DSL connection speed.↓
I took my iPhone to China last year & left it in Airplane Mode the entire time. Free WiFi was available everywhere we went.
We’re going to Italy in a week & plan to bring a laptop & iPhone for business use. There’s no Internet where we are staying, just a few hotspots around town & none of them are free. So we will be trying out a new service from Xcom Global that rents a MiFi unit that lets us create our own secure hotspot for up to 5 devices. It’s $17 per day, but data is unlimited & we won’t have to search or worry about using an unsecured cybercafe.
I’ll be trying out Skype for phone calls.↓
Forgot to mention, you’re really only jailbreaking your phone so that you can unlock it (you can’t unlock until it is jailbroken). However, there are some perks to jailbreaking, other than being able to unlock your phone for use with different carriers/SIM cards, such as: data tethering (PDANet), supporting more than 1 exchange server (AddExchange), free iPhone tracking (Cerebro), a much brighter version of Apple’s flashlight app, a Google Voice app (GV Mobile), bluetooth file sharing/etc, TV out options, save PDF and/or Office files on your phone and be able to access them, etc. The list goes on and on. Those are just a few that I like. Obviously if you use features like data tethering (using your phone to provide Internet access to your computer), you should be considerate to the community…cellular data systems weren’t designed to provide everyone with high-speed Internet service on their computers. But in a pinch, it’s nice to have the option…especially if you need to use a website that uses Adobe Flash. GRRRRRRR!↓
Bypass the outrageous fees charged by AT&T and get the full iPhone experience while paying a reasonable local fee for service while abroad. Just research data/phone providers before you depart…maybe even order the SIM and have it shipped to you before your trip (if possible). A week or two before you depart (or now), jailbreak and unlock your iPhone for FREE. Do NOT ship your expensive iPhone to a complete stranger and pay them to do something that you can do for free…and in less time than it takes to go to the post office. See 5 reasons not to pay someone to jailbreak/unlock your iPhone below.
Afraid of voiding your warranty? Neither the act of jailbreaking nor unlocking affect your hardware directly…they only modify the software that controls your hardware. If something goes wrong, simply put your phone in DFU recovery mode and restore it using iTunes. Apple won’t know your phone is/was jailbroken…unless you take your phone to the Apple store and hand it to them WITHOUT using iTunes/recovery mode to restore the phone to an unjailbroken/locked status. If your phone has hardware issues and you can’t access it (even DFU recovery mode doesn’t work), then Apple won’t be able to access your phone either. They replace your phone (under warranty) and refurbish the faulty one (disassemble, reformat harddrive, replace faulty hardware, etc). If/when you choose to jailbreak/unlock your iPhone, make sure you change the default SSH password (google it) and use Cydia to backup your SHSH (allows you to maintain jailbreak/unlock ability should you ever need to restore your phone). Probably the most important advice: Do NOT update your phone’s OS or modem firmware (disable automatic updates in iTunes) until a jailbreak program and an unlock program has been completed for the newest updates. If you update as soon it is released by Apple, there may be no going back…especially for unlocking your phone because the modem firmware update can’t be undone.
5 reasons NOT to pay someone to jailbreak/unlock your iPhone:
1) They are likely using FREE software that someone else wrote and made available for everyone to use: Spirit (iOS4 jailbreak – will be released soon) and Ultrasn0w (iOS4 unlock – ready as soon as jailbreak completed)
2) What if they drop it? Are they going to buy you a new one? Doubt it!
3) Are they knowledgeable? Do they know to change the default SSH password (default is alpine)? Do they know to backup your phone OS’s SHSH for FREE using Cydia so that you can always restore to your current version of the OS? If they don’t change the password, anyone can gain access to the files on your phone! If they don’t backup the OS SHSH, and you end up having to restore your phone using iTunes, you will be forces (by iTunes) to install the LATEST version of the OS…which might make it impossible to jailbreak/unlock for some time. With the SHSH backed up, you can ALWAYS go back to the previous version of the OS…meaning that you can use the same jailbreak/unlock method that you used initially.
4) Are they trustworthy? What if this person likes to install spyware/malware on the phones? Heck, you probably won’t know the difference since you obviously don’t care enough to learn how to jailbreak in the first place. If you’re not knowledgable, you won’t know the difference. Want someone seeing your pictures, videos, etc? Or they could even track your iPhone’s location for free. Stalker anyone?! Got a phone full of clients’ phone numbers? Corporate espionage anyone?! You get the idea…don’t let strangers use your phone, just like you wouldn’t let them use your computer.
5) If something goes wrong, you don’t have time to get it fixed. Living without your iPhone for more than 5 minutes is unbearable, right?! If you pay someone else to do it, you won’t have any clue how to fix it. Do it yourself so you can always fix it in the future.↓
This is all great info i can use on my upcoming trip to Croatia. I’m meeting a friend who has been traveling the world with her iphone since December. She says the main way locals connect with you when you are visiting is by text, and that it will be imperative for me to have text capability on my iphone. i already have skype that is a no brainer, but i will absolutely need texting capabilities – so it sounds like i need some sort of AT&T plan for the 2 weeks i’m there?
Also, has anyone who has bought a cheap local phone and paid by minute abroad bought one used off of a traveler who is leaving the country (i.e. going back to US) or know of a website where people coming and going can find or sell used ones – which will be even cheaper than buying a new one there? Or, are they really so cheap that it isn’t worth trying to find a used one?
Thanks!

A great string. I just returned from UK, Greece, Used my Iphone with roaming off and 3g off. got 24 minutes of phone for $48 when I returned and $78 data for the few times I switched on roaming to use maps. I talked with my provider and if I had bought a plan I would have saved about $20 and had a few unused Mbps in hand. I will DEFINITELY jailbreak next trip. I will use the Rock your Phone free jailbreak- takes about 5 minutes.
Europe has recently brought a cap on roaming charges of $60 without prior client approval. The industry was out of control on this so the EU government acted. +↓
I was just about to call ATT about this very issue. I am leaving for Spain on Tuesday and planned to take my Iphone. I’ll have my laptop, so I guess I’ll just skip taking my Iphone…Thanks!↓
I just returned from a 2 week trip to Europe. Northern Italy and Southern Germany. Before I left i spoke with the AT&T Wireless International customer service rep. What a confusing mess. He “checked my normal monthly usage and said I use 19 MB in a normal month. What a F’up. He took the number from my bill and converted KB into MB. It was already in MB. Recommended the lowest tier data plan which I activated. This was far too little, and it was his mistake.
In Italy I received an email that I was 90MB over the 20MB allowed. Still don’t understand why they didn’t tell me sooner, or why the way they told me required me to burn more data to get the message.
Called customer service, they retroactively activated the 200MB data package. I learned on this trip that the iPhone does nothing without transferring data.
My bill for this month is $453.00. This my normal billing plus $199 for the data plan and $134 for call charges in Europe. A bit more than expected, but not outrageous. Next time I will get a prepaid phone in Europe, or a global phone, and I will take my laptop for email. Airplane mode with Skype is a great idea if you can find WIFI.
Main problem was that WIFI was spotty even in the best hotels. Need to turn on data roaming for email to download. Sometimes I would forget to turn it off when done. I got the iPhone mainly so I could use it in Europe. It is really expensive to do. Friends told me that AAA has prepaid global phones for travelers for about $100. A better deal.↓
Aloha, Got a iPhone with Skype Credit & headed for Paris. Also have an “old” iPhone I could unlock if there is a good reason and a local landline in our apartment. Any reason I should spend the $49 to unlock & $x to buy a local sim?
Would like to send/receieve US calls,check emails & web and if practical $ use some of the iPhone travel apps. Suggestions & experiences↓
It’s my first time going to Europe as an iPhone owner so I’m curious. However, after going to Panama recently, I did exactly what you did. Airplane Mode! Easy, safe, cheap and just use WiFi when possible! Friends are going to have to cut back on the texts and stick to Facebook messaging or emails instead!
Also Chris Parente makes a good point, we can use our skype app on WiFi to make phone calls! Completely forgot about this option.
Thanks for the clear explanations… this helpful article confirmed and answered my curiosities!↓
Thanks again for this post. I used Airplane Mode during trip to Prague, along with the iPhone Skype app and a $10 Skype credit. Was able to check emails regularly, free Wi-Fi was all over the city including my hotel. And when I needed to make or receive a call it was less than 3 cents a minute. No SMS was the only downside but I can deal with that to avoid a huge billing surprise from AT&T.↓
@ Sophie – 20 mb goes pretty quickly, especially if it’s being used for apps.
And if you’ll be abroad for an entire year, maintaining an iPhone account only for app use (rather than to make phone calls) seems like it could be more expensive than helpful.↓
Thanks so much to all who have contributed to this thread.
I am planning on studying abroad in France for a year, starting in September. I have spent some time in other countries before and plan on getting a cheap prepaid phone for calls within France and just using skype for calls back to the States. Likewise, I can check my email and the internet on my computer.
Really, to echo some others who have posted, I just want my iphone primarily for the GPS and perhaps some helpful apps for navigating cities and traveling.
Do you guys think the 20mb data plan will be enough? and/or worth it?↓
I will visit Berlin in June for 2 weeks and stay with friends. I will therefore not use my iphone for long distance calls. I still have from years ago an older handy for which I could by a simcard and make my local calls for little money.
However I need the luxury of my iphone for my apps (Fahrinfo, Muxeumsfuehrer, GPS etc) wandering though the city. Internet surfing is important too. I have planned to open my emails at my friends house and can block receiving them on my iphone- therefore no high costs for loaded emails. Finding always a Wi-fi place can be a pain or let’s say when I was in Germany ( not in Berlin) 4 years ago
Would the AT & T package the right way to go ? I am hesitant to unlock my phone.
What it comes down to is basically apps, webbrowsing . What is the most suitable way to go ?
Any comments ?↓
We just returned from two weeks in Austria, Germany and the Czech Republic, using an iPhone. We found a 20 Mb data plan was more than enough to take care of our needs for infrequent mapping and daily email.
In most places, Internet / WiFi in Europe is still pay for what you use by way of hourly or daily charges, if it’s even available. Very few places have free WiFi, McDonald’s and Starbucks being the major exceptions, but we did not travel to Europe to frequent them.
The important thing is to develop the discipline to turn WiFi and data roaming on and off as you use them. Then, check the usage statistics in the iPhone after each use and you won’t be surprised.
If you are going to be calling frequently, buy a cheap cellphone there and feed it minutes from the tobacco stands and train stations. Otherwise, buy ATT’s $5.99 plan to reduce your rate to $1 / minute and watch the length of your calls. Remember that texts are $.50 each on each end.
Skype is fine in theory, but you must find a WiFi connection and have sufficient bandwidth if you want to use the video features. Audio is not a problem, but once again, you must find a connection that is free or that you are willing to pay. Also, Europeans seem not to be as openly conversational on their cellphones as Americans.
Our general observation is that it’s not much of a “world phone” if you have to worry about re-mortgaging to use it abroad.
Finally, WiFi hosts may well NOT allow email out, some may not allow email in and most are wary of downloads. Become familiar with your webmail application before you leave for Europe, as you may use it almost exclusively while there.↓
Tom — thanks for the article. I go to Prague soon and am checking my options. Airplane mode for me — anyone know how common free Wi-Fi is in Prague?
Re Skype — I’ve downloaded the App, but now what? Do I need to purchase a number, credit? Anyone want to share some beginner 101?
Safe travels all.↓
Hello, if any of you are coming to Tuscany, I recommend this augmented reality app for iPhone 3GS called “Tuscany+”. It’s so cool (it’s true you pay roaming unless you find a free wifi…). There is a video and a text that explains it here:
There is also another one for who is going to the uffizi: it’s a complete guide that you download at home and don’t need internet in Tuscany to use it. Read here:
Hope you like these tips (let me know what you think).
Ciao ciao

I going to Ireland in May. I was reading on some other sites (and the o2 site) that you can buy prepaid sim cards for the Iphone. They didn’t say any thing about unlocking it. Does this still have to be done before I pull my AT&T sim out? I also was wondering how to charge the thing. Do i need a power converter as well or will just using an adapter and pluging it in be ok?↓
So I’ve been researching this as well, since I will be in Europe traveling for 3 months. I didn’t want to deal with unlocking my phone and juggling sim cards. I also didn’t want to deal with AT&T. I think I have found a solution that will minimize cost and maximize my ability to stay in touch and navigate foreign cities.
I’m planning on airplane moding it as many have mentioned previously. To make the most of that I downloaded a free app called JiWire hotspot locator. It allows you to download a database of 300,000 hotspots for use offline. It also allows you to search for spots nearby. I noticed that it does not allow you to view locations on a map if you are offline. My solution was to find a wifi spot and then map out spots you will be traveling to. I mapped each wifi POI and snapshotted the map of each individually (by holding down both iphone buttons simultaneously). That way I had a map of each hotspot in my photos so that I can find them easily later.
I also have the skype application on my iphone. I am looking into getting the ‘Unlimited World’ plan for $12.95/month (see). From my understanding this will allow me to make landline calls throughout Europe for booking hotels and restaurant reservations. It will also allow me to make nearly unlimited calls to US landlines and cell phones. So this will be my solution for staying in touch with friends and family back home. Its also nice having that peace of mind knowing I can call landlines throughout Europe should the need arise.
Its not foolproof, and we’ll see just how accurate the wifi database is as well as how reliably I can get skype to make the international calls. It all sounds pretty good on paper though and is much cheaper than any international calling/data plans I have found.
If anyone has experience with this please let me know if I’m missing anything.
Thanks↓
The “Airplane Mode only” option won’t work for my trip to the UK & France. I want to be able to use the internet apps (currency, subway, GPS, aroundMe-type info) that I bought the phone for in the first place. I also need to make local calls there. (I can use Skype on my laptop for calls back home, but more on that later). I also have a big problem in that there’s no internet access in the flat I’m using in the UK. So I want to tether my iPhone to the laptop to use the 3G network. I’ll be there for more than a month, so sitting in a Starbucks or McDonalds at 2:00am to call home is not a pleasant thought. (Who wants to be in a McDonalds in London, or a Starbucks in Paris, land of excellent cafes? The idea that ATT&T is causing me to go to an American-based chain store when I’m in Europe is really galling. I avoid them here; why should I have to use them there?)
So my current choices look something like this:
1) Leave my expensive, cool iPhone at home and use paper maps, locals’ directions, and buy a cheap local phone to call about trains and planes–basically go back 10 years. Skype from the laptop (if I can find a dongle that will let me use the 3G network for internet access.)
2) Bring my iPhone, but don’t use any of its cool apps, unless I find a WIFI spot. (Last time I was in London and Paris, it cost at least $10 per shot to use WIFI, even if that was spent on a coffee to sit in a chain cafe. Maybe there are more free spots now.) Get a local SIM card for calls, and get a separate dongle for data on the laptop.
3) Leave my iPhone home, and buy a used one in London, find a pay-as-you-go phone & data plan, and sync all my data to it from the laptop. Still not sure if I’ll be able to tether it to the laptop, and may still have to get a separate dongle.
I’ve been researching this for weeks, and there just doesn’t seem to be a way to connect with both my iPhone and my laptop in any easy, reasonably-priced way. This seems crazy to me. The technology is all there, I’m willing to pay a *decent* amount to use it, but am forced to jailbreak, unlock, void warranties and learn new apps, worry about having to restore and reinstall the phone’s OS when I return, etc, etc, etc.
My needs do not involve watching movies or TV on my phone, or reading newspapers online while at the airport, but even if they did, I should be able to do that without having to pay through the roof when locals have a much better deal.
So if I’m missing the one piece of the puzzle that will give me both UK & France local phone and data usage that will support iPhone app usage and photo blogging, for a reasonable price, someone please let me know.↓
When I leave the country, I make sure that data roaming is off. I can still receive texts though — they cost just 50 cents and it’s a great way to stay in touch with loved ones. Calls get really expensive quickly (have never bought that $5.99 package — seems like it would only save pennies) so I try to keep them really short. When I get into a Wifi area, that’s a great chance to read/reply to email and play with my apps like facebook. When I had a blackberry, that wasn’t an option for me.↓
I’ve got an unlocked iPhone which I have used in Germany for the last 3 yrs. First time I bought a T-Mobile sim, loaded it with € and replaced the ATT&T sim. It can always be loaded up with T-Mobile cards of varying amounts which can be bought just about anywhere now. Just dial the tel. nbr on the card and type in the reference nbr on the card. Since I am usually there for approx. 3-4 mos every year, I make sure there is still some € on it when I return to the US. Next trip: ATT&T sim out – T-Mobile sim in and I’m good to go as soon as I land. I seldom make calls to the US but wife always calls me from the US: no charge off my sim!! I’ve used the phone in Germany, Luxembourg, France and Italy; all with good results. iPhone works just fine here in the US. Just make sure you find a reputable company to unlock it. I used ‘Cell Phone Repair’. They have offices all over the US. Hope this helps.↓
Just yesterday, I spent two hours at a local ATT store with an ATT rep and an Apple iPhone rep the ATT rep called in to try and explain the huge discrepancy between what the iPhone shows as network usage and what ATT is metering. The ATT rep didn’t understand the problem and the Apple rep could not explain it. All should be forewarned not to depend on the usage figures the iPhone shows. As noted by others, ATT’s $.99 / minute calling and receiving package is less than a bargain, not to mention the separate $.50 charge for texts out. The bottom line for us is that our son’s 4-month semester in Germany will likely be with a cheap, simple cellphone (called a “handy” there) purchased upon arrival, rather than his ATT iPhone (anything but “handy” in this case). A real shame.↓
Tom – You carefully dissect one of the most pressing (and frustrating) issues in international relations today. My “calls” to AT&T on this subject have been equally bewildering. And believe me, their unremarkable data “package” will get you a few stock quotes from Bloomberg before exceeding the data limit. Basically, my rule is either use your iPhone for texting only with very limited phone calls, and NO data usage unless through a local Wifi provider or buy a cheap SIM card for an old phone and use it while you are there (the problem in this case though is that you may go to a variety of EU countries in a given visit, and who wants countless “found SIM objects” in your wallet). Mon dieu!↓
I researched this extensively before I went abroad and it was difficult for me to wrap my head around. There’s a lot of different information out there and if you go to the AT&T website they’ll try to upsell you to buy an international package. That’s not worth it unless you need to make calls for business and it’s not coming out of your pocket. I don’t know why a regular backpacker would need to pay for this expense.
1.) Download the Skype Application.
2.) Turn Airplane mode on. Never switch it off.
3.) Find WiFi spots at your hotel or hostel, coffee shop, etc.
I made Skype calls to the States sitting in a coffee shop in Paris and hanging out in my hostel in Berlin for absolutely no cost. It’s amazing. The person on the other end will have to talk to you through their computer, but for conversations with loved ones every few days while you’re traveling it is the way to go.↓
All good advice–and you can still make phone calls with an iPhone thats been “iTouched” by turning off data roaming and 3G (a.k.a. turning on airplane mode and WiFi). Just download the Skype app and use it via WiFi–as detailed at
Yes, you can then only make calls when connected to a WiFI hotspot , but it works great for me–though via some quirk, which I am not sure is universal or just unique to my phone, the main ear speaker doesn’t work while using Skype, so I have to plug in earphone to hear the other end of the conversation. An odd, but not insurmountable, problem.↓
My husband and I traveled to Ireland last summer with our two iPhones. After talking with AT&T, and having basically the same information given to us as was given to you, we opted for the Airplane Mode choice. We really didn’t need the phones or text messaging and we could check email via wifi at the hotels. And we had no nasty surprises on our next statement.↓
Never, ever am i going to opt for roaming. The charges are just too much! The best solution is to buy a local SIM card from any operator that sells them (give them any address if they ask and tell them you’re in the country for a few months, they won’t check that anyway :-).
If you want to receive calls, I’d suggest using a Skype number (but you’ll have to tell it to everyone or use it long before you travel). It’s much cheaper this way, plus you can call for very cheap using Wi-Fi hotspots.↓THE VOICE

Princeton Review gives Dordt College a nod
Dordt College has been named among the Best in the Midwest by The Princeton Review. Dordt College is one of the 150 schools from eleven midwestern states profiled in the first edition of The Best Midwestern Colleges. The goal of the guidebook is to identify some of the colleges and universities that stand out within each region and, in particular, to raise awareness of many schools that are less well known outside of their region.
Selected students are asked seventy questions about their school's academics, campus life, and student body, as well as their study hours, politics and opinions. According to Robert Franek, Princeton Review's lead author of the guide, "Each college had to meet two criteria. First it had to meet our criteria for academic excellence within its region. Second, we had to be able to survey its students anonymously, either through our online survey or our paper survey which we distribute and collect on campuses." Input from students attending the colleges provides extensive and candid feedback about what surveyed students think of the schools they are attending.
Only ten other private colleges in the state of Iowa made the Best in the Midwest list. They are Buena Vista in Storm Lake; Central in Pella; Clarke in Dubuque; Coe in Cedar Rapids; Cornell in Mount Vernon, Drake in Des Moines; Grinnell in Grinnell; Luther in Decorah; Morningside in Sioux City and Wartburg in Waverly.M

Location: New Zealand
Website: N/a
I'm thirty years old, and studying furniture design/making at the Universal college of learning (UCOL) in Palmerston North New Zealand .I'm in my second and last year of my two year diploma.
I have been within the Furniture/ Kitchens industry since I left school, up to this point, but are having second thoughts as to whether or not to return to the commercial furniture industry here in Nz ,because I personally think that compared to the likes of the US and Europe, that alot of our furniture here is boring(most is mass produced and imported). However in saying that there is some nice custom made furniture out there, you just got to look a bit harder thats all!
However I would love to continue with exploring new challenges and skills as far as furniture design and making are concerned, even after my course.
In my spare time I like to get on my Nova dvr xp wood lathe and let those wood chips fly!, I've been turning for about two and a half to three years. I love to explore and work with native New Zealand timbers, but also explore wood turning design.
My ultimate personal goal as far as wood turning is concerned is to get into and explore hollow turning forms and shapes( getting a bit tired of bowls and platters!), from a artistic and sculptural perspective. Unfortunately at this present moment student life has halted this to quite a extent.
My personal Influences as far as wood turning is concerned is, John Jordan from Cane Ridge Tennessee, and Ron Flemming from Tulsa Oklahoma.
I look forward to meeting new people and sharing thoughts, skills and Ideas with fellow wood workers on Lumber Jocks.
Ps: And a big shout out to my first year Lecturer at Ucol for putting us as a class onto lumber jocks, cheers Andy!.

I worked with a company for 7 months. During my employment was given "fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock." I have since left the company. I have a couple questions as I don't know much about stock.
1. Is this still my stock?
2. Can I sell this stock (at the time I was told I had to wait 6 months, which has since passed)
3. Can I buy stock in the company online? Or is this illegal since I used to work for them?
2 Answers from Attorneys
Generally speaking, if one owns fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock then one in fact owns such stock free and clear. If the company is a publicly traded company then generally one can buy and sell its stock freely assuming the company did not IPO recently or assuming there aren't any other trading restrictions imposed on (former) employees. If the company is not publicly traded then the stock certificate and the paperwork that accompanied the stock grant need to be carefully reviewed to render an opinion.
My office has a special offer for LawGuru clients where we can conduct a limited review of this matter.
Sounds like you own the stock, but to be sure I need to see the stock certificates and find out more information.

The Panel recommended respondent be definitely suspended for one year
retroactive to April 2, 1996, the date he pled guilty and was sentenced.
By a vote of 6 to 0, the Interim Review Committee adopted the Panel's
conclusions of law and recommendations but the Committee recommended
respondent be suspended retroactive to May 2, 1996, when we temporarily
suspended respondent pursuant to ¶ 6 of Rule 413, SCACR.
Respondent was arrested on May 30, 1994, for felony driving
under the influence (DUI) causing great bodily injury. Respondent was
driving southward in the northbound lane when he collided with a
motorcycle injuring the riders. One rider, Maurice Lewis, was seriously
injured.1 Respondent's blood alcohol level was .23. He pled guilty to felony
DUI and was sentenced to five years. Respondent was released from
prison on April 9, 1997.
residual problems, such as a loss of smell and taste, behavioral changes
(i.e. emotional outbursts), and a knee injury.
p. 9
We have not sanctioned an attorney solely upon the basis of a
conviction for felony DUI. Other jurisdictions that have considered the
question of the appropriate sanction when an attorney drives under the
influence and causes serious injury or death have found some period of
suspension or even disbarment warranted. See Danny R. Veilleux,
Annotation, Misconduct Involving Intoxication as Ground for Disciplinary
Action Against Attorney, 1 A.L.R.5th 874 §§ 6-9 (1992 & Supp. 1995).
A fixed period of suspension is commonly imposed for a felony
DUI conviction. See e.g. Kentucky Bar Ass'n v. Rankin, 862 S.W.2d 894
(Ky. 1993)(six-month suspension and two year probationary period for
felony DWI); Kentucky Bar Ass'n v. Jones, 759 S.W.2d 61 (Ky. 1988)(court
imposed two year suspension on attorney convicted of felony DUI and
reckless homicide); In re Morris, 74 N.M. 679, 397 P.2d 475
(1964)(indefinite suspension for involuntary manslaughter resulting from
DUI); Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Michaels, 38 Ohio St.3d 248, 257
N.E.2d 299 (1988)(court imposed eighteen-month suspension when attorney
pled guilty to involuntary manslaughter, DWI, and reckless driving); In re
Curran, 115 Wash.2d 747, 801 P.2d 962 (1990)(court imposed six-month
suspension when attorney convicted of vehicular manslaughter).
We find respondent has violated § 5(C) of Rule 413, SCACR, by
committing a serious crime and his misconduct warrants an eighteen-
month suspension. Therefore, respondent is hereby suspended from the
practice of law in this State for a period of eighteen months retroactively
to the date of his temporary suspension, May 2, 1996. Within fifteen days
of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk
of Court showing that he has complied with Paragraph 30 of Rule 413,
SCACR.
DEFINITE SUSPENSION.

TOP PICK
30 For 30 (ESPN, 8 p.m.): Look, The A.V. Club staff isn’t immune to mistakes. Sometimes we miss stuff—like last Tuesday, when the return of 30 For 30 flew completely under our radar. (Because maybe it was listed under the SEC Storied banner and we were like, “Welp, no 30 For 30 until next week!”) This time around, Kevin McFarland made sure we were paying attention, and we’ve made sure that he has a place to upload his review of Hawaiian: The Legend Of Eddie Aikau.
REGULAR COVERAGE
Marvel’s Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. (ABC, 8 p.m.): The listings for tonight’s episode make a big deal about Coulson running across a Comandante Camilla Reyes, and the Internet is shedding no light on who that might be. So we’re looking to the next best source: Oliver Sava.
Brooklyn Nine-Nine (Fox, 8:30 p.m.): Santiago is put in charge of a program for troubled youth, which is bound to become some sort variation on Scared Straight! once Diaz gets involved. One flared nostril from Stephanie Beatriz, and Molly Eichel has already abandoned her life of crime.
New Girl (Fox, 9 p.m.): A “double date” has two meanings this week, seeing as Schmidt still hasn’t come clean to Cece about Elizabeth (and vice versa). “Sounds like this double date’s about to become ‘no dates,’ on the double!” Erik Adams says, while tipping his sunglasses and doing a one-legged lean against a brick wall.
Trophy Wife (ABC, 9:30 p.m.): This potentially winning comedy became the first rallying point of the fall season after it was swallowed up by the Voice-NCIS battle last Tuesday. Brandon Nowalk’s not ready to say goodbye to the kid who said “garbage and shoes,” so why not give this show a shot this week?
The Mindy Project (Fox, 9:30 p.m.): Having successfully worked James Franco out of its system, The Mindy Project may be preparing to do that to Anders Holm. At least that’s how Katherine Miller interprets the news that Holm’s Casey wants to be a DJ after returning from Haiti.
Person Of Interest (CBS, 10 p.m.): If any show was set up to tackle the Edward Snowden/NSA scandal in the first few episodes of its new season, it’s Person Of Interest. The NSA has already intercepted Phil Dyess-Nugent’s thoughts on the episode.
Sons Of Anarchy (FX, 10 p.m.): LOL: All that joking about forgetting about 30 For 30 and there hasn’t been a Sons Of Anarchy entry in the Tuesday edition of What’s On Tonight? for weeks. No offense meant to Zack Handlen, Kurt Sutter, motorcycle enthusiasts, or the general concepts of anarchy and sons.
WHAT ELSE IS ON
Wolfblood (Disney, 8 p.m.): While other studios went mad for all things supernatural-romance in recent years, Disney rested on the laurels of mega-rich superstar teens (with problems just like you!) and dogs with blogs (blogs just like yours!), which explains why its first foray into that field is a British import. Genevieve Valentine gives the werewolf show a loo-ooooo-ooook! (For a show about airwolves, see below.)
Airwolf (G4, 8 p.m.): After narrowly avoiding the ax, this is what G4 is reduced to: A primetime repeat of the Airwolf in which a drunk Eugene Roche prevents nuclear war with Russia. And not a cufflink or tie bar in sight! (For a show about werewolves, see above.)
Beauty Queen Murders (ID, 10 p.m.): It’s unclear whether or not this true-crime series is about murders of beauty queens or murders committed by beauty queens. Either way, this type of murder happens often enough to fill out a full Investigation Discovery show. So beware, beauty queens. (Or beware of beauty queens. And werewolves. And airwolves, when applicable.)
Dukes Of Haggle (Discovery, 10 p.m.): Like a rat king formed from the entangled facial hair of the Duck Dynasty gang, American Pickers’ Frank Fritz, and Storage Warrior Darrel Sheets, Discovery’s latest reality show follows four groups of competitors haggling their way across the American South. (Facial hair or no facial hair, the stars of the show are not werewolves.)
Machete (FX, 8 p.m.): Grindhouse continues to have an impact far deeper than its box-office draw suggests, as indicated by the upcoming sequel to this Danny Trejo-led spinoff. And yet a full-length version of Edgar Wright’s Don’t remains a far-off dream. (Not to be confused with the similarly un-produced Grindhouse spinoff, Rob Zombie’s Werewolf Women Of The S.S. Or to be confused with Airwolf, a property Robert Rodriguez would certainly adapt into a feature.)
Singin’ In The Rain (TCM, 8 p.m.): In the inevitable robot apocalypse, a simplified version of Blade Runner’s Voight-Kampff test will be used to distinguish humans from their automated adversaries. Its single question: “Do you enjoy Singin’ In The Rain?” All answers in the negative can be attributed to unfeeling, non-empathetic beings of mechanical origins. (Werewolves, however, prefer An American In Paris.)
NHL Hockey: Capitals at Blackhawks (NBC Sports, 8 p.m.): The NHL begins its reorganization season (or whatever you want to call it when the Red Wings and Blue Jackets are shunted over to the Eastern Conference for scheduling purposes) with this high-profile opener, as reigning league MVP Alexander Ovechkin and the Caps visit the reigning Stanley Cup champs in Chicago. (No, Ovechkin is not the first werewolf to win the Hart Memorial Trophy.)
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
The Blacklist: In spite of her inspired, insane turns in Blue Velvet and 30 Rock, whenever your What’s On Tonight? correspondent reads the name of last night’s Blacklist guest, he can only think of Tom Servo spouting “For Lancôme, Isabella Rossellini!” in the Angels Revenge episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Phil Dyess-Nugent might not concur, but he sympathizes.The SAFA Tool 2.2.40 is designed to support the implementation of SAFA Guidelines, specifically at the supply chain assessment level.

While that may seem like an obvious statement, Jason Lloyd of The Beacon Journal reminds readers that nothing can be taken for granted when it comes to Bynum and his troublesome knees.
.”
While it would appear that Tristan Thompson would be the favorite to start beside Bynum, Brown indicated that former center Anderson Varejao could also see time at power forward.
For his part, Bynum is extremely confident in himself and his new team. He believes that he’ll be an All-Star center if he remains healthy, and he says the Cavaliers will make the playoffs this season. Both could wind up being true, but each instance will largely depend on the healthy and durability of Bynum’s knees.

Anyone can develop chronic exertional compartment syndrome, but it's more common in athletes who participate in sports that involve repetitive impact exercise, such as running and fast walking. Chronic exertional compartment syndrome is sometimes called chronic compartment syndrome or exercise-induced compartment syndrome.
If conservative treatment doesn't help with chronic exertional compartment syndrome, your doctor may recommend surgery. Surgery is successful for many people, allowing you — whether you're a recreational or serious athlete — to return to your sport..
Excessive pressure within an isolated segment of muscle (a muscle compartment) causes chronic exertional compartment syndrome. Exercise increases the blood supply to working muscles, making them expand. If the connective tissue (fascia) that holds the muscle fibers together in a compartment doesn't also expand, pressure builds up in the compartment. Over time, the pressure cuts off some of the muscle's blood supply, leading to chronic exertional compartment syndrome.
Some experts suggest that biomechanics — how you move — may have a role in causing chronic exertional compartment syndrome. Other causes may include having enlarged muscles, an especially thick or inelastic band of tissue (fascia) surrounding a section of muscle, or high pressure within your veins (venous hypertension)..Awful Green Things from Outer Space

More Here! »So Stuart Bingham has taken his place in snooker’s ranking event winners’ circle...who else might join him as a first time champion this season?
The usual nine of ten players will in all likelihood dominate but the difference now to a few years ago is that more players are sharp because they are playing all the time.
The confidence that a good PTC run can bring feeds into the big events and there will be a number of players looking at Bingham’s win at the weekend and thinking, ‘I could do that’
Ironically, the name at the top of this list is Bingham’s chief critic at the Australian Open, Mark Allen.
He has taken a lot of stick for his comments but remains a fine talent who has reached the quarter-finals of the last two ranking tournaments despite hardly practising.
Maybe sometimes he needs to tighten up a little but he certainly has the attacking game that pays dividends in this ultra-competitive era for snooker.
Who else?
Jamie Cope has long been regarded as a talent who hasn’t quite stepped up to the next level, but it emerged recently that he has in fact been suffering from an hereditary condition that caused him to shake on the shot, for which he has now received treatment.
Hopefully this will help him make some progress now, although I think sometimes Jamie’s head drops a little too early in matches when things are going wrong and this is perhaps another issue he needs to address.
Bingham is 35 and his victory will give heart to the likes of Mark King and Joe Perry, two players who have been on the fringes of winning big titles without quite doing it.
Martin Gould is one of the most improved players on the circuit in recent times, but it remains to be seen if his open game can yield silverware.
What of the young stars? Could, say, Jack Lisowski or Anthony McGill conceivably come through the pack in the way, for instance, Paul Hunter did at the 1998 Welsh Open?
These are all questions. I don’t know the answers, but I’d be interested in your thoughts.
39 comments:
Well done, Dave. First of all I was amazed to read on (your) twitter that the blog was only read by 12 people on a current day. This is madness. I consider the blog to be a very good one, indeed. And I read quite a few of them out there, so it actually should be ultra popular.
On the current topic, I really thing Mark Allen will be the next one to shine on the big stage. He was suffering from depression earlier this year, and as well all know, it takes a while to shake off it. (If he ever does) But, I expect the opposite "spur on" Effect on him to come into motion. He really annoyed Stuart with his comments, and they were all wrong, but now he needs to realize, that "the bottler" has one a title and he has not. I really like Mark Allen and hope he does start practicing a wee bit more and gets a title on his CV.
As for my second choice, it will actually be Mr. Croupier Gould, but I am not so sure, he safety game is good enough (if it exists) for him to win a title. But, you never know, he is such a potter, if he out pots every one in a tournament, he migh as well do it.
I think you forgot to mention the leader of the most-ranking-fnals-without-a-win-list: Ryan Day!
I think Wenbo will go close to winning a title this season.
A very good potter, he appears to be emerging from a crisis in confidence, and while tactically, he is atrocious, theres no doubt he has the bottle to do it.
Another player who could have a good run is Marcus Campbell.
He is solid, improving all the time, and has the advantage of a tough practise school up in Scotland.
its to early for Jack Lisowski and Anthony Mcgill they haven't got experience of many TV Matches and eventually they will run in to a brick wall.
main candidates are Mark Allen,Martin Gould and Liang Wenbo looks to be starting to get his act together at long last.
If it is to happen sooner rather than later then Mark Allen has to be top of the list with Martin Gould a possibility.
Looking a little further ahead Anthony McGill and Jack Lisowski spring to mind with Jamie Jones another making good progress up the charts.
I thing the likes of Mark King and Joe Perry are past their best and would be surprised if they took a major crown. Ryan Day and Jamie Cope have been so close but Day in particular has had a bad dip in form over the last couple of seasons but if he gets it back he could well win a big one and the same goes for Liang Wenbo.
As a dark horse, watch out for Matthew Selt!
Yes, we all know Mark Allen has bundles of talent..shouldn´t he then start practising harder, so he can convert those quarter-finals and semis into finals and win ranking tournaments!
Perhaps he lacks the discipline of say a Hendry or Davis to practise hard enough (which quite often seems to be the case with many natural talents?)
Interesting discussion topic Dave. I think that the two front-runners to win a maiden title this season must be Mark Allen and Liang Wenbo. As pointed out by Kildare Cueman though, Wenbo's tactical game is below par relative to the very top players. I fancy that he might have a better chance winning one of the PTC events rather than a full-blown best of 9 format event. Allen on the other hand has the all-round game. He's proved this in the World Championships and he may well be spurred on by Bingham's success to knuckle down and finally win the silverware that his obvious talent deserves.
This is a question for dave or chris turner as i know both of you are snooker statisticans.i see bingham is the 48th player to win a ranking event.how many of the 48 different players have won as a qualifier?.would love to know this answer hope you can help.
The best player never to have won a ranking event is Anthony Hamilton. A supreme breakbuilder, allied to a solid tactical game, it is mystery as to why he never entered the winner's circle.
Of course, it is still possible for him to break his ranking title virginity but time is against him, and the recent revelation of neck trouble may hasten his decline.
Mark Allen is the obvious choice in terms of current standing, and he has won a notable invitation tournament.
Ryan Day and Liang Wenbo have to figure somewhere in this debate. Both players lack a little in the safety department, and Day may be scarred by three final defeats.
Wenbo will improve, and when he does his scoring power could blow the field away in a given week.
My gut feeling is that King and Perry were never quite good enough, particularly King in the scoring aspect of the game.
As for Cope, would like to see it but he needs to develop a B-game and start scrapping out those victories when he is not firing on all cylinders.
12 people a day??? That is obviously not true. Dave, can you confirm this and if so, are you sure that is the case? This has readers from many countries and each post is actively commented by many and most likely read by many more. 12 people...no way. Really?
And the young star to look out for is a scottish player called Heven Stendry. One to watch.

in the 80s and early 90s top 32 was seeded through so although Hendry won as WN 23 in 1987 he wasent a qualifier.
Jamie for a start mark allen is a much better player than hamilton and he has never won a ranking event either.
Hi Dave is there a list of all ranking event winners say from the seventies till now???I would say martin gould may win one.mark allan, jamie cope certainly as the game..id love to see mark king win a ranking..but overall I want hendry to win another ranking title or the masters like davis did in 1997.
Claus, there's a glitch in the stats at the moment
Higgins and Spencer won the WC as qualifiers.
I dont care what the stats say Dave your blog is one of the best out there, if not the best.Numbers do not tell the full truth.
Wild where did you get that list from ? Good work by the way.
yep, many people can read your articles directly on the snooker forum.
Did they even have qualifiers back in Higgins/Spencer's day? I thought they just paid their entry fee and that as it.
The obvious candidate is Mark Allen. My dark horse would probably be Jamie Cope. Better all rounder than Liang.
Hi Dave,
It certainly has been an interesting couple of seasons under the Hearn regime.
Well done Bingham for finally winning one for the journeyman player. I would say, that the PTC's have been most helpful to this group of players, rather than the elite. And I always throw in the theory that if this new ranking system was in place a few year's back, more journeyman player's would've definitely had the chance of doing what Bingham has done. The driftwood of King/Day/Perry et al hung around the top 16 because of the system. These guys may have a good run again, but I think really a PTC (as indicated by Perry's final apperance last month,) is where they will be better placed.
Cope is another player who doesn't quite have the game to take a plethora of tournaments, but would like to see him win at least one, as I could Stephen Lee.
I would like to think Mark Allen will win a few rankers. Regardless of his war-of-words with Bingham, he will have a far better career than the Basildon cueist. He has time on his hand's and I can see him landing a big one, providing his health stays ok!
I would eventually like a see an invitational tournament for the elite 8. Because looking at the top 16 now it will be interchangable outside the 8 - who look very tight and deserve another innovative tournament.
Thanks, Joe
BTW, Shed Seven??! Forget that, what about the Spinto Band!
Alan McManus to win a big tournament if he can keep focussed in the qualifiers.
To suggest that Anthony Hamilton is the best player never to have won a ranking event is to romantically look at the past decade with rose tinted spectacles.
Hamilton is a nice guy but is manufactured as a player and lacking in true gumption as an individual.
He never ruffled any feathers and never harmed anyone but that in itself was his problem.
Wild marco fu was not a qualifier when he won the grand prix.infact the top 32 and 16 qualifiers took part in the tournament.fu was 27th in the world so did not need to qualify.dave what is the amount of qualifiers to win rankers.
trevor
your right Grand Prix was last 64 start that year.
sorry
"Hopefully this will help him make some progress now, although I think sometimes Jamie’s head drops a little too early in matches when things are going wrong and this is perhaps another issue he needs to address."
I'm not so sure if we can judge his attitude problem the same way if he had an undiagnosed condition holding him back. If you have that much natural talent but haven't had any success you can kind of understand becoming petulant the way he has.
Anyway that's good news and I hope he can really take off from here.
Don't forget Neil Robertson and the World Open. He was a qualifier when he won that.
The best player never to win a ranking event is Joe Swail. No question. What a talent that guy is, he delighted us at the Crucible so many times just an entertainer and a great guy. I will never forget his performances against John Parrott and Mark Williams in the last 16 at the Crucible to come from behind to win on a decider over 25 frames.
Higgins was certainly a qualifier in the 1972 World Championship (8 players played 2 qualifying rounds). Don't think they had qualifying rounds in 1969 when Spencer won it.
Neil Robertson hasent won any tournament as a Qualifier Lowest Rank hes been in winning tournament is no 13th
and the 1972 World Championship was not a Ranking Event which the Question was referring to.
Yes he has Wild. He won the World Open last year as a qualifier. His match was held over to TV but it was still a qualifier.
no other way round the first round was played in the academy because they could not play all the matches at the venue they only played 11 first rounders(last 64) at the venue.
1117
neil wasnt the qualifier!
11.17, Neil Robertson won the world open as world champion and no. 2 seed.
His first round match was held over,
If he wasn't a qualifier why was he first match included on the qualifiers draw sheet on the World Snooker site then? Robertson and O'Sullivan were heldover but were still qualifiers.
Strictly Speaking i guess your right but in reality top seeds dont qualify so really naming a World Champion as a qualifying winner of the World Open is a bit silly.
the structure of the event was wrong that its even a issue.
Anon 5.35 robertson Was the number 1 seed for the world open as reigning world champion.the way the seedings work for a world ranking event are as follows.no 1 seed is the defending champion,no 2 seed is world champion.since the world open was a new event the world champion was number 1 seed simple as that.
I think you'll find the World Open wasn't seeded. It was randomly drawn from all the qualifiers.
5.07
there was qualifying rounds that was drawn then they reached the last 64 round thats when the top 32 entered the event.What Games Are: The Scientism Delusion
Beyond The Box Launches A TweetDeck For Sports To Bring Realtime News And Analysis To Your iPad
Editor’s note: Tadhg Kelly is a veteran game designer, creator of leading game design blog What Games Are and creative director of Jawfish Games. You can follow him on Twitter here.
Making a game is rarely as simple as having an idea, coding it and shipping it out the door. It looks as though it should be, and every year there are one or two media stories of studios who do exactly that, but in reality it’s not that common. Usually there’s a lot of playtesting, blind alleys, a need to rework or rethink how the game works and to iterate. This has always been the case, though perhaps in this more connected age it’s easier to iterate against the market than behind closed doors.
Bad games die in obscurity. They vanish into the great unwashed of the App Store’s 150,000+ games, never to be seen again. Their failure is commonly equated with poor execution and iteration, but it also happens to many well-executed games. A game may be diligently developed, iterated, analysed for user behaviour and whatnot, and yet they never go anywhere. And conversely there are many examples of games that you might not consider any good, which sell big.
So it’s reasonable to conclude that gaming success is not just about delivery. There’s another factor at play, one that you might call hype or marketing. By which you probably mean a combination of advertising in channels like ChartBoost, publicity and trying to please Apple so that you get featured in the App Store. It all seems to be a part of that same execution equation, but wider. Iteration+execution+marketing=success.
And yet it still doesn’t work..
To many game makers it’s similar. Games seem to solve entertainment problems, and game developers provide features to do so. Since all problems boil down to tests and verification, like a science, the method should be clear. So the strategy becomes about trying to find corners, niches, better problems or out-solve the competition on existing problems. This is why most games tend to be conservative in their ambition, and why genre thinking is highly prevalent.
From a developer side, genre thinking largely views games as a series of problem categories. A new form of slot machine on your iPad or a game where an avatar runs along an endless path emerges – and suddenly everyone is talking about the “social slots genre” or the “endless runner genre.” They talk about how they need to be “in that space” with “their play.” They search for external validation through observing what the competition has done, and use that to justify why they should take that risk themselves and add their secret sauce (which leads to some amusing places, such as the awkwardly named Running With Friends).
But, again, this approach is usually far more unsuccessful than successful. Temple Run and Jetpack Joyride may have hit on something, but for the dozens of other developers who then made an endless runner, not so much. Zynga and Supercell may have hit the mother lode with a farming and a strategy game, but most of the other studios who tried to replicate this success failed. Their successes were not just about iteration, execution and marketing.
Iterate-execute-market thinkers don’t tend to make the logical leap and conclude that their approach is wrong. They almost never seem to say to themselves “Maybe the problem is that we were too conservative, too timid, too risk-averse.” Instead they conclude that they just didn’t iterate, execute and market hard enough. They just didn’t get the combination of ingredients quite right to make the secret sauce sing. But there must be a secret sauce right? I mean, look at Supercell, they say. They got the sauce right.
The reality is that this whole way of thinking may look like science, but it is not science. It’s scientism, which is the axiomatic belief in the empirical and that that which seems science-like is probably right. Furthermore, in the absence of empirical validation, the assumption that there is always a formula out there somewhere. And that that method is above reproach.
There are some corners of the gaming world where formulaic thinking hold true. Sports, casinos and various others show regular evergreen patterns over long periods of time, but even there the patterns that scientism-believers think they see are overblown. What is often forgotten in the rush to confirm a bias for success is that entertainment industries do not solve problems, even if they are software-based. Toy Story does not solve a 3D-animated toy movie problem, and the “Life of Pi” does not solve an inspiring book problem. They do something else, which is why those entertainment industries are always full of big surprises from bold makers, and legions of follow-on publishers trying to understand Yann Martell’s secret sauce..
Just as with movies and books, breakout games start from the place of having an idea of your own. On the App Store there are thousands of apps all working those same promotional channels, yet the majority go on to fail. If scientism really was a proven way to succeed then companies like Zynga would not find itself in continuing difficulty. EA wouldn’t be shedding jobs a-go-go and THQ’s debts wouldn’t be so crippling. These are (were in THQ’s case) all companies whose primary asset is their ability to market and promote, to push product and dominate attention, to apply formula thinking. And yet their failures far outnumber their successes.
Rather than applying mystical formulas to self-selected confirmation biases, and assuming that secret sauces are only the right pinch of salt away, the more successful approach to games usually revolves around what Seth Godin calls tribal marketing. Rather than say “We have an idea that fits a genre, let’s make that idea, then when we make that idea let’s market that idea, and if we just do that well enough then we will succeed,” the really successful game maker usually starts with “I have an obsession. Do other people have the same obsession? Let’s see if there’s a game there.”
In other words, rather than relying on the law of averages to stumble you into success in a made-up genre invented by the industry, think like Shigeru Miyamoto – who turned his own fascination with weighing himself into the Wii Fit. Of course you might say that Miyamoto has Nintendo behind him, so he can afford to be more ambitious than you or I, but this is not true. He can afford to spend more money on his ambitions than you or I, but even Miyamoto started somewhere much smaller. Today’s Nimblebit was yesterday’s Nintendo, which is to say that the right creative approach can scale.
So what to do? The answer lies in two terms: “alignment” and “marketing story“.
The first means getting aligned with your people. The scientism-fan is often somewhat like the analyst, the intellectual or the craftsman, used to holding the market in cool regard and wondering what key will unlock it. He’s like like the French politician Alexandre Auguste Ledru-Rollin, who apocryphally said “There go my people, I must found out where they are going so I can lead them.”
Successful game designers are often obsessives in one kind of game, whether it be simulations, driving or fighting games. The aligned game maker is connected very deeply to her audience because she is essentially one of them, and the very successful ones are so because they are aligned to large-enough audiences which make their obsession viable. Will Wright, Todd Howard, Jane McGonigal, David Cage and many many others are all true believers who have found large groups of like-minded people.
And the marketing story? All the most successful products, from burgers to $500,000 cars, resonate with their intended audience. Whether that product satisfies their conception of what it should be or represents leadership toward where it goes next, successful products tell the people the story in which they already believe. Skyrim means something as much to roleplayers, more than being just what it is. So too FIFA Soccer and Gran Turismo. So do most other gaming successes (the main exceptions being outright novelties and platform wedges).
But of course getting alignment and marketing story right is easy to say but in reality very difficult to do because it requires a lot of self-examination. You can’t be aligned and also cooly detached at the same time. You can’t espouse a marketing story unless you actually believe in it. You’ll just get confused, and come across as such. It means getting past the scientism while at the same time not losing sight of due diligence.
As game makers we’re too used to thinking of games as a business rather than a passion, and so our on-the-street sense of connection turns into scientism. We often forget the innate joy of our own obsessions and our flights of fantasy. We often stop asking the question “What if you made a game that…?” and instead say “What genres do we need to tap?” We fall too deeply into thinking of players as users, to be measured in daily-active and monthly-active cohorts and broken down as revenue generators and customer segments. We forget that we’re entertainers, not engineers, and that genres are mostly bullshit to an audience that just wants to have fun and feel the fantasy of the worlds that we create.
Sometimes scientism works really well, but more often than not the true source of its success are rooted in good timing. Zynga may have appeared to be a company of game-scientists solving problems, but the reality is that it had the smarts to be risky with first-mover advantage back when everyone else was waiting for validation. It’s a similar story for GREE, BigPoint and many others following essentially the same path. The mysticism of their methods is mostly well-understood and usually starts with someone taking a huge risk before they started to apply scientism to their thinking.
We intellectuals, analysts and craftsmen like to talk of secret sauces and whatnot because they make us feel reassured. All we are doing is buying into a marketing story of our own, the one that says games will one day be solved, in the future, because we are uncomfortable with uncertainty. Nono, we think. It can’t be as dumb as simple luck and timing. That Notch guy? Maybe he just got lucky. But that Pincus guy? He’s got the method, the secret sauce and the plan.
Nope. He just had the guts to gamble huge before anyone else. All the rest is mostly fiction.

From SoSH: Re: 9/25: NY v. Bos: Vasquez v. Wakefield
1. Yes, yes Jose knows last night didn’t go as planned. Yes, yes Jose was incredulous that Eurona left Pedro in to pitch the eighth. Yes, yes it felt eerily similar to Game 7 of last year’s ALCS. Jose knows all of these things, but he also knows something else – IT WAS NOT THE SAME!!!
This was not the ALCS, Eurona is not Gump, and this game was not a bellwether no matter how much the local mediots would like to pretend it is. Eurona may not have made the right decision last night, but he made it on the basis of actual information about matchups, pitch counts and performance. By contrast, Grady always seemed to make decisions on the basis of whim.
Contrary to popular belief, we did not get mugged last night. We got mugged in Game 7. It rattled us; it shook us up; it left us feeling wary and scared and sensitive. As a result, when we see something that looks a little similar, it’s deeply upsetting, even if it is completely different. In other words, we got mugged last October, so when we see someone get mugged on TV now, it brings back all of the old memories and makes us nuts, even thought there’s no one holding a switchblade demanding our wallets. But you know the funny thing about this kind of stress? Sometimes it makes people a little crazy. It make them go looking for the mugger with a baseball bat. And do you know what they do when they find them? Revenge. Sweet revenge.
2. Jose is pretty BS after last night’s debacle. And you know what that means? Yup, he’s going to take it out on Tony Castrati.
What TC says: "The fans scolded him, the way they would have scolded Grady Little if he ever had been allowed to return. "
What TC means: See they should have brought Grady back. Same difference. That guy was so cool.
What TC says: "Terry Francona made the wrong decision at the wrong time against the wrong opponent"
What TC means: If I was managing, I would have made the wrong decision at the right time against the wrong opponent. That would have been way better.
What TC says: "So what do Red Sox officials do now, fire this manager, too?"
What TC means: You can’t fire the reporters so fire the manager. Go ahead…you fired Grady for it so you can’t be hypocrites now. I mean it’s not like Grady was an awful game manager who was chronically underprepared long before game 7 or anything.
What TC says: " Francona had nothing to do with that . . . until now."
What TC means: Last night’s game opened a rift in the state time continuum that allowed Eurona to travel back in time to Game 7, where he had one mission – to stop Grady Little. But instead, he just looked at him and said. "That’s some good managing Grady."
What TC says: "In the end, the damage here is minimal."
What TC means: But the sky is still falling down.
What TC says: "And those who forget history are condemned to repeat it."
What TC says: You know, I completely forgot about World War I. I mean, I know it existed, but I don’t know what happened or who was in it. It thing that means there is gonna be another big war between some countries, some place about something soon, maybe between Mexico and Peru or something.
3. After last night’s debacle. Pedro Martinez made a puzzling comment. According to the Globe he said "I just tip my cap and call the Yankees my daddy." That sound really weird and almost defeatist, if you don’t know that Pedro calls the Toronto Blue Jays "Mommy," The Chicago White Sox "Ramon," and the Seattle Mariners "Jesus."
I’m Jose Melendez, and those are my KEYS TO THE GAME.
Friday, September 24
From SoSH: Re: Sept 24 - No more Mister Nice Guy
1. Jose watched the game last night from the glamorous .406 Club where Jose is pretty sure the four beers he drank cost more than his watch. Despite the Sox loss, this visit to the .406 club went far better than Jose’s previous visit. At least this time no one got fired. Jose’s only other appearance there was in 2001 at a Sox-Yankees game, and the coworker who brought him was fired for abusing client relationships. Jose went undisciplined. Actually, Jose is pretty sure that they’d wanted to get rid of the guy for a long time and this was their excuse. (Note: Could the Sox use this as an excuse to axe Dale Sveum?
Henry: You used your influence to go to a ballgame.
Sveum: Um…I work at the games.
Henry: That’s no excuse, you’re fired. Go home.
Sveum: You’re sending me home for no good reason.
Henry: Now you know how it feels.)
Jose went as the guest of SoSHer Lefty on the Mound, who also took the hint that John Henry would not, and gave Jose a ticket in order to increase the chances of a Sox win to 80 percent. (Note: Jose got his playoff ticket rejection today. Good to see, they’re taking the playoffs seriously.)
Now Jose knows what you’re thinking. You’re thinking “Jose the Sox have lost the last two games you’ve attended. Are you bad luck now? Should I take the playoff tickets I was planning to give you and give them to orphans instead?”
No! There are two perfectly reasonable explanations either of which should make you feel good about giving Jose tickets. First, the last two games Jose went to, both losses were the only two times this year Jose sat in elite seats, the .406 Club and on the monster seats. So when Jose sits with the people in the bleachers or right field, the team is 9-1. Jose is, after all, a man of the people.
The second, and far more likely possibility is that since Jose was on to a new cycle of ten, he had two losses to spend, and he just spent one. In other words, since the Sox went 8-2 in Jose’s first 10 appearances, they will go 8-2 in the next ten. Since they are now 0-1, that means they will go 8-1 in the next nine Jose attends this year. Therefore, if they lose tonight (Note: Jose will be in the bleachers) any other game Jose visits this year is a sure thing!!! Don’t bother checking with a statistician, just trust Jose on this. It’s not like he failed his Statistics 112 final. (Note: He got a D+. Stupid Analysis of Variance.) So send along those offers.
Unfortunately, Lefty on the Mound had a really bad cold last night and left around the 5th, leaving Jose do watch the game with two Dominican brothers, both named Manny, who work with Lefty and have a brother named Ranier who plays A Ball in Billings, Montana for the Reds. This means that when they visit their brother. He can introduce them “Hi, I’m Rainer, this is my brother Manny and this is my other brother Manny.” But clearly, Jose watched the game with two Dominican brothers and not two clearly insane people. (Note: He did watch an insane person pitch for the Sox, however.)
Today Lefty on the Mound is one of JOSE’S PEOPLE.
(Image of Lefty and his father playing catch.
(Voiceover) “Lefty on the Mound used to play lots of ball. That was back when breathing came easy. But on September 23, something went horribly wrong.”
(shift to footage of lefty hacking)
All of a sudden, even watching the game he loved to play became a burden to heavy for one man to bear.
As his Bronchia spasmed, so did the pitching of his beloved Red Sox.
(Cue footage Tejada launching a missile up over the monster. Cue song “Leaving on a Jet Plane”)
His score card unfinished, his peanuts uneaten, Lefty left the game he loved at the midway point, simply unable to fight off the illness that was overtaking him.
(Cue shot of empty seats, fade to pair of baseball gloves lying in a back yard, unused.)
Today Lefty is recovering, but the game can never be recaptured, the events can never be undone, and the pain, it lingers, lingers like smoke, lingers like the taste of garlic, lingers like BK Kim fastball, always there just below the brave face he puts on.
That’s why Lefty on the Mound is one of JOSE’S PEOPLE.
(Note: Maybe this KEY can’t be of the highest quality, but it can at least be far too long!!!)
2. Today Jose begins what may become a weekly feature, the Eric Kneel Neighborhood Watch. The idea is that just like a real neighborhood watch, we work together to make sure nothing is stolen.
What Eric Kneel says: “The difference between good snarky (Jon Stewart) and bad snarky (Dennis Miller)”
Who Eric Kneel should have cited: Daniel Manus Pinkwater author of The Snarkout Boys and the Avocado of Death,” and “The Snarkout Boys and the Baconburg Horror.
What EK says: “A guy's got to be good. Numbers count.”
Who EK should have cited: Bill James, Eric Van, that weird guy of Duquette’s with the alligators, Karl Rove and possibly this bookie named Bruno.
What EK says: His name means "friend of God,"
Who EK should have cited: Jesus, Buddah, Zoroaster, Zeus, Allah, Thor, Kevin Youkilis.
What EK says: “Meanwhile, the Page 2 MLB All-Star team organizing committee (which is pretty much just me) has made it clear that a recount is out of the question”
Who EK should have cited: Katherine Harris, the U.S. Supreme Court.
What EK says: “The Vladi Daddy, whose every thing, from bow-legged walk to tar-burnished batting helmet, is a Page 2 All-Star teamish sort of thing par excellence.”
Who EK should have cited: Every pretentious guy who tries to make things sound more emphatic by using French phrases.
What EK says: “The guy had the endorsement of North Dakota's governor”
Who EK should have cited: North Dakota Governor John Hoeven, potentially Governor Umlaut.
What EK says: “Fans who, if given the chance, will rip your heart out of your chest and grill it with onions, butter and a touch of garlic.”
Who EK should have cited: Julia Child. That is a Julia Child recipe, was a Julia Child recipe and will always be a Julia Child recipe. Just because she’s dead doesn’t mean you can just take it, and pass it off as your own, and with the Betty Crocker cook off just weeks away.
(Note: Eric, Seriously, good column, especially the part about Michael Barrett. Oh God, did Jose offend you? He did, didn’t he? Oh no, oh no, oh Dear God no.)
3. It’s always good to see Major League Baseball protecting the integrity of the game by banning senile old men like Johnny Pesky from the bench. Jose only wishes they had ban them last year at this time. Then Grady wouldn’t have been there for the playoffs. (Note: Johnny Pesky is awesome, Jose just needed to set up the Grady joke.)
In related news, the right field foul pole has been renamed Selig’s stick.
I’m Jose Melendez, and those are my KEYS TO THE GAME.

From SoSH: 9/23 - BAL @ BOS
1. Last night Sox second baseman Euro Bellhorn (Note: Who is not a looker. Jose can’t believe women find him attractive.) broke two of baseball’s greatest records. He became the Red Sox single season strike out king and the major league single season switch hitting strike out king.
But where was the celebration? Where was the sign on the green monster counting up as Bellhorn inched closer to the magic numbers of 161 and 162? Where were Butch Hobson’s children hugging Bellhorn, with tears in their eyes, knowing that their father had been almost erased from the record books. From now on, their father is the Sox strike out king no more. The only records Butch Hobson holds now is the most Sox games managed while high on cocaine. (Note: And Jose has doubts about that one. All of the signs certainly suggest Grady was on crack last year.) Why didn’t Bellhorn have a special glove with 161 and 162 embroidered on them? Why didn’t Special K cereal or Kmart sponsor the event? Why wasn’t the game stopped so the commissioner could present Bellhorn with a K car? Why didn’t the Bills invite him to Buffalo to run the K Gun offense? Why is there no parade down K street in Southie?
And Belhorn’s accomplishment is special. In this day and age, when so many records are tainted by allegations of steroid use, no one has suggested that Bellhorn used performance enhancing drugs to help him strike out more often. Baseball is supposed to be the sport, more than any other, that honors its records and its history. Last night that didn’t happen, and it’s just sad.
2. Speaking of records, Jose set a record for opening day merchandise sales yesterday with 0.00. That’s right, Jose didn’t even buy his own stuff on Day 1. KEYS MERCHANDISE Pretty sweet, huh? Since that is the lowest possible number, Jose can never be expelled from the record books. Interestingly, those sales figures are identical to Keith Foulke’s ERA for the rest of the year. Spooky.
3. How amazing was Orlando Cabrera’s performance last night? He went from Bogota to Boston, to hero in one day with his walk off homer in the 12th. That said, there will be a price to pay. Apparently his wife was not happy with his decision to leave her side, but The OC, our hero, was willing to risk a life time of resentment to save the Red Sox. All in all, Jose thinks it was a good trade off. (Note: Though some one needs to explain jet lag to him. It is not something one gets on a trip from Columbia to Boston, as they are in the same time zone. One of Jose’s bosses tried this once. She was frazzled at a meeting and said, “I’m sorry I’m not completely organized, I just flew in and have a little jet lag. “Boss,” Jose replied. “Jose is almost sure that Miami is in the same time zone as Boston.” In related news, Jose had a hard time getting promoted at that company.)
But what’s more amazing still, is that in addition to playing shortstop for the Sox tonight, Cabrera also appears to be pitching for the Orioles, if Jose is to believe the papers. After all, there couldn’t be more than one Cabrera in baseball right? Right?
I'm Jose Melendez, (and not two clearly insane people) and those are my KEYS TO THE GAME.

From SoSH: 9/22 - BAL @ BOS
Good news!!! Jose has a snazzy new logo that should not warrant a cease and desist order. That means that you can now get genuine Jose Melendez gear off of the blog. You know, if you want to.
1. Jose saw the lengthy Globe story on the Red Sox scalping crackdown and it made him sad. Not sad that the Red Sox are trying to halt scalping, while Jose has bought a ticket or two from a scalper, he generally hates the business, but sad that on a day when the Museum of the American Indian opened in Washington D.C., we still use an American Indian reference to describe such a despicable practice. In protest, Jose will now refer to reselling tickets at higher value as “ticket killing off entire peoples with smallpox, stealing their lands and forcing them onto reservations,” or “Ticket Custering” for short and people who sell these tickets will be referred to as “Custers.”
2. The Red Sox finally did it; they made Jose shout an obscenity in his mother’s ear. Jose was on the phone with his mother when Foulke gave up the go ahead homer. “MOTHER F*CKER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!” Jose yelled. His mother had not realized he was watching the game while they chatted until that point. After about 30 seconds of being surprised and perhaps a little appalled (Note: Though Susan Melendez has been known to use a little coarse language herself) she replied, “You’re watching the Red Sox aren’t you.” Of course, if you know Jose that was an easy guess.
The only other thing that could have made Jose scream the MF word would have been if he’d seen John Kerry on TV vowing to take as much abuse as possible or John Bradshaw Layfield made WWF champion. (Note: What, the second one happened? Mother f--).
3. The final Jerry’s list is of Clearly Insane Jerry’s, and it only has two, rather than one.
1) Jerry Sizzler
2) Jerry Sizzler
Bonus mojo to anyone who knows why this list exists. (Note: Not that Jose believes in mojo.) And no Googling it.(Note: Jose knows these KEYS are short and blah, but that’s the kind of day it is…well, long and blah actually, but the point holds.)
I'm Jose Melendez, and those are my KEYS TO THE GAME.

MERACHNDISE IS BACK ON
Check it out at
From SoSH: Re: 9/21 – BAL @ BOS
1. This was supposed to be the KEY where Jose told you about how an act of kindness secured a Sox win last night. This was going to be where Jose told you of how a SoSH poster named lushess255 took the hint that John W. Henry would not and gave Jose the ticket needed to secure victory last night, giving freely, asking nothing more than beer and chicken wings in return. But they screwed it up. A bases loaded walk, a sour pickle and the Sox bowed. That said Jose would like you all to remember that the Sox are still a robust 8-2 in games attended by Jose , so Jose will be accepting offers of free tickets from here on in from John Henry or anyone else who would like an 80 percent chance of a Sox victory.
Instead, Jose presents this first installment of Jose’s People. A look at the people whose lives have been touched by KEYS, in a style stolen from Kent’s People/Bart’s People from the Simpsons. (Note: If you say you’re stealing something it’s not illegal/wrong. Right? Right?)
(Voiceover) “ A passionate Red Sox fan, lushess255 has been to 30 games this year.”
(Cue crack of the bat and roaring crowds)
“But what happens, when the crowds…go quiet.”
(Cue violin)
“After his beloved Red Sox fell to the Yankees last Sunday, lushess255 was inconsolable. The clicking of the keyboard, the only interruption in his symphony of disappointment. Another shot at a division title…gone…
(Cue “Where Have All the Flowers Gone,” image of Sheffield homer run.)
“But in the age of the Internet, one can never truly suffer alone.”
(Cue Bonds 700th Image)
“Jose Melendez’s observation that Barry Bonds’ record breaking Home Run would be like Ben Johnson’s 100m victory”
(Fade to Johnson)
“Or Rosie Ruiz’s Boston Marathon win”
(Fade to Rosie,)
“Threw a life preserver to lushess255 and pulled him out of his ocean of despair.”
(Cue Stars and Stripes Forever fade to image of Jose and lushess255 in shaking hands in front of a waving American Flag)
“And that’s why lushess255 is ONE OF JOSE’S PEOPLE.”
2. So Jose’s merchandise got yanked yesterday for too closely approximating the Red Sox logo. Jose disagrees with this assessment, but he can understand cafepress’s desire to avoid frivolous lawsuits. But it is okay, as Jose is working with new logos that should be up in a day or two. It is ironic that this act of censorship comes as the Red Sox face their own lawsuit suggesting that they are too closely approximating a playoff team. If you’re having trouble telling them apart from an actual playoff team, just look closely for the shoddy workmanship. Also, don’t buy baseball team’s from alleys or basements in Chinatown, those are almost assuredly pale imitations of playoff teams. (Note: Yes, Jose knows he shouldn’t be so negative, and he isn’t really, but he is just plain grumpy about last night’s game, and three straight awful starts.)
3. Put the children to bed, and send off the feint of heart. Here come the evil Jerrys:
1)Jerry Falwell
2)Jerry Lewis
3)Jerry Springer
4)Jerry MaGuire
5)Jerry Tarkanian
(Were his players at Fresno really arrested for robbing someone with a Samurai sword?
6)Elbridge Gerry
(Inventor of the Gerrymander, though Gerry has a hard G)
7)Geri Haliwell (aka Ginger Spice)
8)Jerry Jones
9)Jerry Bruckheimer
10)Jerry Williams (The miserable talk radio host)

KEYS TO COMMERCE UPDATE
From SoSH: Re: 9/20 - Beat Baltimore
It's time for Jose Melendez’s KEYS TO THE GAME.
Before we enter your regularly scheduled KEYS, Jose is pleased to inform you that, by popular demand, KEYS T-shirts and other junk are now available. Jose will not sully the game thread with advertising, but all those interested should check out the blog.
1. Apparently, Sox pitcher BK Kim has entered Bad Teammates Anonymous. According to Herald scribe Jeff Horrigan, Kim had to apologize to the team’s pitchers and catchers for his shameful behavior as a condition of being called up from Pawtucket. Reportedly, before taking this step, Kim had to admit that he had a problem with being a bad teammate, and accept that he would have to focus on not being a bad teammate one day at a time. Kim will also be required to listen to testimonials from other bad teammates, describing how much their life has improved since they stopped sulking, ignoring instructions and flipping off fans.
How long Kim remains a bad teammate in recovery remains to be seen. While the programs numerous success stories receive little fanfare, its failures, notably Albert Belle and Ruben Rivera have been high profile.
2. Why don’t we bring back the Tony Castrati translator for today?
What TC says: “The New York Yankees have a better bullpen and a better lineup, and they have a better manager, too.”
What TC means: They’re invincible I tell you, invincible. I mean, we’re barely over .500 against them.
What TC says: “Curt Schilling will become what Martinez once was, a single ace against a deck stacked with kings.”
What TC means: I’m trying to catch on to the poker craze, but I still don’t quite understand the rules, and I certainly don’t realize that an ace and four kings is a kick ass hand.
What TC says: “Entering the weekend, since the start of the 2002 season, Lowe and Martinez have combined for 102 victories, more than any teammates in baseball during that span.”
What TC means: But that was then this is now. Two games is a much more meaningful sample size than two hundred.
What TC says: “Now in his eighth major league season and eligible for free agency at the end of the season, even Lowe admitted he ‘looked like a rookie.'”
What TC means: I am going to take completely out of context Lowe’s endorsement of a new facial cream that melts years away and makes one “look like a rookie.”
What TC says: Then Martinez went out yesterday and turned in an effort that could just as easily have come from Pedro Astacio, who swabbed the deck.”
What TC means: I heard on NPR that Sunday was “National Talk Like a Pirate Day” and am doing my best with naval analogies.
What TC says: “Yet regardless of what happens inside the cocoon of the two-team AL East, the Red Sox suddenly have bigger problems to worry about.”
What TC means: Panic room was on TV last night and it inspired me.
3. Since the Red Sox are playing a team that includes Jerry Harriston Jr., and Jerry Remy is, as always, calling tonight’s game, Jose Melendez is proud to present the top 10 Good Jerry’s of all time. Jose would like to thank his friends Dan and Noah who originally took on the Herculean task of ranking all Jerry’s, and then let Jose in on the work. (Note: You may remember the list of Vladimirs form earlier in the year, but the Jerry’s are where this began. In fact, a list has been on a bulletin board in the Melendez family kitchen for 10 years, though new Jerry’s have come on to the scene since then so it’s been adjusted.
1. Jerry of Ben and Jerry's
2. Jerry Remy
3. Jerry Stiller (Note: He used to be higher before “King of Queens.”)
4. Jerry Buscher (5th Fugazi member)
5. Jerry "the King" Lawler
6. Jerry Garcia
7. Jerry Only (member of band 'the Misfits')
8. Jerry Brown (The former CA Governor and Oakland mayor, not the former Major Leaguer.)
9. Gerry Ford
10. Jerry Seinfeld
Tomorrow, the evil Jerrys!!!
I'm Jose Melendez, and those are my KEYS TO THE GAME.

KEYS TO COMMERCE - Sept. 19, 2004
1. You asked for it you demanded…and Jose delivers. Yes, Jose is whoring himself out worse than Roger Clemens, though without the, you know, treason. Behind this little link
lies your source for all manner of appalling KEYS TO THE GAME merchandise. T-shirts, hats, mugs and more still to come. Go on take a look, heck even buy something. And remember all of the profits go to the Jose Melendez Foundation (Note: Literally, to pay for repairs to the foundation of Jose’s house. Okay, that was a lie, Jose rents. Jose’s keeping the profits? Are you happy? Though actually, a little kickback will go to his aunt and ace graphic designer Carol Melendez) And keep coming back for more. One of these days Jose might just add an "I’m Jose Melendez and Eric Kneel is my b*tch T-shirt." Jose bets that would be a big seller.
Jose must confess, this is a little weird for him; he doesn’t have an e entrepreneurial bone in his body. On the other hand, if it doesn’t make any money, can it really be considered entrepreneurship?
2. Jose is also thinking about starting to sell customized sets of birthday KEYS. Jose has written these for loved ones over the course of the season, no big deal. Then he saw an ad promoting customized improv shows for corporate occasions. This got Jose thinking. If loser improv comedians can do shows based on corporations they don’t work at, why couldn’t a loser blogger write birthday KEYS for people he doesn’t know? Jose figures that for $30, he could write a KEYS style poem and two additional birthday KEYS based on customized information sent by the purchaser. It’s the perfect gift for any of Jose’s insane minions. Jose hasn’t really set up a Paypal account or anything like this to actually make this possible yet, but if you’re interested email Jose at keystothegame@hotmail.com and we’ll figure something out. (Note: Jose is not holding his breath on this one.)
3. Jose is also planning to release a book version of the 2004 KEYS TO THE GAME once the season ends in late, late October (Note: You’d better believe it.) Keep looking here and at Jose’s shop after the World Series for details.
I’m Jose Melendez and those are my KEYS TO COMMERCE.
From SoSH: Re: 9/19 Pedro's kung fu is strong
1. Okay, so Jose thinks we can all agree that yesterday did not go quite as planned. In terms of conforming to the plan (a 5-3 Sox win) yesterday’s game was right up there with Michael Dukakis’ plan to capture the presidency and George W. Bush’s vow to return integrity to the White House. (Note: Or if one wants to get away from politics, it was up there with Bobby "The Brain" Heenan’s plan to end Hulkamania forever or Electro’s plan to kill Spiderman.)
If the Yankees are McDonald’s, as Jose suggested, then yesterday was the day they gave us burgers chock full of the rich intriguing flavor of E. coli, because they just killed us. That said, there’s a funny thing about forcing tainted meat down people’s throats -- it tends to result in lawsuits. So watch for your subpoena’s Yankees, because you all are getting served.
How bad did things get yesterday? Jose agreed to leave the game in the fifth inning (Note: This isn’t the measure of how bad it was, anyone would have stopped watching once it was 13-0) to go to a crafts store called Michael’s with the Melendezette. And, get ready for this, he did it without complaint. Yup, the game was so bad, that going to a super store plaza in Everett to buy cake decorating materials seemed like a good idea. (Note: Admittedly, the notion that it might result in actual cake’s being made was intriguing. The Melendezette is working today, so let’s hope this game is a lot more entertaining because if it isn’t Jose will have no one to spend the day antiquing with.
2. This just in. Carl Pavano is a d*ck. According to Gordon Edes, the Florida hurler who has established himself among the premiere free agent pitchers on the market this year, left four tickets for the much maligned Steve Bartman when Florida visited the Cubs last week. Isn’t this just an insane amount of piling on? This poor SOB can hardly be blamed for the fact that the Cubs let the next three runners reach, and then blew the final two games with their best pitchers on the mound. Unless, of course, you believe in the mystical powers of livestock.
On the other hand, this act of meanness gives Jose an idea. Next year, when the Red Sox make their first appearance at Yankee Stadium, remind Jose to leave some tickets for John Stiglitz of Oyster Bay New York. Jose will not elaborate. Okay, maybe he will elaborate a little bit. Let’s just say Jose looked into his crystal ball and saw that Mr. Stiglitz will become quite unpopular with Yankees fans this October.
3. In a rare non-Red Sox KEY, Jose would like to say that Barry Bond’s 700th home run is an unbelievable accomplishment. It now even seems probable that he will break Hank Aaron’s home run record. Whether you like Bonds, or hate him like most people, when he hits that record breaking home run, you, Jose and every one else will have no choice but to sit back and give the man his due. We will have to concede "This was an accomplishment for the ages. Not since Ben Johnson shattered the record for the 100 meter dash at the 1988 Olympics has one sportsmen had such an extraordinary achievement. Truly this rivals Rosie Ruiz’s victory in the Boston Marathon."
I’m Jose Melendez, and those are my KEYS TO THE GAME.

Location: Tawas City
Population: 1,827
Tawas City sits on the shoreline of Lake Huron and is symbolic of a small town steeped in the rich history of the state of Michigan.. The 500 block area of the old downtown district had four vacant buildings that were deteriorated and the area was considered blighted. There was also an abandoned gas station with contaminated soil from leaking underground storage tanks, as well as contamination from a former dry cleaner. Since there was no stormwater collection system, the Tawas River, running behind all of these buildings, was receiving runoff whenever it rained.
On January 16, 2007, city officials invited residents to participate in a visioning session to discuss the future plans of Tawas City. The number one goal was to redevelop the downtown district on US 23—the main commercial corridor of the community. First things first—City Councilman Dave Dickman led the council in forming a Brownfield Redevelopment Authority, and City Manager Mark Moers applied for (and received!) a $60,000 Waterfront Redevelopment Grant. The city purchased the old gas station from the state of Michigan in a tax foreclosure sale and also purchased the dry cleaner and an abandoned house. The grant provided the funds for the demolition of the buildings and the cleanup of the property. A new paved parking facility was put in, along with decorative lighting. “The DEQ led the way for us to form the Brownfield Redevelopment Authority and to apply for a grant that fit our needs,” said Councilman Dickman.
At the river bank, a 100-foot walkway with a pedestrian walkout into the river was installed. The walkway also serves as a kayak/canoe launch. To protect the environment, natural river rock was placed to stabilize the shore and a stormwater collection system was installed. This eliminates the possibility of contaminated surface water runoff into the river. A Veteran’s Memorial Park area was established, and the next stage of the development will include a recognition plaza for all veterans of Iosco County.
The city is very proud of the fact that it tapped talent from its own backyard to transform the waterfront. A local developer, Town Square LLC, purchased the 500 block across the street and demolished the vacant buildings. A mixed-use development was constructed, consisting of four commercial units on the first floor and eight residential units on the second and third floor. Again using a local contractor—Schaaf and Associates Construction—the city contributed an additional $1.5 million to purchase a third of an acre in the 500 block to construct a new city hall. Believe it or not, the city council had been meeting in the city’s library, and city hall was conducting business in a former railroad office building. The new facility features traditional architectural design, incorporating a clock tower and observation room that overlooks Tawas Bay. A 100-foot riverwalk trail was built on the bank of the Tawas River behind city hall, which connects to a new 400-foot trail behind the Towne Square development.
The city’s fire station, which sits behind the new city hall, was a very small facility that left only inches between the parked fire trucks and was considered a safety hazard. City Manager Moers knew that there was material for a steel manufactured building that had been purchased years before and never used. The city again had local contractor Schaaf and Associates redesign the building materials and construct a new building connecting it to the existing fire house, nearly doubling its size. Tawas City Fire Chief Steve Masich said, “Now the fire equipment and trucks have space to maneuver and there is room for future growth.” There was even room to bring back an old 1939 International fire truck that had been part of Tawas City’s fire department years ago.
The city has also been able to make major improvements to Gateway Park with a new handicap accessible fishing pier and boat launch. In addition, the park has new sidewalks, lighting, benches, two viewing scopes, and an extended parking area. This was made possible through a $134,000 grant from the Michigan Natural Resources Trust Fund and $110,000 from the city. Mayor Duane Walters said “It has been a challenge but a privilege to keep the city moving in a positive direction.”
Demolition of blighted structures, a stormwater collection system, and Tawas River access has been a vast aesthetic and environmental improvement for the city. Construction of a new city hall, Veterans Memorial Park, and the mixed-use development in the downtown area of Tawas City is a focal point for future businesses and has brought a vibrant new beginning to the once dilapidated downtown area.
City Manager Moers noted that “The project was a total facelift of the city, revitalizing the blighted and contaminated downtown area into something the citizens of Tawas City can be proud of. The transformation of the waterfront area for recreational use will have long-term benefits for Tawas City. This merging of public and private investments in our city is a rare opportunity that we have taken full advantage of. The city was proud that it was able to use local companies to work on these redevelopment projects. We felt it was important to our local economy to support local businesses.”

Catholic World News - March 05, 2013
At the conclusion of their recent meeting in Abuja, Nigeria’s bishops denounced threats to human life.
“The right to life is the first of all fundamental human rights,” the bishops stated. Every threat to life is a violation of human dignity. In this regard, we must not fail to emphasize that the primary responsibility of government is the protection of life and property. We denounce the fact that Nigeria remains a place where some people wantonly kill in the name of religion, a land where the right to worship is restricted only to certain.”
The bishops also discussed the Year of Faith, denounced corruption, and declared a “pastoral emergency” in the Diocese of Maiduguri, which has suffered gravely from attacks by the Islamist terrorist movement Boko Haram.
“We as a Conference hereby declare Maiduguri diocese a ‘Pastoral Emergency Area,’” the bishops stated. “In effect, we have, as a Conference, initiated plans and strategies to more directly support and sustain pastoral life in the Diocese of Maiduguri without neglecting to help other affected areas. We call on all our faithful and other men and women of goodwill to make a special commitment to this task through prayers, visits, technical assistance and!game

On the field, the husky right-hander pitched through pain to help end the club's 86-year championship drought in 2004 — then contributed to another World Series title three years later.
Off the field, the opinionated observer appeared at a congressional hearing on steroids use and campaigned for former President George W. Bush.
From a Thanksgiving dinner in 2003 at his Arizona home where Boston general manager Theo Epstein lured him back to the team that drafted him in 1986 to his retirement Monday, Schilling made his mark in a city of demanding fans.
"I think in the end, we really didn't need to sell it," Epstein said Monday. "The Red Sox were perfect for him, because he likes the big stage, the history of the game. He likes to be the center of attention. It was a good fit."
Schilling enriched that history throughout a career that began with Baltimore in 1988 when he retired the first major league batter he faced, Boston's Wade Boggs, on a groundball. He threw his last pitch in 2007, a ball on a full count to Colorado's Todd Helton in Game 2 of Boston's World Series sweep.
A shoulder injury and surgery sidelined him for all of 2008. Then, at age 42, he had to weigh long hours of rehabilitation against the alternatives — spending more time with his wife and four children and focusing on his video game company.
So Schilling, a free agent, scrapped his idea of possibly signing with a contender in the second half of the season.
As successful as he had been in 20 years of pitching for Baltimore, Philadelphia, Houston, Arizona and Boston, as competitive and driven as he was on the mound, he had stood on it for the last time.."
Schilling pitched brilliantly in Game 6 of the 2004 AL championship series against the New York Yankees just days after surgery to suture a loose tendon to his right ankle.
The procedure was repeated before another outstanding outing in Game 2 of the World Series sweep of St. Louis as Schilling led Boston to the title in his first season with the Red Sox after he was acquired in a trade a few days after Thanksgiving.
In both games, blood seeped through his sock.
"I think people will definitely remember that, but I would say three championships is a pretty big deal," said Yankees outfielder Johnny Damon, a member of the 2004 Red Sox. "It was a nice career. The writers will think about it in a few years if he's Hall (of Fame) material. He definitely took advantage of what he was given."
The bloody sock from the World Series is now in the Hall of Fame.
"It was freezing, raining, cold as hell, and the guy just had open surgery on his ankle," Boston designated hitter David Ortiz said. "A lot of people come up to me and ask me, 'Hey, he was bleeding for real?' I'll tell you what, man. He showed me a lot of guts. I had a lot of respect for Curt."
Schilling finished with a 216-146 record and a 3.46 ERA. He is tied for 80th on the career wins list and his 3,116 strikeouts ranks 15th overall. He won more than 20 games three times from 2001 through 2004.
All that may not be enough for him to get to the Hall of Fame.
But there's much more on his resume: an 11-2 postseason record, the best of any pitcher with at least 10 decisions, with a 2.23 ERA in 19 career starts. He also was co-MVP of the 2001 World Series with Randy Johnson while in Arizona.
Then there was his focus. Red Sox manager Terry Francona rarely spoke with him the day he pitched.
"The surlier, the better," Francona said. "The few times where he did speak, I remember thinking, 'He's not ready to pitch.'"
Schilling's shoulder injury came to light early in February 2008 when he disclosed on his blog that he and the team disagreed about the best way to treat it. He preferred surgery while the team wanted him to rehabilitate it in hopes of having him pitch that year.
Eventually, both sides agreed that surgery was best and he had it on June 23.
"I talked to him about a week ago," Dr. Craig Morgan, who performed the operation to repair his right biceps tendon and labrum, said Monday. "He said his shoulder felt fine. He's just enjoying being with his family. And the other thing he told me was he wasn't quite sure he wanted to put the time commitment and do four to six hours of exercises every day, which is what's required to come back to pitch."
Schilling was 9-8 with a 3.87 ERA in 2007 when he spent seven weeks on the disabled list with shoulder tendinitis. But he was 3-0 with a 3.00 ERA in the postseason.
"(He) never backed down from any challenge," Epstein said. "One of the things people didn't realize about Schill is that he was really motivated by fear. Fear of failure."
He wasn't afraid to express his opinions.
In July 2007, he said on HBO's "Costas Now" that the refusals of Barry Bonds and Mark McGwire to address speculation about steroids use are tantamount to admissions. Last September, he said during a radio appearance that former teammate Manny Ramirez "was always kind and nice for the most part, but he'd show up the next day and say, 'I'm through with this team, I want out now.'"
Now Schilling is out — leaving behind a distinguished career and moving on to a life away from the spotlight.
"The game was here long before I was, and will be here long after I am gone," he wrote on his blog. "The only thing I hope I did was never put in question my love for the game, or my passion to be counted on when it mattered most. I did everything I could to win every time I was handed the ball."
AP freelance writers Mark Didtler in Clearwater, Fla., and Maureen Mullen in Fort Myers, Fla., contributed to this report.
I’m loathe to write about digital behavior again, but since so many of you are Facebook
crackheads junkies addicts, you might find this CNN story about Facebook behavior interesting. It’s about the 12 most annoying types of Facebook users.
I’m in there. Twice. Actually, I’m in there 2.3 times.
It’s a long story, so I will summarize. If you don’t care about Facebook, don’t worry. I will summarize.
The Let-Me-Tell-You-Every-Detail-of-My-Day Bore – Posts 50 times a day. Lazy bastards who cc: their Twitter comments to Facebook are guilty of this.
The Self-Promoter – All of their contact involves telling you what they’ve posted, won or done.
The Friend-Padder – Wants to stockpile friends as if they were collectibles. I’m not sure of the purpose of this. I do just the opposite. I’m looking for reasons to be anti-social. In fact, I delete friends and keep their friends.
The Town Crier – Wants to make sure you know the sun has risen, traffic is bad and the contents of every story Associate Press will move today. An invaluable source of irritation.
The TMIer - Shares too much, i.e. location of boils, color of bowel movement, etc. Maybe that was TMI.
The Bad Grammarian – Yes, there’s bad grammar on Facebook. So what? Normal people ignore bad grammar on the Web, since so many people are posting via phones, or via phones while driving, i.e. “me.” Plus, complaining about grammar is the definition of irony on the Web, because the Grammar Police typically make grammatical mistakes in their complaint.
The Sympathy-Baiter – The poor sad sacks who want you to care about them via digital messaging, but not enough to have real life, face-to-face interaction.
The Lurker – This person reads but rarely contributes. A true Web stalker, i.e. “me.”.
The Crank – This lout complains and ridicules people, i.e “me.”
The Paparazzo – A user who posts lots of pictures, taken without permission, including ones you’d rather not see online.
The Obscurist – This person posts status updates that are meant to wry and sardonic, but aren’t.
The Chronic Inviter – Not only is Facebook the hub of their social life, it’s their social conscious, too. They invite you to join their causes, their fan clubs, etc. They won’t leave you the hell alone until you delete them from you friend list.
The lesson to take from the CNN analysis of Facebook behavior is that regardless of what you do, you’re doing it wrong and someone is judging you.

This is why I no longer am a Fakebook member.
“You know the best thing about Zombieland? No more Facebook status updates.”
I try to be funny and or informative in my updates, but fail 93 percent of the time. I’ve figured out that no one wants to know about my colon-blowing fiber logs I ate for breakfast this morning. But they were really good.
Reunion time was this summer (I didn’t go). I indulged in online stalking like Roy does. I was pleased to learn that those classmates on FaceBook, MySpace, or any other online thingy were far less “successful” than I was. It felt great. Of course I was a loser for even searching.
People are addicted to these modern toys.
This problem didn’t exist in my day, when all we had to play with was a little red wagon, and maybe a Hula Hoop.
Shouldn’t there be one for those who update/tweet during their favorite shows and type as if everyone else is watching? For example, this was an update I typed up last week:
OMG! Sylvester is co-captain of #Glee Club! LOL This show is so aptly named, don’t you think, Gleekers?
AND I’m part Obscurist – my updates are funny and witty only to me. How do I know this? I don’t get any comments

“Its All About Seizing Opportunity”
by Samar Sheth
I’m confused. I have no idea what type of medicine I want to go into, and I have no idea what type of practice I want, private or academic, clinical or basic science research, big city or small town. I think it’s a feeling many medical students feel, one of a sheer anxiousness… “Am I good enough to do this?… Can I launch a successful career?” As time has continued its march, I’ve seen that personal interactions and seemingly chance experiences have not only shaped my likes and dislikes, but of my peers as well. I also see that a little luck and being at the proverbial “right place at the right time” is all it often takes to dramatically alter or change paths. We students are not alone; even the greats of our profession have grappled with these feelings of uncertainty.
Dr. Fredrick Sparling, a role model to many throughout his medical career, is one such physician who underwent a variety of experiences that changed his view as well as helped him to have what he calls prepared luck to further his career and to mold it into something unique and something that he is very proud of.
I recently had the opportunity and privilege to sit down and talk to Dr. Sparling, former Division Chief of Infectious Disease, former Chair of the Department of Microbiology, Emeritus Chair of the Department of Medicine, and current director of the Southeast Regional Center for Excellence in Emerging Infections and Biodefense (SERCEB). An illustrious resume’ indeed.
When I walked into to his office I was greeted by a firm handshake and a warm smile. As we sat down I asked him to tell me how he got to where he is today, and his interesting and encouraging story began.
Dr. Sparling is from the rural Midwest. He went to a consolidated high school outside Chicago in a very rural area where roughly half the students were from farming families. During high school he took advantage of an opportunity to travel abroad as an exchange student to Germany. While there he stayed with an ex-Nazi family just a mere 8 years after the end of World War II. He described the experience as “life changing.” During his time abroad he realized how biased media, both American and German, could be and how a bit of skepticism was could be very useful when searching for “truth.” Upon returning home to the United States he discussed his family’s difficulty understanding what Germany was really like post WWII. He struggled to convince them that the Germany he saw during his experience was not the country portrayed by the mainstream media in the United States.
Upon graduating high school and armed with his new world view Dr. Sparling decided to head to Princeton for college. He described himself as a solid, but not stellar student. Yet, it was his curiosity and life experience that drove his success and the opportunity to attend an Ivy league college from such a Midwest upbringing At Princeton he majored in premed, driven by childhood experiences with asthma and the example of the healing powers of his family pediatrician.
He applied to a variety of schools and as a bit of an afterthought he decided to apply to Harvard Medical School. To his surprise, his admission was granted. This fortuitous and at the time “random” break would serve as a primary influence on his life and future career plans.
In medical school, Dr. Sparling improved his academic performance, although it is difficult to tell based on the humility with which he describes his life at Harvard. After completing school he began an internal medicine residency at Massachusetts General Hospital where he was one of only 12 interns. During his intern year he formed a relationship with an infectious diseases physician by the name of Mort Swartz. Dr. Swartz’s family had been killed by the Nazis during the Holocaust. He described his mentor, as gentle, having a fabulous wealth of knowledge, and an excellent teacher, never ‘pimping’ anyone. While in Boston he intentionally began to pattern his career after Dr. Swartz. He strove to develop the knowledge that he admired in his friend and mentor and became interested in the subspecialty field of Infectious Disease.
Another important influence on Dr. Sparling from his time in Boston was Harold Amos, a brilliant microbiologist, who at the time was one of the very few African-American faculty members at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Amos was remarkable in that he took the time to meet each student. The relationship he cultivated with his pupils was characterized by a spirit of gentle sophistication and a welcoming compassion. The value of this relationship was not lost on the young Dr. Sparling and the lesson would greatly influence his approach to his students throughout his educational career.
The intern year at MGH was a challenging time in Dr. Sparling’s life. His time was stretched extremely thin, with new responsibilities of patient care and an aspiring interest in research. During the fall of his intern year, many of his fellow interns had started applying for fellowships and research positions to allow them to avoid the military doctors’ draft . Although previously naive to extensive basic science research, Dr. Sparling applied as well. He initially had interest in doing research at the NIH, but was too late in applying and received an offer to pursue his last choice: working at the Centers for Disease Control Venereal Disease Research Laboratories in Atlanta. This “bad luck” would serve as a formative move for his career.
After moving to Atlanta and getting acclimated to the CDC, he quickly found his research to be mundane and “boring”. However in retrospect he said that that time helped him develop his own interests and the initiative to pursue them. He had no direction and no real mentors and eventually started going to the Emory library to read. Although many others were working with syphilis, he was not interested in the studies and trials that were ongoing. He saw an opportunity in working with the gonococcus, particularly establishing genetic systems to study the organism. He began teaching himself science out of journals and successfully published a paper as the single author. Due to his research successes at the CDC he was then invited to work in a variety of labs back at Harvard. Following another two years of research in basic microbial genetics and biochemistry, he took a clinical fellowship in infectious diseases under Dr. Swartz. He took this story to present a very important teaching point to any student interested in becoming a physician scientist. If you decide to be a clinician scientist with a productive basic science lab career, you need to pick a lab to train in that will prepare you thoroughly in the fundamentals of the work.
As Dr. Sparling approached the end of his clinical fellowship, he began a job search. While at a national research meeting, he was introduced to Dr. Joe Pagano, now the Emertius director of Lineberger Cancer center. This introduction began a dialogue in which Dr. Pagano invited Dr. Sparling to come and work at UNC numerous times. At first he questioned working at UNC, however after talking to various mentors and other graduates of the MGH program, he elected to take the position. Not only was he given clinical time, he was given lab space as well in the department of microbiology. This dual-appointment allowed him to continue to develop as a clinician-scientist, an opportunity that may not have been available without the support of both departments.
When deciding on his specific research focus at UNC, he described himself as both “lucky” and “prepared”. His background at the CDC had given him a unique skill set and a concurrent unique interest in venereal diseases research. Although his lab training at Harvard had been strictly E coli, a “proper object of study”, he decided to branch out into his old friend the gonococcus shortly after arriving at UNC, looking at the genetics of drug resistance. Jokingly he says that he was “the only clinician in the US who read the British Journal of Venereal Disease”. From the experiments conducted during his early days at UNC, based on tools and curiosity developed during his research fellowship, Dr. Sparling would launch his impressive research career on gonococcal antibiotic resistance and molecular pathogenesis.
After a relatively short time at UNC he became Chief of the Division of Infectious Disease. Following this appointment, he was then presented with the opportunity to become Chair of the Department of Microbiology, a move that was unheard of because of his background as an MD and not a PhD. For the next eight years he led the department, focusing his efforts on his research and undertaking minimal clinical responsibilities. Dr. Sparling continued to succeed in his leadership roles and again he was offered the position of Chair of the Department of Medicine. This new position change was the largest of his career. Dr. Sparling was thrust into being involved primarily in the clinical aspects of medicine, including managed care and the increasing fiscal challenges that dominated the healthcare landscape. After making the adjustment he remained as the department’s chair 10 years, maintaining a research lab, and enjoying especially the students, residents and faculty with whom he worked. After a brief attempt at retirement, Dr. Sparling has returned to the world of medicine and is now the director of SERCEB.
Dr. Sparling describes himself as “very happy” with his current position, saying that he has worked on both sides, clinical and basic science and feels that he possess the unique ability to bring these sometimes divergent entities together. He works with people throughout the US and continues to feel that UNC has the most collaborative atmosphere he has experienced. He describes his position as a “conductor” and this is appropriate…. No longer does his play the individual violin, trombone, or tympani drum, but instead he brings many groups together, all the while making “beautiful music”.
Whether accidents, gifts, or a “bunch of good luck”, Dr. Sparling has formed an extremely successful career in research and clinical medicine. Although he says he never really knew what he wanted to do, with the direction of various mentors and some seemingly fortuitous breaks, he has certainly become a success. His advice, “follow your nose and do what you do well, and then focus on the moment and you will go forward.”
As I was leaving Dr. Sparling’s office I felt much better about the somewhat uncertain process that lay ahead in my own career… specialty choice, residency, fellowship, career plans… the decisions sometimes seem daunting. Yet, I was comforted knowing that “chance”, at least on this day, had given me the opportunity to speak with someone who was no stranger to the time and chance that life can bring. And as I thought of how well things had turned out for him and potential that I saw in my own life, I smiled.>>."

For the Legs and Shoulders, Slow & Heavy Workout Series, you will need an adjustable barbell and various weighted dumbbells. Maximum strength gains will be achieved by going through a series of exercises, performed in a uniquely slow and concentrated manner to eliminate momentum and thereby allow for maximum muscle fiber recruitment. For the leg portion of this workout, you will first set out to pre-fatigue the legs before going into the slow and focused sets. This is simply done to keep your home workouts safe. Because your legs can usually handle much more weight than can many times be safely hoisted up over the head, we have incorporated pre-exhaust sets so that you will not need as heavy of a weight to put over your head to challenge them during your slow sets. You will begin the Leg and Shoulder work out with a warm up, and then pre-exhaust your legs with front lunges, immediately followed by SLOW barbell squats. Then you will pre-exhaust with reverse lunges and go right into SLOW barbell static lunges. You will then shift your focus to your inner and outer thigh area with a pre-exhaust set of side lunges and go right into SLOW dumbbell plie squats to continue exhausting the inner outer thigh area. You'll conclude the leg workout with dumbbell calf raises. Next you will immediately go into your shoulder work. The effectiveness of these shoulder exercises is not only due to the slow manner of repetitions but also to the slight angle changes of the body as you perform the exercise. You will do dumbbell front and side raises with a 10 degree anterior tilt, a posterior delt raise with a flat back to engage and strengthen the lumbar region, a seated overhead press with your arms at a 45 degree angle for comfort and safety, and conclude with an external lying rotation to strengthen the rotator cuff.The workout then concludes with a soothing stretch. Remember the overall effectiveness of the Slow and Heavy Series is not so much WHAT exercises you select but rather HOW you perform them. Get ready to get FOCUSED!!!
Legs & Shoulders Format: warm - up 3 1/2 min, legs/buttocks 30 min., Shoulders 31 min., stretch 2 min.
For the Chest and Back, Slow & Heavy Workout Series, you will need various weighted dumbbells. Maximum strength gains will be achieved by going through a series of exercises, performed in a uniquely slow and concentrated manner to eliminate momentum and thereby allow for maximum muscle fiber recruitment. The workout begins with a warm up and then immediately starts off withchest work. You will do classic exercises starting off with slow sets of dumbbell bench press and then move right into slow sets of dumbbell chest flys. After you have completed the flat sets, you will repeat the same exercises in an incline position to recruit chest muscle fibers from a different angle. Then you will have an optional slow set of push ups to perform. Note: While these exercises may not seem like anything new or different, just wait and see how the heat builds up in the chest region at this slow and focused speed.Next you will continue with Back work. You will do slow sets of two arm dumbbell rows in a table top position to engage the lumbar region as well as the upper back and you will also maintain a retracted scapular region to engage the postural muscles. Next up are pullovers and deadlifts. These two exercises will also maintain a scapular retraction to encourage good posture. This portion of the workout concludes with lower back. You will do the superman exercise to strengthen the lower back and continue with prone, supine, and reverse planks to strengthen the entire core region. You will complete the workout with a soothing stretch.Remember the overall effectiveness of the Slow and Heavy Series is not so much WHAT exercises you select but rather HOW you perform them. Get ready to get FOCUSED!!! Chest & Back Format: warm - up 3 min, chest 26 1/2 min., Back 18 min., Superman 3 min., Planks 6 min., stretch 2 min.
These workouts require a step, 4' to 5' barbell and moderate to heavy dumbbells. Ankle and hand weights are optional.Tudor Room

Analyzing this phenomenon could significantly improve the preventive efforts. In this paper we present a method for sentiment analysis of suicide notes submitted to the i2b2/VA/Cincinnati Shared Task 2011. In this task the sentences of 900 suicide notes were labeled with the possible emotions that they reflect. In order to label the sentence with emotions, we propose a hybrid approach which utilizes both rule based and machine learning techniques. To solve the multi class problem a rule-based engine and an SVM model is used for each category. A set of syntactic and semantic features are selected for each sentence to build the rules and train the classifier. The rules are generated manually based on a set of lexical and emotional clues. We propose a new approach to extract the sentence’s clauses and constitutive grammatical elements and to use them in syntactic and semantic feature generation. The method utilizes a novel method to measure the polarity of the sentence based on the extracted grammatical elements, reaching precision of 41.79 with recall of 55.03 for an f-measure of 47.50. The overall mean f-measure of all submissions was 48.75% with a standard deviation of 7%.
Suicide is a complex phenomenon that for decades has attracted the attention of scientists in different domains such as psychology, sociology and philosophy. About one million people commit suicide worldwide each year.1 Suicide is reported as the 11th leading cause of death in United states.2 It is a serious public health problem that demands attention and prevention. Although prevention is not an easy task, monitoring people’s mental health and performing early actions can reduce the number of suicides. A person at risk of suicide is likely to talk or write about his or her feelings, many times in social network sites or via email, which highlights the importance of natural language processing for automated monitoring and preventive purposes.
The i2b2/VA/Cincinnati Sentiment classification challenge is a shared task that required automated identification of emotions in suicide notes. The participants were asked to find emotions in the notes at the sentence level. This is a multi-class classification problem where each sentence can accept any of the final categories of emotion. The emotions include: hopelessness, guilt, sorrow, blame, anger, abuse, fear, forgiveness, thankfulness, love, pride, hopefulness, and happiness/peacefulness. There are also two objective categories: information and instruction. A total of 900 annotated suicide notes were used for this task, 600 of them were used for training and 300 kept for testing purposes. More detailed information about the task and the annotated data are published separately.3
In this paper we present our approach to the sentiment classification problem defined for the shared task. The proposed method is a hybrid approach that combines machine learning and rule based techniques. We designed a rule-based engine and trained a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for each possible emotion. A set of syntactic and semantic features are extracted from sentences to build the rules and train the classifier. In order to generate the sentence features we propose a new approach to identify a sentence’s clauses and its constitutive grammatical elements and to use them to measure the polarity (a quantitative measure of the positive or negative feelings reflected in it) of a given sentence.
Recently, the natural language research community has demonstrated an increased interest in the analysis of “sentiment” or emotions in text documents in different domains. Several rule based4–6 and machine learning based approaches7,8 have been developed for emotion identification in text. Lu et al6 developed a system that classified a sentence into 4 emotion categories; they applied a rule-based emotion recognizer that is based on keyword spotting and event extraction from text. A set of rules were defined by considering the relation of the verb, subject and the object of the sentence. The common actions between users of a chatting room and real life objects such as “book” or “jewelry” were extracted from web and the objects were classified into affective categories. Manual rules were then utilized for classifying a sentence based on the relation of the verb, subject and the categorized objects. Andreevskaia et al4 compared two different approaches on news headline sentiment detection: a knowledge-based, unsupervised approach with a supervised machine learning approach. The knowledge based approach uses a list of subjective words and considers the impact of polarity shifters on the word’s polarity score by defining a set of rules. Their study show that the knowledge based approach can produce high quality results with good precision while the supervised approach generated results with good recall and low precision. Cambria et al10 utilized ConceptNet11 and WordNet-Affect9 in defining emotion vectors; they used clustering techniques to find the most similar emotion vector to a sentence vector and assigned that emotion to the sentence. Neviarouskaya et al8 developed a machine learning based tool that extracts emotions from text and the extracted emotion is then used to create a 3D virtual model. They created a lexicon containing a set of trigger words for each emotion that were mainly taken from Wordnet-Affect.9
Our proposed method is a combination of rule-based and machine learning techniques. To handle the multi-class classification problem we implemented an emotion detector component for each of the 15 emotion categories (Fig. 1A). Each emotion detector component consists of a rule engine and an SVM classifier (illustrated in Fig. 1B).
The design of the rule engine applies a triple logic whereby the output of the rule engine can be 0 (the emotion is not present), 1 (the emotion is present), or 2 (the presence of the emotion cannot be determined by the rules). For 0 or 1, that would be the final decision for the related emotion. Otherwise (output is 2), the sentence will be a candidate for the SVM training set. In fact, for a given emotion the classifier is trained on sentences that were not covered by any of the rules. Thus, the rules are applied first on a sentence and if the result of the rule engine is 2, the final decision is based on the classifier’s result. This approach was taken given empirical testing showed that using the rules ahead of the classifier resulted in higher f-measure. The main components of the system are: preprocessing, rule engine and SVM classifier. Each component is explained in detail in the following sections.
Spelling and structural error correction. The suicide notes in the shared task dataset are typed from the scanned version of the original notes. The process introduced many spelling and syntactic mistakes such as using symbols or spaces in the wrong place; For example “don*t” is an example where asterisk is used instead of apostrophe and “I ‘ve” is an examples of unexpected space. For spelling correction we used Text::SpellChecker which is a perl CPANa module that deals with a block of text to correct the misspellings; it uses GNU Aspell,b a free and open source spell checker, which its main feature is that it suggests possible replacements for a misspelled word. Considering the common mistakes in the training data, we prepared a script to automatically do the required replacements. However, for the rest of the misspelled words the system requires the user to manually select from the list of suggestions.
Parsing and POS tagging. We used Stanford parser,12 to parse the sentences and Stanford tagger13 for the part of speech tagging. Stanford dependencies were utilized to extract the sentence syntactic elements (subject, verb, object, and others) in the next steps.
Name entity recognition. Detecting some of the determinative entities such as persons, locations, phone numbers and others in a sentence is necessary in our method for defining the rules. We used ConceptNet11 as a knowledge base for named entity recognition, where for example we could determine that “daughter” is a human and “desk” is an object. In addition we have used regular expression to detect addresses, phone numbers, and names.
The rule engine consists of two sets of rules for each emotion: positive rules (where if the rule premise is satisfied the emotion is likely present in the sentence); and negative rules (where if the rule premise is satisfied the emotion is likely to not exist in the sentence). If a sentence is not covered by either group of the rules it is passed to the SVM classifier for the final decision. The rules for each emotion are based on lexical and emotional clues in the sentences. The simplest lexical clues are based on the presence of common vocabulary or language expressions which people use for expressing an emotion (eg, “thank” for “thankfulness” or “forgive” for “forgiveness”). More complex lexical clues consider additional features other than keywords and will be discussed in the following sections. Emotional clues are real-life conditions that a person experiences that trigger or indicate a specific emotion. Both lexical and emotional clues were manually extracted by analyzing the training data. A few examples of the emotional clues are listed in Table 1.
In order to find the emotions, we defined a rule for each clue. A set of syntactic and semantic features of the sentence were extracted. The syntactic features include: sentence clauses, verb, subjects, objects, indirect objects, complements, adjectives, adverbs, verb auxiliaries and other grammatical elements. The semantic features include: subject or object type (eg, first, second or third person), verb tense, verb polarity, and verb argument’s polarity (eg, object polarity).
In defining the rules we considered the relation of the verb and the semantic roles in the sentence. Consider “forgive” as the main verb of a clause. If the subject of “forgive” is a first person then the emotion label will be different from when the subject is second or third person and the object is first person; the former will usually be labeled as “forgiveness” while the latter will be labeled as “guilt”. Examples of translating an emotional clue to a rule are shown in Table 2.
In order to define the rules based on the clues, syntactic and semantic features should be extracted from the sentence. In some rules only lexical features are included, while some other rules need polarity features of the whole sentence or the sentence elements. For example for category “thankfulness”, if the value of the verb belongs to “thank, appreciate, apprise ...” then the verb condition is satisfied; while in detecting “hopelessness”, when the person describes himself/herself with a negative adjective, the polarity of the adjective is considered to satisfy part of the rule condition rather than the exact value of the adjective. The calculation of sentence polarity is explained in the Polarity Measurement section. In the following sections we briefly explain how we extracted grammatical elements followed by an illustration of our approach in finding negations in the sentence. Then our proposed method for polarity measurement is elaborated. Finally our method for building a bag of trigger words for each emotion is described.
Each sentence was analyzed at the clause level. A clause is a part of a sentence which has only one main verb. We used Stanford dependencies to extract the grammatical relations. The dependencies represent the grammatical relationships with arguments of a relation being the words. The offset of an argument in the sentence is also attached to it. The sentence clauses were built from the dependencies. For example consider the generated dependencies for the sentence “I hope you will forgive me.”:
where “nsubj” is the name of the relation and indicates that “hope”(hope-2) which is the second word in the sentence is the verb and “I” (I-1) which is the first word is the subject. “dobj” is another relation that shows “me” is the object of “forgive”. Stanford type dependencies are explained in detail by Marneffe et al.14
To build the clauses, first we consider the relations that include a verb as part of the relation, such as (nsubj, dobj, cop) and build the clause by adding the verb and the corresponding element in the relation. In order to find other elements of the clauses such as subjects, objects, indirect objects, complements and their modifiers (adjective or adverbs) we loop through all dependency lines and modify the existing clauses. For example by analyzing the dependency aux(forgive-5, will-4), we add “will” to the list of auxiliaries of the verb “forgive”. From the dependency line ccomp(hope-2, forgive-5) which shows a clausal complement relation, we add the clause that has the verb “forgive” to the list of dependent clauses of the clause with the main verb “hope”. Therefore we convert each sentence to a list of nested clauses where each clause can have various grammatical elements. We consider the relations between different clauses in a sentence by analyzing relations such as “ccomp”.
Negation in this context is more complex than in other more direct genres, such as biomedical literature or clinical records, where a lot of work has been done to process negations. We determine the negated words by initially considering special relations in the dependencies such as “neg”, where it illustrates the relation between negation words and the target word. Consider the sentence “I don’t know ...”, the negated verb can easily be detected by processing the related dependency “neg(know-4, n’t-3)”. However, sometimes a concept is semantically negated but there is no direct negation relation in the dependencies. For example in the sentence “I don’t want to leave you alone”, “leave” is semantically negated and this can be determined by processing the governor clause (“I don’t want ...”).
In addition to dependency analysis, we consider the presence of semantically negative words (eg, “no one”, “nobody”, “without”) to detect negated words. The presence of the conjunctives such as “but” and “except” also can negate the meaning. Consider the sentence “no one is to blame except me.”, the phrase “no one” has negated “blame” and the conjunction “except” has negated it again, therefore overall the verb “blame” is not considered as negated and the sentence has the concept of blame.
Effective sentiment analysis of the sentences has a positive impact on the accuracy of our proposed method. The possibility that we can find “happiness_peacefulness” in a sentence with a negative tone (polarity) is very low. On the other hand a sentence with positive polarity is not likely to reflect “blame” or “guilt”.
Here we propose a novel approach to measure sentence polarity. In our approach, sentence polarity is calculated as an integer number; positive numbers are associated with positive sentences and negative sentences have negative numbers as their polarities and the polarity of neutral sentences is 0. If we consider a sentence (S) as a set of clauses(cls) and phrases, sentence polarity is calculated based on Equation 1:
Equation 1: Sentence polarity
where clsi is a clause and phrasej is a phrase in the sentence such as noun phrase or adjective phrase which is not included in any of the sentence clauses with a verb. The polarity of each clause is calculated as the sum of the polarity of the verb, objects and the complements (Equation 2):
Equation 2: Clause polarity
where “verb” is the lemma of the verb of the clause that can be a phrasal verb also, “obj” can be the direct or the indirect object and “compl” is the complement of the clause.
The polarity number for the individual words is acquired from the Subjectivity Lexiconc which contains the polarity of approximately 8000 English words. More explanation about the lexicon can be found in Wilson et al15. The polarity can be +1, −1 or 0; and the intensity can be weak or strong. Considering the intensity of the polarities, we define the initial polarity of each word as an integer between −2 and +2. If a word is negated the polarity number will also be negated. In addition to negations, we incorporate the impact of other modifiers such as adjective or adverbs (eg, “good”, “terribly”) on the polarity of a word. Consider the phrase “poor children”: although the polarity of “children” is 0, when incorporating its modifier the polarity will be −1. Based on the proposed algorithm, the polarity of the phrase “truly sorry” is −4, since the polarity of “sorry” is −2, and the polarity of “truly” is +2. The algorithm whereby we calculate the polarity of a single word considering its modifiers is presented in Table 3.
In order to build the rules based on lexical clues, we need to utilize a list of possible trigger words for each category. For example, one of the rules to detect “happiness_peacefulness” is to look for adjectives describing happiness or joy within the complements of a clause with a first person subject (eg, “I am happy”). In addition, while processing the emotional clues aside from measuring the polarities, for some rules we need to consider the base values (lemma) of the sentence elements and limit the range of acceptable values. For example, to satisfy this emotional clue: “If the continuation of life appears to be impossible for the person.”, the verb of the clause should belong to the following set of verbs and their synonyms: {“go on”, “continue”, ”stand”, ....}.
We generated the list of triggers by collecting the words from different resources. For some emotions we prepared a list of seed words based on the words with the highest TF-IDF(Term Frequency-Inverse document Frequency) in that emotion from the training data and expanded the list using Wordnet16 synonyms. A large number of keywords are also from Wordnet-Affect.9 For some other emotions we collected the possible triggers by selecting all the sentences with the target emotion and extracting the verbs and complements. The collected words are stored into the database with the corresponding part of speech.
In each Emotion detector component shown in Figure1 a trained SVM classifier is utilized. First the rules are applied on the sentences in the train set and those that are not covered by any rule are used as instances for training the classifier. We used SVMLight17 library with polynomial kernel to train 15 SVM models, one for each emotion. For each sentence, the following attributes are calculated:
We evaluated the performance of the system based on the gold standard released by the challenge organizers. There were 600 training notes and 300 test notes. The system performance was measured using micro-average of three standard measures: recall (R), precision (P) and F-measure (F). We present the system performance results for different experiments in Table 4. We compared the performance of the system when we just applied rule-based or machine learning methods with the experiments where we applied a combination of both. In one experiment (ML only), we applied machine learning to a limited number of emotions for which the classifier generated acceptable results (love, guilt, hopelessness, information). Then, in order to incorporate other emotions, rules were first applied and classifiers were utilized in 4 emotions with acceptable classification results (Rule+ML1). The system performance was tested in another experiment (Rule+ML2) while the rules and the classifier were used for all the emotions.
For a given sentence, true positives are the number of emotions that are both assigned by the system and exist in the gold standard. False positives are the number of emotions that are assigned by the system but do not exist in the gold standard. The emotions that are assigned to the sentence just in the gold standard but not by the system are considered as false negatives.
Using machine learning without rules resulted in micro-average f-measure of 41.96%, while using rules alone resulted in the f-measure of 45.95%. Then we applied the combination of machine learning and rules (Rule + ML2) for all emotions and the f-measure increased to 47.36%. In the Rule + ML1experiment where we removed the emotions with small training instances (eg, “abuse”) we had 0.14% increase in the performance and reached to 47.50% of f-measure.
As shown in Table 4, the f-measure increased by just by 1.55 percent when we applied the classifier over the rules’ results. This can be due to the fact that most of the sentences that have obvious lexical clues are handled by the rules and the classifier could not handle the more complicated sentences to significantly improve the results. We observed that using SVM for some emotions like “blame” generated more false positives than true positives which resulted in overall reduction of the performance, forcing us to just use rules for those emotions (all emotions except love, guilt, hopelessness, information). We also limited the number of rules for those emotions since rule engine also generated high number of false positives. Although in the training data the system could find true positives, the rules were not enough to cover the test cases for some emotion categories (hopefulness, blame, anger and abuse) which caused their result to become zero. However we could eliminate zero results for some categories by doing further tuning on SVM parameters and applying the classifier on top of the rules for all the emotions (Rule + ML2).
In general, dealing with the subjective data that contains ambiguity is a challenging task. For a given sentence two different persons may find different emotions while there is no obvious clue or difference in the context of the sentences. In this task the sentence level inter-annotation agreement is reported as 54.6%. This ambiguous nature was the source of a large part of the false positives and false negatives of the system. For example the sentence “please forgive me.” was tagged as reflecting “guilt” in many of the notes, while in some other notes there was no emotion assigned to it.
Some of the rules in our system are based on the lexical clues and mainly are based on the presence of some trigger words or phrases. However, based on the training data, some emotions share common triggers; for example “sorry” is common in the sentences with “sorrow”, “guilt” and “hopelessness”. In addition some of the emotional clues are also common between different emotions. There are delicate semantic differences in the context of such sentences that leads the sentences to reflect different emotions; many of such differences are handled in the defined rules and the unhandled cases caused part of the system errors.
As we explained in the Methods section, the rules are defined based on the extracted semantic roles in the sentences which are defined based on the output of Stanford parser. Part of the system errors are related to erroneous dependencies in the parser output that partially are caused by the nature of the sentences that contain many grammatical errors.
Furthermore, a large number of false negatives are caused by using just a limited number of rules that were based on the most obvious clues. By extracting more emotional clues for each category and defining the corresponding rules, many of the uncovered sentences will be handled and the performance can be improved.
We presented our approach in sentiment analysis of the suicide notes which is submitted to i2b2/ VA/Cincinnati shared task 2011. The task required finding the possible emotions in the sentences of suicide notes. We proposed a hybrid system that utilized a set of defined rules and trained classifiers for each emotion. A set of syntactic and semantic features were extracted from sentences and were used as classifier features and also in defining the rules. We proposed a new approach for measuring the polarity of a sentence by considering the relationships between the grammatical elements of the sentence. In addition, an algorithm was proposed to extract the sentence clauses and the constitutive grammatical elements.
We have reached an f-measure of 47.50% with precision of 41.79% and recall of 55.03%. As we discussed, there are delicate semantic differences between some of the sentences reflecting different emotions; we handled part of them by defining the semantic features. Adding more syntactic and semantic features for training the classifier can improve the performance of the SVM classifier. In addition we plan to improve our proposed method in semantic role extraction from sentences. Utilizing logic and reasoning and generally automating the process of the rule generation are other future plans to explore.

District names Dexter teacher as Teacher of the Year
June 13, 2009
By Cheryl Rodewig, The Bayonet
Story Highlights
- "These are my kids. They're my legacy," Koon said.
- Koon introduced sport stacking, a competitive sport where participants stack cups quickly and carefully in varied formations, to the Fort Be
Pam Koon, who teaches physical education at Dexter Elementary, was named the 2009-2010 Teacher of the Year for the Georgia/Alabama Domestic Dependent Elementary and Secondary School district.
Koon began as a teacher in Muscogee County in 1975 but decided to transition to Fort Benning in 1981.
"And I just loved it," said Koon, who has taught physical education at Dexter Elementary for the past 28 years. "I felt like I had come home ... like I fit right in, and I've been very happy."
In Koon's class, P.E. isn't just running laps or doing push-ups. Koon has a more "connected" approach, said Dr. RenAfAe Mallory, principal for Dexter and Wilson Elementary.
"A lot of people think P.E. teachers teach only P.E., but she does so much more," Mallory said. "She uses what she teaches (kids) in P.E. as a platform to support academic programs. She finds out what they're doing in the classroom then, when she forms her lessons, she also incorporates what the teachers are teaching, whether it's math or vocabulary. Her focus is so much on the children. She's amazing; she really is."
"These are my kids. They're my legacy," Koon said. "I try to do everything to make a child the best person that child can be: all around balanced, physically, mentally, emotionally, socially.
"I knew one little boy played baseball, and I asked him, 'How is your team doing'' and he said, 'Why do you care'' I said, 'You've hit the nail on the head. I do care.' I do care about what you do when you leave this school, what you do after school, what you do on the weekends. I do care. And I want you to do the right thing. That's why I'm up here doing what I'm doing, because I care. I just feel like that's my purpose. It's my heart. It's everything."
When she's not teaching physical education, Koon works with students to help them catch up in their studies and leads brain-based activities in other teachers' classrooms.
She also teaches sign language and, after school, knitting. With a small group of students and teachers, Koon has helped knit caps and blankets for children in the community.
Koon said she wants students to learn the keys of success. She promotes the core subjects, technology, goal setting and good manners to help students grow to their full potential.
That's part of why Koon introduced sport stacking, a competitive sport where participants stack cups quickly and carefully in varied formations, to the Fort Benning community.
The activity "makes your brain work better" and builds confidence, Koon said.
"Everybody can do this," she said. "I don't care (if) you're not that good in sports or you don't like sports or whatever - you can do this."
Another idea that integrates movement with learning, the Feeling Good Mileage Club meets twice a week before school to walk around the track. Koon started the club to let students gear up for learning with exercise.
"It's a good time to get energized, to get your brain ready for learning, to get your blood flowing. It's a good time to walk and talk with your friends," she said.
While they walk around the track, students may count in twos or discuss shapes in the clouds to incorporate thinking with physical activity.
"It all works together," Koon said. "If you've got the body involved, you're going to make the learning more meaningful, and it's going to go in your brain better. And it just makes it more fun."SEATTLE — Online retailer Amazon.com Inc. is selling an ad-laden version of its Kindle 3G e-reader, which has wireless service for downloading books.
Amazon said late Tuesday that the new Kindle 3G with Special Offers costs $164. It includes on-screen ads and is $25 cheaper than the standard Kindle 3G.
Last month, Amazon started selling a Wi-Fi-equipped Kindle with ads for $114 — $25 less than the standard Kindle with Wi-Fi.
The announcement came the same day that Barnes & Noble Inc. introduced a cheaper version of its Nook e-reader with a black-and-white touch screen. At $139, the new Nook shows the book seller is trying to compete with Amazon and Borders Group Inc. on e-reader prices.
Amazon has consistently lowered the Kindle's price since first releasing it at $399 in 2007.

i love hydrangea, whether in my garden or potted on my kitchen island. i don’t mind if it’s white, green, pink, blue or purple (yes, hydrangea is about the only thing i like in purple)…there really isn’t anything like it.
this time of year the hydrangea’s are bursting and abundant- it just makes me happy!

It's called the Curve Master:
It looks awesome in the video. Have any of you tried it?
I even found one on eBay that supposedly will work with our vintage Singer slant sewing machines.
Wish I seen this a few months ago.
That looks like a great tool. I haven't even done curves yet, well not many. This may let me try at least.:thumbup:
I've seen it demod at a quilt show. I still haven't gotten one yet, but intend to.
Yes, I bought one at a quilt show several years ago, because the person demonstrating it did such an awesome job of the curves. But to be honest, I can do better with just my regular 1/4" foot. I found I had more control guiding the fabric under my 1/4" foot with a stylus than the curve master did with the wider foot. But, it's not so expensive that if you try it and don't like it you would have lost a lot. Good luck!
I got one and like quiltmom04, find I do better with my 1/4 foot. I think the demonstrator does well because she has done it thousands of times. I pin it both ends, the middle and then in between again, 5 pins total, sew slowly and they turn out perfectly everytime.
I watched it demoed at a quilt show a couple of years ago. I bought one, but have never used it.
As always, I am so glad I asked about something here on the QB before purchasing! quiltmom & dottie your input is very helpful - thank you! I guess it would be wise to do more practicing with a 1/4" foot before looking for a magic solution. :o
I have one and have used it a couple of times. It's ok but find that I can do just as well with a regular foot by just slowing down a little bit when sewing.
I bought one and made a perfect sample the first time...never could make another one as good.PattiSue Plumer begins her first season coaching at Stanford.

(what a guy huh?)
I agree w/pp about the group deminishing because of this silly rule.
They are denying your love of learning of God because you wish to nurture your child the way God intended?
Doesn't seem very Christ-like to me.
Hey, do you think Jesus was fed efamil?
Sorry- off topic there for a second...
hope this helps
10 Yet you drew me forth from the womb, made me safe at my mother's breast.
i like this one!
This would be really hurtful to me. Good luck.
"Can a mother forget the baby at her breast and have no compassion on the child she has borne?"
The passage goes on to say "Though she may forget, I will not forget you!" which to me means that God's love is even stronger than a mother's love--and that's no small thing!!!
If the "bible study" group doesn't change their "rule," I'd be out of there. I don't know how much benefit their interpretation could be if they don't even believe that God made breasts to nurture babies.
Here's another website about why the church should promote breastfeeding:
Go get 'em!
Ruth, single mommy to Leah, 20, Hannah, 19, and Jack, 13(homeschooled)
Moses mother was brought to the palace to NURSE Moses, since, of course, the Pharoah's daughter could not. She was his nanny, but also fed him.
I am sorry you are having such a difficult time.
><<
If so, I would say if "distraction" were the cause for concern than there could just as well already be enough of it. Forget breastfeeding.
I say, in a bible study group-if the group has mothers already coming, they should be understanding to distraction as it is! Any group with parents should know better!
If it is mixed, throw a blanket over to be discreet is what the rule should be if any. I don't see why babies should get the bad end of the stick for the sake of learning a bible lesson. If my kid HAS to be taken away from me for me to learn and fellowship-then I need to take myself and my baby out of there . If it isn't a mixed group thn that is just weird. You would think mothers would be more understanding?
><<
.
Is this statement suppose to be funny!
I like what onlyboys had to say!
Seriously though.
I know it would be a great feat of strength to stand up in front of the group and express how you feel. I know because I have been there. Not in this particular situation, but similar.
Might I make a suggestion to the letter?
Write it out- all of it, all that you feel and really let loose!
Then, go have a cup of tea, stretch out on the couch and sip it and re-read the letter.
Think about what you are trying to accomplish here. You want to change the poilcy? Or just let them know they stink and you're not going to attend because of this policy.
If they really cared about you and your feelings, they would welcome the much needed advice and consideration for those women who pride themselves on nurturing their children this way.
If they value you as a member of this group, they would open their hearts to understand just how painful this type of discrimination is and how it cannot be tolerated.
If they find this type of mothering, which is as old as time, to be offensive, then perhaps they are the ones who need to change. They're only possible objection to breastfeeding past 6 months is their own dysfunctional sexual self. They beileve that there must be some perverted sexual relationship between mother and child if they nurse past 6 months.
Those people who feel that there are problems with nursing past 6 months are the ones who need to seek therapy to overcome their immature sexual feelings to the event.
Lastly
Forgive them. I think that is tougher than standing up in front of the group and giving them all a raspberry!
Rise above mama and let them know they cannot treat others this way but you are willing to forgive their transgressions.
Then rewrite the letter.
Gently.
Or.....
you can tell them all to jump in a lake and laugh like hell at my previous post! I'm okay with that.

"Yet You are He who brought me forth from the womb; You made me trust when upon my mother's breasts."

I am for contacting the pastor of the church and letting them know about their "new policy".
What state are you in? They are probably violating state law as well.
Please let us know what comes of all of this.
Maybe someone had an attack of Milk Pride ( remember pride is one of the 7 deadly sins) its a condition where one becomes a bit unglued when they encounter a Mom who is nursing longer than they did. Then they begin the dirty looks, snide comments etc.
Seems to me there are biblical references about bf until age two. So 6 months is barely getting started. You can check the legal section at lalacheleague.org to see if your state has bf support laws and even if they do not, the common theme is that a mother can bf anywhere she is allowed to be. Wow to whomever thought up this rule...

Anyone Interested In/own Junior Golds? Outlook: Funding, Exploration Etc.
latest from Stock Research Portal Blog:
An article titled 'Junior Gold Stocks: Bent, Not Broken' by Scott Wright of Zeal Speculation summarizes his views on Junior Golds - where they have been and why, and where they are going. In summary, Wright says:
- in the past several months even though gold has been strong, the risk capital that usually finds its way into junior gold explorers has 'all but left the scene';
- junior gold stocks typically lag gold and even the larger gold stocks over the course of an upleg since institutional investors usually can't buy them. Accordingly, rallies in these juniors are ignited when the enthusiasm of individual traders takes hold in the latter halves of uplegs;
- measured by the S&P/TSX Venture Composite Index (CDNX), the gold juniors have fallen by 80% from its 2007 high before finally appearing to have hit bottom this past December - and this in a period when the gold price has been strong;
- decimated stock prices and fleeting investor interest is a bad combination that does not bode well for the futures of many of these juniors. Ultimately they rely on bullish sentiment to survive, and (in Wright's view) many will now be strained to stay their course. Stated another way, selling begetting more selling has driven the stock prices of many gold juniors to alarmingly low levels over such a short period of time it has radically changed the landscape for junior gold stocks. For some of these companies the damage may be irreparable - with capital (new equity infusions) leaving the junior sector being 'deadly for the survival of this species';
- Wright?s believes his latest round of research on over 300 gold juniors has revealed 'just how rotten the environment' is for this sector. He says 'what I found was frightening'. Only 3% of junior golds had market capitalizations over $300 million (the floor market capitalization of 'small cap' per Investopedia.com) and only 15% had market capitalizations between $50 - $300 million (the definition of a micro-cap per Investopedia), leaving 82% being defined as 'nano-caps'. Taking this further, Wright found just over 50% of all junior gold stocks have market caps under $10m;
- 85% of all junior gold stocks are currently trading under $1 per share, 75% are trading under $0.50, 59% are trading at less than $0.25, and nearly 40% are trading under $0.10;
- using 3-month average volume and the average share price for all the nano-cap juniors, the average daily trading value per stock only amounts to $44,000, and $18,000 for the 'under $10 million market capitalization' juniors;
- when it comes to investor awareness, without a major discovery Wright believes 'the smaller a company is the harder it is to attract interest', that a company's share price impacts their ability to raise capital going forward, that a company can release only so many shares to the market without disrupting share capital provisions and 'diluting the heck out of existing shareholders', and if a junior tries to raise capital with an over-ambitious offering size relative to its market cap and existing shares outstanding it simply won't find the subscribers. To Wright this means that 'many juniors with super-low share prices will have a difficult time raising capital in today's environment. And if they are able to find subscribers to new shares, they aren't likely to raise significant-enough capital to fund costly exploration programs';
- Wright concludes 'the fact of the matter is it will be extremely difficult for many juniors to flex enough muscle to obtain the capital necessary to fund multi-million dollar exploration campaigns when they are so small';
- according to the Metals Economic Group, junior equity financings were down by $6 billion in 2008, with the juniors' overall share of worldwide exploration, falling under 50%. Further, with the magnitude of equity financings likely to decrease even further in 2009, there is likely to be a contraction in gold exploration which Metals Economic Group thinks will be in large part from lack of spending by the junior miners; and,
- those juniors that don't have cash will not be able to tap the equity markets in the fashion in which they had in the past, and those that do have cash will 'reel in spending to conserve capital'.
Having commented on what he sees has happened in the junior gold sector (which is consistent with how I see it as well) Wright then draws the following conclusions:
- many juniors will not be able to survive these current economic conditions. Those whose stock prices have 'cratered' and have little cash 'are in big trouble';
- a slowdown in exploration is 'smashingly bullish? for gold's long-term fundamentals. The gold mining industry is already struggling to keep up with growing demand. Less exploration means less discovery, which in turn reduces the ability for gold producers to renew their reserves and build new mines;
- the extremely low market caps of the junior golds will open the door for acquisitions, and a noticeable consolidation in the junior gold stock sector is likely;
- those 'elite juniors' with superior management, high-potential projects, and sound financials (among many important fundamentals) will be the ones to survive and thrive. Those 'select' juniors will be able to overcome the current 'malaise' and eventually provide investors with the spectacular gains they 'should expect in this high-gold-price environment';
- the role of the junior golds in the gold lifecycle has not and will not diminish, as most of the big gold mining companies can't generate enough organic discoveries to sustain longevity;
- some of the best geologists in the world work for or run junior gold explorers, and these 'rock jocks' need to explore for gold where geopolitics and geology may not always be favorable;
- as a result, while the junior gold sector may seem dead, Wright believes that now may be 'the best time to consider speculation in this sector';
- as for picking the junior gold stocks in which to speculate, Wright believes quality is more important now than ever before. Irrespective of their current market capitalizations, the 'elite juniors' able to maintain fundamental integrity will recover from their highly-sold-off levels;
- with strong gold prices it is only a matter of time before investors return to the junior gold sector. Wright believes that those investors who buy the 'elite stocks' at the current 'insanely-low levels' will likely score legendary gains.
Setting aside whether 'Wright is right' with respect to now perhaps being 'the best time to consider speculation in this sector' and the possibility of 'legendary gains', I believe Wright is correct with respect to what is likely to transpire in the junior gold sector by way of consolidation, and what the future likely holds for that sector. For those readers interested in junior gold explorers the StockResearchPortal website is well suited to help ferret out what Wright calls the 'elite junior golds'. As I have said in prior posts, I consider those to be ones that meet the criteria of having cash on hand to fund at least one year's operations, and having what appears to be - or pursuant to a pre-feasibility study has been likely determined to be - a commercially viable NI 43-101 Resource or Reserve located in a stable, mining-friendly, political environment physically close to both external infrastructure and third-party ore processing and refining infrastructure.
I recommend readers take the time to read Wright?s article in its entirety and in context. I consider the time will be 'time well spent' for those interested in the junior gold sector.

Mark To Market Dead
The FASB has made it “easier for companies to use their own models, estimates and judgment in determining the ‘fair value’ of their assets.” The Stock Research Portal concludes that this change to mark-to-market means that “The world stock markets may go up in the near-term, but changing accounting rules, and hence what financial statements say, will not solve the current economic problems.”

iFixit may never be the same again as today they have announced their acquisition by Apple. Yes, Apple. Famed for taking whatever hot new hardware leaves Cupertino and reducing it to its components, iFixit will now become part of the Apple family.
As part of the deal, Apple made a commitment to produce the most replaceable electronic devices and personal computers on the market. This is a clear win for the whole iFixit community.
Apple is working hard to make devices last long enough to be upgraded or irrelevant, making repairability an antiquated notion. iFixit will become a key player in the future of Apple device development, starting with the new Smartphone Replaceability Index.

Fools. There is no Apple Press Release. If an acquisition is taken place, both companies do a press release, but this is only one, so Fools
"Or, you know, it might be April 1..."
Ugh. I fell for it.
This made me LOL. ... For like 30 seconds after I navigated away from the page. It's good to see some plain old humility on the internet. Good for you fellow Steve. And thanks for the chuckle.
Why is there no source link? You guys should put something like "Source: {link}" under the "More of: [link], [link]" line. Also, iFixit already took the prank down- couldn't find any mention of it on their site.
Not sure what you're looking at but ifixit.com is completely different - for the prank. try again. And didn't really think there was a need. It was an email "press release" - we always put source links when - you know - it's REAL news. This is a joke.
A funny one too! Apple would never acquire an outside company to help them make their batteries user replaceable or last longer than their useful life. Lol

Apple would never make a product to be hardware friendly either, especially to replace batteries
Oops. My mistake then - I'd thought ifixit.com = ifixit.org. Sorry if I was being harsh, that wasn't my intention.
Scrolling down to the bottom of the e-mail I received from them is the statement: "(Before calling us to express your thoughts, please check your calendar.)"
APRIL 1st!
very nice
Now if only Facebook buying Oculus would have been an April's fool joke.
I agree!

How is this even remotely funny/clever?

By Jason Lesley
Coastal Observer
Georgetown County Administrator Sel Hemingway said he saw purchases that didn’t match documentation from the county economic development department while he was helping new director Brian Tucker get familiar with the county’s vendors and suppliers.
Those discrepancies led to the arrest of former county economic development director Wayne Gregory in Columbia this week on charges that he embezzled $100,000 using a county purchasing card. Gregory was the county director of economic development from 2005 until last August, when he took a similar post with the city of Columbia.
Gregory, 36, was taken into custody Tuesday morning in Columbia after officers from Georgetown County, the State Law Enforcement Division and city of Columbia searched his home. He was booked into the Georgetown County Detention Center at 6 p.m. on a charge of embezzling public funds. He was released after posting a $5,000 bond Wednesday morning.
“We were going through the transition with Brian Tucker coming on board and orienting him to sources and vendors,” Hemingway said. “In the process of contacting some of those folks, we realized that purchasers were different from what documentation we had.”
Hemingway said the discovery was made about six weeks ago. “We contacted the solicitor and everybody felt it was enough to move on,” he said. “They are continuing their investigation.”
Columbia city manager Teresa Wilson fired Gregory from his $110,000-a-year job after being notified of his arrest. She ordered a full review of her city’s economic development operations since Gregory’s arrival seven months ago.
Spokeswoman Carrie Cuthbertson said the Georgetown County Sheriff’s Office was notified by county officials suspecting fraudulent purchases. Cuthbertson said investigators found evidence that Gregory used his county purchasing card to misappropriate more than $100,000 for personal use. The maximum penalty for the crime is up to 10 years in prison, according to state law.
County spokeswoman Jackie Broach said the county administration is reviewing policies to control and authenticate transactions made with county purchasing cards. “We are also working with an external auditing service which will review these policies and offer advice on measures that can be taken to strengthen policies and prevent any future misuse of purchasing cards,” she said.
Tucker said county economic development has moved on from the Gregory regime. “We’ll let history take care of history and the courts take care of what happens,” he said. “As far as the story going forward, it’s no different from a week ago, a month ago, three months ago when I took over this position. It’s bringing jobs to Georgetown County and executing a plan to do that.”

He said National would encourage its voters in Epsom and Ohariu to give their electorate votes to Act's David Seymour and United Future's Peter Dunne respectively. While National could work with the Conservative Party if it made it into Parliament under its own steam, National would not help it get there.
"The only option to accommodate that party would be to remove a sitting MP from the ballot paper and that, as I have said, is a bridge too far. So there will be no electorate accommodation with the Conservatives. However, we are happy to consider working with the Conservative party post-election should the public vote that party in to Parliament."
Mr Key's announcement got a swift reaction from Labour leader David Cunliffe who said Mr Key was treating MMP as "a plaything."
"These parties have no electoral mandate and will return to Parliament only through blatant electoral manipulation. The Prime Minister is treating New Zealanders with contempt, using the coat-tailing provisions to abuse the system."
Mr Key also said again he believed he could work with NZ First if it returned to Parliament, but said it was unlikely Mr Peters would be given a Cabinet post. Since 2008 National's support party ministers have all been outside Cabinet and he expected that to continue while National was the dominant partner. He believed he could have a constructive relationship with NZ First. "Yes, there's lots of baggage and history there, but Winston Peters has lots of baggage and history with all sides of the House."
Mr Key has ruled out working with Mr Peters in the 2008 and 2011 elections, but changed his mind earlier this year when he first spelled out National's preferences for a coalition.
National will not withdraw its candidates from Epsom or Ohariu, but Mr Key said they would focus on the party vote only. Mr Key said he expected there would also be a lot of National voters who would vote for Mr Goldsmith, while others would decide to vote tactically. He said as National Party leader he would vote for Mr Goldsmith himself as an Epsom voter.
Despite its current high polling, Mr Key said it was highly likely National would need support parties to get a third term in government and tactical voting would help achieve that.
Earlier today, Conservative Party leader Colin Craig said he'd prefer National incumbent Murray McCully to stand in East Coast Bays, and took a shot at the deals National does with the Act and United Future parties.
Without the seat, the Conservatives have to win at least 5 per cent of the party vote to enter Parliament.
Mr Craig said he had a dim view of electoral deals, and a deal with National could have seen a voter backlash.
"I'm reasonably negative about them. I've been quite critical of arrangements like National do with Act and United Future, because I'd like to think the voters get to decide first how they wanna vote, and then politicians decide how Governments get formed."
He said he had never asked for a deal from National.
"It would help on one level, in that we wouldn't have to work as hard. But it doesn't give us a sense of independence and being our own party. On balance I think it's better for us, than if National had done something for us."
For National, pulling Mr McCully from the seat would also risk alienating liberal voters who were not fond of the Conservative Party.
But Mr Craig said he supported a third term for National, if they won the largest share of the party vote - though he could not rule out working with Labour.
If Labour agreed to the Conservative's bottom line of binding referenda, and National did not, then "that would be a very interesting scenario, and perhaps Labour would be prepared to do that".
He said he did not expect to beat Mr McCully in East Coast Bays this election.
He claimed his own polling had his party at 3 to 4 per cent - though last election he claimed to be in front in the seat of Rodney, and eventually lost by over 12,000 votes to Mark Mitchell.
"I think 6 to 7 per cent is realistic."On Mar 1, 2012, at 10:05 AM, SM wrote: >? It doesn't, of course. If the WG doesn't meet that goal, it will be clear at the time, and the WG can ask to recharter for that limited purpose. --Paul HoffmanReceived on Thursday, 1 March 2012 19:09:57 UTC

At a discussion meeting Friday morning, the ruling Kuomintang used its majority to rebut attempts by opposition lawmakers to present their favorite issues, including constitutional revisions to lower the voting age to 18.
The trade agreement with China, which was signed almost a year ago, provoked the occupation of the Legislative Yuan compound by students from March 18 until April 10. The protesters only left after the authorities promised they would first review a framework law monitoring talks with China.
The main opposition Democratic Progressive Party reacted angrily to the KMT’s rejection of its own proposals. Over eleven special sessions during the past six years, the KMT threw away opposition plans for a nuclear-free Taiwan, against the monopolization of the media, for social relief, for referendums and for constitutional reform, DPP caucus official Tsai Chi-chang said.
The opposition politician said that major issues needed to be discussed rationally during the normal full sessions of the Legislature, when there would be time for full debates and clause-by-clause reviews of all the proposals.
He warned that if the government of President Ma Ying-jeou and the KMT tried to push through unpopular measures, the DPP and the social movements would not stand idly by but organize sieges of the Legislature and other protests.
“If the KMT tries to force through its proposals, we will make sure they achieve nothing,” said DPP lawmaker Chen Ting-fei.
Members of the small opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union crowded around Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng and held up a placard criticizing the excessive organization of special sessions.
Social groups condemned the same practice at a news conference outside the legislative compound Friday morning. The special session should not approve the trade pact, the framework law for talks with China and the special law for Free Economic Pilot Zones, student leader Wei Yang said. The government versions of those items have been widely condemned as too lax and giving away too many advantages to China.
According to the schedule worked out Friday, lawmakers will review the president’s nominees for the Examination Yuan on June 16-19 and vote to approve or reject them on June 20.
A similar process will be repeated for the Control Yuan, the nation’s top government watchdog, a week later, culminating in votes about the nominees on June 27.You might consider incorporating principles of Dr. jack Kruse's Leptin Reset Prescription:You might consider incorporating principles of Dr. jack Kruse's Leptin Reset Prescription:My metabolism was totally broken....I believe that I no longer have the ability to tolerate carbohydrates more than a minimal amount.

ABOUT REAL ESTATE; HOUSING DISCRIMINATION: STUDY OF CITY IS UPDATED
By LEE A. DANIELS
Published: March 19, 1982
Six years ago, an investigation of Manhattan apartment-renting patterns conducted jointly by The New York Times and the Open Housing Center of New York concluded that racial discrimination was ''widespread'' and that it ''works to deny many choice apartments to blacks and other minority group members despite their ability to afford them.''
Does racial discrimination still occur to a significant extent in New York City's housing market? Without another full-scale inquiry, this question cannot be answered definitively. But the issue has been brought into bold relief by three recent, well-publicized incidents involving racial discrimination here.
In one, a Manhattan cooperative board voted down the purchase of an apartment by the New York Public Library as the residence for the institution's current president (who is of Armenian descent) because, one board member later explained, the board felt that at some point in the future the library might elect a black or a Hispanic person as president.
In the second incident, a Federal jury in Brooklyn found that a realty company had discriminated against a black man who had sought an apartment in one of its buildings. The jury awarded the man, an aide to the Manhattan borough president, $50,000 in damages. The sum is believed to be the biggest jury award ever in a housing discrimination case.
Finally, earlier this month, a Federal jury in Manhattan awarded a young black woman, a Yale graduate who works for a bank, damages of $38,000 after finding that a realty concern had discriminated against her when she sought an apartment.
To some, these incidents indicate that housing discrimination is indeed still widespread and affects all classes of black and Hispanic New Yorkers.
''Our callers come from the spectrum of occupations,'' said Betty Hoeber, director of the 18-year-old Open Housing Center, ''from postal workers, factory workers, clerical workers, right up to topline professionals. The fact that affluent blacks meet it is striking evidence that landlords and brokers aren't paying attention to an individual's ability to pay. They see a black face or hear a Spanish surname or accent and that's it.''
Mrs. Hoeber said that her office averaged 75 to 100 calls a week from individuals complaining of purported housing discrimination.
Isaiah E. Robinson Jr., chairman of the city's Human Rights Commission, also believes racial discrimination in housing ''very pervasive.''
''And the complaints we get are only the tip of the iceberg,'' he continued, ''because when people are looking for shelter, their first priority is to find an apartment. If they think they've been discriminated against, they're likely to feel they wouldn't be able to prove it, or that trying to prove it would subject them to retribution.''
Robert Abrams, the State Attorney General, who has brought two major housing discrimination suits in recent years, said through a spokesman that he, too, believed a sizable number of discrimination complaints were never brought.
Concern about discrimination is not limited to the apartment market. Officials in the office of the New York Secretary of State, which licenses and regulates real estate brokers and salesmen, said that about a dozen neighborhoods of single-family homes in Brooklyn, the Bronx, Staten Island and Queens were covered by special orders preventing brokers from soliciting potential sales of homes there unless a homeowner expressly allowed it.
The orders were imposed at the instigation of community groups, who feared that their areas were being subjected to blockbusting and racial steering.
There are those, however, who contend that racial discrimination is no longer widespread, and that the perceptions and allegations of it, while understandable, are not proof that it is being extensively practiced.
Leila Long, head of the city government's housing discrimination task force, stated that while racial bias in housing was unquestionably still practiced, it was not ''rampant'' when compared with conditions a decade ago. But she said that the tight rental housing market - the vacancy rate in New York this year reached a 10-year low of 2.13 percent - may exacerbate the perception that it is.
Sheldon Katz, head of the Rent Stabilization Association, which represents owners of about 900,000 rent-stabilized apartments, agreed with her assessment and added that the low vacancy rate made a true test of whether discrimination was widespread impossible.
''Most landlords have long waiting lists and they are under tremendous pressure from applicants not to abide by the order of those lists,'' he said. ''People will use all sorts of gimmicks to get an apartment.''
The 1980 census might be used to support the contention that discrimination is far less a force in the New York housing market than it used to be.
The census found that during the 1970's, the number of blacks living in parts of the city where blacks had previously lived in only small numbers had significantly increased. These areas included the Upper East Side and the Upper West Side in Manhattan as well as Staten Island and Queens.
George Sternlieb of the Rutgers University Center for Urban Policy Research said that since the passage of the 1968 Federal Fair Housing Law, there had been ''a very, very substantial decrease'' in housing discrimination, in part because of stiff penalties imposed by juries and government agencies on those found guilty of it.
However, in recent years at least two national studies - one private, one by the Department of Housing and Urban Development - found that the incidence of racial discrimination in the housing market remained significant, affecting nearly 50 percent of black home buyers and 25 percent of black renters.
Thus, the debate over the extent of housing discrimination continues. But it is a debate with set boundaries. Most would not deny that progress in reducing housing discrimination has been made - nor that further efforts are needed. As Professor Sternlieb said, ''The war has been won, but the need for mopping-up action continues.''Michael Ludwig wrote:

The case of Paul Ciancia has been forwarded to the attorney general in Washington to determine if they will seek the death penalty in the murder of a Transportation Security Administration officer and the wounding of three other people, Assistant U.S. Attorney Joanna Curtis said Monday.
Prosecutors did not reveal what recommendation was made and declined to discuss the case outside of court.
Ciancia, 23, didn't speak during a brief hearing in U.S. District Court.
Before a final decision is made by the U.S. Department of Justice, public defenders will go to Washington to present why Ciancia shouldn't face the death penalty. Chief Deputy Federal Defender Hilary Potashner said she may not be prepared to do that on the government's timeline because the defense is still receiving evidence.
So far, 10,000 pieces of evidence and 150 DVDs of material have been disclosed to the defense, Curtis said. Investigators are still looking into Ciancia's background and they have visited his hometown of Pennsville, New Jersey, and interviewed high school classmates.
Judge Philip Gutierrez said he wants to hold the trial next year.
"I'm not waiting," he said.
Potashner, however, warned that the seriousness of the charges and the volume of evidence in the complex case could delay the trial.
The next hearing was scheduled for Dec. 8.Globe-News staff
The Arbor Christian Academy Lady Lions used a strong first-half defensive effort to take down Arlington Burton Adventist, 66-25, in a TAPPS high school girls Class 3A bidistrict playoff Thursday at Arbor.
The Lady Lions forced forced nearly 30 turnovers, head coach Kyle Johnson said, and shut down Burton in the second quarter by allowing only two points.
"I think our press completely wore them down in the second quarter," Johnson said. "We wore them down to where they weren't effective at all."
The Lady Lions (16-5) took a 19-7 lead after the first quarter and were never threatened. Arbor outscored Burton 19-2 in the second quarter for a 38-9 halftime lead.
Arbor went on to win by 41 as four Lady Lions scored in double figures. Jennifer Lapp scored a game-high 21 points. Sarah Huffman had 15 points, Lexie Gremillion had 11 points, and Hannah Platt had 10 points.
The Lady Lions advance to face Colleyville Covenant at 3 p.m. Saturday at Colleyville in the area round of the TAPPS playoffs.

Ascension Academy 44, Dallas Tyler Street Christian 27: Ascension Academy had an easy time in opening the TAPPS Class 1A girls playoffs. The Lady Cardinals led the entire game against Dallas Tyler Street Christian Academy and rolled to the victory.
Ascension (22-4) applied pressure defense and pushed the ball up the floor, which was too much for Tyler Street to deal with.
Ascension's Christina Smith scored a team-high 12 points, and teammate Casey Krosson scored 10 points.
Marissa Bonilla was Tyler Street's only offensive option, scoring a game-high 21 points.
"I'm happy except for the girl who scored 21," Ascension coach Bill Hamilton said. "She hit seven 3s, so we didn't do a very good job of adjusting when she got the ball. But otherwise I'm happy."
Ascension will host Austin Veritas in the TAPPS area playoff round at 6 p.m. Saturday.

San Jacinto Christian Academy 55, Gainesville State School 35: San Jacinto Christian never trailed as the Patriots overcame early jitters to roll past Gainesville State School to open the TAPPS Class 3A playoffs and pick up their first playoff win in four years.
The Patriots (26-6) led only 9-5 at the end of the first quarter but steadily increased their lead the rest of the way.
"They were real nervous, and once the nerves went away we took control of the game," San Jacinto coach Gene Hammons said of his team. "I think defense was the big deal in this game."
Sawyer Pace had 13 points for the Patriots, who will host the Irving Highlands-Garland Christian winner Saturday.

Letter: Debt could be in Amarillo's future | Comments: 1ISRAEL HAS BEEN receiving considerable criticism around the nation and world for its recent attacks against Hamas forces in Gaza. Demonstrators in many places, including the Bay Area, have condemned Israel for its air strikes, which are designed to halt Hamas rocket attacks against Israeli civilians.
Anyone blaming Israel for the recent violence is grossly misinformed and plays into the hands of terrorists.
After Israel abandoned Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip and Hamas came to power, there have been relentless rocket and mortar attacks against the people of Israel. Since 2007, more than 5,500 rockets have been launched from Gaza.
With the end of a cease-fire last month, rocket attacks resumed with a vengeance, endangering Israeli civilians, disrupting businesses and terrorizing those within the increasing range of the rockets.
The hope of Israelis and, no doubt, many Palestinians was that peace and progress would have been the results of Israel's decision to remove Jewish settlements in Gaza. Instead, rocket attacks have ensued, and Hamas continues to refuse to recognize Israel's right to exist.
As a result, Israel has struck back. It has the legal right under international law and a moral obligation to protect its citizens from constant rocket and mortar attacks. Fortunately, barriers and strict security have sharply diminished suicide bombers from Gaza, but not the rockets.
These rocket attacks specifically target civilians, not Israeli military facilities. That is a war crime and an act of terrorism.
In fact, Hamas is committing three war crimes: targeting civilians in Israel, using civilians in Gaza as human shields and seeking the destruction of another nation.
Israel removed Jewish settlements in Gaza, has tried negotiations and agreed to cease-fires with no success in stopping the rocket attacks. That is why it is now using force.
While there have been many civilian casualties in Gaza, Israel is not targeting them. It is attacking buildings suspected of holding arms, often with warning shortly in advance of the attack. Israel also is attacking suspected rocket launching sites. In the meantime, Israel has sent medical aid to Gaza
Hamas, on the other hand, does not try to lessen civilian casualties. It keeps its own citizens near military targets to dissuade Israel from striking them.
If the Hamas government in Gaza truly wants the Israeli attacks to stop, it can do so quickly by putting an end to the rocket launches.
Hamas also could have a long-term peace with Israel by recognizing its right to exist, calling off suicide bombings, negotiating in good faith and establishing normal working relations with Israel.
Unfortunately, peace is not on the Hamas agenda. Instead, it has provoked Israel to attack and then has used the human suffering cased by the attacks to garner sympathy for itself and contempt for Israel.
It is dismaying that such tactics by Hamas have worked so well even among those who should know better.
Israel should be supported for defending itself against terrorism. It is Hamas that deserves condemnation.All recommended hotels in Dublin: B&B

Far better than the fellow tree Sudowoodo. Far better than the fellow "human" Cofagrigus. Far better than that obese pumpkin Gourgeist! And even available in the wild, without a trade (unlike that obese pumpkin who only exists to ruin its uniqueness of typing)
I just like Trevenant. Even though its name is ...simple.

What’s the thinking behind the P-5 trial?
Studies of statins and colorectal cancer risk are controversial and some conflict.
However, a study that looked back at colon cancer patients in Israel and matched them to similar people who didn’t have colon cancer found that a larger percentage of patients who didn’t have colon cancer had taken statins for more than 5 years. About half as many colon cancer patients had taken statins (6.1 percent) as people who didn’t have cancer (11.6 percent). Even after adjusting for other risk factors for colorectal cancer, including taking aspirin regularly, statin use reduced colon cancer risk by about 45 percent.
In addition, scientists looking at cell processes have found that statins block a protein that is important in cell growth. Blocking its action may prevent colon cancer from spreading or polyps from developing.
Who can be part of the trial?
Stage I and II colon cancer patients who
- have finished their planned treatment — surgery or adjuvant chemotherapy.
- are no more than 1 year past their treatment.
- have had a complete colonoscopy in the past six months and all polyps removed.
- if they are taking aspirin regularly agree to continue it during the five years of the trial.
- have not taken a statin within a month of entering the trial.
Are there colon cancer patients who are excluded from P-5?
- Patients who are regularly taking NSAIDS, except for aspirin.
- Patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)
- Patients with Lynch syndrome (HNPCC or hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer)
- Have high cholesterol levels that might require them to take a statin.
Are you interested?
- Talk to your surgeon or oncologist about the NSABP P-5 clinical trial.
- Locate a P-5 trial site and contact near you.
Phase III Randomized Study of Adjuvant Rosuvastatin in Patients With Resected Stage I or II Colon Cancer
- Arm I: Patients receive oral rosuvastatin once a day for five years.
- Arm II: Patients receive an oral placebo once a day for five years.
Patients on the trial will have physical exams every six months, a colonoscopy within 6 months of starting the trial, and colonoscopies 1, 3, and 5 years to look for new polyps.
The study is double-blinded — neither patients nor their doctors will know if they are getting rosuvastatin or a placebo.
Some study patients will also be asked about their quality of life and tissue samples will be analyzed for biomarkers.
Writing in the NCI Cancer Bulletin, NSABP Protocol Chair for P-5, Dr. Bruce Boman said,
While some retrospective observational studies suggest that statins prevent colorectal cancer, others do not. Moreover, most of these studies were short term and were not designed to look at tumor development; so the jury is still out on the efficacy of statins. What is needed is a properly designed, long-term, prospective study that evaluates tumor development, and that’s why the randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind NSABP-P-5 study was developed.
Kate Murphy says
We searched Cancer Research UK and didn’t find any trials for someone like you with stage 3 rectal cancer a year post chemotherapy.

Are there any trials / recommendations for patients with Rectal cancer – stage 3 , now in remission ( i year post chemo) . I am UK ( London) based. Many thanks.Free Universal Film Introduction MP4 Video Download

The Massachusetts Bar Association commends Gov. Deval Patrick for today signing Senate Bill No. 800 into law. The bill rescinds an early 20th century law banning same-sex couples from marrying in Massachusetts if the unions would not be legal in their own states. The bill passed unanimously in the Senate in earlier this month, and was passed by the House of Representatives on July 29.
The change takes effect immediately because the Legislature attached an emergency preamble to the bill, which waives the customary 90-day waiting period.
The MBA’s House of Delegates has long supported civil rights for all citizens, including marriage equality. “We applaud the executive and legislative branches of our state government for their leadership in rightfully abolishing a law that stripped civil liberties from same-sex couples,” MBA President David W. White Jr. said.
The MBA has a consistent record of considering and voting on issues presented by the state’s landmark Goodridge decision that legalized same-sex marriages in the commonwealth. In particular, the MBA voiced strong opposition to defining the term “marriage” as a legal contract between a man and a woman and prohibiting recognition of any other relationship as marriage or its legal equivalent.James Hindmon (1899 - 1971)

Skip to comments.Ferguson police say Michael Brown fit description of strong-arm robbery suspect
Posted on 08/15/2014 7:19:37 AM PDT by McGruff
Michael Brown, the unarmed black teenager who was fatally shot by a police officer in a St. Louis suburb, fit the description of a strong-arm robbery suspect that police were responding to the night he was shot, the Ferguson police chief said at a Friday press conference.
(Excerpt) Read more at foxnews.com ...
Not messy. Not a confused situation. Not a matter of disparate interpretation of events. Not an event worthy of national attention.
The ONLY issue that has the Victim Community upset is that a Cracker killed one of their sacred sons..
The leftist media is a pack of liars and purveyors of liberal propaganda. That’s all they are.
News saying Browns handed the cigars to his friend...being seen as an accomplice.
I have no doubt.
It also said.”
What I am struck by in this “witness statement” is the claim that the officer grabbed the GIANT ENORMOUS kids neck and tried to PULL him into the patrol car. What, on top of himself? I guess that’s supposed to be the “answer” when other for why the kid was in the car struggling with the cop, eh?
Did the cop try to pull the guy into the drivers seat with him? WTH?
Yep. And dare I say it? No justice, no peace?
Since the witness, Johnson, who says Brown was on his knees, is the accomplice in the robbery, that account is seriously damaged.
There will be a lot of egg on faces with the video from the police car is released.
I head early on that “shoplifting” of some cigars may have been a cause.
Looks worse than shoplifting.
Question; would the shop owner have been justified in pulling out a gun and shooting his attacker?.
If is him ... Stop was justified.
Rev Al ain’t gonna like these revelations. He be sayin’ “hummmmmmmmmm.” Regardless of the facts, the lynching of the officer must go on. I’m confident the facts and the truth will unfold. The Great OZ has spoken.
The black community is pushing hard ....”Don’t shoot..and Hands up”......so even if he did the robbery they’ll came he had surrendered. The Attorney’s PR machine is also pushing it with the community.
The truth never squares with what the mob says.
They both were wearing Benjamin Crump’s T-shorts the last two days.
Michael Brown is slated for sainthood a la Trayvon. The facts be damned.
Apparently the witness was the victim's buddy in the robbery.
#BREAKING: Chief Tom Jackson names Officer Darren Wilson as being the officer who shot and killed #MichaelBrown on Saturday. #Ferguson
Were did you see the pictures?
Link?
“Question; would the shop owner have been justified in pulling out a gun and shooting his attacker?”
A well applied choke hold can kill a person in under a minute. So, yes.
I’m curious if there is audio to the robbery - would like to hear if racial slurs are being used against the store owner...
The key eyewitness, however, is Brown’s companion, who was in on the robbery. Slam-dunk for officer Dennis Wilson’s defense.
even if this convenient alibi is true, if the kid had his hands up and was surrendering, the cop was wrong to execute him.
it may or may not be a good thing that this kid (who may or may not be the one in the pics) is out of the gene pool, our police officers are not judge/jury/executioners....yet.
if the cop was wrong let the criminal justice system handle it.
wopuld this situation be the same had the cop been black?
facts won’t matter....the narrative has already been written.
If he stole a cigar, he must have forced his way behind the sales counter (unless MO law is different, cigars and cigarettes are kept out of reach of children).
The welfare teat nourishes well.
You will recall that St. Trayvon was out getting the ingredients for Drank or whatever they call it.
This comment was missing the sarcasm (/s)tag, right?
yes, obviously
I bet they didn’t know he was unarmed.
Possible scenario. Brown struggles with the cop in the car. There’s a shot inside the car, Brown gets out of the car unhurt. For all the nearby policeman know, Brown now has a gun and perhaps just shot their colleague with it.
Bang bang bang.
“if the kid had his hands up and was surrendering”
Who reported that? His co-robber, Dorian Johnson?
Need big bullets for big targets.
So was he the guy that robbed someone or not? I can’t tell by this article...maybe I missed it.
Further proof that Faux News sucks.
Maybe the cop was just pissed — and shot him anyway.
I know. Michael died..
“Just saw the pictures. The guy is a giant pushing around the store owner. Looks like Brown is a scumbag.”
OK, I just looked at the robbery pictures again, along with another photo of Brown, the exact same hat and clothes. It IS the same person!
The guy in the street dead and the guy robbing the store are either 2 different guys who look just alike and dress just alike and are the same color and stature. ...or they are the exact same person. Odds are on the latter
so now he had a co-robber!
how quickly we buy into the ‘he’s black so he must be a thug’ story...
a co-robber? really?? apparently he had several co-robbers because those who were there tell similar stories.
which also may or may not be true, but the facts are not out there yet, and i have no more reason to believe the ‘police’ than the civilians.
they’ll NEVER EVER learn skeeter. It’s a deficiency.
How many Duke Lacrosses, Lil Trayvons and now Bad Bad Leroy Mike Browns have to happen before folks realize the ghetto and 95% of all Media are scumbag liars.
Now the news is saying the police dept. bungled this case the whole way -— but they have been doing their job while the media set up a false narrative. [:headwall:]
I know why Fox withheld the information. (BTW, I don’t watch Fox anymore)
However, the length of time for this latest bit of information to come out is too long.
In the meantime, they (the media reporting) are partially guilty of days of the rioting / looting in Ferguson.
I’d be wary of anyone’s account of the incident at this time, including the cop’s.
I’ll wait for the evidence to come out.
Since, undoubtedly, the Police have had this information all along, it kind of makes me sad the State Police did not have a longer opportunity to survey the protesters to find more of the bad guys but hey, most of the bad guys are known as is the case from their past. But can hear al sharptongue saying, ‘dang, get me out of town!’ and Jessie saying, ‘Whew I didn’t go there!’
Same huge B/m, same clothes, same - oh my - are those gladiator sandals?
I do not blame Fox. The rest of the media just bought the story of the crowd and kept up the what an angel the kid was. Cops do not take their pistols from the holster for no reason.
Wow! Looks like the same clothes and sneakers....
The media is going to need a faster spin-cycle for this one..

Yesterday fares for 2012 went online, and it was not a pretty picture. Fares have risen above inflation again, and on average have increased by 5.9%. Looking forward to 2013 and 2014 the forecast is even bleaker, with no movement at all on the government's plans for 'inflation plus 3%' rises for most fares over the next two years. Imagining ticket prices around 24% higher than now is enough to make a commuter shudder, but this is what is expected by 2015. We are being taken further and further away from the value for money rail service that we desperately need.
Passenger outrage is bubbling up, on Twitter and chat rooms across the web. On 3 January, the first working day back after the New Year for most people, ticket offices, train carriages and social networking sites will no doubt be buzzing with the voices of irate passengers. A coalition of organisations, including Campaign for Better Transport, is launching an action to help passengers vent their concerns in a way that gets heard by the people who make the decisions. On the first day back we're launching a 'text, tweet or call' action to give the views of commuters a platform.
Everyone has a thing or two to say about fare hikes and poor service, and it's not surprising because we have the highest fares in Europe. Fares regulation was originally brought in to protect rail passengers. However, the way the government uses rail fare policy actually brings in revenue, effectively creating a tax on those people who do the right thing and use public transport. It would be a grave mistake for the government to forget the economic, social and environmental benefits the railway brings for the whole country, not just train passengers. If policies do end up pricing people off the trains and onto the roads, as government forecasts predict they will, even people who have never used a train before will suffer from increased congestion and pollution.

Come one night you just holdin' what we said and greet the day
I've got to cool myself down from stompin' around
Thinkin' some words 'cause I can't name ya
Guess it's okay got nothing to say
Still I don't suppose I can blame ya

Posted to: Chloe MoretzCertified skating coaches, Dheeraj Utmani and Ajay Shivlani, inspired Amole Gupte to make 'Hawaa Hawaai'
Over 25 years ago, two buddies, Dheeraj Utmani and Ajay Shivlani, were enamoured by the magical game of skating. Though management students, the duo began conducting skating classes for school students.
Amole Gupte’s recent film Hawaa Hawaai that features Saquib Salim and Partho Gupte has sports as the backdrop
Their classes also served as inspiration for director Amole Gupte to make his recent film Hawaa Hawaai. Dheeraj and Ajay share their experience of working with the cast and crew of the movie and their dream to popularise skating as a sport.
Ajay Shivlani and Dheeraj Utmani with their students
Q. How did Amole Gupte’s film Hawaa Hawaai come your way?
A. His son Partho Gupte has been training with us for years. He is part of our speed training class, which is an advanced level of skating and is held at night at the Bandra Kurla Complex. Amole would accompany his son for the training and it was during one such skating class in 2007 that it struck him that a film about skating can be made. We were the creative and skating trainers in the film. We were on the sets most of the time.
Dheeraj Utmani and Ajay Shivlani
Q. How were actors Partho Gupte and Saquib Saleem to work with?
A. Partho is an intelligent and mature actor. He is hardworking and happily worked round-the-clock. Saquib Saleem is a natural actor.
Q. You also teach skating to special children?
A. Yes, we have trained many kids with special needs and we also help NGOs. Earlier we had special batches for them, but now it’s an integrated class. But we provide free training to them.
Q. You think films on sports affect people’s lives?
A. The memory is short-lived. There is a craze for sometime but people grow out of it and move on. Only passion and love for the sport can make a difference.
Q. What is your earliest skating memory?
A. We were childhood friends and used to practise at Shivaji Park. Our first success was when we were featured in a newspaper column. We are management students but decided to start skating coaching classes. Initially it was difficult to get recognition and we held free classes till we had decent enrollments. In 1997, we formed our organisation, Roll-o-Fit and today, we have over a lakh students in various centres around the city.
Q. You have several achievements to your name?
A. Yes, we are the most qualified skating instructors in India. We have been featured in The Limca Book of World Records. We have skated from Mumbai to New Delhi and also from Leh to Khardung La. We are internationally certified skaters. We had also applied for inclusion in The Guinness Book of World Records.
Q. Why has skating as a sport not flourished in India?
A. There are many young talents involved in this sport, who are representing us internationally but in spite of that the infrastructure has not developed. Traffic and the state of roads have to be improved and provisions have to be made for aspiring skaters.Andrew Agostinucci (1927 - 1986)

Actually, it was a low rumble followed by a deafening screech that prompted spectators to stick fingers in their ears as Jensen and her five teammates soared through the skies over Oshkosh to prepare for their performances this weekend.
The Air Force major, fighter pilot and Wisconsin native is the third woman and the first mother to fly in the Air Force Thunderbirds flight demonstration team.
"For me, this is a dream come true — who wouldn't want to perform at Oshkosh? It's kind of like playing at Carnegie Hall," Jensen, 37, said in an interview outside her No. 3 plane shortly after arriving at Wittman Regional Airport.
Born in New Richmond, Jensen grew up in River Falls and got hooked on flight when she saw a plane flying in the clouds in a TV movie at the age of 5. She watched the Thunderbirds perform in Eau Claire when she was 13, sparking her dreams of one day becoming an Air Force fighter pilot.
She didn't get her first flight until she was 15 — in a single-engine Cessna 172. Her second and third flights were to and from the Air Force Academy for swim camp and her fourth was to basic training after she had been accepted as a cadet.
The daughter of a Marine helicopter pilot in Vietnam, she graduated from the Air Force Academy with a bachelor's degree in English and spent 10 years on active duty and the past five years as a reservist. She's the first female reserve officer to fly with the Thunderbirds
Before joining the famous flight demonstration team, she was a T-38 instructor and assistant flight commander for Air Force Reserve Command's 340th Flying Training Group at Sheppard Air Force Base in Texas.
She met her husband in glider school while they were at the Air Force Academy. He's now a commercial airline pilot and stays home in Las Vegas with their 5-year-old son while Jensen is on the road 220 days a year. With both parents pilots, it's no surprise their son has a propeller next to his bed, a Braniff Airlines poster on his wall and a bookcase in the shape of a plane tail.
When she finishes this season in the Thunderbirds, she'll head to Washington, D.C., to be a congressional liaison for the Air Force.
One reason there are so few female Thunderbird demonstration pilots is because only 7% of America's fighter pilot forces are female, Jensen said.
"To be on the team, you have to be at the right place in your career with the right set of skills, a family who's supportive and the desire to do it. So there's a lot of things that have to happen for any pilot who wants to be part of the team," she said.
She has spent quite a bit of time in the cockpit — it is, after all, her office — with 3,100 hours as an Air Force pilot, including 200 hours of combat in F-16s in Iraq.
Jensen was at Disneyland with her family, standing in Cinderella's castle, when her cellphone rang in 2012. On the line were all 12 officers from the Thunderbird team calling to congratulate her. Most pilots spend two years in the Thunderbirds but because the military's flight demonstration teams were grounded last year due to sequestration, the entire team stayed together for an additional year.
She flies the No. 3 plane on the right side of the diamond, sometimes as close as 18 inches from the lead plane at speeds up to 450 knots. It's not for the faint of heart. In some of the maneuvers, Thunderbird pilots feel as much as 9 Gs on their bodies and fly as low as 300 feet from the ground.
This weekend AirVenture air show spectators will see Jensen and the rest of the Thunderbirds perform loops and rolls as they zoom as low as 500 feet over the crowd in their white F-16s adorned with red and blue stars and stripes. Her favorite maneuver is when the four planes in the diamond split off from each other in four directions.
So is it nerve-wracking or comfortable flying in such tight formation?
"It's both," she said, adding that the pilots practice their show far away from each other and gradually move closer.
"It's all very controlled. I know exactly what (the lead pilot) is going to do, he knows exactly what we're going to do. There are commands we go through and we've literally done them hundreds of times," she said. "It's very deliberate, very rehearsed and very safe."
This is the first visit by the full Air Force Thunderbird flight demonstration team to EAA AirVenture and because the "aerobatic box" — the air space above the grounds — is bigger than for other air show performers, convention organizers are moving spectators 150 feet back from the normal flight line. Also, residents and businesses inside the aerobatic box must leave for a few hours while the team performs.
The Thunderbirds are scheduled to perform at the end of the weekend air shows, approximately 5 p.m. Friday and Saturday, and 3 p.m. Sunday.

surprise the recent bed bug epidemic has left many scared to slip
between the sheets. It's up to facility managers to help ease that
anxiety by becoming educated on all aspects of a beg bug
infestation so they are prepared to handle, and hopefully prevent,
a problem.
Here's what you need to know about bed bugs:
What They look like
According to the National Pest Management Association (NPMA), bed
bugs have a mahogany to rusty brown coloring (unless they've had a
blood meal, which would make them reddish). They have six legs and
are usually just under one-fourth inch long with a flat, broad oval
shape.
Where you'll find them
Bed bugs like to be in small crevices near a human environment.
This includes behind baseboards, wallpaper, upholstery, mattresses
and in furniture crevices. It is important to know that bed bugs
are not related to cleanliness. "They're an equal opportunity
pest," says Missy Henriksen, NPMA's vice president of public
affairs. "They can be found in even luxury hotels as well as budget
properties."
How to spot an infestation
NPMA says that typically. According to Steve
Free, owner of The Bug Stops Here, a pest control company in New
York, bed bug bites typically occur in clusters or tracts, and they
are usually found not only on your arms and legs but also on your
back and belly.
If a tenant thinks they have an infestation, Free recommends
thoroughly inspecting the beds: strip them down, examine the
bedding, and then place the mattress against a wall and examine it
with a flashlight and magnifying glass. Pay special attention to
the lip of the mattress where it's sewn together because that's the
type of crevice bed bugs prefer. Look for the small
brownish/reddish spots or castings where they shed their skins.
Who to call
If the evidence points to bed bugs, Henriksen highly recommends
calling in a pest control specialist to evaluate the problem
further and diagnose the appropriate treatment. When it comes to
selecting a specialist, Free recommends checking each company's
licensing as well as any online reviews. Bed bug treatment is a
sensitive process, and you'll want a specialist with a stellar
reputation. For similar reasons, Free also recommends choosing a
company that has a long track record so you can avoid the
possibility of dealing with a start-up that is only trying to cash
in on the bed bug epidemic.
Available treatments
Henriksen says treatment for bed bug infestation depends on the
environment, so you'll need a specialist to diagnose the
appropriate solution.
"For instance, it might not be wise to use a heat treatment in a
wax museum or crayon factory or a candle manufacturer," she says.
"A professional may decide not to use pesticides in a nursery or
intensive care unit of a hospital; though it's important to note
that some products have EPA-registered labels that could allow for
this use."
According to the Office of Environmental, Health and Safety
Management with the University of Indiana, the most effective
approach is through Integrated Pest Management (IPM), which might
involve a combination of any of the following methods:
When discarding any infested bedding or furniture, it should be
wrapped in plastic labeled "infested with bed bugs" or made
unsalvageable so that people don't try to pick them up secondhand
bringing the problem into their homes.
Talking to tenants
When it comes to an infestation, the bed bugs are not your only
problem. You must inform your tenants and ease their concerns as
much as possible. Here is a list of things you should do to prevent
a panic:
Henriksen says to provide tenants with the following prevention
advice:
Nobody wants a bed bug problem, but sometimes they happen even
when taking precautionary measures. The key is to remain calm and
ease anxiety among tenants, and then take informed, active steps to
solve the problem.Keeping up with music-streaming services that provide all-you-can-eat access to an ever-growing library of the hottest and currently-trending tracks, can be a hard business.

Pictured with the model is Gary Cunningham, an outside machinist for ATA.
A test conducted in Arnold Engineering Development Complex’s 16-foot transonic wind tunnel supports the design of the newest version of the B61 nuclear bomb.
As part of the B61-12 Life Extension Program, AEDC engineers partnered with researchers from Sandia National Laboratories to perform a wind tunnel test on a full-scale mock-up B61 to determine the configuration that would deliver the necessary spin motion of the bomb during freefall.
It was noted by the customer that the decision to test at AEDC was made in large part because it has the nation’s largest wind tunnel capable of the required air speeds but also due to AEDC personnel’s experience in testing jet interactions similar to those on the B61.
Aerospace Testing Alliance Project Engineer Melissa Minter stated during the eight-days of recent testing, the test team’s primary objective was to characterize the aerodynamic counter torque effect produced by the interaction between the B61 Spin Rocket Motor plumes and the weapon’s aft fins. Counter torque occurs when plumes from the rocket motors work against the fin performance, thwarting the torque from the motors and reducing the vehicle spin rate.
Sandia’s team analyzed the counter torque produced by the jet-fin interaction as a function of the jet-to-free stream dynamic pressure ratio.
“Background-Oriented Schlieren images of the airflow around the model were acquired for all runs during the test and provided visualization of the flow disturbances caused by the jet plumes,” Minter said. “The images show that the counter torque is caused by a vortex/fin interaction, and the vortex is caused by the jets and begins downstream of the jets.”
Air Force Project Manager Tyler Neale explained a legacy version of the B61 gravity bomb had undergone a full-scale wind tunnel test at AEDC in 2002, but that data is no longer applicable since the bomb now uses a significantly different tail design than earlier versions.
While the legacy test had previously confirmed that counter torque was a result of vortex/fin interaction, the BOS images from this most recent test provided additional insight into the vortex trajectories and the shock structure at the jet nozzle exits.
ATA Analysis engineer Scott Keen stated this “was a very non-standard type of testing for AEDC.”
Sandia researchers have stated they’re extremely pleased with the data received from the recent test.
The new data gained from this test will be used in the development of a model of the B61 flight performance characteristics.A man's decision to fly a plane over his friend's house has resulted in a criminal charge.
York Regional Police say a man rented a plane and proceeded to buzz several neighbourhoods in Richmond Hill on Sunday evening.
Police started getting calls about a plane that was reportedly seen "climbing into the sky, stalling and falling back to low altitudes."
Local resident Jeff Smith had guests over for a dinner party when the plane flew overhead.
It looked like the plane was in trouble.
"It's scary because we thought he was going to crash," Smith told CBC News in an interview.
Attempts to make radio contact with the pilot failed and it was then presumed that the plane was experiencing mechanical trouble.
Police began clearing local roads, so the plane would be able to make an emergency landing.
But the plane landed safely at the airport, where police caught up with the pilot when he landed at Markham Airport, at Highway 48 and Elgin Mills Road.
A 26-year-old Richmond Hill man now faces a charge of dangerous operation of an aircraft.22_0<<
Yeah but it’s the ugliest camera on the market (sorry but it is!), and 4/3 is still not 35mm, either Motion Picture or full frame. A lot of people are still eschewing the 7D in favour of the 5D because of the crop factor. This is yet another crop factor on top of that.
And we have to wait and see what the pictures and price are like. Any word on the colour space and bit rate of the AVC Codec?
I’d be really surprised if this Panny isn’t a whole head and shoulders above what the GH1 can do. The bit rate will be 50mbps or above and the circuitry will make moire and aliasing a thing of the past for large sensor video. If it’s just a 4/3rd’s cam with all the same issues, it’ll struggle to justify it’s obvious price hike over the DSLRs. I think Canon will wade into this market in late 2011 with something similar, but hopefully with the 5D MkII’s sensor.
Fingers crossed. In the meantime i’m very happy with the results i’m getting from my Canon.. moire isn’t much of an issue when you know it’s a potential problem and shoot to avoid it. I know it’s not perfect, but we’re talking sub £1k for these cams…
Bring on the future!
Sean, I have no doubt that this camera and the one due from Sony will kick ASS when it comes to performance against the DSLRs…but as you point out sub £1k prices for cameras that seem to give you what you want will be a hard price to beat…should quality be compromised by price, not if you are looking for a tool that performs unlike the DSLR…a good idea compromised by design !
Fantastic stuff….. the great points in your blog post certainly made this segment excellent…..I am greatly enjoying of it myself.There is much more latest informations are available in this post and the video clippingsa are excellent….. Thanks for the latest useful update.Keep it up!
happening
Why would you want the 5D MkII’s sensor? It’s horizontal 35mm (photography) full frame. It’s much more like VistaVision, not a typical motion picture (vertical 4 or 3-perf 35mm) frame. Seems silly. Unless you came from photography, cinema lenses will behave and look MUCH different on such a sensor. An 18mm will suddenly be MUCH wider than if you were, say, shooting with Panavision or Arri.
I’ve been following this closely, and am encouraged by the developments. I am also really disappointed in the datarate. If Panny had taken the 10-bit, 100 meg codec from their 300 and put it in this, it would really rock. As it is, even the uncompressed SDI out is 4:2:0. That doesn’t give anyone much to work with in post. From what I can tell, I might be better off with a GH-13. Maybe there’s an AF-250 in the works?by klozin

The process of selecting an infilled artificial turf system can be confusing. There are many suppliers, each presenting multiple offers.
We have put together the ‘Selecting the Proper Turf System’ document to help you on your journey towards getting the very best artificial turf system for your specific needs – we urge you to download it and study the various types of artificial turf components and learn how each component contributes to an artificial turf system.
If at any point you are unsure as to how each component is vital towards getting a quality artificial turf field, feel free to contact us directly and we will be more than happy to walk you through the various components and important steps in bringing a quality artificial turf field to life.
There are five main components to review in order to validate choosing the proper turf system for your needs.
Fiber
It is critical to understand what fiber type is right for your application. Turf fibers are responsible for durability and resilience, along with grass-like looks and softness. When it comes to fiber type, there are three options – Monofilament, Slit-Film, and Hybrid. What goes into the production of the fiber you are considering for your field and what fiber type will perform best for your application are the two key items you should focus on to make a decision.
Pile Height
Pile height refers to the length of the grass blade. The length of the blade is directly related to the amount of infill that can be inserted into a given system. The more proper infill material the field has, the better the shock absorption and player safety characteristics. Different pile heights are recommended for different sports/uses. Find out which one is right for you.
Infill
The infill system is the most important aspect of all synthetic turf fields. It is the basis for the safety of the turf system by providing the appropriate cushioning to absorb impact and provide suitable performance attributes. The infill market is becoming more complex with new products being introduced at a rapid rate. With so many choices, it is important to understand the difference between the various options to properly meet your needs.
Backing
Choosing a backing type is arguably the most difficult part of putting together an artificial turf system as most people do not pay attention to its importance because it is not visible from the surface. The composition and performance of the backing simply cannot be overlooked.
Turf Seaming Method
The seam is the lifeline of the field. It facilitates the combination of large turf panels which results in one unified field system. Reoccurring problems with seams are the number one maintenance issue affecting fields around the globe – find out why anything short of the best seaming method is out of the question.

Michigan plans drawing for multi-species hunt
By AP
LANSING, MI – Three hunters will get a rare opportunity to pursue four species of game animal next year under a new program called the Pure Michigan Hunt.
The winners will be allowed to hunt elk, bear, spring and fall wild turkeys and antlerless deer. They'll get their choice of hunting sites at managed waterfowl areas.
Hunters can apply as many times as they like. Each application costs $4 and can be purchased at license retailers through December. Winners will be selected during a random computer drawing in January.
They'll still have to buy licenses for each game animal they pursue.
Lt. Gov. John Cherry bought an application Monday as the program got under way. He says it's a good way to boost the state's hunting and conservation heritage.Source: Recipezaar

Javier Morales and the rest of Real Salt Lake will need to get through FC Dallas in order to win another MLS Cup.
Jeffrey D. Allred, Deseret News
SANDY — Real Salt Lake and FC Dallas have been on a playoff collision course for about a month, but now it's official.
RSL's hope of winning the MLS Supporter's Shield and securing the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference were extinguished Sunday night when the L.A. Galaxy beat visiting FC Dallas 2-1. The Galaxy clinched the Shield with 59 points with RSL finishing second with 56 points.
"Any other year I think we would've ended up first with 56 points," said RSL defender Nat Borchers.
RSL will meet No. 3 seed FC Dallas in the two-game first-round playoff series beginning this Saturday.
Game 1 will be played at Pizza Hut Park in Frisco, Texas, next Saturday at 3 p.m. (MDT). The return leg will be Saturday, Nov. 6 at Rio Tinto Stadium at 8 p.m. Both matches will be broadcast on Fox Soccer Channel.
"Now it doesn't matter what the seeding is. We're going to have to play good teams to get to MLS Cup again," said Borchers. "We've put ourselves in a great position in the playoffs to do well."
The L.A. Galaxy enjoyed a big cushion in the race for the Supporter's Shield at the midway point of the season, but RSL fought back valiantly to give itself a shot on the final weekend of the season. Realistically though, a congested schedule in the CONCACAF Champions League made winning the Supporter's Shield unrealistic.
That's fine with Borchers. Advancing to the Champions League quarterfinals was a fair trade off to finishing second in the race for the Shield.
Salt Lake and Dallas split their season series, with each team winning at home 2-0. Their meeting two weeks ago at Rio Tinto Stadium was arguably the most anticipated match of the entire regular season. FC Dallas went into that match with a 19-game overall unbeaten streak while RSL was in the midst of a 25-game home unbeaten streak.
It was a tightly-contested match that RSL eventually won with a pair of goals in the second half.
That loss and another at Los Angeles to close out the season, and suddenly FC Dallas doesn't seem quite so invincible heading into the playoffs.
"It's going to be very tough to play against them. They're a very fast team. Even watching them (Sunday night) it's a good reminder of how quick they are on the counter attack," said Borchers.
The key to the series will be RSL's ability to get a result on the road. Even though it closed the season on a seven-game road unbeaten streak, it has lost all eight games in Big D in franchise history.
"We're definitely cognizant of the fact we haven't got a result down there, but quite frankly we're due," said Borchers. "We need to make sure we go down there with the right mentality. It's a road game so we're going to have to be super switched on with our defensive pressure."

Significance and Use
As much as possible, terminology contained herein is based on medical dictionary definitions.
This guide provides nomenclature and classifications to accurately and unambiguously describe tissue engineered skin substitutes as well as their clinical functions. These classification systems and their nomenclature are not intended to be prescriptive for product labeling or advertising.
In this guide, “replacement” and “substitute” have different meanings, although they can be used synonymously in ordinary English. “Skin substitute,” which is defined in 3.5.2, is a tissue-engineered medical product that a physician or surgeon can use in a medical or surgical procedure. “Skin replacement,” which is defined in 3.7.7, is the therapeutic outcome of successful skin replacement surgery, but this is only one of several clinical uses for skin substitutes.
Skin substitutes are used in different medical settings and by different medical and surgical specialties. In order to help clarify the clinical applications of skin substitutes, a discussion of common medical and surgical procedures that use conventional skin tissue grafts (autograft and fresh or frozen allograft and xenograft) is provided in Section 6. This discussion is intended provide context for understanding the categories of Section 7, which model clinical uses of skin substitutes by comparison with the uses of conventional skin grafts. However, the procedures, circumstances, and surgical intentions in section are not intended to limit the possible uses of skin substitutes, nor is the classification in section intended to limit the uses of skin substitutes to only those uses of conventional skin graft tissues.

Painting
Mary is holding a book open with her hand while Jesus turns towards her and their gazes meet. The Virgin is wearing a sumptuous, richly embroidered red dress above a beautiful white blouse; the traditional blue cape falls in ample folds from her head, her hair is highlighted in gold. Jesus is wearing classical style garments that leave his shoulders bare and is holding a goldfinch in one hand. In pagan culture, this bird represented the spirit of man flying away at the moment of his death and this meaning was adopted by the Christian tradition. In addition, the link between the goldfinch and the Child is bound up in legend: the red spot on the bird’s head apparently appeared when a thorn was extracted from Christ’s forehead as he was making his way up the Calvary and his blood fell onto the bird, staining it.
The composition is an original working of elements taken from the Venetian tradition (the face of the Virgin and the way her hand lies on the book) and from Raphael (the pose of the Child). It is a late work by the skilful Paolo Morando, who died in his early thirties.

Model in love
5/6/2014
Czech supermodel Petra Nemcova isn't hiding her relationship with Haitian prime minister Laurent Lamothe, 41. "We are involved, and I am very happy," Nemcova told People on Saturday while at Bloomingdales Aventura to introduce a line of candles, Be the Light New York. The onetime Dancing with the Stars contestant, 34, actually lives in Port-au-Prince, working on her Happy Hearts Fund, rebuilding schools ravaged by natural disasters.
Nemcova lost her fiance, photographer Simon Atlee, in the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and was badly injured herself. Since calling off her engagement to actor Jamie Belman in 2012, Nemcova has been an ambassador at large for Haiti, where she met Lamothe.American painter. Owing to his fragile health he was taught at home as a child by tutors and by his father Newell Convers Wyeth (1882–1945), a distinguished illustrator who gave him a rigorous training in draughtsmanship. In about 1933 he first saw the watercolours of Winslow Homer, prompting him to paint impressionistic watercolours that captured fleeting effects of light and movement, as in the Coot Hunter (1941; Chicago, IL, A. Inst.). He first exhibited in 1936 at the Art Alliance of Philadelphia and the following year had his first one-man show, of watercolours, at the Macbeth Gallery in New York, which sold out on the first day. In 1943 Wyeth received a lucrative offer to paint occasional covers for the Saturday Evening Post, as his father had done, but he refused, wishing to devote himself to more independent art.
Wyeth’s earliest works were in pen and ink and watercolour but by the early 1940s he had begun to use egg tempera on gesso board, a technique he had learnt from his brother-in-law, the American painter Peter Hurd (b 1904). In this painstaking technique he found a good counterbalance to his natural inclination towards swift, spontaneous execution. For similar reasons he also began to use drybrush watercolour, in which a fine brush is squeezed almost dry of liquid before use. Nevertheless, watercolour remained as a means of catching observations quickly and for studies. Early examples of temperas include Public Sale (1943; Bryn Mawr, PA, H. W. Breyer priv. col., see 1967 exh. cat., p. 15). In 1945 Wyeth’s father was killed in a railway accident and this tragedy gave greater emphasis to the introspective, melancholy strain developing in Wyeth’s work. This is apparent in such temperas as Christina’s World (1948; New York, MOMA), which depicts the cripple Christina Olson in the midst of a vast expanse of grassland looking wistfully back at her house. Olson was a model for many of Wyeth’s works until her death in 1969. The drybrush work Faraway (1952; Jamie Wyeth priv. col., see Meryman, p. 51) of his son Jamie was the first Wyeth thought successful in this medium.
From the 1950s and into the 1970s Wyeth regularly painted the farm owned by Karl and Anna Kuerlner in Chadds Ford, as in Brown Swiss (1957; see Meryman, p. 57), which was named after the Brown Swiss cattle included in the scene. While continuing to paint landscapes the artist began to produce portraits in the 1960s, for example the drybrush Up in the Studio (1965; New York, Met.) depicting his sister Carolyn, who was also a painter. On occasions he mixed the media of drybrush and watercolour, as in Garrett Room (1962; artist’s col., see Meryman, p. 26), which after beginning as a fluid watercolour was completed in drybrush. Between 1971 and 1985 Wyeth secretly made numerous drawings and paintings, including nudes, of Helga Testorf, a neighbour in Chadds Ford. Almost 100 of these so-called ‘Helga pictures’ were exhibited from 1987 at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC, and elsewhere.
Wyeth’s style and subject-matter changed little throughout his career, and the restrained earth colours that characterized his earlier work were continued in later paintings such as Ring Road (1985; priv. col., see 1987 exh. cat., p. 147). His work was enormously popular in the USA, and as a mark of this he was given a large retrospective in 1976 at the Metropolitan Museum in New York, the first time a living American artist had been accorded such an honour. With the critics, however, his reputation was less secure, largely because his style and subject-matter fell outside the avant-garde developments of American art. Travelling very little, he spent his life almost entirely in the Maine and Pennsylvania regions of the USA. To many his accessible paintings evoke some mythical rural past, striking a powerful chord in the American psyche. Like Dürer, whom he greatly admired, he placed great emphasis on observation, and his detailed style reflects this. Nevertheless, through the series of pencil and watercolour studies for a work, many details were often pared away.

I was walking my dog with my Sister when we noticed Two bright orange lights flying from the north heading westerly with out a single sound it was almost like they were just outside our atmospheere The night was flat calm and there was not a sound in the area and not a cloud in the sky. The two lights flew the same flight path with about 5-10 seconds apart the just for about 3-4 minutes then flew upwards and out of sight.

Maybe it's the way she rocks out at the Shank or knows how to put together an amazing outfit from the Salvation Army, but there's just something about your girl that tells you Tiffany & Co. wouldn't impress her much. So, what would? Anything from Catbird, a teeny Bedford Avenue boutique that specializes in local jewelry designers with styles that are just as quirky and cool as she is. Would Tiffany & Co. offer such fun pieces as a hand-tarnished bronze Inspector Clouseau mustache necklace by Digby and Iona? Or a 14-karat gold matchbook on a chain by OathNYC? Or shiny interlocking-vampire-teeth rings by Bittersweets New York? The jewelry comes in a range of prices for every stage of your relationship, from "I think you're awesome" (Nikki B.'s assorted beaded bracelets, four for $30) to "We're totally in love" (Iwona Ludyga's diamond spider studs, $430).

Adad Hannah
Two Body Equilibrium
July 12—September 8, 2013 4: Gravitas explores the force of gravity, both literally and figuratively. The second
work in this series, Adad Hannah’s Two Body Equilibrium, unfolds over a quick but intense four minutes as two men perform an act of balance and strength. Influenced by the “tableau vivant”
(living picture), in which an artwork is staged by costumed models in elaborate settings, the video
focuses on the impossible task of holding certain poses for long periods of time. In a scene inspired
by both Japanese ukiyo-e prints and European painting, the viewer is offered both a sensuous
display of color, pattern, and flesh, and a tension-filled performance that calls attention to
every subtle blink or movement.

The presidential press conference was initiated by Farm Aid founder Willie Nelson, who invited about 200 farmers and the press and four presidential candidates -- Buchanan, Bush, Gore and Nader.
Progressive farm groups asked three questions: Will you support a new farm program that ensures that farmers earn a fair price from the marketplace, not from the taxpayer? What will you do to restore competition in the marketplace (including a moratorium on mergers, banning packers owning livestock, and reining in biotech companies)? Will you support US trade and farm policies that end the disastrous practice of exporting and importing farm products below their true cost of production?
First was Senator Byron Dorgan, for Al Gore:
"I come from a little county of southwestern North Dakota and there's a Lutheran minister -- you all have seen the movie Four Weddings and a Funeral? -- the Lutheran minister in my home county says she has four funerals for every wedding in her church.
"People are leaving, people are dying, no new people are coming in, the average age is going up. Prices are down, costs are up. Every direction a family looks -- trying to work the farm out there -- they see monopolies.
"This is not some unique accident. It is a deliberate corporate highjacking of the economy in rural America ... Some people want to debate this in terms of dollars and cents. Family farms produce a whole lot more than just grain and meat. Family farms produce community. They produce a culture.
"Europe has already recognized it. We don't and we must.
"We need to repeal the Freedom to Farm Bill. We need to break the back of monopolies crushing family farmers and we need fair trade.
"We're about four or five votes short in the Senate on every one of these issues. We can't even get a hearing on Freedom to Farm. The chairman of the Agriculture committee in the Senate refuses to hold a hearing on the issue of repealing Freedom to Farm ...
"The Clinton-Gore administration says, 'Freedom-to-Farm doesn't work.' If we elect the right people to the Senate and the House, have a Congress that doesn't lose these votes, instead wins these votes, and a President who says, 'Let's repeal Freedom-to-Farm,' I think we'll get it done.
"About four or five choices that are different in the Senate ... will change that vote and will repeal that bill, replace it with a fair price for family farmers.
"I was in Cuba a while back. People in Cuba don't have enough to eat. We can't sell grain to Cuba because we don't have the freedom to sell.
"I voted against that bill (Freedom to Farm). I said it would lead to lower prices and it has. Someone here said we have the best farm program corporate America can buy and I believe that."
Dorgan was surprised by booing and hissing when he mentioned the Clinton administration. A Dorgan aide told me the Senator worried that farmers would lose faith that there is a difference between the Dems and the Reps.
One difference: The Democrats sent someone to Farm Aid, which the Republicans did not. The message to family farmers was clear: As only 2% of the population, you don't matter.
Pat Buchanan told the crowd to go ahead and boo if they disapproved of his ideas, saying, "I've heard a lot of disapproval ...
"Clearly, Freedom-to-Farm has failed. The policy fails, you change it. Secondly, if the Clinton administration can use anti-trust laws to bust up Microsoft, why don't they use it to bust up these agricultural cartels?
"Last year when I was campaigning, corn, beans, hogs, apples, tomatoes -- you name it -- every single commodity was selling below the cost of production. Now, when that happens there's a fundamental endemic problem. And that problem is the global economy and the globalization have been established of, by, and for the multinational corporations.
"Now. Look what is happening on the Hill. They not only put them [multinational corporations] ahead of family farms, they put them ahead of human rights, they put them ahead of national security. Both political parties are bought and paid for by the business round table and this is why you get the trade policies that you do.
"China sells us 40% of their exports. They buy 1% of ours. That is managed trade. This policy with China is adopted for the multinationals not to sell there, but to move factories there. What you gotta do with China is sit down and say 'Look, we bought 80 billion from you. You bought 10 billion from us. You're gonna buy 50 billion more from us or you've sold your last pair of chopsticks in any mall in America.'
"Ralph [Nader] and I opposed NAFTA. When it was passed, in Canada the Canadian dollar was worth 80 cents to the American dollar. The Canadian dollar was cut in value so now the wheat and cattle come in to North Dakota because they've taken unfair advantage.
"I've got a friend who ran the largest tomato farm in Florida. He said, 'you gotta protect us from unfair practices. So Mexico cuts the value of the peso by two-thirds, cuts the price of tomatoes by two-thirds, floods the United States, he's out of business.
"You're right that if the anti-trust laws can be used against Microsoft they can be used against these cartels that are shafting the American farmer. Secondly, when prices of any commodity fall below the price of production, stop importing the commodity into the United States. Now that is putting farms ahead of any free-trade ideology and we gotta do that. The Europeans do it. They make no apologies.
"Third, and I agree with Byron Dorgan on this one, that the United States ought to stop using food as a weapon and export food and agricultural goods that feed people and don't go to dictators all over the world.
"So what I say in the last analysis is, if you believe in family farms, then you gotta put that ahead of the ideology of free trade, and if saving the farm means violate so-called free-trade ideology, you gotta do it.
"But right now, my friends, this is going to keep happening and happening until I believe you get rid of these two parties that I believe are bought and paid for by the same big multinationals. And you get a party in there -- I don't care which one it is -- that starts putting America and Americans first."
Hardly waiting for his introduction, Ralph Nader jumped right in:
"Well, there's a lot to agree with here. I'll just extend it a bit. I haven't heard names of the companies yet. Let's talk about who owns our government. Who runs agricultural policy. Who buys and rents most of our politicians, with notable exceptions like the great Senator Dorgan who voted against the Freedom-to-Farm bill in 1996, now he has to defend the Clinton-Gore administration which signed the Freedom-to-Farm bill.
"We're talking about Cargill, Continental Grain, ADM, IBP, Perdue, Tyson -- those are the companies that run Washington, D.C. And the first reform is getting corrupt money out of politics -- public funding of public campaigns.
"Second would be to initiate the six-month notice provided in the GATT and NAFTA trade agreements, the six-month notice of withdrawal so we re-negotiate trade agreements as if people mattered, not corporations.
"Third is to do what the Elkins Act did years ago. It prohibited railroads from owning coal mines. And we have to prohibit meat packers from owning livestock production and grain packers from owning grain production.
"This last week, Business Week had a cover called 'Too much corporate power?' and in ten pages, they answered yes. And in the editorial they said, 'Corporations should get out of politics.'
"Almost three years ago I started an agribusiness project and Mike Stumo and Doug O'Brien helped start the Organization for Competitive Markets -- OCM. The website is competitivemarkets.com. A few weeks ago they issued a whole food policy, from the preservation of family farms all the way to benefitting the consumer.
"Some of those whole food policies include enforcing the anti-trust laws against agribusiness conglomerates and implementing a moratorium on mergers among the large agribusiness corporations -- a statutory moratorium. It also includes strengthening the farm program for grain commodities to include a farmer-owned grain reserve, a long-term land idling and conservation program, and a non-recourse loan program for family farmers.
"We also support a different kind of USDA. We have to push the USDA toward less capital-intensive and more environmentally beneficial production, supporting value-enhancing agriculture.
"And then saying to those giant corporations -- Novartis and Monsanto -- if you think you're gonna get away with changing the nature of nature you've got another think coming.
"You're gonna have to answer the basic scientific questions that you have not answered as you've plunged this technology recklessly throughout farm country. And furthermore, we're gonna demand that every American that goes into any supermarket or food store is going to have the right to genetically-engineered labeling for food. By the way, 90% of the people want labeling for genetically-labeled food.
"And targeting government food procurement towards small and local farms. It is an absolute tragedy that the people in this country who grow and harvest our food, and that includes farmers and farm workers, are paid the least, treated the worst, and damaged the most.
"And these guys in the commodity markets are making tons of money in Chicago and elsewhere. That is a completely upside down system of economic injustice.
"I think it's time, really, to go past denunciation and we have to organize by connecting farmers with consumer groups and environmental groups in a giant Seattle-type coalition. Because, as Saul Alinsky once said, 'the only way you fight organized money is with organized people.'"
I was surprised at Nader's ability to rouse the crowd, and then at the crowd's enthusiastic response. But my next surprise was seeing Nader wandering around, talking informally to press and supporters. I listened for a few seconds before realizing, hey! I have a tape recorder! turn it on! and so I got the following:
"... the almighty dollar reigns supreme, and people are turned into spectators watching video corporate culture day after day instead of developing their own arts and crafts and going to their own plays and their own musicals in their community. And this is getting worse and worse, so much so that these kids are growing up watching the screen thirty hours or more a week and don't even know what it's like to go into their neighborhood community and help build their own culture with their own creativity. That's the damage of corporate culture. It's centralized, it's commercialized, it's homogenized, and it forces people to be spectators instead of doers."
Someone asked if the American people know they need a third party and Nader said:
"Well, certainly the national media is doing its best to make sure they don't know. There's really one corporate party in this country, with two heads -- one may sip Pepsi, the other sips Coke, all beholden to giant corporations who now have turned our government into a government of the Exxons, by the General Motors, corporate, for the DuPonts. Our democracy, our government, our elections have been highjacked by big money and the agents for this highjack are the politicians who think that money in their campaigns is more important than standing up for the American people and that's why we've gotta take our government back and that's why we've gotta have a new party that comes out of the grass roots and is of, for, and by the people, and that's the Green Party and we're building for the future after November, not just trying to get as many votes as possible before November.
"The basic struggle is between the civic culture and the corporate culture. We either have a sovereignty of the people in this country with all of the creativity and justice and opportunity and prosperity, and trusteeship for future generations that this entails or we have a sovereignty of big business which is what we have now where everything's for sale. A society dominated by commercialism is a society headed for further decay, headed for further standardization and homogenization. And that was a warning to us by every major religion in the history of the world.
"It began in stages. It began with the control of our media, which started out with radio which was supposed to be nonprofit and no advertising. It started with people basically forgetting about the necessity to separate commerce from politics, to separate campaign dollars from corporations from our elections. It started with people who forgot the difference between commercialism and civic initiatives that led to our schools cutting deals with Coca Cola and Pepsi Cola, our universities being corporatized, increasingly in terms of what's taught, what research is being done. Corporatism and commercialism creep up on us day by day and they recognize no boundaries other than those that are imposed on them externally, and that's what we have to do -- build a civic culture to run the political institutions and to hold the corporations to boundaries where they cannot develop a society where everything is for sale."

Duluth and Saint Louis County took center stage in St. Paul.
That, as hundreds of resident lobbyists met with lawmakers, outlining the region's priorities.
LeAnn Wallace reports.
"It's lobbying day for Duluth and Saint Louis County here at the Captiol. Hundreds of residents made the trek down to Saint Paul to outline the region's priorities to lawmakers."
The sites and sounds of Saint Scholastica's Jazz Band filled the Capitol during a rally Wednesday.
But the real work started before that as lobbying teams made the rounds...trying to score facetime with lawmakers. This year, they especially wanted to meet with the incoming freshman.
Representative Kerry Gauthier has now been on both sides of the lobbying efforts.
Duluth and Saint Louis County Days is in it's 14th year. Organized by the Duluth Area Chamber of Commerce, it's evolved substantially over the years.
The main priorities this time around: Saving local government aid payments to cities and if the legislature does pass Governor Mark Dayton's bonding proposal, funding for the sanitary sewer overflow project...and other pet projects like additional funding for UMD.
Lobbying Days will continue tomorrow with a legislative breakfast. Governor Mark Dayton is set to be the keynote speaker.

Good industrial facility layouts always develop from the general to the specific--never the other way
Inquire: Facility Layout Assistance
Think of a rope. When it's tugged, knotted, coiled, or shaped to take a form (a question mark would be appropriate), the entire length is affected. Facility layout is similar: all parts make up one interconnected whole.
By Hal Ettinger, used with permission
Understanding the logical movement of people, materials and product traveling between the front door and the shipping dock is the primary challenge of developing an efficient plant layout. The ultimate goal is to optimize the workflow of people and product now and into the future.
It's not a simple "bucket brigade"
If the production process was simply a matter of one person handing their work to the next person in line, like a bucket brigade, from the receptionist on down to the delivery driver, the task of designing an efficient layout would be child's play. As long as each one in the line was right next to their upstream and downstream partner, the production line could snake around any which way without any noticeable change in production output. The major operations of a manufacturing or distribution facility can be treated as if each were a single individual that simply hands its work “down the line”. But even with this simplest model we can easily see that there is nothing like a bucket brigade taking place inside most plants. Each department has multiple interactions with the others – the warehouse gets “handed” incoming shipments from the receiving department at the same time that it gets “handed” orders from the fulfillment department. It's doing half a dozen things at once for half a dozen different groups. Meanwhile, in the midst of all this, personnel are wandering away to find places to smoke, sit, eat or make a run to the toilet.
Our metaphorical facility manager has a lot on his hands, and we haven't even mentioned how he has to juggle all the work-in-process, staging, and other material handling that is completely internal to the department.
For any given department, there really are two layouts to be considered. The first is the layout of the overall plant and how and where the department fits into it. Let's call it “the grand scheme”. In developing “the grand scheme” we have to decide how much of the floor space each department gets.
The second layout to be considered is the “internal plan” of the department. Here we need to think about equipment footprints and internal traffic and staging. You can see that the two layouts have to be related, more specifically, the internal layout of the department is constrained by the department's place in “the grand scheme”.
The most important thing to remember in industrial facility design
This leads us to the first and most important rule of layout design: Good plant layouts always develop from the general to the specific, never the other way around. If you begin the process of designing your layout from a department adjacency perspective rather than from an individual department your chances for success will increase. Some people will challenge this by asking; “Can't you just start with a certain layout for one area and then develop the other areas to accommodate that?”
This is the way that people who are not experienced typically approach a design problem. They usually have some specific idea that they've become fond of. It might be a certain arrangement of equipment, or maybe even just the particular location of, or view from, their office, but they'll grasp this nugget like one of those blind men who groped the elephant, and they'll try to develop their vision of the whole facility around it. It's like trying to draw a landscape by starting at one corner of the paper and sketching your way across the sheet to the other. By the time you get to the opposite corner the drawing has become distorted and badly composed. As anyone who has made a profession in design knows, each element of design influences, and is influenced by, many other elements. It's only when these elements have been selected, positioned, and configured in accord with some higher governing principle that they form a coordinated, efficient system or, in this case, an efficient and productive plant layout. In designer's language, the general principles that govern the overall design are called design programming or scope of work.
This brings us to the 2nd most important principal of good layout: The choices that are available at any given point in a design are determined by the decisions that preceded it and constrains those parts of the design that remain to be developed. In other words, thou shall know thy design program and always keep it foremost in thy mind. This sounds like it should be obvious, yet this aspect of design work is overlooked.
Set your priorities
Often the emphasis and attention to detail is given to the main entry and front-end offices when designing a facility. And no doubt this attention conveys a strong message to both customers and employees. But often overlooked in the excitement to impress with new offices are the Shipping and Receiving department. True, this is the least glamorous area of a plant, but when you consider almost all your revenues exit there, the shipping doors just may be your most important openings in the entire building. Shipping requires the same attention to detail as any other department when it comes to size requirements, configuration, amenities and location (to facilitate its effectiveness and efficiency).
It's a bit odd, but layout planning can start from the back end (shipping) and move to the front (main entry). This logic allows for the dog to wag the tail not the other way around. But even before considering plant layout, you must consider what impact the site will have on and to layout planning. Given this back to front planning logic, the site influences how and where you ship and receive product, which then leads where shipping and receiving should be located on the site.
Every area of a plant should be considered part of an interconnected whole
Think of a rope. When it's tugged, knotted, coiled, or shaped to take a form (a question mark would be appropriate), the entire length is affected. Layout is similar. Along its length (movement of people and product) all parts are impacted by any expansion, elimination of equipment, equipment installation, whatever. All parts make up one interconnected whole. Revisions like adding personnel, a department re-layout, or equipment installation impacts all areas in the plant sometimes in less than obvious ways. (for example re-routing of material handling aisle to accommodate installation of new equipment, reduction of work-in-process due to expansion).:
- Customer (market) determines product
- Product determines warehouse and equipment needed
- Equipment locations determines material and personnel workflow
- Workflow determines location of office and employee entry points
- Employee entry points determine location of toilets/lockers, cafeteria, human resources, and offices
- Office determines location of main entry
- Putting the pieces of the puzzle together will help prove or disprove your layout theory until you get it right (adjacencies)
The parts
A typical facility, whether it's manufacturing, distribution, or commercial can contain these parts, either some or all of them:
- Front end
- entry
- customer conference rooms
- accounting
- sales, customer service, etc.
- general work areas
- private offices
- misc. (main telephone/data, office supplies, break area, files, fax, mail/postage)
- Production Cell
- various equipment
- fulfillment
- unique value added component
- Warehousing
- storage (raw materials, finished goods)
- Shipping/Receiving
- shipping/receiving office
- driver area
- labeling and ready to ship
- Maintenance & Production Support
- Maintenance (parts storage)
- Solvent storage
- Equipment support (air compressors, etc.)
- Battery chargers
- Employee Services
- main locker/toilets
- cafeteria
- training / recreation
- human resources
Just like assembling a puzzle, arranging the various pieces by shape and color, print out on 3 x 5 index cards the 8 areas of the plant (if starting from scratch) or a department's various internal areas if only expanding one department. Arrange the cards by preferred. Walk through the placement of index cards by discussing movement of people and product. Re-arrange placement of cards to suite your needs. If it doesn't work at this stage, do not proceed. Get it right at this stage or else your layout is going to flop. After all, your chances of placing the 8 cards in the right order is pretty good. The real challenge is making it work in an existing building you plan on renovating, or on a restrictive site, or at your present location.
Share information; solicit opinions
Do not work as a project team of one. Share your ideas and welcome new ideas. Encourage others to participate in the layout process, as painful as it might become. It's amazing how different people interpret the same problems found in the plant. You might interpret slow turn-around as an equipment related issue, which given your choice would be solved with the purchase of a new piece of equipment.
The Production Supervisor, experiencing the same slow turn around issue, could interpret it as a manning (staffing) problem. What ever the case, inviting input by others will open doors which would not have been opened, and thereby addressing items which would have not seen the light of day. Logical planning will bring ideas and allow for constructive dialogue.
Constantly proving and improving
As the air gets a little thinner each step you take to the summit of Everest, each phase of layout development gets a little harder.
So, back to the cards. When you're feeling good about the overall adjacencies, the next critical step is to bring scale into the equation. Many a good man has thrown in the towel when scale enters the program. Let's just assume every department is a square with width & length equal. Cut out the shapes from some chipboard you have laying around the shop representing best guess square footage requirements. Scale brings a new challenge to putting the puzzle together. We can start by reassembling the scaled shapes in the same order as before. But it quickly becomes apparent keeping the previous adjacencies creates some interesting problems. For one thing, any sense of symmetry is gone (we all love symmetry), also some very interesting shapes appear. Remember, the objective is to put walls around material handling. Hang in there—Rome wasn't built or designed in a day.
The key to resolving the scale and location challenge is to break away from the square department and stretch in either the x or y axis and by doing so allowing the flexibility to make the shapes fit together better. So a department figuring to be around 2300 sq. ft. (48 ft. x 48 ft.) can be shaped 31 ft. x 74 ft. Stretch and pull till your hearts content so the overall shape is more realistic and workable.
Don't forget the employee services and production support areas. They may seem immaterial at this stage but when the time comes to locate these areas, it will disrupt the apple cart big time if they are not accounted for at the beginning. If you wait, you will end up compromising both the functionality of these spaces along with negatively impacting the areas around their forced placement. This is an important lesson. Playing catch up to warehouse layout design by adding areas or departments not originally figured into expansion plans is very dangerous. Not that plant layout can not be flexible to expansion or twists and turns impacting the industry, but when you consider the rope analogy, all parts make up one interconnected whole.
Now for the kicker
When you are comfortable with the adjacencies and footprint (shapes) of the departments, ask yourself; (1) are there any areas which might become underutilized? (2) is expansion possible without adversely impacting any of the other departments or areas?
Again, if the shoe doesn't fit, don't force it, go back and try again. The lesson here is that each step of the layout process can only be taken after you reach a level of real (not hoped for) confidence that it's right. And keep in mind this exercise is a lot less expensive than if changes take place during construction.
Batting clean up—how to place building columns and equipment
"Just make it fit, I'm losing patience"Now for the hard part. To see whether the department shapes will accommodate major equipment, while at the same time keeping in mind the roof will need to be held up by building columns—sometimes called “ I didn't know an 8 inch steel pipe could make my life miserable” columns. The sad reality is that equipment doesn't run with a steel column through it. When making the equipment “dolls” for this exercise, measure the entire operating area, including the overall dimension of the equipment and area around the equipment required for it's running (consoles, staging, work tables, etc.).
We will have to make another assumption and that is the building columns will be in a grid measuring 30'x 40'. Actually we have some flexibility here. As long as the minimum distance is not less then 25 feet—to avoid a lot of columns—and maximum distance of 45 feet, so you don't begin to pay premiums on steel.
Draw the column grid on translucent material so it can be placed over the layout to see where there might be interference. Place the equipment dolls in the appropriate departments, using good production flow judgment.
Let's see what we have done. The final test will be to objectively determine whether the overall layout can accommodate inevitable expansion. The real test of any layout is whether it has an extended shelf life. If it can accommodate unforeseen new markets, growth of existing customers, installation of equipment never considered. Facilitating expansion is the yardstick to measure successful plant layout.
Documenting questions as you go along (and finding out your memory is not as good as it used to be)
Questions will come up during this initial layout process which you need to document. The idea is to make sure all outstanding items eventually get addressed. Remember unanswered questions will not just go away by themselves. They will eventually surface in the most inopportune time during the project.
Start a project file where you can put all your its operating efficiencies. Following the elementary layout process described above will allow you to address many issues which eventually arise during either the construction phase or, worse yet, when you are up and running.
Remember to error on the side of thoroughness
Some of the unturned stones you may be faced with:
- Did we allow enough space for storage of office supplies; did we have that figured in?
- Does the receptionist area have a closet for customer coats; heck have we figured for closets at all?
- Are the employees going to have lockers? Did we allow for the space?
The amount of hours spent on the project's front end, logically developing an efficient layout is directly proportionate to its success. More time, more chance for a successful layout. You must be committed to spending a lot of time during the initial planning phase before arriving at a layout that will work.
Now for the good news, there are techniques and tools used by individuals in the business of layout and plant design that makes this process less painful, while at the same time giving you the ability to contribute to this most exciting process of creating something that will stand as a testament of all your hard work.Wok-Grilled Vegetable Lo Mein

Nice flavor. I used chow mein noodles, baby bellas and pea pods.
We loved the flavor of this dish! However, it either needed half the noodles or 50% more vegetables. Either way, that will be an easy fix and the flavor was so good. DH made this on his Cuisinart grill vegetable tray on the grill versus a wok, as the holes are of similar size and this worked fine. Adding this to my keeper file. Made for Sun and Spice 2013.
Great dish! I used sweet onion, baby bellas, red pepper, bok choy, bean sprouts and zuchinni. I used a 1/2 pound of thin spaghetti. Made over a charcoal grill - outstanding smoky flavor and it whipped up quickly. I didn't think there would be enough room to grill the noodles too - but it worked perfectly. Thumbs up from the whole family. We found that a drizzle of Thai sweet chili sauce is really good on this dish.

The fire was reported at 12:01 p.m. at a two-story home in the 100 block of Rosewell Way, between Monterey Road and U.S. Highway 101, Capt. Cleo Doss said. Multiple calls came in about smoke and fire in the area.
When crews arrived they found the garage and both floors of the house in flames, Doss said. Crews were able to keep the fire from spreading to neighboring homes, he said.
The fire was extinguished at 1:20 p.m.
A juvenile and an adult were at the house when the fire started and were able to get out safely. No injuries were reported.
Part of the roof collapsed in the fire, Doss said. The cause remains under investigation.

I created this website to serve as a knowledge base of everything I know and learn about this amazing ceramic grill. It’s not just about the recipes, but everything else that goes along with owning a Big Green Egg. As I continue to cook I will share my experiences and lessons learned with you. Hopefully, you will share your knowledge and experience with me as well, and together we can build a great online resource. Check out the About Me page to learn more about who I am, why I started this website, and how the heck I got the name Eggic. In the meantime, here’s what you can expect to find on this site:
Big Green Egg Accessories:
Have your eye on one of the several Big Green Egg accessories
, but can’t decide if it’s worth the money? I’ll give you an honest appraisal of every Big Green Egg accessory I own to help you make your decision. I’ll also purchase some accessories I normally wouldn’t just so I can provide as much information to the community as possible (and to build my collection). Check out the Accessory Reviews pages to get yourself started!
Big Green Egg Video Series:
I am starting to put together some YouTube videos detailing all the information found under the Basics, Maintenance, and Recipes pages so be sure to subscribe to my YouTube Channel! Here’s one of my first videos, showing how to use the Grill Gripper. This is just the start, there will be dozens of videos to come! If you have an idea for a video, please let me know!
Big Green Egg Basics:
Are you a brand new Egghead struggling to figure out what this ceramic thing is and how to use it? Check out the Basics pages, where you can learn about safety, cooking configurations, how to light your Egg, and more! Oh yeah, if you are a new Egghead, welcome to the family!
Big Green Egg Prices:
Haven’t made the plunge into the Big Green Egg world yet? That’s okay! I know how difficult it can be to figure out exactly what these Eggs will cost, and until now the internet hasn’t been a great place to get that information. The good news is that I’ve done most of the leg work for you! I have compiled all the information you need about the capacity and pricing of all sizes of Eggs. Check out the Big Green Egg Prices page in the navigation menu for more information.
Big Green Egg Maintenance:
The Egg is a well built grill, that’s for sure, but everything needs some TLC. Check out the Maintenance pages to learn how to clean your Big Green Egg, calibrate the dome thermometer, replace your gasket and more! As I maintain my Big Green Egg I will document the process and show you exactly how to keep yours in top shape.
Big Green Egg Recipes:
No Big Green Egg website would be complete without a long list of recipes! My take on recipes is slightly different; since I am not a chef, I’m not going to provide your standard recipes (a dash of this or that). Instead, I’m going to tell you exactly how I prepare the meat, how I configure the Big Green Egg, what dome temperature I cook at, and how long I cook. My goal is to provide easy to understand and concise instruction on how to cook a specific meat (or vegetable) properly. It will be up to you to add you own style and flavors to the dish. I’ll take you step by step through all my cooks like brisket, pizza, steak, and many more.
Community Involvement:
I will be the first to tell you that I do not know everything there is to know about the Big Green Egg, or grilling in general. I need your help to develop this website! Your comments, thoughts, and criticisms are welcomed and needed. Please, if you see something missing, something you disagree with, or if you want to share one of your recipes just contact me. I have every intention of being responsive to the Egghead community, and hope that together we can build an incredible resource for the Big Green Egg!Eg,, or

The budget focuses on several priorities that safeguard the health, cleanliness and safety of Connecticut's Capital City, and is designed to encourage grand list growth, promote job creation, improve quality of life and enhance quality education opportunities.
"This budget is the result of contributions from all of the stakeholders in Connecticut's Capital City and validates the collaborative process that we have all undertaken over the last four months," Mayor Segarra said. "Throughout this process, it became clear that in order to move Hartford forward, we must focus on the priorities of the people who live, work and visit Hartford."
The budget contains an appropriation ordinance for FY 2012-13 of $546.6 million, a decrease of $1.2 million under the revised FY 2011-12 budget. Additionally, the budget increases the City's contribution to the Municipal Employees' Retirement Fund, the annual grants budget, and the allocation to the Hartford Public Library. The appropriation to the Hartford Public Schools' budget would be unchanged, remaining at $284 million.
Moreover, the budget contains a five-year Capital Improvement Program for Fiscal Years 2012-13 through 2017-18, totaling $610.6 million, of which $60.9 million would fund the first year. (The net appropriation would be $44 million after grants and reimbursements.) This year's projects, which are essential to the City's wellbeing, include site preparation for the Public Safety Academy; improvements to the Northend Senior Center, Keney Clock Tower and municipal facilities; and significant improvements to City playgrounds. The overall five-year plan includes support for the iQuilt plan, Colt Streetscape and Coltsville redevelopment , as well as street improvements.
The budget also contains a 3.51 mill rate increase on all taxable property, and no drawdown on the fund balance to preserve and enhance the City's bond rating. The increase is largely the result of the five-year property revaluation, which will commence in FY 2012-13. Under the revaluation, commercial property values decreased approximately 20 percent and residential properties by 7 percent.
"Well over half of the budget deficit that we have worked to eliminate as part of this budget process - $35 million of the projected $56 million – was caused by the significant drop in property values," Mayor Segarra said. "Restoring lost revenues and maintaining our property tax at fiscal year 2010-11 levels would have required an increase of 10.72 mills, and I was unwilling to further burden residents and businesses.
Painful choices are required if we are to sustain our economic recovery and positively impact development and investment."
Finally, the budget contains several new sources of revenue, including a $3 million increase in collection of delinquent property taxes, an additional $1 million for Medicaid reimbursements, and PILOTs from non-taxpaying property owners.
A public hearing on the budget will be held on Wednesday, April 25, 2012 at 5:00 p.m. The hearing will be held at Bulkeley High School, 300 Wethersfield Avenue.Villa Premiere Hotel & Spa, a luxury boutique hotel in the paradise that is Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, is offering a few extra free perks to make their property stand out from the crowd.

Where is the Windows 7 Internet Explorer Icon?! Not to worry! Here is a few methods on restoring the icon back to your desktop:
Method 1: Manually recreate the Internet Explorer icon on your desktop
Due to some changes in Windows 7, we are required to use a slightly different method than you may be used to to restore the Internet Explorer icon back onto your desktop:
1. Head over to the start button, then look for the “internet explorer” icon in the start menu. If you do not see it there, you can either search for it using the search that is located right above the start button, or you can head over to all programs and look for the icon there. Once you have located the Internet Explorer icon, you can hover over the icon, and right drag the icon to your desktop. Once you release the right mouse button a small menu will show, and it will ask you if you want to “copy, move or create shortcut”. Choose create shortcut, and viola, you now have the icon on your desktop! Double click the icon to ensure that it is working and you are finished! You now have the Internet Explorer icon back on your desktop, as good as new!
Wondering why the icon is so spiffy looking and interesting? Head over to the evolution of the Internet Explorer icon write up to see our study on the icon and its trends.
Method 2:
Microsoft.com offers another solution with a registry entry to recreate the icon on your desktop. It is rumoured to no longer work with Windows 7, so try it at your own risk:
1. Start, run or start and then search. In the run box or search box, type in “notepad” to start the windows notepad program. In the notepad, copy paste this following text:
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\HideDesktopIcons\NewStartPanel] {871C5380-42A0-1069-A2EA-08002B30309D}"=dword:00000000 [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\HideDesktopIcons\ClassicStartMenu] {871C5380-42A0-1069-A2EA-08002B30309D}"=dword:00000000
Once you have copied all of this text into your open notepad windows, press ctrl+shift+s to open the save as dialogue and save the file as "Ie.reg" to your desktop. Close notepad, then head over to your desktop and run the file you just saved. This should bring up a prompt which you should answer with the usual "ok, yes, continue, etc."
You are done! You now have the icon restored!

OH MY. As much as I adore kids, and I am amazed with anyone that could have a classroom of 25 kids every day.....I sure couldn't do it. The bus ride to the zoo today nearly killed me, even being fairly quiet. Today was a gorgeous 78 degree day, thank goodness! Each parent chaperon was assigned to four kids in a group besides your own child and you simply set out on your own way. It always seems like a million miles of dusty and dirty trails at the Phoenix Zoo. Not my favorite spot, even though I love to walk. The animals are always sleeping or hiding and the kids are always zooming by each exhibit without any interest really. Even crazier, our bus driver got us lost, so we had less than 3 hours to tour a 5 hour zoo AND do lunch. YIKES.
You would think that a zoo trip would include a few lows of course! Actually, I gave Maddison an extra snack before arriving, and when she said she felt low she was a perfect 80. I gave her some raisins which held her until lunch. I hoovered in the
70's but felt like I was in the 40's. ICK. Blood sugars were awesome otherwise! A nice trip all in all, but the 40 min drive home with a bus full of screaming kids singing "Who took the cookie from the cookie jar" was enough to induce a serious migraine, even for Maddison. Not kidding. On the way home one poor little girl apparently felt the same way as Maddison and I and ended crying and pleading for the song to stop! I highly agreed! I couldn't believe the teacher let the song continue so long and wasn't concerned about the VOLUME. It was THAT crazy! Maddison and I came straight home to my comfy bed, pulled the curtains and had some serious quiet time complete with lots of Powerade zero. Whew! A much needed rest!
During lunch one little boy asked me if I knew Maddison had a bully at school. Oh man.....I didn't think it was a "bully" and I thought that no one else knew. All the other kids chimed in and told me that it is a 3rd grader and she has thrown sand in Maddison's hair 4 or 5 times. TALK ABOUT THROWING ME OFF GUARD! I didn't know what to say a first. The boy told me that tomorrow all the boys are going to "guard" Maddison in a line, or maybe in a circle when she plays in the usual spot in the sand. It sounds like he has a protection plan in order. I think I need a plan too. I had no idea we were looking at something to this degree. I just want to find out who this girl is and STOP the trouble she is causing.
I really dont get it. In Maddison's class she is "prized"....and when I say "prized" I mean that all the kids watch out for her. They all care about her well-being and always ask if she needs to go to the nurse. They worry when she misses school and many have sent home pictures they draw for her that include animals because they know she is ALL about animals. They all want to sit with her at lunch. At least, these are the things I see when I am there. I know that last year Maddison had a few girls that were mean to her on occasion, but that was simply "no you can't play with us" type stuff. I thought it was because she was repeating 1st grade with all new faces. This year hasn't been so bad, and Maddison has a very close friend that she is always playing with. Every "bad day" that Maddison has I ask her about. Rarely does she mention a conflict, and never has she mentioned something like this. WHY are kids so mean? I just will never understand it.
I have a meeting with the school counselor tomorrow to talk about this "bully" and see if we can pinpoint who it is. I didn't see this coming at all. Maddison hasn't really complained about it either. I really think I am done with public school. This bully isn't the reason. This bully is my breaking point. I have had to FIGHT for Maddison every damn year. Since Kindergarten I wanted her tested for learning concerns and she never "qualified" because she "hadn't fallen behind yet." Once she did start to fall behind she was diagnosed with the "D" demon and it was downhill from there. The confidence she once had diminished almost overnight, not because of the Diabetes, but because she can't keep up in the classroom and doesn't complete tasks timely. It doesn't help that she's in the nurses office 3-7 times a day trying to escape the "torture" because she doesn't know how else to cope with feeling "incapable." She is bored, she lacks concentration, and doesn't learn best by listening. She learns best by doing and seeing. She will never succeed when she feels bad about herself. She will never be the student she could be when she is trying to learn a way that her brain is not wired to learn. She will never have confidence when the damn bully beats her down, throws sand in her hair and taunts her by calling her "one inch Maddison." This has to stop. I'm going crazy looking for the answer and I'm being naive to think a public school has the answer. I've been trying for an answer since Kindergarten.
This is our 4th year (K, 1st, repeat 1st, 2nd) and I'm tired. I want the teasing and boredom to stop. I want Maddison to enjoy learning. I want her to be confident in school as she is away from home. Back from the zoo field trip, I have alot to think about!

Awwww :( my heart goes out to you both and I hope they are able to find out who this "bully" is and put her in her place! Kids can be so cruel and often times teachers sweep it under the rug because it's just "words" but those words stay with you forever!
(((BIG HUGS)))
Speaking from experience, you should be able to find out who the bully is, have the called into the principal's office, and put short shrift to this nonsense! And you can run into a new bully a few years in a row. Once word gets out that your child is "off limits" the bully will pick on a different target. You will not be able to stop the more subtle types of harrassment (girls talking against each other behind their back, etc.) I hear you and it is hard. The diabetes makes one hypersensitive to this, as they already go through so much, but Madison is not alone, other kids experience this. I love that the children in her class love her and stand by her and am very touched that the boys are willing to guard and protect Madison. I think that is very sweet. If school is not a good experience in general then I am all for switching schools. Homeschooling could be an option; unfortunately, in the upper grades the schoolwork becomes more involved. I am sure there is a solution for this though (in our state, it is very difficult to homeschool). I say investigate all your options, make the best decision for your daughter and go for it!Girl Meets Needle has totally saved Piggy's bacon -- again. For the second time this month, I've been tagged to complete a meme. So here goes...
What is your all time favorite yarn to knit with?
I'm going to have to go with Malabrigo Worsted. It's lusciously soft, and comes in fantastic colours. I'm not sure it's my favourite overall -- the pilling isn't ideal -- but in terms of the actual knitting, it's tops.
Your favorite needles?
Addi Turbos.
The worst thing you've ever knit?
Ummm...well, I started to knit a cabled afghan for my friend's wedding. I thought a hand-made present would be so much more meaningful than something off their registry.
Not this afghan, however. The pattern was from a Leisure Arts booklet; I can't remember the name. It was done on big needles (12mm/US 17), with two strands of green Bernat Satin held double.
At the time I bought the pattern and the yarn, I had recently finished Yarn Harlot: The Secret Life of a Knitter, and I laughed that I wouldn't be like the Harlot, who set out to knit a green afghan as a wedding present for her brother's wedding, failed to complete it on time, and instead gifted the happy couple with a blender or something like that.
Well, of course the joke was on me. As I should have known. I was not only a new knitter, but also a procrastinator of the first order. Seriously, I could -- and can to this day -- procrastinate for Canada. Anyhoo. The whole thing was a disaster. Of course I fell behind schedule, but that wasn't the real problem. The real problem was the bloody thing didn't look anything like the picture, despite my gauge being bang-on. It got frogged.
Bottom-line: I did give the happy couple a hand-made gift: a very nice vase with a crystalline glaze. Made by my father.
Your most favorite knit pattern? (maybe you don't like wearing it...but it was the most fun to knit)
I think the most satisfying knit I've done so far was the Smariek's 3 a.m. Cable Hat, which I knit as a Christmas gift for the bride in the above answer! Not a complicated project, but it was my second attempt at cables, and turned out rather well. Although, come to think of it, I've never seen the recipient wear it...
Most valuable knitting technique?
Well, I'm still pretty much a novice knitter, so I don't really know too many fancy-pants techniques. But I think I've figured out mattress stitch (like, yesterday), which should prove helpful.
Best knit book or magazine?
I don't like this question. I suspect I feel like a mother who has just been asked to name her favourite child, or a chef asked to pick just one herb to use for the rest of his professional life. At least book-wise. But if pressed, I suppose I'd have to go with Knitting Rules! by the Harlot. It's a pretty good balance of useful information and enjoyable prose.
Magazine: Interweave Knits.
Your favorite knit-a-long?
CoughI've never done one.Cough.
Your favorite knitblogs?
Look to your right, and down a bit. I love all of those. For a start.
Your favorite knitwear designer?
Hmmm...again, this is a hard one. Can I pick someone whose designs I've yet to knit? If so, I'll go with Ysolda Teague. I've purchased Gretel, but that was for a swap partner; I've looked it over, but would need to buy it again for myself. I also adore Vivian, Coraline, Matilda Jane and Snow White. Oh, and Verity. And those Rapunzel Stockings are lovely. The toys are sweet, too. So, just about everything, really.
The knit item you wear the most? (how about a picture of it!)
I haven't kept anything I've knit to wear; they've all been gifts. I have kept the Luna Lovegood scarf, but it's crocheted...I'll give you the pic, anyway:
Ok, so...I'm tagging Beentsy, MrsQuimby, Plae, Brenda, Yarn Sprout, and LupinGirl. Self-tagging is also encouraged. :-)
That's a really good meme, I will try to do it eventually. Believe it or not, I have all my posts planned and several even written for the rest of NaBloPoMo. Busy week so I had to get organized!
One of the better meme's I've saw so far.
I know that procrastinator thing too well. We can stitch faster in our minds than we can with our hands.
I love the scarf. Very nice. And we won't be talking about any of MY knitting disasters, thank you very much.
I just saw that you have my blog on your "worth it" list. Thanks so much.The Tennessee attorney general, along with 16 other state attorneys, called Wednesday for craigslist.org to remove its adult services section.
A letter to craigslist.org CEO Jim Buckmaster and founder Craig Newmark states that the website hasn’t done enough to fight online prostitution ads, and if it can’t screen the ads better then it should just shut down the adult services ads.
Attorney General Bob Cooper was quoted in a release as saying, “The increasingly sharp public criticism of craigslist’s adult services section reflects growing allegations that ads for prostitution — including ads trafficking children — are rampant on it. The company should take immediate action to help end exploitation of the women and children victimized as a result of these ads.”
The letter goes on to state that the company’s own “manual review” of the adult services ads did not appear to reduce the traffic of solicitations on the website.
According to the Associated Press, the other 16 states include: Arkansas, Connecticut, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia.
I'm sure others will disagree, but I'm pretty much a first amendment absolutist. Except for the yelling fire in a crowded theater, publishers of content are free to publish what they like despite how tasteless some politician running on a Puritan platform may deem it to be.
I'm skeptical that there is a problem with ads trafficking in children. I don't dismiss that there might have been one or two anecdotal incidents of such, but that hardly constitutes an epidemic and doesn't justify shutting down an entire section of the website that is undeniably popular with consenting adults.
I'll also say this... I'm an unapologetic libertarian when it comes to the private sexual lives of adults. If they want to hire a prostitute, that's between them and the prostitute. And when they make the arrangement on Craigslist, it doesn't become a public nuisance like it would be if prostitutes were flagging down johns at stop signs all up and down Murfreesboro Pike, Dickerson Road, and Charlotte Ave.
@global_citizen. Prostitution is NOT a victimless crime:
In most cases, it is human trafficking, i.e. slavery.
To Kryptonian. I'm a well educated adult, thank you very much. I can read about issues and form a different opinion than you. The link you posted quotes one person's study and makes no mention of peer review. I'd be willing to bet a great sum that the person who conducted this study is a radical feminist in the mold of Andrea Dworkin, who believes the simple act of a man penetrating a woman is an inherent violation of the woman.
That said, don't get me wrong. I'm a strong civil libertarian, a feminist, and firm believer in equal rights and social justice. However, I do not swallow every study at face value and I reject the findings of the link you posted.
Prostitution may not be entirely victimless, I'll concede that. However, no amount of stringent law enforcement - or abridgment of the first amendment - is going to stop the world's oldest profession. You know that and I know that. And I do not believe most who become prostitutes do so against their will. It's a choice they make.
And again, if it's going to happen (and it is) I prefer it be arranged on Craiglist instead of the intersections of Murfreesboro Rd.
The average age of entry into prostitution is between 12-14 years old, in the US. Whatever we may believe about prostitution, hopefully we can all agree that it is wrong to exploit children for sex and to force or deceive people (both men and women) into performing sex acts (or labor, or domestic servitude) for someone else's benefit.
There are many well documented cases of trafficking in persons and I know some in Tennessee, and their horrific stories, personally. Protecting children and adults from having their most basic rights as human beings violated is what we can all agree on, I trust, and work together for,
I understand and totally respect a variety of views on how to deal with Craig's List ads. And there are many other ways that predators sell their "wares" than just Craig's list, though it is a major player. We simply want to format those sources in such a way as to afford the greatest protection to people being coerced and children being manipulated.

Director , End Slavery in TennesseeANDERSON COUNTY, Tenn. (WVLT) -- Tyler Hicks lines up behind his center, gives the call, takes the snap, drops back, and fires a precision pass to one of his Anderson County receivers.
If you attend a Mavericks' practice, that's a scene repeated over and over. But it wasn't one you could have witnessed last year.
Not after Hicks suffered a brain injury from a March 20, 2012 car wreck.
"We didn't know if he would play football again," Mavericks head coach David Gillum said.
"His recovery has just been miraculous."
After the wreck, Hicks spent a month in the hospital, much of that time in ICU.
"The whole right side of my body above the waste was broken and damaged," a now-recovered Hicks said during practice.
When Hicks was released, he said it was "like starting life over again."
Arguably the most athletic student at Anderson County, he couldn't walk.
Everything had to be re-learned.
"It was different.. Everything was different. There wasn't anything like it was...athletically, my school work, nothing was the same. Everything was slower. "
"It was pretty hard seeing him not be able to do everything that he could. But, Tyler, you can't knock him down. I knew he'd come back," friend and teammate Jared Lindsey said.
And he did come back.
With therapy, the support of the community, and with help of his dad, day by day, Tyler showed improvement. First learning how to walk again, then jog, and then run.
He wasn't able to play football last fall, but today, a year after the wreck, he's back.
On the field. In the huddle.
"You get a warm feeling when you see him," Gillum said. "You get chills on your arms when you watch him. It is emotional, knowing what he went thru, that we got him back."
Hicks says he's ready to be hit. Adding that it's "been too long" since that's happened. He returns a smarter quarterback, and a wiser person.
"Anything can be taken from you on any day. Just don't take anything for granted."
His first snap in his first game this fall won't be a Hail Mary. After all, Tyler's prayers have already been answered.About This GigapanToggle

A group of state lawmakers gave the go-ahead this week to a bill associated with Florida’s Stand Your Ground law. But, as Sascha Cordner reports, some say the changes could go further, while others believe the measure decriminalizing firing a warning shot won’t do much at all.
A hate crime report compiled by the Florida Attorney General’s office shows a 22-percent statewide increase in hate crimes in one year. But as Jessica Palombo reports, hate crime experts say such reports are severely flawed because most offenses go unreported or unprosecuted.
After long months of study, including the collection of a number of anecdotes, Clearwater Senator Jack Latvala this week introduced a bill he says will crack down on lawmakers living outside the districts. As Stan Jastrzebski reports, the bill lists nearly two-dozen criteria which may be considered; even though Latvala says state lawmakers may not be subject to it if and when it passes.
Florida’s public universities are having a hard time finding presidents. The hunt for Florida A&M’s took nearly a year, and the search for a president of Florida Atlantic is in its final stages after several fits and starts. Now, as Lynn Hatter reports some are once again raising concerns about the way Florida finds its public higher education leaders.
Lawmakers are moving forward with a bill that would clear the way for Floridians to shoot off more fireworks.

Viruses can spread through email attachments, application programs on your computer, or application programs installed from disk drives.
In order to spread through a computer system, or network, a virus must be activated; meaning, the file that contains the virus must be opened, or executed in order for the virus to come to life. Once activated, viruses look for certain programs to infect, depending on what they've been programmed to do. The one thing that all viruses seem to do well is duplicate themselves within the programs they find, and that is how they spread.Perfect Lunch Restaurant: Northern Waters Smokehaus
When it comes to lunch in Duluth, the sandwich is king. Not one pizza place, burger joint or Asian restaurant managed to crack the top four in Perfect Duluth Day’s poll to determine the best lunch restaurants. Furthermore, the place with the best sandwiches in town, Northern Waters Smokehaus, smoked the competition. A solid majority of 55.4 percent of voters agreed Northern Waters is the best mid-day meal around.
Clearly the deliciousness is no secret — there’s almost always a noon-hour line at Northern Waters.
It turns out, Duluth’s best lunch restaurant isn’t really a restaurant per se, but rather a specialty fish-and-meat market with a couple of stools and a counter that accommodates about a half-dozen people. Outside there’s a deck with a few tables; everyone else either heads for the beach or a park bench, or devours the goods at their office or right in their cars without complaint.
The variety of sandwich options available, from Cajun Fish to Sitka Sushi to the “Silence of the Lambwich” make it easy to go back again and again to try out the latest concoction.
Eric Goerdt with the perfect lunch plaque
Eric and Lynn Goerdt started Northern Waters in 1998, supplying smoked fish to restaurants and caterers from a commercial kitchen in the Superior Business Center. They opened their retail location in the DeWitt-Seitz Marketplace in 2001 and won a Joel Labovitz Entrepreneurial Success Award a year later. In 2004 the production end of the business moved to DeWitt-Seitz and the eat-in counter was added.
(Northern Waters was featured on the Food Network’s Diners, Drive-ins and Dives in 2010, but that clip sadly does not seem to exist on the Internet.)
Honorable mention goes to another popular sandwich spot, the deli at How Sweet it is Cakes, which came in second place with 21.5 percent of the vote.

Nice! As a bonus you can go grab a cookie from Amazing Grace while you're there. The only drawback is that I have to say the bathrooms at DeWitt-Seitz are often curiously gross.

Re: DeWitt-Seitz bathrooms. Way too small for the amount of traffic, and poorly ventilated. Fortunately, there are more, roomier bathrooms away from the heavy traffic. I will not announce on this forum where they are, lest they lose their shiny, fresh, empty goodness.

Right on the heels of Mr emmadogs asking whether I get the PDD award for 'best nomination' comes this taunt from vicarious. Vicarious, you cannot bring this up, and then laugh evilly in the distance with glee while we curse ourselves for not knowing where the good restroom is, and you for taunting us with your secrets. Since I nominated Northern Waters first, I now demand my prize: access to this secret so big that it will change my life as I now know it.

Well, after work today, I was going to go skulk around the 2nd floor and above of D-S building, but I see that this is clearly not going to happen just yet. So...vicarious, thank you for the hints. I will go skulk this weekend, and I anticipate finding a bathroom with an attached sauna, attendants with heated hand towels, French bar soaps, etc. Obviously, by the time I get there, everyone else in town who reads this will be lining up, thus cursing this plan from the very outset. Anyway--thanks for the secret tip!!!

Australians have a love-hate relationship with their banks and research released today confirms what many retail banking customers have known for years: banks know what their customers want but are not responding to their customers needs.
The research report titled “What’s Critical in the Vertical: Retail Banking In Australia” was produced by the CMO Council and sponsored by Ricoh Infoprint Solutions and ComputerShare. The survey of 1270 consumers and 113 bank marketers revealed that the banks’ marketers know what troubles their customers and yet put their focus elsewhere, perhaps as a result of internal pressures from upper management within the banks themselves.
“I think they (marketers) clearly know. It comes down to business priority and budget. If your boss is saying focus on new acquisitions then that’s what you do,” said Director, Precision Marketing and Sales, InfoPrint Solutions, Mr Lee Gallagher. He went on to say that though marketers may know what would make a bank’s retail customers happy, upper management is not buying in.
With a high churn rate in the first one to five years, banks do have a bit of time to play with before they lose a new customer, if they act.
“I wouldn’t say banks have deliberately missed the mark but retention has definitely taken a back seat to acquisition, growing the customer base, taking market share,” said Mr Gallagher.
So get them in but don’t worry about keeping them seems to be the current focus of the Australian banking industry.
Reading between the lines, for banks, that means there’s a huge opportunity here. The first bank to genuinely respond to needs of customers should potentially score a landslide of new customers and do better at retaining its years one to five year churn customers.
“In the absence of competition, then service can get sloppy,” said Worldwide Customer Strategy Practice Leader with InfoPrint Solutions, Mr Mike Bryant. “Customers all want the same thing. What differentiates things here (in Australia) is the bank.”
Though the marketers said they knew their customers biggest sources of pain are: unmet needs and expectations, poor customer service and increases in costs, fees and charges, what they’ll be spending their time on this year are: improving relevance and value of communication and driving customers to use automated, self-service models.
It’s cheaper to have people self serve, so a bank’s profit may look nicer, but it doesn’t make their customers happy, or loyal.
“Only about one out of the 44% of people (who trust their bank) is actually loyal to their institution”, said Mr Gallagher.
A significant number of people are also seriously questioning the business practices and ethics of their bank, and 61% of people surveyed tell friends and family about their banking problems. (Perhaps it’s no wonder that only one percent of marketers surveyed will be doing anything this year to try to drum up word of mouth referrals.)
The challenge now is for banks to deliver the efficient, value-added service options, and reduced costs, customers want. If the survey data holds true then the first to do so will win the lion’s share of new business in the coming years. Surely an obvious, but fairly attractive, acquisition strategy?Join or Sign In

The effect of timber harvest on the Fool Creek watershed, 30 Years Later
Troendle, C. A.; King, R. M. 1985. The effect of timber harvest on the Fool Creek watershed, 30 Years Later. Water Resources Research. 21(12): 1915-1922.
The Fool Creek watershed at the Fraser Experimental Forest, Colorado was harvested using a pattern of alternating clearcut and forested strips in 1956. Today, with almost 30 years of postharvest record, subtle impacts on the hydrology of the watershed can be detected that were not significant in the past. In addition to the depositional increases in the snowpack in the openings, average peak water equivalent over the entire watershed has been increased (9%). Long-term, postharvest, climatic records now available show a strong correlation between estimated increases in flow and winter and melt period precipitation. Much of the annual variability in increased flow, now explained by precipitation, was formerly attributed to regrowth or time. Peak discharges, advanced 7.5 days following harvest, have also been increased 20%, with the largest effect occurring in the wettest years. Increases in peak water equivalent, annual flow, and date of peak flow occurrence all appear to be returning to preharvest levels at a very slow rate.

We’ll admit two things about the upcoming 2010 Santa Cruz Tallboy 29er:
1) We’re surprised as heck to see it given Santa Cruz’s comments on our 29er DH post and on their engineering guy’s own blog, and…
2) We’re a little late to the game on posting this. Ã‚Â It’s been in the wild for a couple weeks now, depending on who you talk to.
So, to make up for the latter, we’ve accumulated lots and lots of pics, specs and details for your viewing pleasure. Ã‚Â Here it is, the 2010 Santa Cruz Tallboy 29er. Ã‚Â It’s a carbon-fiber frame with next-generation VPP pivots that have grease ports and angular contact bearings, aluminum pivot axles and titanium hardware. Ã‚Â It’ll come in four sizes, from Medium to XXL, and it’s light!
Hit ‘more’ for all the goods…
QUICK SPECS:
- 100mm travel
- VPP suspension linkage w/ grease ports
- Titanium hardware
- Aluminum pivot axles
- Carbon Fiber frame
- 17.5″ chainstay length across the size range
- Availability targeted for October delivery
- Pricing TBD
THE BITS AND PIECES:
The Tallboy will be Santa Cruz’s third carbon fiber bike, and they say they’re becoming more enamored of the material. Ã‚Â Click on any of these images to enlarge:
The bottom bracket area where the BB shell will be bonded in.
The seat tube section, with the molded-in upper pivot mount.
The rear triangle. Ã‚Â The right side shows the chain guard. Ã‚Â On the left is a clever little touch, a metal rotor guard to keep your brake rotor from scratching/nicking the frame. Ã‚Â Santa Cruz will actually start sticking these on all frames shortly, and they’re available for retro-fit, too.
PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER:
This mockup is unrideable, but shows what the frame will look like (mostly…it is still in prototype phase). Ã‚Â Note the very short headtube, a tapered 1-1/8″ to 1-1/2″ tube that houses an inset upper bearing.
The bike is built with 100mm travel. Santa Cruz claims it’s super stiff, testing stiffer than their 26″ Blur XC, and just slightly less stiff than their Blur LTc. Ã‚Â If it can match a well-respected XC bike like the Blur in stiffness while having the larger wheels, it should be good.
Frame weight is pegged at right about 5lbs with shock, making it pretty darn light…which you can see can be easily built up to a bike that weighs on par with an average 26″ wheel mountain bike:
Almost 27 lbs, but here’s the deal. Ã‚Â This bike ain’t built light as you’re seeing it here:
That Crank Brothers Joplin seatpost alone is 534g (1.17 lbs). Ã‚Â Put a 250g (average) Thomson seatpost in there and you just dropped over 1/2 a pound. Ã‚Â Swap the Candy pedals for comparable Eggbeaters and drop another 30g. Ã‚Â Santa Cruz said the wheels in this pic aren’t super light, and the seat is a CroMo railed piece. Ã‚Â In otherwords, getting this bike down to 25.5lbs shouldn’t be too hard or terribly expensive…and it remains to be seen what built kit SC will offer on the bike. Ã‚Â (BTW – That’s a size Large bike in the pic.)
You can keep yourself up to date here (we promise…no more late entries on this bad boy) or by watching the Santa Cruz blog.
WOW, Just stumbled across the new santa cruz tallboy. i had no idea S/C were introducing a 29er into there already formidable fleet. i ride the Blur LT2 and find it a faultless ride, however i am one who is never content and need to evolve at all times. after riding a Ã‚Â£1000 fisher hard tail 29 er i was astonished at the extra grip and the smooth rolling over rocks, and all this on a wet trail of which i had previously ridden 9 other top end bikes during a demo day. hope this bike will be available in England so i can test ride it. the only doubt i would have is the bikes limitations as regards the all mountain riding that i do, my Blur is built up heavy at 32 pounds.I realize the tallboy does not carry the all mountain tag but i just can not afford two bikes of this calliber.Yes i want it all and want it now, Ha Ha.

Three-time Ad Age Multicultural Agency of the Year winner Dieste opens this year's Hispanic Radio Conference with a presentation designed to provide ideas and advice on how to unlock the potential of the Hispanic market and avoid land mines -- all with an eye (and ear) toward helping attendees create better marketing in the digital and mobile era. This special presentation will also demystify, but, more important, challenge the "total market” approach -- all too often used as an euphemism for a "one size fits all" approach to marketing communication across multiple ethnic market segments. Presenters: Carla Eboli, Chief Marketing Officer/Dieste, Dallas Gabriela Gonzalez, Senior Strategic Planner/Dieste, Dallas 3:40-4:20 p.m. Hispanic America: The Changing Challenges and Opportunities of an Aging Population Mirroring the nation's shifting demographics, Hispanics in America continue to grow older, with the median age steadily increasing over the past 15 years. In fact, by 2050, Hispanics will make up 20 percent of the elderly population, up from 7 percent in 2010, according to census data. And the number of Hispanics 50 and older in the United States is projected to grow from 9 million today (out of a total of 50.5 million) to more than 35 million by 2050. And here are even more interesting statistics: According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Latino population is projected to more than double, from 48.4 million in 2009 to 106.2 million people by the year 2050. Similarly, between 2008 and 2030 the Latino population aged 65 years and older will increase by 224 percent compared to a 65 percent increase for the white population. What do these changes mean in terms of brand preferences, consumer habits, and marketing tactics? Our panel explores the issues and analyzes what it all means to radio and advertisers. Moderator: Celine Matthiessen, VP/Analytics & Insights, BIA/Kelsey Dr. Alan B. Albarran, Professor & Chair, Department of Media Arts, University of North Texas/Denton Rafael Ayuso, Manager of Communications, AARP/Texas, Austin Dr. Lloyd Potter, Texas State Demographer & Professor of Demography, University of Texas/San Antonio 4:20-5:00 p.m. Playing the Ratings Game to Win: Issues and Opportunities Whether it's PPM or diary, the ratings are most programmers' report card. But how stations are measured is a constant issue with many programmers. This session will review the state of Nielsen's measurement of the Hispanic population, with a focus on what is changing, and the unique issues that Hispanic broadcasters face in 2015. Also covered: what it takes to grow a station’s reported audience. Moderator: Charlie Sislen, Partner, Research Director Liz Blacker, EVP/U.S. Hispanic Strategy and Sales, iHeartMedia Mike McVay, SVP/Content & Programming, Cumulus Media Monica Narvaez, Hispanic Broadcaster Account Specialist, Nielsen 5:00-5:40 p.m. Tomorrow's Talent: Where Are They, How Do You Find Them? How is Hispanic radio developing talent? After decades of importing talent from outside the U.S., many believe the next great personalities will be native-born. And with a shrinking number of on-air positions, where do you find, and how do you develop, the next superstar -- particularly with today's limited budgets? Meanwhile, syndicated programming continues to grow. What are the pros and cons, and how does a station maximize marketing and revenue opportunities with syndicated personalities?

Our panel of bankers, brokers, and equity investors will consider Hispanic radio as an investment. What does a radio company, specifically a Hispanic radio company, need to look like in 2015 to attract today's more cautious investors? And what is the environment for private equity, debt financing, and privatization options over the next 12 months for Hispanic radio operators? Moderator: Drew Marcus, Managing Partner, Sugarloaf Rock Capital, LLC Jeff Hinson, President/CEO, YouPlus Media, LLC Jeffery Liberman, Chief Operating Officer, Entravision Communications John Oxendine, Chairman, President and CEO, Blackstar, LLC 9:25-10:10 a.m. The Hardest ... If Not the Oldest ... Profession Many local and general sales managers will tell you that sales management is the hardest job in radio today. They have more people to manage, more things to sell, and less support staff than in years gone by. They have to stay on top of everything and are frequently so inundated with "answering up" that the line of reps outside their door, waiting for answers, leaves little time for brainstorming. In addition, if they are not Hispanic, they need to learn the nuances of Hispanic culture -- and fast! To the rescue is our panel of sales experts, armed with inspiration and ideas that your sales manager -- or you -- can take back to your station. This session is guaranteed to help you better manage your staff, plan and organize your time, and bring results to the bottom line. Our sales gurus will offer suggestions on how to bill more revenue for your clients, and your station, tomorrow. You'll also walk away with Ideas about how to combine digital and radio assets into creative client opportunities that can lead to bigger shares and stronger marketing ties.

They have to buy it! How can you get them to think the same of your Hispanic station -- and act on it? What distinctions can you spotlight about your audience and its buying power and potential? How can "big data" and other research help bring new business and revenue to the table? Upscale or downscale, what's the upside your unique listeners can bring to the retailers in your market? Plan to walk away after this presentation with new approaches, new ideas, and new awareness of the revenue potential your station may be missing -- and how to be a "must have" buy with your advertising clients!

Media Re-Defined - What Clients Want
Today's top agencies earned that distinction by asking themselves, "How can we best serve our clients?"

Truth is, the market is saturated with all kinds of high-tech digital cameras. Well here's one more. The 5.0 Mega Pixel Waterproof Camera from VuPoint Solutions is a great option for all of the snorkelers, divers, and sea spray-phobes on your holiday list. According to the company, the camera, which comes with a removable waterproof case, is capable of capturing both photos and videos in up to 50 feet of H20. And at approximately $100, this is one picture snapper that won't break the bank.

There are several core items that every boater should own—a compass is certainly one of them. Good thing this monogrammable version from Red Envelope ($89.95) isn't just practical, it's handsome too, making it a gift-worthy keepsake. Though the compass is fashioned after an antique pocket watch, it features some decidedly high-tech engineering. Namely, a tungsten-steel needle and a military-standard capsule, which help ensure fast and reliable readings no matter where you are.

It's a great option for quick, onboard repairs and is easy to keep track of, given that it clips directly onto your key chain. (Just remember to stow it with your checked luggage before you try and clear airport security.)

Ukrainian practice drozdov&partners has been announced as winners of an open ideas competition for the Dalseong Citizen’s Gymnasium. As part of the district’s centennial anniversary, the competition aims to replace an existing, outdated sports hall with a new gymnasium complex for the local residents of Hyeonpung-myeon, a neighborhood within the Daegu district of Dalseong-gun.
The winning design favors a minimalist approach, integrating a “simple volume” within the hillside site that reactivates an existing public plaza and sports hall, while strengthens its connection to the surrounding neighborhoods, schools and city transit.
Construction is expected to begin in 2015. More project information and images, after the break.

Edvard Munch said that “art comes from joy and pain,” and then he added, “but mostly from pain.” Melville’s description of his recently completed novel, Moby-Dick, also describes most of the great artistic and literary achievements in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
“It is of the horrible texture of a fabric that should be woven of ships’ cables & hausers. A Polar wind blows through it, & birds of prey hover over it.”
Published in 1851, Moby-Dick was ridiculed by critics and reviewers, in no small measure because his Victorian readers took offense at his impiety and latent atheism. But in reality, this literary masterpiece is one of the most aggressively honest explorations of Christianity that emerged from the nineteenth century. In his famous chapter 42, “The Whiteness of the Whale,” Melville’s Ishmael implies that God might even be responsible for evil:
Though in many of its aspects this visible world seems formed in love, the invisible spheres were formed in fright.
Melville was haunted by God’s inscrutable sovereignty, a power and majesty that terrified him because he was hidden. (In this way, Melville’s response is not unlike Luther’s well-documented hatred that he harbored at the righteousness of God before he “broke through.”) Perhaps more than any American writer, Melville felt deep in his bones the terror of a God who kills and makes alive, a God of wrath, eternal decrees, and unapproachable holiness. Melville’s God is, in the words of theologian Steven Paulson in his book Lutheran Theology, an unpreached God. Life without a preacher, Paulson writes,
is life with a silent God whose will is immutable and who stands on high mountains, like Zeus on Olympus, hurling thunderbolts called fate, judgment, and death…”
Or, in Melville’s world, this silent God is a colossal white whale that terrorizes from the unseen depths of the seas, striking all who dare pursue him. (Ahab, the lunatic captain, bears the visible marks, not unlike Jacob, of having wrestled with the Divine.) For Paulson, we must encounter and then flee from this terrifying God of seeming arbitrary wrath and judgment in order to find the God who saves. And this is done only through a preacher (Rom. 10: 14) who proclaims in Christ a God who is terrifying and arbitrarily gracious, who is not against us but for us. The preacher reveals that grace not judgment is God’s last word. But in Moby-Dick, God remains forever unpreached, and therefore, arbitrary, monstrous, and terrifying–retreating further and further away until it strikes, and completely destroys (judges) the Pequod. And yet.
And yet there is a survivor. Amidst the polar wind and birds of prey of Moby-Dick, grace operates throughout the novel. But it is most obviously and inexplicably present in the Epilogue. How does Ishmael survive the sinking of the Pequod? How does he, the one who is named after a Biblical castaway, a wanderer in the line of Cain, survive? The biblical Ishmael is the one who is rejected by his father Abraham in favor of Isaac, the child of promise. However, like his biblical namesake, who is nevertheless cared for and blessed by God, Ishmael is blessed by Melville, his creator, who, by putting the words of Job in his mouth (“And I only am escaped alone to tell thee.”)
The strangeness of Ishmael’s survival was not lost on Melville’s reviewers. Many read it as a gratuitous addition. And let’s face it, it is. Melville’s Ishmael survives only as a gratuitous decision by his creator in the form of an inexplicable, un-warranted Epilogue.
An act of one-way love.

Evangelical:An Auckland University of Technology student with cerebral palsy will reach new heights when he climbs all the steps in the Sky Tower in a bid to raise disability awareness.
Jordon Milroy, 22, has battled the challenges of cerebral palsy - a condition caused by brain damage due to a lack of oxygen during pregnancy - all his life. On April 17, he will take on another challenge, climbing all 1267 steps in New Zealand's tallest building.
It's a big deal for someone who often uses a wheelchair to get around. However, although Mr Milroy's mission might be massive, his aim is simple.
"I hope that people learn a bit more about cerebral palsy and disability. And I hope to get to the top alive and in one piece."
To ensure he does make it to the top, he has been training intensely for the past year, climbing 14 levels of steps in his apartment building almost every day as well as going to the gym.
Mr Milroy said maintaining a positive mindset was crucial.
"Mentally, I have been telling myself I am able to climb it. Believing in yourself is the most important thing."
He has also been receiving help from Carabiner, a mentoring programme for youth with disabilities and an initiative of the YES Disability Resource Centre.
"It works by setting goals," Mr Milroy said. "Mine was to do with sports and they match me up with somebody in the sports industry. We work on this goal together."
Carabiner co-ordinator Cam Calkoen said he was inspired by Mr Milroy's "desire to make a difference".
"His passion and vision are second to none, but what I really admire is how he's looked at the bigger picture and said, 'How can I use this to create awareness about disability?"'
Mr Milroy has also been fundraising to buy off-road wheelchairs for disabled youth in Samoa. He said it was a project that was close to home.
"Growing up in Samoa and having a disability means access is a big barrier in normal everyday life. Knowing first-hand about this, I wanted to give something back."
With just over a week to go, Mr Milroy said that despite feeling "a little bit scared", he was looking forward to the big day.
"There's a fire burning inside me which can't wait to climb this baby."Every few months you see a movie, a speech, or a picket about just wages and a call to elevate the minimum wage.

(AP) - A former police officer in Humboldt County claimed one of his superiors offered to buy dinner and drinks for members of a unit that investigates marijuana grows if they met a quota for seizing pot plants and money from cultivators.
The Times-Standard of Eureka reported Saturday that former Arcata Police Department officer Kevin Stonebarger made the allegation in a sworn declaration for a lawsuit brought by a widow who is suing the city over a 2011 raid at her home.
Stoneberger said a sergeant promised the celebration that year if the department's Special Services Unit destroyed 10,000 marijuana plants and recovered $150,000 from people found to be growing weed illegally.
A lawyer for the city, Nancy Delaney, denied any wrong-doing by police and accused Stoneberger of lying in the declaration.
The Times-Standard said Stoneberger resigned from the force last year because of a knee injury.

Both multimedia options feature photos, local videos, and national videos.
The Washington Post's multimedia options are certainly greater than the Pioneer Press. The Press, as a local news organization, is more focused on local news. The Post is a national affiliate, and therefore has more news covering the national level.
Multimedia options do a great job of presenting a story through photographs or video instead of words.
The language in multimedia stories is different, it doesn't always have to be past-tense. The captions describe what is going on in the pictures, while still progressing the story forward by saying how that picture relates to what the story is about.Press Releases

I.
Of the three would rather have seen Stephen go. I think they want him for his prissy personality as a foil. Camera Personality wise, Elia was the weakest of the three.
Really like most of the players, wish Jamie had won tonight.
And what the hell, did none of these people watch any season other than their own? This isn't the first time they had chefs eat and comment on their competitors dishes.
Mike I can get off my screen anytime now. Used to think I didn't like Spike, but he pales in comparison of the odiesness that Mike I. is.
Stephen has never impressed me as being that interested in being a chef--a restaurant owner, sure, but not so much a chef-owner. He'd rather manage the house and the wine cellar, and he might do a decent enough job of that. I agree that he was probably kept because of his on-camera personality.
I'm actually glad that they stuck to the rules and disqualified Richard. I like Richard well enough, but he was plating past the time limit and no matter who did that, the penalty should apply. I do kind of wish Jamie had won, but I'm impressed by the fact that Angelo seems to have learned a lot about how to curb his ego since his first show.
Was anyone else kind of surprised by the way the different chefs looked? Richard appears to have lost a bit of weight, while others (like Mike I.) appear to be, well, enjoying their own cooking a bit too much. Oh, and I almost didn't recognize Tiffany Faison with her hair down. I realize she probably puts it up to keep it out of the way in the kitchen, but she should wear her hair down or loosely tied back more often. It's much prettier that way.
I third the motion that Stephen was kept around because of his personality. It was a wrong move on the show's part, because he seems much more reserved compared to his villainous streak back in S1.
Early on, I'm thinking Tiffani will win this. If she had been on any other season, I think she would have won. She and Harold were perhaps the strongest final contenders the show has ever have. Perhaps I'm going a bit too overboard on my compliments towards her, but the girl is good.
I don't think Stephan was kept for his personality. I think this show, above all others, operates with integrity when it comes to judging. Yes, they say Bravo has a vote but Tom C has said repeatedly that they judge the food and don't care what is going on in the kitchen. He has said that he would not have signed on to do this show otherwise and I believe that. There will be plenty of drama in that kitchen with the cast with or without Stephan.
Elia served raw fish; that trumped the others. I do agree that I would have prefered Stephan to go but I understood the decision.
I loved seeing Fabio stand up to Anthony. Bourdain's arrogance is part of his appeal but he did go over the top last night. Fabio's dish could not have been that bad, it was pasta for crying out loud.
How many times do we have to watch a team or individual do three things on a plate and have it fail? Just do one dish! That was the main reason Tiffany lost the crown.
This is going to be a great season. Go Carla!
I think that part of the reason that Elia was sent home was because she didn't really try to change her dish. She said as much and the judges said it too. It sounded like a critisism when they were discussing Stephen's dish that he didn't know what he was trying to fix, but I think that actually helped him in the long run. He never cooked those dishes in the first place to know what to fix. Elia however said she loved her dish and wasn't going to change it too much. On top of that, she served them raw fish and admitted she didn't taste it.
I liked that Fabio stood up to Bourdain. He's right, critiquing, with helpful comments is much better for the chefs than putting them down.
loved that Dale was just making food for the fun of it since he had immunity. Obviously he did a decent enough job to be in the middle, but then had fun making what he wanted to make.
I still don't like Mike I, he just irritates me for some reason.
Too bad Richard went over the time, he at least was in the running for winning. I did appreciate that they brought him out to acknowledge that his was a great dish, but then told him he was disqualified due to over-time. He didn't have to wonder how good his dish was. Too bad he went over too since it didn't look like he was doing anything substantial in those last few seconds. Bet he won't make that mistake again.
I don't think she'll win, but Carla is still one of my favorite people on there to watch. She genuinely felt bad when whoever said they got a bad part of the meat.
Did it seem to anyone else like Elia was never in it? To not test the fish, to barely change the original dish, to not even notice that the top of the fish was raw? That's crazy....I wonder if she got in there and realized she just didn't want to go through another season, because she's obviously a better chef than that.
Richard took his dq very well I thought. He didn't seem to feel like he was cheated out of a win, and no matter what Dale said, those few extra things he was putting on the plate after time was out might HAVE been the difference in winning or not. His dish was good enough that he was safe anyway, so it was a fair call. As for his weight, there was an article about him in the Atlanta paper yesterday and he mentioned that he just didn't like how he looked on television, so he committed to exercising and getting in shape after his season. he's lost 20-30 pounds since then.
I was really surprised too that none of the chefs even considered that they would be watching the critiques...seems like an obvious, especially if they had watched other seasons.
And speaking of critiques, I was glad Fabio called Bourdain out. Bourdain is clearly incredibly intelligent, well traveled with a great palate and good skills in the kitchen (as well as being a fabulous storyteller-read Kitchen Confidential, it was great) but the quips are better saved for his own show. He makes for great television, but it must be so frustrating as a contestant to hear something like "Are you running a crackhouse" instead of hearing where the dish failed and where it could be improved on. Fabio made his point really well-if you hated the dish, don't just make fun of it, say WHY you hated it so he can learn from his mistakes. That's why the fans hated Toby after all, because he was more interested in thinking up one liners than actually judging the food.
This episode was very interesting for me and I was conflicted about the challenges. In the quickfire, I really didn't like that the teams ranged from 2-4 members. It's debatable if more chefs on a team was beneficial or detrimental, but I'm sure it kinda sucked that there were four chefs with immunity when there might have been only two.
And in the elimination challenge, while it was brilliant in a lot of ways, I don't know if it was as fair to, say Stephen and Jamie, who had to recook dishes that weren't theirs in the first place and that they both hated the first time around. Sure makes a difference compared to someone like Angelo (even though I love him) who basically only had to tweak a dish in his own style that he really enjoyed cooking. Makes you wonder if Jamie might have won if she was cooking something she was passionate about.
As for Jamie, even if her soup was the best part of that quickfire dish, I think she was maybe to blame for their team losing. I felt like she was so against the idea of working with Fabio and Carla that she really pushed them into the decision to make three seperate dishes. The other two were always pretty good at working in teams, and it would have probably been better to have a single, coherent dish.
I didn't watch season 7 but I'm watching the all-star's. So far I like it. I was sad to see Elia go right away. I don't like Marcel but I think he's a good enough chef to be there for awhile. I hope they don't use Bourdain as a guest judge too much, don't like him either. I was glad Fabio stood up for himself against him. According to the previews it looks like this will be a good season.

My impression is that Stephan is "carried" on Top Chef primarily because of his palate (which must be impeccable, honestly to be a master sommelier) which mitigates the fact that he is FAIL technically. He probably knows what everything should taste like, he just literally can't physically execute.
As for Blais, yeah it's a cheap way for someone else to win, especially since Blais was probably timing his molecular stuff down to the second for perfect plating and went 5 seconds over. But it's also interesting... winning the first challenge has been a bellweather landmark on the show but it also is telling about Blais... the most talented chef ever on the show but who might never win due to personality/judgment flaws..Quote:

December 29th, 2011 by Ric Hanson
DES MOINES – Required annual training starts Jan. 17 and concludes on Feb. 29 for confinement site manure applicators at many county Iowa State University Extension offices. Seven dry manure classes will also be held. “Confinement site applicators are required to attend annual training, even though their certificates are good for three years,” said Jeff Prier, DNR coordinator of the program. “It’s also a good reminder of new and existing rules and other information pertinent to applicators and producers.”
Certificates expire on Dec. 31. To avoid late fees, certification renewal must be submitted to DNR no later than March 1. Applicators whose certificates are expiring must complete the training, and submit forms and fees. Confinement site applicators must attend two hours of training each year of the three year certification. A $25 continuing education fee is charged and pre-registration is required. Prier said even those who received initial certification the fall of 2011 must complete training in 2012. Applicators can find contacts for registration and a list of counties where the training is available at.
Those applicators who cannot attend a training session should contact their local Extension office to schedule time to watch a video. Extension offices may charge a $10 fee to show the video outside of a scheduled showing. Applicators may also take a 50‐question exam. Contact the DNR field office most convenient to you to make an appointment, by calling:
• Northeast Iowa, Manchester, 563-927‐2640
• North central Iowa, Mason City, 641-424‐4073
• Northwest Iowa, Spencer, 712-262‐4177
• Southwest Iowa, Atlantic, 712-243‐1934

When you give your life to something else, it solves all those other things. I'm urging you, and I'm challenging you, for
the next 30 days. Thirty days, will you do something once a day, for someone else outside your family, just 30 days ?
After 30 days, ask yourself: do I want to do another 30? All I'm asking you for is 30 days, 30 days.
Now if you will do that, I want you to make a commitment before the Lord right now, simply by bearing witness and
raising your hand, I will do this for the next 30 days. Okay, now I want you to look around - keep your hands up - look
around. I want everybody to know that you're able to hold these - just have fun with it. Don't be judgemental, have
fun. Just ask each other: hey, what did you do this week?
Ma ybe someone who knows what they're doing with Facebook- because I don't - maybe you could start a Facebook
blog on Bay City Outreach thing called Salt and Light, or whatever you want to call it, and just have it there for people
to put their stories: hey, I was here, and this is what happened. You won't believe what God did. Hey, I was here and
this is what happened, you won't believe what I saw God do, and then when we start telling stories like that, it creates
energy; and I promise you, I promise you, this is what God has called Bay City to be. Regardless of who's standing
up here, this is what Bay City is: a group of people bringing heaven to every place they see hell on this earth. I urge
you to be that. Let's pray together.
Lord, You're wonderful, we love You, and we honour You. Lord, forgive me for the places I've buried my talent. I want
to be someone who uses what You've given me, to establish Your kingdom here. I'm going to pray a prayer with you,
if you mean it. I'll tell you the prayer first, and then we'll pray it together. If you mean it, I want you to get in on it, and
the prayer goes like this:
Lord Jesus, give me the courage to see things differently, and the irresistible urge to respond to what I see. So if you
mean that, right now under your breath, say: Lord Jesus, give me the courage to see things differently, and the
irresistible urge to respond to what I see. If you're here today, and you've never received what Jesus did for you
before the foundation of the world, and you just want to ge t onboard, you want to start your journey with God, you
could say something like this: Lord Jesus, I have no hope of saving myself, so I ask You to be the Lord of my life. I
choose to trust Your version of my story, instead of my own. Thank You Lord. Amen.

* Prices may differ from that shown
~~*~~*~~ Timotei Energising Orange and Mint ~~*~~*~~
~~*~~ I'm a Lady ~~*~~
Although I am most definitely female (I've got proof), I am probably the least feminine object in the world - my friends despair at my constant hoody and trainer combo but I'm happy and comfortable in my boyish ways. However, I do like to partake in bathtime and smell pretty. Unfortunately, this is what has driven me to writing this review. I purchased this in a small and rather useless pharmacy that insisted I spent £5 when all I wanted was some Tixilix for the girls as they had kennel cough - I bumped up my original purchase with a blank greetings card and a bottle of this gel because it sounded nice and I was in a rush - plus at £1.09 for 250ml, it seemed a reasonable price.
~~*~~ It's a shower gel ~~*~~
I'm not going to invest in separate shaving foam so my shower gel gets used for that (and for de-griming Puddle the Irish Water Spaniel when she's dipped herself in cow poop). A dollop the size of a £2 piece will lather up enough to cover my big ol body and will generally cover the whole of my dog when mixed with her curls - interesting stuff if you too have an 80's perm effect on your noggin.
~~*~~ Energising, my butt ~~*~~
It proclaims to be 'energising' presumably due to the inclusion of mint - the fact that there is a distinct lack of mint smell may attest to the fact that I do not feel energised after use. Neither does the Puddle. It does smell very orangey when using it but soon after, it fades and after a day's work it smells like stale sweat. I know I probably smell of stale sweat anyway in my rather pongy job but this is a strange sickly smell that I don't like. On a plus note, it doesn't seem to dry out my skin but it isn't as moisturising as other shower gels. It's a fairly nice smooth consistency without being too runny or having those horrible scratchy bits in it, and comes in a bright orange colour to prove it has seen an orange, once.
~~*~~ Ingredients and other rubbish ~~*~~
Actually to list the ingredients would be futile - does anyone really care or know what they mean - the only interesting one is glucose but since it states on the bottle that you're not allowed to drink it, this probably won't be of benefit to those in need of a sugar fix. The bottle is not particularly attractive but has an easy to use flip-top lid. This is a Timotei product from the aroma gel range - I may be tempted to try another flavour but won't be bothering with this one again. If however you'd like to make your own mind up you can find it pretty much anywhere - notably in poundland where I believe it was selling for a pound.

// TIMOTEI SHOWER GEL \\
--------------
THE PRICE
--------------
I picked this up from Wilkinson's whilst it was on sale for 99p, the usual price is around £1.70 - £1.90 mark.
I think this is a reasonable price for a reasonable shower gel.
----------------------
THE APPEARANCE
----------------------
The shower gel comes in a curved clear plastic bottle with a orange plastic lid.
On the front of the bottle is the Timotei logo and some more information, along with a large picture of a sliced orange and a little circle which contains a picture of mint.
On the back of the bottle is the usual information, how many ml you have, ingredients, what it does ect.
The gel itself is orange in colour.
Over all, a decent looking bottle but nothing special.
--------------------
MY EXPERIENCE
--------------------
The shower gel claims to be energising, I have to be honest though, it didn't make me feel any more energised.
The gel is orange in colour and has a jelly like texture, when you squeeze the bottle it does actually come out like jelly, it isn't smooth and runs out, its quite thick and breaks up as it comes out.
The smell of the shower gel is very nice, if you open up the lid and just squeeze the bottle to get a whiff it spells like pure orange juice, no sign of mint when you do this though, it actually smells good enough to drink, this probably being why on the back it tells me it isn't drinkable!
When the shower gel is applied onto my puff and put onto my body, the mint comes through very strongly the first few seconds it hits the skin, it blends perfectly with the orange and they both are a match in heaven, but after the gel has been on your body the strong smell of the orange and mint fades, with the mint fading the most and being non existent. You are then basically washing with a plain wash.
The gel does lather up quite nicely and smells nice for the first few minutes, afterwards when dry the smell is no longer on the skin and I don't feel more energised. It does clean you though!
Over all, a decent product.Untitled

"Somebody drove in last night, broke into the ATM machine. It looks like they tied machine with a truck or something and dragged it out and took it," the store manager said.
They did get surveillance video from the store, so they know they are looking for a white Chevy pickup.
The store manager, whose family owns the store, says the landlord will pay for the damages, but they have to take care of the rest.
The cash machine was later found near Bells, Texas, but there are no suspects and there was no money in the machine.
The manager says this has never happened before.
"Yeah, it’s always quiet. Most people, we know them. Regular customers. Neighborhood store, you know."
The manager says the machine belonged to the store. He says its worth about $3,000, and it was probably holding about $1,000.
The store is on Loy Lake Road near Hyde Park Elementary School in Denison.Hi all, I'm glad to announce the release of IPython 0.6.12.

Think on a company promoting its new ecosystem; the company gives away high-end devices for free (or almost free) and profits by the whole ecosystem (apps, ad-based free apps, accesories, etc.).
Possible, but highly unlikely. To create this kind of stir (a $400-$500 device for $100) a company would be losing quite a lot of money on every device. So first they need deep pockets. Then they need to make that money back, in an environment of $1 apps.. After having my iPhone for a year I've spent maybe $100-$150 on apps for it and I have quite a lot compared to most people. Then consider that this kind of hardware you will likely want to get a newer model in 2-3 years... I don't think it would be profitable.
I doubt there will be many new apps. The platform is still dead. Hard to justify starting development now for a dead platform. That's a very short time window to make back your development costs, when you know all the users of the platform you will ever have are already out there. Not sure how many touchpads there are in total now but it's not huge.
You can get a $100 tablet today. In 10 or 20 years time you'll still be able to buy a $100 tablet, and a $500 tablet which will be better (and more magical).
Anyway this means nothing.
The iPhone is the most popular smart phone in the US ( actually it holds both the #1 and #2 spots, it's that magical ;-) but it only has 20% of the US market after 4 years on the market.
The iPod has been around for 10 years, it still commands 65% of the music player market.
Both are subject to the same economic impact on technology.

Shortened URLOne of the heroes of Manchester United’s win over Liverpool this weekend was Danny Welbeck.
He led the line well alongside Robin van Persie, playing the full 90 minutes with his performance winning praise from Gary Neville who during commentary yesterday announced him as his man of the match.
Before the game on Twitter I played down fears about Welbeck starting.
After all despite only scoring one goal for United this season, it’s not as if the forward has let down United before with his hard work-rate and hold-up play impressing despite his gangly appearance sometimes making him look like a player on the verge of losing the ball often.
After all there’s a reason why Welbeck hasn’t played as regularly this year. Well two reasons actually, the first being he’s been a victim of RVP’s arrival and that Javier Hernandez has returned to form spectacularly. Together that’s resulted in Welbeck having less starts, less time on the pitch which has meant that his season hasn’t really got going.
Of course that’s not to say Danny hasn’t helped himself. He has missed some chances this season, the most notable coming away to Newcastle when he rounded Steven Harper only to fire wide of goal. However due to the competition he’s had perhaps it’s only natural to see him rush his efforts and after all it is easy to forget that he is still only 22 years old.
He’s still a baby in football-terms and is still learning how to become a better player. He still hasn’t probably finished growing and will only get stronger physically if he continues to work hard in the gym which will make it far easier for him to bully defenders more and get ‘in their heads’ before they’ve even stepped on the pitch.
In order to do that he will need to be score goals and be more convincing. However forwards can work hard without getting the rewards and sometimes all they need is a bit of luck to go their way, a ball to go in off their backside or for them to benefit from a close offside decision. Even a tap-in can be what’s needed.
Going back to yesterday’s game Welbeck worked hard and fully justified his place in the starting line-up. He played a part both goals spreading the ball to Patrice Evra for the first before being fouled for the free-kick that led to Nemanja Vidic’s goal.
In the second-half when United were under the cosh from a rejuvenated Liverpool he tracked back and played his part. Yes perhaps it would have been wise to bring on Hernandez from the bench. After all, his pace and energy would have frightened Liverpool’s defence but the game-situation didn’t require him. Liverpool were threatening to get an equaliser and it was wise to keep on Welbeck for his defensive duties particularly when United were struggling to keep hold of the ball.

OUT NOWBut the Pirates of Pewamo-Westphalia scored seven unanswered points in Game 5 to defeat the Warriors and move on to the state quarterfinals.
Huge momentum swings were the norm as Pewamo-Westphalia, ranked No. 6 in the state in Class C, won the first two games, 25-21 and 25-20.
The Lady Warriors, ranked No. 7, won the next two games 25-23 and 25-16. The Pirates won the tiebreaker, 15-8.
WMC ends its season at 37-12-3.
“When you get this far, it is all about momentum and that was very evident in set five tonight,” Bailey said.
In Game 5, the Lady Warriors went up 6-3, but the Pirates came racing back to tie it at 8-8 and then scored the next seven points for the win.
“We had the momentum until point eight,” Bailey said. “I call a time out and I said, ‘Pass the ball,” and what did No. 2 (the Pirates’ Kasey Schmitt) do? She served the board on us, seven straight points.
“So, it’s a game of momentum. You either have it or you don’t and if you get it, you’d better keep it.
“We did not come out and play one of our more stellar matches tonight,” Bailey added. “We were very slow behind the ball and our passing in the first set was atrocious. Let’s be honest, our team is based on serving and attacking and if we lack in either one of those skills it will be a tight match and that’s what happened tonight.”
Besides Maria Ma’s 20 kills, Rachel Bruinsma added 19 and Vanessa Eekhoff had 10. It was the first time all season Bruinsma did not lead the team in kills.
Bruinsma added 10 aces and Eekhoff had five.
Senior Julie Merz had 44 assists, Anna Sweetman had 13 digs and Bruinsma had three blocks.Baseball may yet prove to be sane
Two events this week may show that fiscal sanity is finally coming to major league baseball.
The first was the passing of the July 31 trading deadline and its relative lack of activity.
The second is the impending punishments to be doled out to Alex Rodriguez and several other players involved in the Biogenesis performance-enhancing drug scandal.
What do either, you say, have to do with baseball reigning in its exaggerated spending?
The lack of activity at the trade deadline, according to ESPN analyst Buster Olney, who predicted it during Sunday's Red Sox-Orioles telecast, is a result of general managers and teams just not being willing to take in players with huge contracts, no matter how much they could use them for the two-month pennant drive.
Almost all of the contenders could use a pitcher like the Phillies' Cliff Lee. None, however, wanted to pick up his contract.
Ditto for just about every other big name out there.
Instead, Olney said that teams are finding it cheaper in the long run to develop their minor league systems and try to structure future contracts more to their liking and the bottom line, than trying to "buy" a pennant, something which was in vogue just a couple of years ago.
That, plus the split into three divisions in each league with an extra wild-card spot, makes it tough for teams to be sellers as well. A poll of Phillies fans last weekend would have overwhelmingly been in favor of selling off some of the team's top (overpaid?) talent. But even in the wake of their recent eight-game losing streak, the 50-57 Phillies, or the Nationals, Mets, Rockies, Yankees, Royals and even the Seattle Mariners, can't be written off as out of contention yet, and their GMs and owners can't be so anxious to divest players.
There are two months to play yet. An incredible amount of change can happen in two months.
Don't think so? On June 1st, the Los Angeles Dodgers were 22-30 in the NL West, in last place, seven games out. Two months, a Yasiel Puig and a Hanley Ramirez later, they're in first place (57-48) with a 3½-game lead. They went 35-18 in that span after their bad start.
In the pre-division days, the Phillies would be tied for ninth place in a 15-team league and have to crawl over eight teams. A player purge should be expected in that situation. Now, they're third in their division and not all that far back. They don't look like a playoff team, but you never know.
As for the impending punishments, last week's 65-game suspension of the Brewers' Ryan Braun was remarkable, not in itself, but in the comments of his fellow players. Just a couple of years ago, the players and their union would have rallied around Braun, Rodriguez and the rest. Not so now. This time, players almost uniformly expressed their disappointment and disgust with Braun.
That means that the rank-and-file players (if people making an average salary of $2 million or so a year can be referred to as rank-and-file) must think that the players association is finally taking up their cause, instead of that of the ultra-exclusive guys such as Braun and A-Rod. All of a sudden, it doesn't look worth it to pump up your body with chemicals to enhance your chances of making really big money.
Kessler should resign
Joseph Nahas, attorney for Gilberton Police Chief Mark Kessler, put a nice spin on Kessler's profanity-laced videos at Thursday's Gilberton Borough Council meeting at which Kessler was suspended for 30 days for using borough equipment - guns - in the videos.
Nahas and Kessler's gun-toting supporters outside the borough hall state that Kessler was being denied his First Amendment right of free speech, but he wasn, Kessler can't be thrown into jail for making his inflammatory videos. He hasn't been and won't be.
But his First Amendment rights don't apply to his job or his position on the North Schuylkill School Board. As police chief, he took an oath to serve the public in Gilberton. Whether he likes it or not, part of that public may include a few "libtards" as he calls them. Whether he likes it or not, his bosses (Gilberton's taxpayers) have every right to expect better from their civil servants.
If you've seen the videos, you know what I mean. They're a disgrace to his uniform, all policemen, and Schuylkill County residents. If I were to post a video on YouTube, using similar language, whether it was on my free time or not, I suspect my bosses wouldn't be too happy about it and I'd fear for my job.
Kessler's claims on an area television station that the media has blown the situation out of proportion are bogus, as well. Why did he make the videos? So people would see them. Why did he use such foul language? For shock value.
He wanted his 15 minutes of fame and got them. He also is getting more than he bargained for. Now he should do the honorable thing, and resign from both his police chief post and his seat on the.Cowboy Magic® Greenspot® Remover dissolves dirt in minutes and does not need to be rinsed out. Great for last minute touch-ups and for cleaning horses in cold weather when they can not be bathed..Is comedian Pete Holmes related to the late actor John Ritter?
Both are actors and comedian. Pete Holmes bears a striking resemblance to John Ritter, however, Holmes was never heard talking about any relationship to the actor.
Holmes alternately describes himself as the giant John Ritter saying "I'm a huge John Ritter, I'm like John Ritter after he drank mutation tea." He's also quoted that he's a mix of his parents and the actor.
John Ritter, born on September 17, 1948 in Burbank, California was the son of country singer and actor Tex Ritter and actress Dorothy Fay Southworth. Ritter and his older brother grew up surrounded by show business. He is best remembered for his portrayal as Lothario Jack Tripper on Three’s Company. John died ten years ago of a heart ailment.
Pete Holmes was born on March 30, 1979 and raised in Massachusetts. Known for his stand-up comedy, Pete voiced the famous e-trade baby in the commercials for e-trade Financial Services.
Comedian Pete Holmes has merged his very silly impression of Christian Bale as Batman with Good Will Hunting for a very hilarious parody video. Watch it below.

Melanie Lindell
Major: Elementary Education
Year of Graduation: 2011
Graduate Program: Master's, Curriculum & Instruction, Winona State University
Please give a brief description of your current position and where you're working.
I am a resident in the Graduate Induction Program through Winona State University and the Rochester Public School District. Residents in this program teach at the elementary (K-6) level while also taking courses to earn a master's degree in Education. I will be teaching third grade at Franklin Elementary School in Rochester this year while also completing my master's degree in Curriculum and Instruction.
What path did you follow to arrive at your current job?
To earn the opportunity to be part of this program, I majored in Elementary Education during my time at St. Ben's and gained experience working with children through activities both on- and off-campus. I volunteered at a KIDSTOP location, helped at a Saturday School program, and taught a Sunday School class. I also worked at a KinderCare center and summer camp. My volunteer work as well as paid positions involving children helped set me apart during the selection process for the Graduate Induction Program.
What advice/suggestions would you have for students who might be interested in your career?
Students who are interested in teaching should take courses in Education and, most importantly, take advantage of opportunities to work with children! Any experience with children will help students learn and grow on their way to becoming passionate and effective teachers.
Students who are interested in attending graduate school in Education should search for programs like the Graduate Induction Program that allow residents to actively and consistently work with children throughout their courses.
What skills are important in your field?
The most important skills in the education field are clearly communicating and modeling ideas and expectations, actively listening to students' thoughts, and flexibly adapting plans to meet students' needs. Of course, these skills don't mean anything without a passion for education.
What activities/experiences were helpful at CSB/SJU (and elsewhere) in preparation for this career?
The most helpful activities and experiences I found were those where I was given room to be creative in how I worked with children and where I was able to observe and learn from professional educators whose ability to engage and empower children awed me. My most memorable experiences include talking with Education professors at CSB/SJU, participating in practicums and student teaching through my coursework, volunteering at a Saturday School program in St. Paul with other Bennies and Johnnies, and volunteering at KIDSTOP at an elementary school in St. Cloud. These opportunities provided a very important link for me between what I was learning in my Education courses and the real world of teaching and working with students.
What is the most satisfying/rewarding part of your job?
Since the school year is just getting started, I anticipate that the most rewarding part of my job will be watching my students grow throughout the year from children timidly stepping into third grade to children confidently leaping forward into fourth grade and beyond. Watching students finally grasp concepts they've been struggling with for weeks or light up with pride as they grow in confidence makes all the work that goes into teaching worth it.realmagick.com The shrine of knowledge.

Recently there have been several threads that have turned into a discussion of carrier-unlocked cell phones, and the benefits & drawbacks of buying an unlocked handset. To help consolidate this information and make searching easier, I've decided to create a single thread where DHC members can discuss this topic.
JamesK
2010-07-30, 12:20 PM
One comment I've heard about locked phones is long delays in getting updates. A friend has the Motorola Milestone and I believe she's still stuck on Android 2.0. A few months back, there was some discussion here about Rogers locked HTC Dream & Magic being stuck at 1.x, even though 2.x was available for the same phone from elsewhere. If the carriers sell locked phones, then they should be required, by law, to remove the lock at the end of the contract period.
TorontoColin
2010-07-30, 01:05 PM
Software updates aren't related to carrier locks so much as they're connected to carrier branding. Even if Rogers were to unlock a phone it would still need the Rogers software update.
Personally I feel carriers shouldn't be able to lock phones purchased outright or at the very minimum the packaging should be required by law to state explicitly that it is carrier locked.

Following up to TorontoColin, there is also a subtle difference for Android phones running custom ROMs.
Before the official 2.2 came out for the Nexus One many people, me included, were running pre-release versions. When the OTA update came out the build was not recognized so we had to wait for a custom ROM that had the new source.
Not a big deal, but worth noting.

can't agree with you more. Furthermore, the company should also de-brand the phone after the end of the contract.

Why should the consumer have to pay a 3rd party company to unlock their phones when their provider should be doing this free of charge. If I buy a phone on contract. When that contract expires, I own the phone outright. They should be sending me the unlock code if I request it.

By unlocking my phone(myself with the help of ppcgeeks) i was able to run custom windows roms on my phone. A phone loaded originally with WM6.1 and telus bloatware. Turned into a WM6.5 and then to a heavily tweeked WM6.5.XX with various versions of htc sense .. IT brought new life to my phone after being bored with it a year and a bit later. I also have android running on it.... The lock can prevent you from doing this, and well your warranty would be void im sure as well..
Basically unlocking and rooting your phone gives you options to run the latest software and roms..

Unlocking a phone refers to enabling the phone to work on another carrier's network. De-branding a phone means removing carrier-supplied software (and with smartphones, generally means installing custom roms).

Unlocked phones (phones purchased unlocked from the mfr, not from a carrier and then unlocked)
Benefits:
-choose any carrier you wish (provided hardware + frequency matches)
-use the default manufacturer's version of the OS = faster updates (e.g. Nexus One and Android 2.2 has been out for weeks, while many people are still stuck with 2.1)
-All features of the phone are available - phone companies like to disable certain features when providing their own version of the OS (usually to charge for you to use them, or because they take too much out of the company profit)
-Usually cheaper if you can get a lower monthly rate for 3 years vs a "free" phone and a higher monthly rate for 3 years.
Drawbacks:
-Large sum of money up front, vs 3-year financing (though see the last point above)
-Often no monthly-plan discount for buying a phone outright (though if you use a carrier that doesn't do monthly phone subsidies, you get the lowest rate regardless of phone - e.g. Wind or Mobilicity)
-Your warranty is with the manufacturer, whereas a locked, carrier-specific phone may be warranted by the carrier (and may be an instant swap in-store, should you have issues vs. send the phone to manufacturer to be fixed and wait)
-No "free" upgrade after x years.
That's my take on the matter.
For the record (in case there's any bias :p), I have an unlocked phone and a service plan with a company that doesn't offer phone subsidies (Wind).

@ TKG26: That's 'rooting' or 'jailbreaking' your phone. Unlocking refers to being able to use your phone on any carrier, while the two go hand in hand, they are not the same.

I have a very basic question. Here's the scenario:
I walk into a Bell store and purchase, say, an iPhone4. I buy the phone outright. A month later I go to Italy for 3 weeks. Can I walk into a phone shop in Rome, buy a SIM card and I'm on an Italian carrier's network? Or am I stuck with Bell's roaming and data charges?
IOW, does locked mean the same thing as "you can't use a SIM"?

Even iPhones purchased outright from a carrier are carrier locked, meaning that you would not be able to use another carrier's SIM card in your phone regardless of where you are.
If you buy an iPhone 4 outright directly from Apple it would come unlocked, so you would be able to use your choice of carrier, so you could use another carrier's SIM if you were to visit Italy.

Thanks, TColin. So to ensure I understand: a smartphone from Bell (BB, Android-based, iPhone) is carrier-locked (regardless of an outright purchase, or a contract). Does this death-grip apply to all Canadian carriers?
The fact that one can't travel, go to a phone store and buy a sim with prepaid minutes seems crazy. I'd be better off buying a phone in Europe when I'm there! OTOH, presumably people go to 3rd. parties to have their phone unlocked (?).
TorontoColin
2010-08-07, 12:43 PM
Almost all carrier branded phones in Canada are sold locked, with a few very minor exceptions (Mobilicity's Sony Ericsson TM506 for example). While none of the Big 3 carriers will provide unlock codes, you can get the unlock codes for many phones through third parties.
The iPhone though cannot be unlocked through a code and must be jailbroken to use it with another carrier, unless you buy it outright directly from Apple.

Thanks for all the information. I'm surprised the regulator permits carriers to sell locked phones only...but that's a discussion meant for another thread.

I heard good news from my doctor today. The MRI results came back and I have nothing serious going on with my back (YEAH!). With a little hard work, exercise, and some help from the physical therapist and the chiropractor, I should be back to normal in no time. Thankfully, the last few days have been good days with more movement and much less pain.
Unfortunately, my daughter now has the flu and the rest of us aren’t feeling well either – UGH! Since my family is under the weather, I decided to post some good old comfort food. I’ll be back in the kitchen soon…

I decided to make an Italian goulash using leftover homemade marinara, fresh mushrooms, onions, bell pepper, fresh basil, garlic and elbow macaroni. If you don’t have time to make the marinara you could always use a jar of your favorite store bought marinara. My whole family really loved this goulash. Thanks for the inspiration Mom.
Heat the olive oil in a small Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onions and mushrooms then cook for 3-4 minutes..
Cook the elbow macaroni per instructions (make sure to season the water with salt) then drain completely. Combine the macaroni with the sauce, add the fresh basil and mix well. Simmer for 15 minutes so the sauce has time to flavor the noodles. Top with Asiago cheese if desired and serve. Enjoy.

[Reply]Meaning First: a manifesto for user-experience design
There are over 800 statues on Easter Island and each stands twice as tall as a person. Little is known about their history or their meaning. Figure 1 shows some of the statues illuminated with the arc of the Milky Way filling the sky above them. This is a beautiful image that reminds me of the many mysteries both on planet earth and out there in the cosmos.
What is interesting is our human desire and drive to understand. We want to understand the meaning behind the Easter Island statues just as we also want to understand the meaning of the Milky Way. We are searching for meaning in everything - it is in our nature to do so.
A different approach to user experience design
This is the fifth and final article in the series covering the importance of meaning. My aim with the meaning series was to provide the reader with an alternative perspective from which to consider and appreciate user experience design (UXD).
UXD represents one of the most exciting, if not the most exciting area of digital. It focuses on our interactions and the experiences they generate.
Meaning is what we assign to every aspect of our lives from the simplest of actions to the most complex. The design of any digital experience that feels meaningful has to accommodate our basic human need for discovery. We like discovering - it makes us feel good. It satisfied our curiosity and desire to explore and learn.
Discovery and serendipity go hand in hand. Yet, discovery is more than intellectual fancy because we don't just think, we feel. Thinking and feeling are inextricably linked and cannot easily be divided. One effects the other and vice versa.
So, why bother with meaning?
Some people would argue that meaning can not be designed because it is too subjective and our behaviour too unique, too diverse and too complex. However, I disagree and I believe we can design enough clues into products, systems and services so that they can become meaningful when we interact with them. It's a matter of perspective.
I have differentiated between surface meaning and deeper meaning and covered this idea in an earlier article. It is another way of describing surface behaviour and deeper behaviour.
Surface meaning or behaviour will appear as much more obvious and therefore immediate whereas deeper meaning or behaviour can be nebulous and is often invisible.
We can exploit these differences as designers. We can shape surface meaning and this is the mechanism for evoking deeper meaning.
Do we need to understand exactly why any person feels the way they do about a particular design or interaction? I would argue that we don’t and probably can't anyway. However, I believe that by shaping the experience people have when they interact with any design at the surface level we are attempting to make it as understandable, obvious and intuitive to the widest possible audience. It is the focus placed on the surface meaning that will keep people engaged with the interaction experience for longer. This is desirable as an approach because the alternative is disengagement and abandonment!
Focus on surface meaning
Meaning-first is a philosophy for designing an experience that evokes a high level of surface meaning. If we can design experiences that are easy to use, obvious and require little mastery I would argue we are focusing on designing optimal surface meaning. We can design-in clues (signifiers and affordances) for people to follow that will guide them and encourage further exploration and interaction.
If we can do that, we are 'setting the stage' and are more likely to evoke a deeper and more profound feeling, maybe even a peak experience. A moment of total and absolute connectedness with ourselves and our environment. This is the power of interaction - designed well it can evoke deep meaning.
The peak of experience
The layers of the user experience
Whilst I advocate understanding the meanings people expect with their digital interactions as the starting point in a meaning-centred approach. I appreciate that a digital experience can't be delivered without the use of technology. This creates a design ambiguity because people will typically start with technology, yet, technology is just a means to an end. It is what we do with the technology that is important.
Is it no wonder given this over-emphasis on technology that so few sites have successfully balanced the user-experience design equation? The technology-centric perspective still dominates but it is a meaning-centric perspective that is needed to deliver experiences that really matter to people and are fundamentally humanistic.
Technology + Content + Style = Meaningful Experience
The UXD hierarchy consists of three layers that overlap. Each layer should not be seen as discrete but overlapping. The layers when added together generate something greater than the sum of each individual layer - they create a meaningful experience. The three layers are:
- Technology;
- Content, and;
- Style.
Technology
The first layer in the UXD hierarchy is technology. It represents the foundation on which any interaction experience is based. If you do not have technology you can't generate an experience. This is important because technology can fail and it can also be poorly implemented.
Technology represents the most fundamental level in the creation of the user experience. It covers elements such as the code, architecture, functionality, servers, protocols, connectivity. For example if your broadband connection 'goes down' and seems to be heavily congested it will impact the experience and therefore how meaningful the experience is perceived. In the worst case scenario you will have no experience because one or many of the elements involved in the technology layer fails or seriously under-performs.
Content
The content represents the actual material of a web experience. It's the words, pictures, images, digital objects (spreadsheets, PDF's) that we consume. You will be less likely to buy a pair of glasses from a web experience without any pictures of the products. Your experience at this point has reached an impasse and you would more than likely be forced to consider other options or even other sites.
Content is the actual material we are searching for, reading, watching, considering, comparing, buying, reviewing or complaining about.
Style
The style layer represents the aesthetic aspect of the design. It would cover elements such as the 'corporate ID', any branding considerations, specific treatments or design styles to be applied which would include the colours, typography and layouts used.
What is important is that it is the content which is styled. How style is applied to the content is what gives an experience personality - what makes it stand out, look-different - creates believability.
Meaningful interaction is greater than the sum of the parts
The Gestalt effect describes the form-generating capability of our senses. We reduce reality by combining all the elements of a 'form' and simplify it regardless of its underlying complexity, and we do this immediately and naturally - it is perceptual. The often quoted phrase 'the total is greater than the sum of the parts' applies to how we generate meaning.
The underlying interaction design patterns (IDPs) for any interactive system will be immediately combined and we will represent it as a whole and not the parts. For the experience to work holistically all the elements (IDPs) need to work as a whole and this will make it easier to understand and therefore use. The easier something is to understand the more meaningful it becomes. To generate 'surface meaning' we need to quickly understand a system or design as a whole and not a collection of parts (IDPs). If we cannot form a whole then the design will be seriously compromised and it will feel confusing because as we may not understand how to use it.
To move from a state of understanding a design to one of enjoying it, our focus needs to shift from how to use it to one of just using it with much less conscious effort - this is the all-important 'flow' we want to evoke in people.
When we perceive a design as meaningful our understanding is augmented and we will feel ‘more’ engaged with the design. We may not even know why we are more engaged because it is a 'feeling' - we are experiencing something deeper, something more meaningful.
The deeper the experience we feel the greater the level of meaning we achieve. Meaning amplifies our experiences.
Creating believability
Content and style work together to make the design believable e.g. we trust it. People will tend to rate designs that appear more aesthetically pleasing to them as easier to use and this idea is covered by the aesthetic-usability effect proposed by Masaaki Kurosu and Kaori Kashimura in 1995.
However, just because a person rates a design as more aesthetically pleasing (represented in the design as apparent usability) does not mean it will be easier to use and therefore may not result in improved performance (represented in the design as inherent usability).
Therefore, whilst we may rate a web experience as aesthetically desirable it may have little impact on actual human performance. Obviously, interacting with a system or design represents a form of relationship between the user and the artifact (system) and this is critical and must not be overlooked. In fact, it demonstrates that to create a human-centred system we will need to focus beyond the aesthetic factors so we can see the whole picture. We need to apply a holistic perspective.
When content and style combine they add believability to the experience. When the three layers work together we will perceive the experience as meaningful because it has generated a high level of surface value - their fit will seem natural and obvious. At this point we will be moving from the surface perspective across the 'meaningful edge' and beginning to engage with the design more deeply.
Moving from surface meaning to deeper meaning
As we move up the hierarchy along the 'meaning dimension' our understanding increases and our experience of the interactions will become even more engaging. As we continue to move up the hierarchy the likelihood of achieving 'deeper meaning' becomes a very real possibility. This will be experienced as more than just pleasure or feelings of happiness. The interactions and responses will be second nature.
Once we reach the apex of the hierarchy, we find ourselves at the top of the meaning layer and at this point we have become totally absorbed with the experience because it has become all consuming.
We are no longer merely thinking about the experience. We are feeling the experience. We have become augmented by the experience.
When this occurs all three layers have achieved a symmetry and a peak experience can occur (this does not mean it will occur however the conditions are optimised so it can occur - it is a matter of 'how much' or 'how little' we feel about the current experience) .
When a peak experience occurs we not only totally 'get' the design but we will fundamentally enjoy the interaction (the relationship between the user and the design) - nothing else will matter.
Designing peak experience is a 'tall order'. However, I believe we should always be aiming to design interaction excellence because the design will provide a much better and more meaningful experience even if we don't actually achieve it.
A meaningful design will represent an order of magnitude of difference and will provide a more authentic interaction experience. We remember experiences that are meaningful to us for longer. Or, to put it another way we will tend to dislike experiences that we consider meaningless and forget them more quickly. We will remember such experiences with less detail. They will influence us less and have less significance.
Evoking deeper meaning
Surface meaning can trigger deeper meaning. Combining the three layers of the design experience intelligently will allow us to provide people with the clues they will need to quickly understand the design.
How do we know when we are experiencing deeper meaning? Because we feel immersed in the experience - it is no longer a matter of using an interface - the surface elements of the interface (design) have become invisible!
The surface meaning we generate when interacting with a design will dictate the level of deeper meaning that we will ultimately experience and therefore feel.
Make it meaningful!
Meaning First is a philosophy that places meaning at the center of the design process.
In a Meaning-First approach you start with meaning because this is what everyone wants. From a digital perspective it is what people have increasingly come to expect from their interactions with digital technology. We all want meaningful experiences. We all want our experiences to be understandable, enjoyable and engaging.
Every second is precious so let's make every single design really count!

Very interesting stuff. Understanding that we experience everything in gestalt requires us to see both surface and underlying meaning simultaneously. It essentially means the designer has to create the experience with feeling applying both technical & emotional judgement as they go. More like a gifted musician than a technician. Something like that anyway... And in this regard UXD is no different from any other creative discipline.
Good job...This is a superb one, I think this type of blog is the best I have ever read and moving from surface meaning to deeper meaning part is totally awesome...Thanks for sharing this wonderful info with us.
First of all, great series Simon. I agree that meaning should come first. It's sad to see how many people don't even think of that.
Absolutely.

Dark-haired man playing with a soccer ball isolated on a white backgroundThe Lion Family
(Image credit: Flickr user Ian Sane)
This is His Royal Majesty King Zawadi Mungu of the Oregon Zoo. He lives there with his wives Neka and Kya.
(Image credit: Flickr user Ryan J. Zeigler)
And since September, he has three daughters: the triplets Kamali, Zalika, and Angalia. The three cubs are almost weaned now, and this past week they met their father for the first time. The first meeting was inside, away from the public. Zawadi Mungu was wary at first, but was soon grooming the cubs himself. Afterward, the whole family made their first public appearance together in the outdoor enclosure. The cubs wanted to play with dad, while their mother Neka and "aunt" Kya watched close by.
Zawadi Mungu was surrounded by five females, but he took it in stride. The little snarls he gives the cubs are very inhibited. They have yet to see their father in full apex predator mode. You can keep up with the lion cubs’ development at Facebook. -via Viral Viral Videos
Miss Callania: thank you for posting my picture. I wasn’t insulted at all by Craig Cole’s correction. If anything I was a little embarrassed that I didn’t know the difference. Plus, I didn’t want anyone thinking it was the zoo staff that made the blunder. The Oregon Zoo has quite a competent staff of people. My niece has worked there for years and she is quite good her job. Thanks again!!

Great recipe, but can you please review the ingredients…I had to look at the other site to get a full list. Also, a couple of things to make this the most amazing thing ever since coconut butter: 1.) please make the link from the meal calendar go directly to the recipe instead of needing to click under the pictures and 2.) please make the grocery list more accurate.

Hello – could you please be more specific about the inaccuracies on the shopping lists? We tried to be as thorough as possible. Also, please be sure that you checked the “kitchen basics” list. There are ingredients that we frequently cook with that are not listed over and over again.
Thanks! Feel free to follow up here, or using the “feedback” button on the left side.
Oh sorry about not looking at the basics one!
Can you provide a link to the “kitchen basics” list? I, too, missed some things not listed in the ingredients (namely, lime) because I missed this list.
Maybe I missed something, but how much lime juice do you put in the marinade? It’s not in the ingredients list… Thanks for this recipe, I’m going to make it tonight!
Sorry for the error – it is the juice from 1.5 limes (about 1/8 of a cup). It has been added. Thanks!
This was really nice. I just really dug the marinade, so I have made tons of meals with the marinaded meat.
Loved this marinade – great lime tang and spice kick!
huge hit with my whole family and friends:) thanks so much going to become a regular i think:) thanks to your site though i have cooked fifteen meals at home in the last five days with out cheating on my whole30 diet thank you.
Loved this! The marinade was gorgeous – lovely warm smoky flavours.
So in step 12, when you say to add vegetables and seasonings, by seasonings do you mean the marinade or is that discarded?A new independent poll has fewer than 40 percent of Pennsylvania voters giving an excellent or good review to the jobs being done by President Barack Obama, Gov.

Fifty-two percent of those surveyed say Obama doesn’t deserve re-election next year, versus 42 percent who say he does. Obama performed best among voters who are liberal, female, under 35, not white, unmarried and college educated.
The telephone poll of 419 registered voters was conducted during the week ending Sunday and carried a sampling margin of error of plus or minus 4.8 percentage points.Philadelphia, PA

Continuing 58 years of a tradition of safe and wholesome fun, the designation to the park and its owner, Christopher Maier, has come from the highly-regarded institution after an extensive stealth inspection.
The rating signifies Land of Make Believe as one of the safest, most compliant water parks in the United States, as it has been so honored for the past many years.
The award-winning park has been recognized by numerous statewide and national groups over the years and is considered among the top amusement and water parks in the nation for its overall excellence in operations, safety, and consistent compliance with federal, state, county and local regulations and standards.
Celebrating 58 consecutive seasons at the foothills of Jenny Jump Mountain, the park, the largest employer of youths in Warren County, has been particularly recognized by the Starfish Aquatics Institute for the park's lifeguards for their efforts in Prevention, Surveillance, Emergency Care, Aquatic Rescue, Professionalism and Personal Safety.
"This is truly a group effort on behalf of everyone who works here," said Maier. "We pay close attention to every detail at the park and it has paid off consistently with this important designation."
Recognized by a host of organizations for its importance to the tourism industry, Land of Make Believe has long been considered an economic engine in northern New Jersey. Additionally, the park has saved 450 acres of open space at no cost to taxpayers. Land of Make Believe will be open daily through Labor Day Weekend and for its grand finale weekend from Sept. 8-9.

The most important band in the world right now? That's kind of impossible to answer. You need perspective to be able to figure something like that out, and that comes with time.

Depeche Mode are true pioneers.
I respect them for not being a traditional band -- the synthesizer creates almost limitless freedom and they even go hunting for new sounds at places like junkyards by smashing things or capturing the explosion of fireworks just to record it and manipulate it later. On later albums, they would use guitars for extra flavor on some songs, but they never abandoned their electronic roots.
I also like that they aren't critcs' darlings like U2. Both bands started about the same time, but U2 was always more hungry for mainstream approval. DM could care less about Grammys, Oprah, and iTunes commericals.
Also, they change the band's logo with each new record which is rare.
In regards to Radiohead, if it wasn't for 80s bands like Depeche Mode, The Smiths, Talking Heads, Beastie Boys, Jane's Addiction, and The Cure we wouldn't have the alterantive radio that we have today. I like Radiohead, but you got to respect the elders who paved the way.

Tis a difficult question indeed............but....... if were talking bands from the past 5-10 years then I've gotta agree with Kid_A and say Radiohead.They are probably the most influential band around.They have made songs that are quite radio friendly and almost mainstream to stuff that is just plain craaaaazy and that is what I love about em' and Thom Yorke's lyrics are just fantastic. You never know what to expect with their next albums (and at the time the same thing was said about the Beatles). As a group they are all fantastic musicians and willing to push the boundaries and take influences from all around the music spectrum.Obviously there are loads of bands around that could be considered but I think people will still listen to Radiohead in 50 years time and say WOW and that's what make them special IMO of course. Most influential of all time-- Gotta be The Beatles hasn't it?
What's this bit for again?

Radiohead is certainly the most important current (ie., not disbanded) band in my mind.
Band member Johnny Greenwood wrote an incredible score for the film There Will Be Blood, by the way, which is more evidence of their greatness, as if that were needed.

Mark my words. The Arcade Fire. Oh, and I'm actually getting increasingly impressed with Coldplay. I thought their first three albums were garbage, Radiohead rip-offs. But Viva La Vida? That's a goodass album, right there. And their new EP? Pretty darn good. I'm not saying they even touch the all time greatest musicians or anything, but I think they're getting better.
Clearly we have different views because, between you and me, I'm actually a Modest Mouse fan as well. A Pixies rip off? A little bit. But I don't think their crap or anything. In fact I'm seeing them in concert this August.

Nov 15, 2006
ISTANBUL, Turkey - His All Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, spiritual leader of over 300 million Orthodox faithful worldwide, will receive Pope Benedict XVI on November 29 - 30, 2006 at the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Istanbul. Pope Benedict’s three-day of Constantinople, the former name for present-day Istanbul. Both prelates are noted throughout the world as peacemakers and for their extraordinary efforts to create bridges of truth and love across religious, ethnic, environmental and political divides. “We are awaiting the Pope’s visit with fraternal love and great anticipation,” said Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, “it will be very important for our Country and Orthodox-Catholic Relations.” Pope Benedict XVI will arrive in Istanbul, on Wednesday afternoon, November 29, to be received by His All Holiness and will participate in a Doxology of Peace at the Patriarchal Cathedral of St. George. The prayer service will include a mutual veneration of the Holy Relics of Saint Gregory the Theologian and Saint John Chrysostom, the Predecessors of the Ecumenical Patriarch, and will be followed by a private meeting between the two Church leaders. On Thursday morning, November 30, Benedict XVI will participate in the Divine Liturgy at St. George Cathedral where both prelates will deliver official addresses, exchange the Kiss of Peace and jointly bless the faithful present. After the Divine Liturgy, a common declaration of ecumenical solidarity will be read and signed. Following the signing, Pope Benedict will join the Ecumenical Patriarch for lunch at the Patriarchate. After receiving the Ecumenical Patriarch at the Roman Catholic Church of the Holy Spirit and celebrating the Papal Holy Mass, Pope Benedict will depart for Vatican City on Friday, December 1.. For his inspiring efforts on behalf of religious freedom and human rights, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew was heralded as a Bridge Builder and Peacemaker and awarded the Congressional Gold Medal by the U.S. Congress in 1997.

Breakfast for dinner is probably one of my favorite meals! It doesn't even matter what the breakfast is, so long as it is served at dinnertime.
Anyway, I wanted to make green tea pancakes with the brand-new container of matcha powder that I bought not too long ago. I had worked with matcha powder years ago, when I was an employee of Starbucks. It's basically very finely ground Japanese green tea, and it contains a lot of antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals for a powerfully healthy kick. In addition, it imparts such a lovely green shade to anything you add it to (as I'm sure you can tell from my pictures).
Now that I had my first type of pancake, I had to come up with one more. I figured my children weren't going to eat the green tea pancakes, and I was right. So what would I make for them that would be a big winner?
Cinnamon pancakes, that's what! My kids are gigantic cinnamon fans. I mean, just enormous. I'm almost inclined to start sprinkling cinnamon on their veggies, just to see if they'll be more enthusiastic about eating them! Not a bad idea....
So I had my two ideas, and I was ready to start mixing up ingredients. I was fortunate enough to find two successful recipes on other blogs. The green tea pancakes came from justJENNrecipes, and the cinnamon pancakes were found on Sugarlaws. Go check both of them out if you get the chance; both are great!
I didn't want to become too experimental my first time making either, so I stuck pretty close to the original recipes. However, in an attempt to give mine a bit more fiber, I added a bit of wheat bran to each batter. The kids didn't seem to notice, and I thought it gave the pancakes a nice little extra something, an added texture that would otherwise not have been there. I also studded some of them with slivered almonds. I sprinkled a few on the pancakes just before flipping them to their second side. Xander wanted almond faces, but I just wasn't that talented this time. Instead, my almonds are a bit more free-form. Next time, perhaps!
As expected, my kids did love the cinnamon variation. They are especially good with a bit of cinnamon sugar sprinkled on top, along with the maple syrup. It's almost like dessert.
And the green tea pancakes were a hit as well! When Andy first saw them, he thought I had simply put green food coloring in them, so he was intrigued when he found out that the color came from matcha powder. The green tea flavor is present, but not at all overwhelming. It gave the pancakes a bit of earthiness, mixed with a mild grassy-ness that was subtly sweet. It's hard to describe, but suffice it to say, they were pretty awesome. I think I'd like to make some matcha cookies or a matcha cake for my next green tea endeavor. I just love the taste!

3 Day Eventing - was pretty good at this, not the Pro level stuff, just keeno armature stylee, did Burghley one year “tally Ho”
Sailing – far too much to write on here, though have done 11 Atlantic crossings and raced in some pretty prestigious events, fave being Maxi Worlds at Porto Cervo and La Nioulargue in St Tropez.

Sunburns are a preventable, yet all too common problem. When sunburn occurs, the skin turns red and is painful for several days. In severe cases, the skin may itch, develop a rash, peel, and this may be associated with fever or flu-like symptoms. Until now, there has been little information on how the sun’s energy produces these changes.
New research has discovered that ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation causes damage to the cell’s genetic material, RNA. The symptoms associated with sunburn are the result of inflammation. Inflammation can be beneficial for several reasons; for example, it helps removed sun-zapped cells so the skin can heal. The inflammatory response may also help to clear out cells with genetic damage before they become cancerous.
Because the RNA becomes damaged by UVB radiation, premature aging in skin can result. Signs of premature aging can include age spots, rough and scaly skin, wrinkles and skin cancer. “To prevent these issues, it’s important to use common sense when outdoors,” remarks Robin Fleck, M.D., founder and medical director of Southwest Skin and Cancer Institute in Prescott, Arizona. “While it is true that some sun exposure provides needed Vitamin D, one should temper their sun exposure based on their skin type, health history and the time of day.”
Skin type determines a person’s likelihood of developing sunburn. People with fair or freckled skin, blond or red hair, with blue or green eyes have a greater incidence of sunburn and a greater risk of developing premature aging and skin cancer. In contrast, those with darker skin and hair color are less likely:.Today we learned that ASUS produces its own in-house magazine, stuffed full of thoughtful pieces about the company's products.

We know that bringing this simple process to pass, can be another story. Many of the issues that regularly arise, and cause the word short sale to knot your stomach, can be overcome with some practical steps and a good Escrow Officer.
You must first know that not all short sales are meant to be. Red Flag: If the seller is unwilling to participate, and provide the necessary documentation for the short sale package to the bank – you may want to stop here. The seller must be fully invested in the sale of their home, or chances are, the property will not sell. The seller must also identify a legitimate hardship: Ethical implications notwithstanding, the seller should present to the bank a legitimate hardship (in the form of a letter) in order for the bank to consider approving the short sale.
Critical too, is the property search you ask your Escrow Officer to perform prior to listing the property. The foreknowledge of any outstanding liens, or of that 2nd Home Equity loan thought to be paid off, will always help eliminate the 11th hour scramble to negotiate these liens to be paid, often ending in three months of work and a cancelled escrow.
The number one point of contention I have found in the short sale, is undoubtedly the HOA and more specifically the past due HOA assessments. One of the first questions to ask is whether or not the HOA assessments are paid current. If assessments are more than a month behind, it is best to obtain a balance statement; three months behind, it may be in collections with an attorney, from whom the seller must obtain a payoff statement. It is not uncommon for $1000 in late assessments to incur another $1000 in attorney fees. The listing agent or seller can often negotiate some of the fees to be waived.
Upon approval of your short sale, your Escrow Officer should always review the approval letter against the HUD, along with the terms of the purchase contract. Especially verify that the terms of the first loan approval are consistent with those of the second loan approval. Any discrepancies must be addressed immediately.
By and large, I believe short sales are being approved more quickly and with less hassle of late, but every lender and situation does vary. I recently closed a short sale that went from listed, to contract, to short sale approval in under four days!
Disclaimer: A short sale involves legal and financial matters, for which a seller should seek professional advice.

Joe Allensays:
Hi Matt,
Great post. It was an extremely insightful observation on the difference between the cut and dry nature of the process and the real world application of said process.
I understand there are two types of Short Sales, a HAFA short sale and a “traditional” short sale. could you shed some light on the difference of the two? Also, what do you find to be the more legitimate hardship reasons as opposed to the more illegitimate? Anything in particular to stay away from?
looking forward to a response, keep up the good work!
Jun 23, 2011
Matthew S. McRoysays:
Thanks for the comment Joe! I’m pleased to hear you found the information useful.
I believe most legitimate hardships are a result of lack of income, due to job loss or pay decrease. Poor health can also play a role in one’s inablitiy to continue making payments on their mortgage, whether it has rendered the borrower unfit to work or perhaps the property must be sold in order to move to a climate more conducive to the borrower or his/her family’s health. In any case a “legitimate” hardship in my mind, is just that, an honest reason for having to sell your home short of the mortgage amount. Harships to stay away from: dishonest ones! Lender’s criteria can differ on the subject, and like all short sales, details are case-by-case.
Many government programs including HAFA have been made available to mortgagors in financial distress. While I am not an expert in this realm, The Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternative program is a short sale for borrowers who have attempted and failed a loan modification.

What a wonderful year you have planned! I used Ambleside in part last year and seeing your schedule makes me wish I was again. I really like your idea of memorizing a chapter of the Bible and one poem each term!
Enjoy!
Lee
I love your blog! I went to the site to see the planning sheet, but it wouldn't let me modify it. Do I have to get pdffactory to do that?
Thanks for sharing!
Dee
Lee,
You're so sweet!
I can't take the credit for the memory work - it's straight out of Sonlight 5. Well, except for the poetry memory and I stole that idea from Charlotte Mason!
Greater grace,

Why do we refer to multi-floor buildings as stories?
I don't know if this is the right forum to ask this quiestion, but I have tried a few other forums and haven't been able to get an answer? I hope somebody can help!In GW2 you are no longer frozen in place when you attack from range. But the mobs doesn't take advantage of that. They just stand still as long as you are "in range" of their attack.
There are no reasons for them not to move. Even a sample "Move left for 2 seconds. Move right for 2 seconds." movement while in combat will help them avoid a lot of hits.
On that note, there are zero reasons for ranged mobs to stand in AoEs. They should dodge out of there asap.The surname KORorwatch ranked #82,690 in frequency out of 88,799 surnames for which statistics were released from the 1990 Census.

This 71-year-old grandfather just won’t go away
Alex Ferguson salutes his adoring fans.
This season, there has been no squeaky-bum time. Manchester United’s 20th league title, the 13th for.
Sworn enemy.
Breaking the.
The title has been heading to United pretty much since City lost to Southampton in February and fell 12 points behind. Van Persie is undoubtedly the new star of Old Trafford, with 24 goals so far. “He’s turned out better than any of us thought,” Ferguson says. “He has kicked on from Arsenal, a much better player now from when he was there.”
“Everybody contributes,” Ferguson, the most successful manager in the business, is fond of saying and it’s hard to argue with that.

Two teenagers suspected in the shooting death of Windermere police officer Robert German died by suicide, a preliminary autopsy shows.
Both 18-year-old Brandon Goode and 17-year-old Alexandria Hollinghurst died of single gunshot wounds to the head, according to the medical examiner.
German, 31, was shot along Conroy-Windermere Road at about 3:30 a.m. on March 22. He died at Orlando Regional Medical Center and was laid to rest last week.
Authorities released suicide notes left behind by the two teens before they went missing.

Today has been one of the most rewarding days of my life.
Today was our first of teaching at the alpha boys school. The alpha boys school is located in the heart of Kingston, the capitol of Jamaica. This school is where many young boys who have nowhere else to go come to live and learn, and it has turned out some of the worlds famous musicians. We arrived in the morning at the alpha girl’s school side, which doesn’t function as an orphanage, simply a great school. Even though it was the student’s winter break, there were over 50 girls waiting to learn. We all gathered together in their auditorium, and our group sat on the stage. The girls stood in straight lines and sang to us and they had the most beautiful voices! We all sang Bob Marley’s “One Love” together and I think many of us were tearing up. After the girls sang, their principle, Mr Singh, gave a very powerful speech to the girls. He first introduced us and explained that part of our group was there to teach the girls math. Since they had lost time because of the hurricane, they were very far behind. He told them about the young women in Pakistan who are being attacked for speaking for women’s rights, especially for women’s educational rights. He warned the girls that unless they worked hard, they would not be ready to face the discrimination that could come their way. It was very sobering, and all the girls looked motivated as they went off to their classrooms.
After the assembly, we walked across campus to the alpha boys school to meet their principle, Sister Susan. Sister Susan told us that all of the boys who were here had done something to get here. She described them as “delinquents” and that we should expect to have to use very firm punishment with many of them. (I am happy to say that every single alpha boy proved Sister Susan quite wrong. Never before had I met a more polite, well behaved group of young men.)
After speaking with Sister Susan, we took a tour of the grounds. The alpha boys have a beautiful place to grow up! I was itching to begin teaching music, and finally, Mr. sparrow, the music teacher, arrived. He introduced us to his band (there are normally 25 members, but we had 9 because many of the boys are home for vacation) and we listened to them play a few songs. They sounded great! Through individual pretests, we learned that none of the boys could read music, they could just play things by ear! How cool is that!
So our goals over the next two days are to teach the boys as much musical theory as we can, while also playing our instruments with them and trying to learn from them too!
After we all played our instruments together as a large group (which was quite an experience, especially since I haven’t played clarinet in quite awhile. I was asked to improvise and even though I sounded awful, I did it!) we had a chance to talk to many of the boys. All of them were enthrall end with this iPad, and were so happy to play the games on it while they chatted with us. Two of them were in drawing classes, and they showed us their work; it was incredible!! They explained to us how the alpha boys school worked: they have three main goals. 1) to give each of the boys a trade in order to allow them to make money in the future 2)to give the boys a top quality education 3) to give the boys strict discipline so that they can survive in the real world. They made the Jamaican world sound so scary and forbidding, but as we talked more I could tell why. One boy named Jackson told us that he had been dealing and doing drugs since he was 12 years old. He’s been carrying a gun for years. I was shocked at how wise this boy is. He came to alpha boys school all by himself; it seems like his family is still involved in drugs. Jackson came to this school alone in order to escape that dangerous life- I was very impressed. He told us that Rastas, although they seem peaceful, introduced drugs and violence into his life.
These young boys are amazing. They were so polite and shy, always called me “miss”, and followed me around with a chair in case I wanted to sit down. They are awesome musicians, great young men, and upstanding Jamaicans. I can’t wait for the next two days!!

Filed under: JamaicaThe Cohabitation Complication The key to making marriage work—and what sets it apart from cohabitation—is commitment. By Dave Boehi A major shift has occurred in our culture during the last 40 years: A growing number of couples are living together before they are married. By 2005, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, nearly 10 million people were living with someone of the opposite sex, up from about 878,000 in 1960. Many of these couples view cohabitation as a trial run to see if marriage will work. As one woman writes, ; Young adults waiting longer to get married (the median age for first-time marriage is 27.5 for men and 25.6 for women—up from 22.8 and 20.3 in 1960); A growing number of people in our culture who believe marriage is not important; and The fear of failure—many singles don’t want to end up divorced like their parents. For many couples, it makes sense to live together so they can determine if their relationship will last before making the commitment of marriage. Living together is the normal type of pre-marriage relationship portrayed in countless movies and television shows. With each new generation of young people, the number of cohabiting couples is expected to rise..” They are “sliding, not deciding,” he says.? © 2009 by FamilyLife. All rights reserved.

The Rockets opened the second overtime with a 10-0 run, with Yao scoring inside to put Houston up 102-92.
"I need to be more aggressive, I guess," Yao said. "I've been in this situation before. I think I need to do more for the team."
Brooks started the decisive spurt with a 3-pointer before Artest drove for two layups and Yao hit a mid-range turnaround.
"We did a good job of finishing up the game," said Brooks. "Yao did a good job. We got him the ball in the post at the end of the game and that was good."
Arron Afflalo scored 24 points, Rodney Stuckey added 21 points with 10 assists and Antonio McDyess grabbed 20 rebounds for the Pistons, who've lost three in a row.
"It's crazy how frustrating it is," said Stuckey. "I'm trying to be as aggressive as I can, but I just ran out of gas. We fought as hard as we could."
Afflalo sank a 3-pointer to end Detroit's drought in the second overtime and Walter Herrmann hit a free throw to pull the Pistons within six. After Artest missed a 3, Herrmann hit a 3 for Detroit with 28 seconds to go, cutting Houston's lead to 102-99.
Brooks went 4-for-4 from the free-throw line on the Rockets' next two possessions to finally secure the victory. The Rockets have won 13 of their last 15 home games and moved a half game ahead of Denver for third place overall in the West.
"We needed to win and we won, even though we didn't play very well the whole game," said Rockets forward Luis Scola, who had 14 points. "We hung in there, we fought."
Yao scored on four straight possessions to give Houston an 82-79 lead with less than two minutes left in the fourth quarter.
The Pistons did a solid job defending Yao for most of regulation, holding Houston's center to 14 points through three quarters. Yao did not attempt a free throw until there was 3:12 left in the fourth quarter.
The Rockets finally found ways to get him the ball and Yao did the rest.
"We had to go with what was working," Brooks said. "Yao was playing unbelievable. I wanted to get him in the key, where he is most effective."
The Pistons grabbed two offensive rebounds and Stuckey hit a running shot in the lane to cut the Rockets' lead to one. Artest missed a long jumper, and Stuckey's free throw with 56 seconds left tied the game at 82.
Scola lost the ball on a drive, and Herrmann rimmed out a 3-pointer at the buzzer to force overtime.
The Rockets built an 88-85 lead in the extra period before Stuckey sank two free throws with 1:29 left. Yao hit two free throws on Houston's next trip, but Stuckey's driving layup with 26 seconds left cut Houston's lead to 90-89.
Kyle Lowry made a free throw before Stuckey easily drove for another layup to tie it at 91. Artest missed an off-balance jumper as time expired in the first overtime.
The Rockets outscored Detroit 15-10 in the second extra period.
"We fought and gave ourselves a chance," McDyess said. "But at the end, it wasn't there for us."
The Rockets led 42-38 at halftime after shooting 50 percent (20 of 40) in the first half.
Detroit shot 31 percent (14 of 45) in the first half, but stayed close by going 9-for-12 from the free-throw line. The Rockets took only two free throws in the half and went 1-for-6 from 3-point range.
The Pistons rallied from five points down to take the lead in the third quarter. Afflalo sank a 3-pointer, McDyess scored twice inside and Detroit shot 58 percent in the quarter to take a 65-64 lead to the fourth.
Will Bynum drove past Lowry for two layups in the first minute to stretch Detroit's lead to five, its biggest of the game. Detroit led 79-75 in the fourth quarter before Yao took over inside.
Notes
- The Rockets are 2-1 in overtime this season; Detroit dropped to 2-4.
- Detroit grabbed 21 offensive rebounds and its 26 second-chance points were a season high for a Houston opponent.
- Detroit coach Michael Curry said Iverson would have tests on his back on Thursday and Friday. Curry said Wallace was also likely to miss Friday's game against the Los Angeles Clippers.!— Measurement Tag For Dictionary.com – > <!— Audience Tag for IAC Network – >

I just updated to DP6! Slow down! (Kidding, don't!)
Lol. It must be close to GM time. I haven't found any glaring bugs in DP6 or 7.
It must have downloaded on its own, it's already installing and I didn't see any downloading.
What about iOS beta!!!??? It's still buggy and lagy at times!
Sent from the iMore AppToday, it’s officially two weeks away from Christmas. That means many things to many people. To Christians, it’s the birth of Jesus Christ. To Atheists/Agnostics and everyone else it’s an awesome holiday. Tagged by Cusmar350 (a big shout out to him), he wants to start a new meme:
HOLIDAY TRADITIONS
It is quite simple really. You tell everyone on here what you do for Christmas, then tag a certain amount of people. Done! So, let me begin my Christmas traditions…
- The Christmas Tree!
Yep, one of the main things of Christmas is the Christmas tree. What could be more fun that doing this? (Apart from a video game.) My family has 3, well, I say 3, it’s really 2 and a Christmas Twig. And when we put them up, they stay up for months; from Mid-November to the start of January. Don’t ask me. It’s what my mum wants.
The main Christmas tree! You see in Ireland, there would be a radiator in place of that fan there.
Christmas tree 2: Small than the other one, but still full of Christmas Spirit! And next the…
The Christmas twig! That’s not real snow by the way. It never snows in WA!
So next, I’ll move onto the 25th December, that’s Christmas Day for all you people who go out of the way not to know things, and talk about what we do then. It’s basically the same every year.
Morning and Presents – Basically the same as everyone I presume. I get waken up by my two ecstatic little sisters who proceed to drag me out of bed and into my parents room. From here, I put on my actors face. And it’s a damned good one! See, my sisters still believe in Santa (sorry if any 9 year olds are reading this), my dad goes out, make sure everything is ready, and we all walk out to get our presents!
I better be getting that certain game this year, mum and dad!
Breakfast and Church – Every year, me and my dad cook a breakfast. But not any breakfast, this is one of the few times we eat a ‘heart attack on a plate’, a proper Irish Breakfast! What’s that? Bacon, eggs, sausages (we have beef and pork), potato bread, soda bread, black pudding, mushrooms, tomatoes and baked beans. Then you can have Malt Vinager, HP sause, Tomato Sauce or any other type of sauce. It’s quite awesome to say the least.
Then we go off to Church for the Christmas service. I always had to go, and except for the past two years, I never wanted to go. I wanted to stay home and play with my presents. It usually lasts for a few hours, and then we’re back at the house for the party!
The afternoon: party time and lunch – Well, basically, I mum loves have parties, so Christmas is no acception. We get a load of people around and celebrate together: talking, yelling, eating, farting, playing, blah blah blah blah. We usually just have nibbles, you know, finger foods: Cold shrimp and sauces, crisps, chips, sausage rolls and pies, fishy thingies, and so forth. It’s pretty fun, and we go swimming in the pool!
The Cover is usually off when we swim.
Christmas dinner! – If it’s not the best part of the day, then it is the second best. And my mum makes a proper Christmas Dinner, and it’s damned tasty if I don’t say so myself. It’s all the basics:
Roast potatoes, carrot, Brussel sprouts, parsnips and Gravy. Then there is the Christmas Turkey with Chestnut stuffing, sausages and chicken wrapped in bacon, and Christmas ham cooked in Coke. It’s awesome! And like every year, we have crackers, and funnily stupid paper hats. We laugh, we cry and we eat (I actually don’t think we cry).
We use the same table every single year.
Bedtime – I stay up till 5 in the morning having fun, then crash! And for some reason, my sleep pattern dictates that I must be up by 6 every. Single. Morning. So I get an hour of sleep, spend the entire 26th tired and miserable, then get a good night sleep and keep on living!
So there you go. What I do every single year for Christmas. To help this keep on going, I shall tag Nightwink, MegaMea, greengrin and Moogle_mom. If you’ve already been tagged, double whammy! And thanks again to Cusmar350 for starting this and tagging me.
Merry Christmas Everybody (at least for in 2 weeks)!

For those not in the know, the Volt is a series hybrid. Unlike the Prius (a parallel hybrid), the Volt does not use its gasoline engine to supply torque to the wheels. the gasoline engine in a series hybrid serves only to generate electricity to recharge the batteries. All of the motive force comes from the batteries/electric motor. The advantage to this is that you can travel the full forty miles of your charge without ever using any gasoline. It may not be great for those in the exurbs, but for carting around town it can't be beat.
Using this tool from the Brammo website, I calculated my daily miles. I found that on my heaviest driving days (go to Kung Fu in the morning, pick up the boy at school, bring him to his Kung Fu class in the afternoon, hit up Trader Joes in the mean time) I may do 30 miles. With a little bit of planning, I could easily stay below that. Now if I could just get a garage...
All fine and good for pure electrics, but if you already have a Prius, don't dispare! In other news last week, There's a Prius chop shop now open in San Francisco that will convert your prius to a plug-in. Luscious Garage is open for business and it sounds like things might really start to pick up for them. Converting your Prius costs around $7500, but that's down $2500 from the estimated cost from calcars about a year ago. Scroll down on this calcars page and find a list of companies who do conversions.
Conversions are also on the radar at Wired magazine.
And still there's more. Electrics made a grand showing at the Paris Auto Show. The Time article highlights the Nissan NuVu. More pictures of it can be found here.

Hi, it’s Colleen here with my first BBQ post of the season!! BBQ season gets me really excited! Food just tastes SO good coming off the grill. Both meats and veggies are brought to another level, and the versatility of what you can do with your food is amazing. Usually the first thing I toss on the grill each year is a perfectly grilled burger – there should be songs and poems written about a perfectly grilled burger…ok, time for me to wipe the drool off of my chin and get down to business!
Just recently I had been thinking of making something for the grill with Harissa. Are you familiar with it? Harissa is used widely in many North African countries including Morocco, Libya, Algeria and Tunisia. In many places around the world, Harissa is as common as ketchup (but SO much more delicious) and accompanies every meal. I couldn’t understand how I had yet to have that flavor in my life, especially since garlic, chilies, olive oil and some of the other key ingredients that go into making it are some of my favorite flavors.
Funny enough, just a few days after I began thinking about Harissa, Jo-Lynne asked me if I would be interested in trying out Mina Harissa for a sponsored post. Mina Harissa is a traditional Moroccan pepper sauce, carefully blended using only 6 simple all natural ingredients; red chili pepper, red bell pepper, garlic, extra virgin olive oil, vinegar, salt.
Min. She learned the art of cooking from her mother. At 16, Mina tasted her next-door neighbor’s homemade Harissa and fell in love with this fiery red sauce. She played with the recipe and made it uniquely hers, adding extra-virgin olive oil, a touch of vinegar and garlic to the red-long-finger hot pepper base that gives the sauce its unique tangy-hot flavor profile.
The jars arrived and I immediately loved the packaging, but what truly got me was the color…the stunning color of that beautiful Mina Harissa stopped me in my tracks. It was all I could do not to open it right then and there…2:00 on a Tuesday afternoon…and scoop some out to taste.
Luckily, I was able to control myself! When I did crack it open to taste it, my mind immediately went to shrimp. Shrimp on the grill with Harissa…
- 12 extra large raw shrimp, peeled and cleaned
- salt & pepper
- 3 tablespoons Mina Harissa Spicy
- Place the shrimp in a small bowl and sprinkle with salt and pepper; toss.
- Add Harissa and toss to coat.
- Cover and chill for 20-30 minutes.
- Preheat grill. Oil 2 skewers with olive oil or spray, slide 6 shrimp onto each skewer and grill over medium-high heat 3 minutes per side or until shrimp is done to your liking. Serve over couscous, a salad or alone as an appetizer.
I decided to grill some string beans too, however it started to pour outside after I cooked the shrimp so I decided to cook the string beans on the stove.
Guess what?? I can’t imagine them tasting any better. The shrimp was really good BUT the string beans…the string beans were utterly amazing! My sister was over when I made these, and the 3 of us (her, my husband & I) almost fought over the green beans. There were even elbows involved — oh YOU know who you are!!
I have never been a green bean fan – ever! My husband and son love them, so I make them often for them and don’t touch them myself. This was the first time I have ever truly loved green beans. Yeah!
Both of these dishes took a very little effort and a short time to make. I tossed the shrimp with the spicy Harissa, let it sit for 20 minutes, skewered it, grilled it, and next thing I knew it was gone. The beans took 8 minutes on the stove. Gotta love a quick and delicious meal! Add in a bright salad or a bowl of couscous and a hunk of crusty bread and you’ve got a complete meal!
- ¾ pound fresh green beans, cleaned and stemmed
- 3 TBS grapeseed or olive oil (I like grapeseed for the high burn point)
- salt & pepper
- 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
- ⅓ cup Mina Harissa
- In a large frying pan with sides, heat your oil over medium-high heat (depending on the size of your pan, you may need to add a bit more oil - just enough to sheen the whole pan.)
- Once the oil is hot, carefully add your green beans. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and toss to coat.
- Keep stirring your green beans for about a minute. Add the fresh lemon juice, toss and cover with a lid.
- Carefully, take the lid off every 60-90 seconds and stir the beans until they begin blistering and charring a bit. After about 8-9 minutes total, the beans should be browned and charred in spots. Add the Harissa and toss to coat.
- Remove from the heat, keeping the lid on, and allow the beans to sit for 3-5 minutes. Serve, adding a bit more Harissa if desired.
I love it when you find a product/products that deliver on what you expect of them and enhance your life in some way. In this case, Mina delivered a delicious product that I felt good feeding my family AND it saved me time and effort in the kitchen (and you would never know it!) Yet another secret weapon in my culinary arsenal!
“Harissa has been hailed as the heart and soul of Moroccan cuisine. It is imbued with all the culinary passions of a country and a people, it is the central condiment that sits atop every kitchen table in North Africa used as a spread, a dip or drizzled on top of nearly any dish”. -Mina Harissa
Check out the Mina story and grab a bottle or two to try out this summer. I say these green beans and shrimp are a must make!!
This sponsored post. We are being compensated for our participation, but all opinions are my own.
Those look amazing! I’ve never had Harissa but it sounds delicious – and like a great combination of so many flavors we love (especially my husband!)
My husband is ALWAYS on the hunt for new sauces and ways to take a dish and make it taste new– we are definitely going to try this one!
Drooling over BOTH these dishes! And spicy is a winner in our house.
I don’t think I’ve ever had harissa either, but sounds like something hubby and I would love! Your recipes both look great, I’m also thinking it could be good on eggs. Have you tried that?
Beth, I haven’t tried it on eggs but I know it would be good! Just last night I added a couple of TBS of it into a whipped feta dip I made and it was lovely, just the right amount of flavor and a hint of spice
Wow… The charred green beans look so delicious, especially with the fiery harissa. Just started using harissa and it’s my absolute new fav sauce. And the harissa shrimps look so yummy!
These look delicious!!!Adam Young is pop’s great escapist.
In song, the Owl City auteur and vocalist promises to paint listeners a dreamscape on a bedroom wall. He makes synthesizer pop music that feels as private as a whisper and as personal as a diary. His world is full of fantasy and transcendence; he writes about waterfalls, rainbows, cascades of downy feathers, and, famously, fireflies that keep him company during a sleepless night. "Reality is a lovely place," sings Young on the lead track to his latest album "All Things Bright and Beautiful," "but I wouldn’t want to live there."
So fans at Starland Ballroom on Sunday night might be surprised at what they see when Owl City takes the stage. Not a spotilight-averse electropop maestro hunkered over a laptop while video plays in the background, but a full band, fronted by a charismatic, expressive singer. Young, as it turns out, is less a bookish scientist than a manic preacher, animated by joy and driven to share his joy with his
listeners.
"I never imagined I’d be on stage, in front of anybody," says Young, 25, who was as shocked as anybody when "Fireflies" hit No. 1 in late 2009. "It all took off before I even knew what was going on. For a shy, introverted kid like me, it was a lot to take in. I’m glad to have the band, because I was an only child, and they’re like the brothers and sisters I’ve never had."
Solitude is a major theme in Young’s writing. Although he has achieved worldwide success with Owl City, he still makes his music in the small town where he grew up — quiet Owatonna, Minn. "Ocean Eyes," Owl City’s breakthrough album, was recorded "in the box": entirely made from software on a computer at Young’s Sky Harbor studio. The digital workstation was a retreat for him; a place where an introspective, philosophical young man who didn’t much like to travel or socialize could be alone with his visions. Listen carefully to "Ocean Eyes," and you can almost hear the snow falling on a deserted Minnesota street.
"When I first started touring, I’d never been anywhere," says Young, who is currently playing to sold-out theaters in Asia. "The first time I was ever on an airplane was when I met with the record label."
A lesser artist might have found this isolation stifling. Luckily, Young’s imagination is an expansive, intoxicating place: When he turns inward, he discovers riches. His music has occasionally been criticized by sour grownups for its childlike perspective, but the more wonderstruck Young sounds, the better it works. "Bright and Beautiful" foregrounds Young’s faith — not just in God, although his religion is fundamental to his writing, but also in the everlasting beauty of nature and the good will of his neighbors. Although "Bright and Beautiful" is a more polished album than "Ocean Eyes," it has not yet spun off a single that rivals the success of "Fireflies." But Young isn’t worried.
"I feel like I never want to be swayed by the unspoken ‘can you do it again’ question," says the songwriter. "I pushed all of that stuff aside while I was making the album. I decided as long as the music I was making was heartfelt and pure and it came from the same place, then that platinum plaque wouldn’t leer down at me. Because it was all so unexpected to begin with."
One standout from "All Things Bright and Beautiful" is "Galaxies," a gentle synthpop anthem about the Challenger disaster in 1986; Young even sampled Ronald Reagan’s memorable speech made in the wake of the Shuttle explosion.
"I heard that speech, and it rekindled my appreciation for the astronauts," says Young, who was born five months after the Challenger’s last flight. "I read everything I could find about the events of that day, because I wanted to pay respect. In the song, I’m just imagining myself as a flight commander, and wondering how I would answer for my own life if I was, as they were, suddenly taken from reality into eternity."
Eternity, too, remains on Young’s mind — but only provisionally. He’s too good at locating the hidden magic in this world to linger too long on the next. Like many Christian poets, he argues that there exists a greater reality that we can’t see, but that we’d be able to access if we could make an adjustment in our thinking. On "Angels," another superb song from "Bright and Beautiful," he sings "If you’re dying to see/ I guarantee/ there are angels around your vicinity."
"I think ultimately, it lies within a conscious choice — waking up every morning with an uplifting outlook. There’s so much beauty out there. Sometimes the trick is just to open your eyes."

Toronto has shown significant reluctance to part with Kyle Lowry, preferring to make a playoff run with him, league sources tell Yahoo.
— Adrian Wojnarowski (@WojYahooNBA) February 12, 2014
So who you got? Are you with the Chad Fords, Marc Steins, Chris Broussards and Ken Bergers of the world? Or are you in Woj and the “hugs for friends” camp?
UPDATE (4:07 PM)
Alright, I feel compelled to spit my two cents on the matter, so here’s my #hotsprotstake: we win either way.
Let’s just face facts — this rumor won’t die until Lowry either gets dealt, or until the trade deadline passes. As far as the NBA hotstove goes, this year is barely cracking tepid. No obvious superstar is on the move — no Carmelo vs. the Nuggets, no Deron Williams to the Nets — which has led some reporters to cast their nets into smaller ponds. That’s not to say that they’re being disingenuous — there’s no Season Five of The Wire going on here, I hope — but as Omar Little would say, “fish gotta swim, you know what I’m saying?” This is their livelihood, and when nothing’s cooking, the
Broussards totally credible reporters of the world need to light ’em mup (mup, mup).
I’m not implying that their reports are baseless. After all, how can you question the validity of “multiple sources with knowledge of the information?” There’s just nothing else going on out there, and Lowry’s an easy target. Here are the relevant facts about the situation, and I want you readers of RR to use your critical thinking skills and form your own conclusions:
- Lowry is an impending unrestricted free-agent
- Lowry is in the midst of a career year
- Lowry is only owed 6 million dollars this season, meaning that contenders likely won’t have to cough up a rotation player to acquire him
- Lowry plays point guard
- The Knicks have a gaping hole at point guard
- The Knicks want to make the playoffs this season because they have no first round draft pick and Carmelo can opt-out of his contract with the Knicks
- The Knicks front-office leaks like a sieve
- The Raptors front-office, especially under Ujiri, has a reputation to be tight-lipped
- The Knicks play in New York City, which just happens to be the media capital of the world
Did you lean back in your chair and put the pieces to the puzzle? Was my last sentence a reference to Fat Joe and the Terror Squad? Are the “multiple sources” making things up?
And that’s not to say that Lowry definitely won’t be traded. Anyone in the NBA be had for the right price (except Durant and Lebron, because there isn’t a right price for either player), but at this point in the season, with the Raptors sitting in third place in the Eastern Conference (and therefore no realistic shot of tanking), Ujiri is happy either way. If a team blows his socks off, Ujiri gives Lowry a hug and wishes him farewell. If not, Ujiri stands pat and garners accolades for taking this team to the playoffs for the first time in six years.
So what I’m saying is this: if Lowry gets traded, we win. If he doesn’t get traded, we still win.
UPDATE (4:59 PM)
Adds an executive with a team that’s been a suitor of Kyle Lowry, “We’ve heard it from (Toronto) that he won’t be moved.”

Date: 09 SepUNISON has condemned a £2.3million spend on temporary agency staff by Warrington Borough Council when permanent employees are being made redundant.
Jason Horan, joint branch secretary for Unison, said: “Outrageously high figures for agency workers particularly within operations who manage the refuse collection service has a projected end of year spend of £500,000 which in the current climate of budget pressures is totally unacceptable, it also places a big question on how management are managing the service.”
There is also a projected spend of £500,000 spend in the families and wellbeing department the union says due to a lack of social workers and support workers.
“Unison has grave concerns that the Labour group has sanctioned cuts without properly thinking through the implications and left officers to reduce permanent posts at there own discretion,” added Mr Horan.
A council spokesman said the figure was a reduction on previous spending.
They added: “We actively seek to reduce agency costs wherever possible, however, the majority of these workers are used not to fill permanent posts on an ongoing basis, but rather to cover maternity leave, annual leave, sick leave and to cover vacant posts whilst we are recruiting to them.
“In terms of social workers, Warrington performs extremely well in managing to recruit and retain permanent staff, in contrast to many other councils. However, it is vital for our most vulnerable residents that when there is sickness or maternity leave, or staff move elsewhere, that we ensure we continue to provide safe services, and this does necessitate the use of some agency staff.
“Mr Horan recently raised his concerns on this matter with the council's joint consultative committee, and the council committed there and then to working with trade unions to see what else we could do to address his concerns including a meeting with the chief executive to fully explore the issue. Indeed we look forward to this next step and to further exploring the matter.”

My housemate has been with Warrington Borough Council for 5.5 years as a member of the refuse collection team, from the time he started at the council he was prompted by the refuse collection foreman to obtain his HGV license as the council was crying out for drivers and it would mean promotion and in turn higher salary, this was repeated on numerous occassions leading my housemate to believe what he was being told. My housemate proceeded to save up the funds and 2.5 years ago passed his HGV license and was promptly told by the waste collection management team that there were no vacancies for drivers and wouldnt be for a long time. During this time they still proceeded to bring in agency drivers (one of whom was the foremans nephew who started a an agency loader but went and passed his HGV license after my housemate had passed his and was immediately put driving whilst my housemate was refused any chance point blank), When my house mate questioned this all 3 members of the waste service management team told him that it was cheaper to employ agency drivers and my housemate basically had no chance and may have to look elsewhere for a driving job, (effectively leave the council because they valued agency drivers over their own loyal staff). However the council waste service management team have paid for my housemate to do his professional driver CPC course at a cost of around £300 but yet refuse to progress him and instead make him walk on the back of a wagon all day.
I feel as a council taxpayer of this town i would rather see the council look after their own staff instead of spending so much on agency staff.TAGO

In the case where telephone interviews may occur, participants should receive a Participant Information Statement inviting them to participate.
They may be instructed to contact researchers to arrange a time for a telephone interview, or the Participant Information Statement may inform them that researchers will call to inquire whether or not they would be interested in participating.
In regards to consent, participants may either return the signed Participant Consent Form to researchers before the interview occurs or their consent may be obtained orally at the start of the telephone interview.
In the case where it is obtained orally, researchers are required to submit a draft of the dialogue which will be read to participants to seek their consent. There are strict State and Federal Laws concerning the recording of telephone conversations:
What you need to provide the Committee
- a. Why it is the preferred survey method and why the information could not be obtained in a less intrusive means, e.g. self-administered questionnaires.
- b. If questions are of a sensitive nature, how the potential for psychological harm is to be minimised and what referral protocol exists for people who experience emotional distress resulting from the interview or the request for an interview.
Interview script
A telephone interview script must be submitted with the application.
- The introduction should be concise, clearly identifying the caller, for whom the research is being undertaken and referring to the letter. It should also be stated who is funding the research (where relevant) and from whom ethics approval has been obtained. In asking to speak to the intended interviewee, the specific nature of the call should not be disclosed to a third party. For example, it is sufficient to say "I would like to speak to ... regarding a letter we sent to her about women's health", rather than "I would like to speak to ... regarding a letter we sent to her about how often she has Pap tests".
- It must cater for people who do not receive the information letter, e.g. lost mail or people who have changed address and retained their telephone numbers. If it is necessary to interview such people, the interview cannot proceed until such time as they are provided with an information sheet if they are willing to receive one.
- If necessary, the script must explicitly seek consent to conduct the telephone conversation and to tape the conversation. Alternatively, participants can receive and return a Participant Consent Form via mail or fax, but this often is not the preferred method because it is time-consuming.
What you need to provide participants
As a general rule, the minimum requirement is that the target population receives a written Participant Information Statement that forewarns them that telephone contact will be made.
Alternatively, the Information Statement may instruct those interested in participating to contact the researchers. In addition to the normal requirements for an Information Statement it should also address the following:
- a. The reasons for obtaining information via a telephone interview.
- b. How names, addresses and telephone numbers of the target population were obtained.
- c. The desired interviewee and why this person is chosen.
- d. Details of the nature of the questions to be asked.
- e. When the interview will take place and its length.
- f. The manner in which the target population may prevent telephone contact, e.g. the provision of a refusal form that can be returned to the researcher.
Consent forms
Consent Forms should contain the following information:
- where the information will be published
- who will have access whilst the information is stored in the Department
- what will happen to the material once the storage period of 7 years has expired
- that research personnel are subject to confidentiality obligations in collecting the data
Whether or not identifying data is to be recorded, the research personnel involved in collecting the data will inevitably hear information that may be regarded as private or confidential. If there is not already a confidentiality agreement in place generally covering the work of these personnel, then they should also sign a short confidentiality undertaking.
By following the above steps, the researchers will ensure that the participants understand the exact nature of the project and have given their fully informed consent to the use of the information recorded. (Reference: Gilbert and Tobin, 19 May 1995)
Relevant legislation
If researchers plan on recording telephone interviews, they should refer to the State and Federal Laws concerning the taping of telephone conversations.
Both of the above-mentioned Acts prohibit the recording of phone conversations except where all parties to the conversation provide express consent.
This legislation requires that you gain the express consent of participants before you publish or communicate your research based on telephone conversations with these participants to other persons.
As these laws protect privacy, courts will apply them strictly. This will usually mean that the consent obtained from participants should be specific, and identify how the information will be stored, used and distributed.
The level of detail in Consent Forms will depend on the extent of the personally identifying information that is collected, stored and which can be accessed on an ongoing basis.
Example:
- if the information which is collected has no identifying details, so that the parties to the conversation can never be traced or identified by people accessing the primary data, the privacy concerns will be much less, and the consent can be more general;
- if identifying information is to be collected, and then sieved out from the information - which is then to be distributed - privacy concerns will be heightened. Consideration will need to be given to securely storing the primary data with its identifying details and limiting access to that data and to any system which allows matching of the 'generalised' data with the primary data containing the identification. The consent will need to allow retention of the identifying data and future access to it.You are using an outdated browser. Please upgrade your browser to improve your ReverbNation experience.

By David Hendricks : May 1, 2013 : Updated: May 1, 2013 10:24pm
- Jack Downey says “arts and culture are the vital signs of any great city.”
Local businessman and fundraising consultant Jack Downey, a retired U.S. Air Force officer, has been named president and CEO of the San Antonio Symphony, effectively immediately, the organization announced Wednesday.
Downey replaces the previous symphony head, Jack Fishman, who departed suddenly last November without explanation, other than to say it was a personal decision.
“Jack (Downey) is a proven leader with a long record of service in our community,” symphony board President Dennert Ware said. “He built the Children's Shelter here into a national model, and we expect he will be just as successful taking our world-class symphony into its last season at the Majestic and then on to our permanent home at the Tobin Center for the Performing Arts.”
The 72-member symphony plans to move to the Tobin Center, now under construction, in September 2014.
Ware said the six-member search committee, made up of four board members and two musicians, were mainly concerned about shoring up the business expertise in the front office, feeling the organization was in good condition with its musical leadership.
“We had considered taking a harder look at other (outside) candidates, but with Jack Downey's skills and experience in San Antonio, we thought that was the most critical.”
The search committee selected Downey as the finalist last week and put together the offer over the weekend. Downey accepted the position on Monday, Ware said.
Fundraising for the organization has been important after it declared financial emergencies in three of the four years of the musicians' 2007-11 contract. In the emergencies, the musicians agreed to pay cuts in the last portions of those seasons to help balance the books.
The musicians are in the first season of a three-year contract, and Ware said he expects the organization to make payroll through the end of the season in early June. “Will we end in the black? I certainly hope so. It's our intention,” Ware said.
David Filner, who served as the symphony's interim CEO for five months, will resume his previous duties involving artistic administration as a senior executive, Ware said.
“David did a superb job overseeing all the symphony's business operations while we conducted our search,” Ware added. “We really appreciate his service.”
Downey retired from the Air Force in 1992 after a 26-year career, and entered the nonprofit world first by working at Christian Senior Services as its executive director.
Downey then moved to the Children's Shelter, where he grew the agency's budget from $300,000 to $15 million. He departed as the shelter's president and CEO in 2008 to join the Briscoe Western Art Museum as executive director.
Later, he formed his own nonprofit consulting firm, Downey Associates, with wife Mary Downey, who now serves as executive director for the San Antonio chapter of the Association for Fundraising Professionals as a planned giving specialist.
“Strong business leadership is the backbone of a thriving orchestra and makes great concerts possible,” said Sebastian Lang-Lessing, the symphony's music director. “It's an exciting new era for the performing arts in San Antonio. We are thrilled the search committee found Jack Downey as the symphony prepares for a wonderful new chapter in our long history and our 75th anniversary season at the new Tobin Center.”
Downey holds a master's of science degree from the University of Southern California and is certified as a senior professional in human resources. He also has taught nonprofit leadership and management as an adjunct professor at the University of Texas at San Antonio.
“I accepted this position because I believe arts and culture are the vital signs of any great city,” Downey said in a prepared statement.
“The symphony is magnificent on stage, but what Sebastian and our musicians do off stage is just as important,” he added. “They are the heart of the city's music ecosystem. They inspire and teach students, who make music a path to higher education. Every day of the year our musicians are out in the community, working, volunteering, touching lives. We have a great story to tell.”
The symphony performs a classical subscription series concert at 8 p.m. Friday and Saturday nights at the Majestic Theatre downtown, featuring music of Giuseppe Verdi, Jean Sibelius and Ludwig Van Beethoven, along with guest pianist Andreas Bach.

Exposimeters are a world-wide well-established procedure for measuring indoor radon concentrations. The measurement of the radon activity concentration is a matter of particular interest at home and at work. Depending on the problem different measuring systems with different measurement intervals can be used. Exposimeters are a world-wide well-established procedure for measuring indoor radon concentrations.
For the determination of the radon exposure at home or at work integrating long-term measurements (with measuring intervals from several webeks up to 1 year) are a common method. They are usually carried out by inexpensive track etch detectors (also called exposimeter). These detectors are used world-wide in large numbers and represent an approved and reliable measuring system.
The detectors are usually send by post. Installation and handling are very easy and can be done by the customers themselves. After the measurement the detectors are analysed in a laboratory. It makes sense, that the result is interpreted by an radon expert.
If you are interested in a long-term measurement, you can order track etch detectors immediately and uncomplicated at the company Kemski & Partner.
Example of the daily change of the radon acitivity concentration. Time-resolving
measurements of the radon activity concentration are necessary, if the influence of
ventilation or the pattern of using a room as well as changes in the building structure
or of the working conditions have to be investigated. These problems often are of interest
for specialists in authorities, for consultants in the environmental sciences or for
scientists at universities. For these purposes instruments containing electronic devices
operated by power supply or batteries like the devices of the Radim line are necessary.
Sensitivity and time resolution have to be suitable for the particular problem.
Example of the daily change of the radon acitivity concentration.
Beside indoor measurements the determination of radon activity concentration in soil gas is of interest, e.g. before starting the construction of a house. Here, the values are in a range of approximately 5.000 to about 2.000.000 Bq/m3 - much more than measured indoor. Due to the spatial variation in the soil, radon has always to be measured at several measuring sites at the same time. For this purpose the use of Lucas cells has been well approved. These small glass cells (volume: 100 to 500 ml) are filled with soil gas and measured in a scintillation counter. Especially for this kind of application the SISIE was developed. With an additional mechanism for de-emanating of water samples it is possible to analyse radon in water with a high accuracy.

May 19, 2005
Filed under Features
Park Guidelines for Off-Highway Vehicles, a 200-page illustrated manual published by the National Off-Highway Vehicle Conservation Council (NOHVCC), is currently going into its second printing.
First published in 2002, the manual has been used by hundreds of ATV and off-highway motorcycle enthusiasts seeking assistance in the formation of off-road riding areas. The NOHVCC describes it as one of the most popular tools the organization offers.
Nila Armstrong, Streams and Trails Specialist for the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, was one of the first land managers to obtain a copy of Park Guidelines.
“I found the book to be extremely valuable for our project,” said Armstrong, who was the main driving force behind the 2003 creation of a new OHV park in southern Indiana called Redbird State Riding Area (SRA). “We found the OHV user survey in the appendix especially helpful as a starting point for developing the park. The marketing tips for dealing with the public and various state lawmakers was also a ‘must-have’ as far as I’m concerned.”
Professional trail designer Troy Scott Parker from Boulder, Colo., utilized Park Guidelines to help develop the tentatively-named Rock Run Recreation Area in west central Pennsylvania.
“I got the manual from NOHVCC because I didn’t know anything about OHV trails or parks when I first started the Rock Run project,” said a lot of people a lot grief before they embark on an OHV park project,” he said.
Parker says the Pennsylvania recreation area is on the fast track to completion and could open as soon as next year.
NOHVCC says the manual:
n Answers common questions that arise when development of an off-highway vehicle (OHV) park is desired or proposed;
n Provides information on community planning and coalition building necessary to promote local OHV park planning efforts and to develop local public support for an OHV park;
n Provides information and resources to the OHV public, youth group leaders, and governmental agencies that encourage and assist them in the development of youth activities, safety training, and environmental programs at OHV parks;
n Provides information to assist governmental agencies and the private sector in planning, designing, funding, operating, and maintaining new OHV parks and upgraded existing parks to meet the needs and desires of the OHV recreation community while addressing environmental and general public concerns;
n Offers ideas, resources and suggestions allowing governmental agencies and private owners of OHV parks to enhance ongoing activities and encourage development of additional park programs.
Other tools available from the NOHVCC include an Urban Park CD that is a PowerPoint program and can assist with presentations at community, zoning meetings, etc.; and a list of individuals that have already developed parks and can be contacted with specific questions.
NOHVCC’s Park Guidelines for Off-Highway Vehicles can be obtained by check or credit card for $45 plus $6 shipping and handling. To place orders, contact the NOHVCC home office by phone, 800/348-6487, by email, trailhead@nohvcc.org, or by visiting their Web site at.Villa Cal Roma

Villa Cal Roma<<Science is playing a significant role in today's news, including hot-button topics such as toxic waste disposal, global warming, emerging diseases and dozens of other critical concerns. Faced with these issues, there has never been a greater need for excellent science teachers who can prepare the next generation of Americans to genuinely comprehend and effectively deal with these and other scientific challenges ahead.
Producing science teachers who can keep up with rapidly advancing fields and can also inspire students is not an easy task. With a grant from the National Science Foundation's Robert Noyce Scholarship Program, the School of Science at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis is challenging science majors - individuals who enjoy and appreciate science - to transfer their enthusiasm and knowledge to students in middle school and high school classrooms.
Through the Noyce Summer Internship program, freshmen and sophomore IUPUI science students spend eight weeks sharing their passion for science at places like The Children's Museum of Indianapolis and the Diabetes Youth Foundation Camp, while hopefully getting hooked on a science education career.
"This program is part of a new strategy to help overcome a real challenge related to the science teacher pipeline - helping science majors recognize their interest in science education early enough in their IUPUI experience so that they major in demanding fields like chemistry, physics or even engineering, yet still have time to take the education courses they need to be science teachers," said Kathleen Marrs, Ph.D., director of the Urban Center for the Advancement of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education (UCASE) and associate dean for academic affairs at the School of Science at IUPUI.
Noyce summer intern Derrick H. Andry is just the type of student Marrs is hoping will find science teaching appealing. A chemistry major at the School of Science, he is spending the summer at The Children's Museum, the world's largest children's museum, where he dons a tie-dyed lab coat and presents hands-on chemistry experiments, including one he developed during his internship to make biodiesel fuel from plant oils, to enthusiastic visitors of all ages.
"I Intern he is working in The Children's Museum's SciencePort using his aptitude for technology to design projects that intrigue a generation for whom technology is a part of everyday life. In his spare time this summer he is taking a physics course at the School of Science and preparing for football season as a linebacker on the Butler team.
Abby Soltis is a dual biology and biomedical engineering major with a math minor. "While many biology majors are enroute to nursing or medical careers, that's not for me. Biomedical engineering has taught me good problem-solving skills that will be useful in whatever I do. Teaching is about passion and I want to transfer my passion for math and science to students. It doesn't matter what kind of science or math it is, I just want to make students enthusiastic about learning.
"I am naturally inquisitive and I am about 80 percent sure I want to teach science or math. This summer as a Noyce Intern designing and demonstrating projects including one related to the physics of sound for the big Rock Stars, Cars & Guitars exhibit has convinced me that whole families can be engaged in science. The Children's Museum has been a wonderful introduction to education," she said.
Through a competitive process, IUPUI Noyce Interns can become Noyce Scholars and as juniors and seniors receive scholarship assistance as they add rigorous courses from IUPUI's School of Education to their already demanding workload. Noyce Scholars commit to two years of service as science or mathematics teachers at a high need public school anywhere in the United States.

There just isn't enough time to complete this level!! Any advice? I seem to make it to row 14 and have once or twice had only a few blocks left but have been stuck for a month now!!
Answer from: Marmar
Took me ages to pass it! Passed it out of pure luck. You have to be very fast, try to get rid of those black stones with bullets. Black stones slow things down. Don't use the bullet before the screen moved down - so you can clear more dirt. Don't rely on diamonds unless you can combine them with a bullet. Otherwise they only remove jewels, not dirt. But it is really All about luck. They making it hard so you get frustrated and start spending money. I'm personally opposed to the idea of paying in order to win a game. Eventually you will pass it. Oh, and try to wait for the energy to be 5. Ten you can do 5 times in a row, which gets you a better practice, and, i think, more chances to win.
Answer from: Atlevel63now
It took me about a week, but it is doable. I did not buy any boosts either. Very tough level.
Answer from: Notpassing58
This is the worst level. I've tried for weeks and I'm getting worse! Used to have a brick or two left but now I'm getting 10/16 and at best 12/16. It's is pure luck. A friend passed it on the second try of his game and he sucks because I helped him pass his previous levels so it has nothing to do with strategy. Get a friend to help on one side while you destroy the other is my best advice. Byeee
Answer from: Passed58
Go big on level 58. Try to get blasters and bombs and combine them together. If you get a diamond don't use it until you can combine it with a blaster. If you can blast those black blocks away.
Answer from: LV
Stuck on level 58 for several weeks. Finally read hints on this forum. Followed Marmar's instructions. Completed level 1st at that point.)Who's afraid of Super 301?
Article Abstract:
The US has imposed the Super 301 clause from the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act on South Korea concerning its import of US cars. The US will impose sanctions on Korea if it is not satisfied, after 18 months from Oct 1997, that Korea has removed barriers to free trade. US car manufacturers sold only 10,000 cars in Korea in 1996, and the US government has demanded that Korea reduce its import tariffs from 8% to 2.5%. Korean car industry experts maintain that the US is trying to sell cars which are too large for Korea, and that the use of Super 301 undermines the international trading system.

Southeast Asia's timid traders
Article Abstract:
By creating the Asean Free Trade Area, Southeast Asian countries will improve their trade volumes, but far less than if they adopted a more open, worldwide Most Favored Nation approach. After three to five years under AFTA inter-region trade will rise by up to $2.9 billion per year, and trade with the rest of the world by $2.4 billion. Open regionalism, however, would boost trade with the rest of the world by $9.1 billion, and interregional trade by $1.7 billion. Singapore and Malaysia do better under AFTA, however.

Sure, some of them are designed to generate more cash for the security business, but that doesn’t alter the fact that it’s generally a pretty hostile place out there if you’re not careful.
Current solutions typically involve the installation of various complicated programs to protect your computer, but up till now there hasn’t been a really comprehensive product which covers all the bases in one easy to use program.
WiFi Protector, developed by the team behind the popular Broadband Speed Checker, provides a complete suite of wireless network protection in a freeware program which is impressively simple to install and use. After downloading all the user needs to do is…well nothing. The program automatically configures itself for your network, and from then on will do a number of clever things.
First it provides an encrypted VPN connection between your computer and the Internet over the wireless connection. This ensures that no-one can ‘snoop’ on your connection and grab private or sensitive data, such as banking logins etc. The software also monitors your home wireless network to make sure that nobody is logging on to it without authorization. Every time a new device connects which is not a trusted device, you receive a warning so you can keep track of intrusions in real time.
The program also maintains a list of past wireless connections which you have used, and informs you when you’re about to log on to an insecure and potentially risky connection. Finally the system shields your IP address and gives you an anonymous one which lets you surf privately and without restrictions, useful if you’re trapped behind a company firewall at home.
The most impressive thing about the product is how easy it installs into your system. It even integrates with your web browser (as an option) to warn about potentially dangerous phishing or drive-by malware sites. Very neat indeed. Although the program is free, there is a Pro version which costs $4 a month on subscription and which offers faster browsing and removes the rather intrusive video ads you have to watch when booting up the system for the first time.
In practice one thing we noticed is the free version does impose a fairly significant speed penalty on your Internet connection because of all the VPN and encryption work. From our tests we saw the file download speed drop by a half when WiFi Protector was enabled. For many people this may be a price worth paying for the increased security, for others it’s a no-no.
One important thing that makes the slower speed issue less of a problem is the fact that you can switch the protection on and off as you feel necessary. This means you could install the software and then switch it on only when you were about to do some Internet banking or other private activity and then switch it off again for general high speed surfing. No doubt the speed problem goes away if you pay the subscription for the Pro version.
All in all we have to say this is still a worthwhile program to own. It’s free, it installs like a dream and apart from the initial annoying advert in the free version, and the inevitable and unavoidable speed penalty from all that security, it’s a nice way to secure your computer against malfeasance. Definitely worth a bookmark and/or download.This is a "tour" Video of my '62 Ford Fairlane. (please excuse the shakey camra work in some places!)

Patient dosing has begun in two trials, which are designed to assess the safety and efficacy of EVP-6124 compared to placebo in patients with schizophrenia when added to chronic, stable, atypical antipsychotic therapy. These two 26-week multinational trials are designed to enroll approximately 700 patients each and both will evaluate two doses of EVP-6124 compared to placebo.
“While currently available atypical antipsychotic medications can be effective in improving the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, there are no currently approved treatments for the cognitive or negative symptoms, which greatly impact the daily lives of people living with this disease,” said Dana Hilt, M.D., senior vice president, clinical development and chief medical officer of EnVivo. “We have seen statistically significant and clinically meaningful results on global cognitive function, negative symptoms and clinical function with EVP-6124 in prior studies. We believe that EVP-6124 may address a significant need for treatment options that can enhance cognition and that can be administered along with atypical antipsychotics, the current standard of care for people living with schizophrenia.”
The Phase 3 clinical trial program includes two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of two doses of once daily treatment with EVP-6124 as a pro-cognitive treatment compared to placebo when added to chronic, stable, atypical antipsychotic therapy in people with schizophrenia. The primary endpoints of the trials include effect on cognitive function as measured by the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS™) Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB™) overall cognitive index and effect on clinical function as measured by the interview-based Schizophrenia Cognition Rating Scale (SCoRS). Secondary endpoints of the trial include the clinical efficacy of the two doses of EVP-6124 as measured by negative subscale of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Clinical Global Impression – Severity (CGI-S), Clinical Global Impression – Change scale (CGI-C), and quality of life, using the EuroQoL-5D™ (EQ-5D). Safety will be determined by clinical and laboratory safety assessments.
“An estimated 2.4 million Americans have schizophrenia, almost all of whom have cognitive deficits which are the major cause of their functional impairment, even more so than psychotic symptoms. There is a critical need for safe and effective therapies that address these deficits in cognition because minimizing them is likely to have a positive impact on quality of life and independence,” said Herbert Y. Meltzer, M.D., Ph.D., professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, Northwestern University School of Medicine. “Studies like these Phase 3 clinical trials are essential for the medical community and regulatory authorities to evaluate new treatment options designed to address these unmet needs of patients with schizophrenia.”
About Schizophrenia EVP-6124
EnVivo Pharmaceuticals’ lead compound, EVP-6124, is a selective, potent, brain penetrant, oral alpha-7 nicotinic agonist being developed as a long-term treatment to improve cognitive function with sustained effect in Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia. It is believed that side effects. EVP-6124 has also been shown to increase the levels of key neurotransmitters such as glutamate and dopamine in key brain regions in preclinical studies, which may be linked to enhanced cognition, not only in Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia, but also in other diseases.
EnVivo announced positive topline data from its double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial of EVP-6124 in schizophrenia in May 2011 and presented a comprehensive analysis of these findings in December 2011. The Phase 3 program of EVP-6124 in schizophrenia was announced in February 2013. The company also announced and presented positive findings from another double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial of EVP-6124 in Alzheimer’s disease in July and October 2012. A Phase 3 clinical trial of EVP-6124 in Alzheimer’s disease is expected to be initiated in 2013.

I wasn't expecting the four big, heavy items I found on my doorstep. I was able to wrangle bundles of the OK Route 66 Trip Guide into the Station because they're held together with bands I could use as handles, but the two extremely heavy boxes of unsolicited advertising materials will have to stay outside until I find someone to heft them for me, since I'm not supposed to lift heavy things with my right arm. (Note: Later, Betty brought them in for me. Thanks, Betty!)

My first visitors today were the kids from "Links", the little local monthly magazine published by persons with disabilities. It's always fun to see them, and they put out a darn fine magazine. Subsequently, there were visitors from a parade of states, including Paris TX, Maumee OH, Sarasota FL, Jasper IN, Loogootee IN, Orange Co. CA, Milwaukee WI, and Empire AL. Betty came and co-hosted with me for most of the day. I've noticed considerably fewer foreign visitors so far this year, although I do realize that their usual traveling times are July and August, so maybe I'm just being impatient.
I had my second complainer of the season today, and that's not so bad since I've had over a thousand happy visitors thus far. This woman (whose home state will remain anonymous) started complaining before she got the door open. "We got lost." "The signage is terrible". "We're getting off this road and getting back on the interstate". "There's nothing to see in these little towns." Fortunately, another couple was there at the same time, and they were first to remind the lady (before I even had the chance) that every wrong turn simply allows you to see something you wouldn't have seen otherwise. It's all an adventure, after all! I added that it would be a good idea to procure a guide book instead of trying to "do" Route 66 blindly, but she refused to buy one or even take the free OK Trip Guide. Oh well!
When I got in the car to go home, the outside temperature was registering 103 on my car thermometer. It remained there all the way home. (No wonder those visitors earlier, in a 40s-era non-air conditioned Buick Roadmaster, looked so hot! But they weren't complaining!)

Sad when people to not have a sense of adventure :o(
West of El Reno Route 66 is poorly marked, too. But, that just means I have more of an adventure looking for it. Makes me feel more like Lewis and Clark.
Wonder what those people would have done in the 19th Century?
Oh well, let them go on their pre-packaged tours to Disney Land, et.al., where they don't find anything. Someone else finds it for them, then just shows it to them.
Mean ol' anti-traveling lady. Pfftthhh!
Do people live in the tourist cabins in the picture? I see a truck parked outside.
Hope your whiner didn't let the toll gate hit her in the butt on the way back onto the turnpike. If she thinks 66 is hard to follow, she ought to try the Lincoln Highway sometime.
Beth - Yes, those cabins are being lived in, at least some of them.
Emily - I resisted the temptation to hurl an EZ66 Guide at her head!3/11/11 . 1 . Bible Verse Alphabet . Scripture Memorization For Children . Uses the alphabet and items that are familiar to children. Teaches children the importance

I bought this not for a scratching problem but to see if it would keep my cat from occassionally using a certain rug instead of her litter box. Sure enough, after spraying it once a week, she decided the box was okay. I imagine it would work well on furniture for scratching as well.
Pros: smells good
Cons: need to reappYes exactly there . Hope you can find it alright and let us know if you need anything or further explanation. I agree labling all is fun and so useful too.

I haven't bought any more labels yet but what do you get in a pack of a or b? are the labels differently sized like they are in the ones you get with the machine?

The NFL had already said the two defensive tackles could play in Sunday."
The fight isn't over, but a three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld earlier decisions from a federal district court -- including one that says the remaining legal issues must be resolved in state court. The judge there has issued an injunction prohibiting the NFL from suspending the players, and he has said a state trial during the 2009 season was unlikely.
It wasn't known whether the NFL will appeal Friday's decision.
"We are looking at our options on how to proceed," NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said in an e-mail.
The NFL wants to suspend the Williamses, who are not related, for four games each after they both tested positive for a banned substance during training camp in 2008.
The players are not accused of taking steroids. They acknowledge taking the over-the-counter weight loss supplement StarCaps, which did not state on the label that it contained the diuretic bumetanide. The diuretic is banned by the NFL because it can mask the presence of steroids.
The legal case contesting the suspensions has many twists and turns. In late 2008, the Williamses met with the league to appeal their suspensions, saying they didn't know StarCaps contained the banned substance. But the league upheld its decision, saying it had warned about the product in 2006.
So the Williamses sued the NFL in state court, asking a judge to block the suspensions so they could keep playing. The Williamses argued the NFL's testing violated Minnesota workplace laws.
The case was moved to federal court, and the NFL Players Association filed a similar lawsuit on behalf of the Williamses and three on Friday agreed with Magnuson's decisions. Williamses are using to block their suspensions. The NFL has said players are responsible for what they put into their bodies.
Minnesota state law requires that an employer give an employee who tests positive for dug use the right to explain the positive test.
The case has attracted attention, and opinions, from other pro sports leagues. Major League Baseball, the NBA and the NHL filed a friend-of-the-court brief in July supporting the NFL's position.
An attorney for the Williamses was pleased with Friday's ruling.
"It's a terrific ruling for us and it's a terrific ruling for unionized employees everywhere," Peter Ginsberg said. He said the ruling shows that "even an $8 billion business cannot ignore liberty rights and protections established by state legislatures."
The appeals court decision could affect current New Orleans Saints players Charles Grant and Will Smith, as well as Deuce McAllister, the Saints' career rushing leader who was released after last season. The three are not part of the Williamses' lawsuit in state court.
Vikings coach Brad Childress said the players can put the legal battle behind them for now and look forward.
The news, in fact, could not be better for the Vikings, who fancy themselves as Super Bowl contenders this season. Losing the "Williams Wall" would have been devastating for their defense, which is one of the best against the run in recent history.
Now they can be sure that both players will be in the lineup every week as they defend their NFC North title.
"It's definitely great to have them back," said Vikings defensive end Ray Edwards. "They're pretty much the heart of the defense and you can't really do too much without your heart."

Find Peak 4940 on Sunnyside of Turnagain Pass and climb the gnarliest avalanche path to it's summit. This gigantic terrain trap accesses the high chutes of TT43. Apparently the Department of Transportation named this avalanche path because it threatens the road and power lines. Some call it TT4940 for Terrain Trap 4940.
Following ravings from Brad Cosgrove, Henry Munter and Ryan Hokanson, I recruited fellow guide and avalanche instructor Leighan Falley for a look. The Chugach avalanche advisory was boasting LOW avalanche danger after rain and two weeks of no snow, but snow began falling as we crossed Turnagain Pass and our doubts rose. As we booted high in the TT43 gullies, the two inches of new snow was point releasing and running 1,000 vertical feet. At 4,000-feet we entered a broken layer of clouds. We remained on the verge of turning around on the entire climb. In the end, the sloughing and storm abated enough to let us squeak up the 43-degree chute and emerge on the corniced summit of Peak 4940. The 4,300-foot shot took us straight to the valley floor. One of the longer runs at Turnagain Pass, but still a long shot from the 6,300-foot north face of Pioneer Peak.
Leighan booting 43-degree snow through rock islands 300 feet from the summit. Hurry! It's 3PM and getting dark.
Stormy and windy but so fun. We had awesome powder skiing for the top 2,000 feet. The new snow over recycled powder was sloughing. Stable conditions otherwise.

I did write about some of my immediate expressions here:
So, I got the camera ten days ago and since then I have shot a lot more and I'm getting more and more familiar with the camera. In fact it already feels like I would have used it for years as the UI is so intuitive. I would say that it is much better in this regard even though I never really had any issues with the MkII. The MkIII is just faster and very pleasing to use. I like the button layout much better.
Along my scattered expressions I am sharing some photos from the last 10 days.
I am still impressed with the tonality and the malleability of the files.
The dark gradations are solid and smooth. There is little pattern noise to speak about in most conditions so far - at least this body is better in this regard than the 10D, 20D, 5D, 1DsMkII that I have used extensively. It also seems significantly better than the 5DMkII in my experience.
I did encounter a funny issue though. The DsMkIII has more hot pixels than my DsMkII. Way WAY less than my long ago sold 20D though. I use ACR for conversion and as usual it deals well with the obvious red dots. That said, it seems to miss some of these really small light green dots that I get in low light shots (I am typically around 30s shutter speed). It is not a biggie, just a curiosity.
The dust seems livelier on the sensor which is a good thing in the sense that there are probably less "welded" particles that need wet cleaning. Maybe the automatic cleaning system contributes to this.
The viewfinder is something everybody should look through. Especially the EVF advocates, hehe. It is insanely big and bright. The info in it is MUCH improved over the DsMkII. I love the ISO display, the number of shots left, the image quality info (the reassuring RAW symbol).
The ISO button has a great big lump to it which makes adjustments a doddle while looking through the viewfinder. The 3-7 frame bracketing is lovely. I absolutely adore the joystick push change of AF points between the center point and a point that I have registered. The top LCD even has a symbol about the MLU being activated... I love it. I love the My Menu feature. It is really handy. The faster buffer flush is great. The new battery charger is cool (space age compared to the earlier model).
The shutter sound is significantly less aggressive than on the DsMkII. It is not so high frequency, not so electrocution like. Fuller and quite satisfying I would say.
The AF in the dark is as good if not slightly better than the DsMkII. At least that is my impression so far. The AF speed seems similar to me. But then again I am no spots shooter.
I shot an assignment with an ST-E2 clone and two strobes and it was a doddle. Too bad I cannot share the pics until the magazine goes to publication in september. The pics turned out really cool. The bright viewfinder actually makes framing easier in the dark.
I think I am buying the claims about increased dynamic range over the MkII. I have but my gut feeling about it. There is a reassuring latitude in the highlights in RAW conversion and the cleaner shadows also help.
Overall it is a well rounded camera, a clear improvement over the MkII. Makes for a really satisfying shooting experience. I would not trade mine for a 5DMkIII, I guess I enjoy the build so much. I also did not get the illumination of the 5D AF points.
One thing I have noticed is that I worry much less about noise reduction and more importantly I seem to be doing way less curves as well. There is something much more to my liking in the default contrast curve or something. When there is noise the ACR seems to do a much better job with these files than with the MkII. Weird but I see it with my own eyes.
I think I am set with this camera for a few years at least. Maybe even longer. It seems an incredible picture taking machine.
EarthlightEvery business has its peak season and its troughs, but companies that sell goods and services related to one particular time of year -- whether it is summertime or ski season or tied to a holiday -- have only a narrow window to get customers' attention, feed them information, and close a deal. That usually requires a burst of marketing. And what about during the slow periods? It turns out that many seasonal businesses focus on marketing during their downtime as well: They look for creative tactics to generate more off-season revenue, or else they prepare for the year ahead. Here are some tips from seasonal businesses on what they do during quiet periods -- many of which will work just as well for a business with consistent revenue.
1. Promote your expertise.
The process of cultivating spring and summer sales begins early in the year at Adams Fairacre Farms, a Poughkeepsie, New York, company that operates three garden and grocery stores. Starting in January, the business hosts a six-week series of free gardening workshops. From 30 to 60 people attend each of the classes, most of which are taught by nursery staff. Marketing director William Lessner says the seminars keep customers in the habit of coming to the stores regularly and help to position the business as a trusted resource. It's hard to know the impact on the bottom line. But in the 15 years since Adams began offering free workshops, sales have grown steadily, to $106 million. "They're an investment in the future," Lessner says. "They brand us as having real garden experts working here."
2. Pick up the phone.
When it comes to holding on to current customers, it's hard to beat a personal phone call. That's been Fred Schwam's experience. He's the CEO of American Christmas, which decorates New York City stores and office buildings for the holidays. Starting in February, Schwam and his employees call their customers, one by one. The script is simple: They review the client's previous order and ask if the client anticipates any changes for the next holiday season. If the customer does want something new, Schwam has a heads-up early in the planning cycle. And touching base builds goodwill even if there are no changes to the order. Schwam believes this focus on repeat business is a big part of the reason he has doubled revenue since 2005, to $9 million.
3. Look for ways to extend the busy season.
Don Cheley, co-owner of Cheley Colorado Camps, makes his money during the height of the summer, when busloads of kids arrive at his Estes Park, Colorado, facility. A few years ago, he decided to look for ways to start the busy season earlier and end it later. He had received some calls from campers' parents inquiring about adult programs. Seeing a potential new group of customers, Cheley began offering family-oriented outdoor adventure packages in the spring, late summer, and early fall. The hiking programs now contribute 5 percent of Cheley's $3.5 million in annual revenue. Interest in the programs is growing so fast, in fact, that Cheley says he has had to turn away prospective customers, because he doesn't have enough staff in the "shoulder season" to guide more hiking tours.
4. Blog -- especially about the big names in your industry.
The Golden Gecko Garden Center, in Garden Valley, California, sees business fall off in the winter. Owner Trey Pitsenberger uses the lull to tend to his blog, which has become something of a must-read in the industry. Many posts on the site (thegoldengecko.com/blog) serve up dish about big companies in the industry, such as Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and Scotts. Last March, for example, Pitsenberger wrote about the local Home Depot's practice of selling tomatoes before the weather is warm. "With Home Depot's policy of paying the vendors only after the plants have sold, they just throw out any that die in last night's frost and have more sent in," he wrote. "No loss on The Depot's part." By going after the big boys, the site has attained a great Google ranking. Type Home Depot garden center into the search engine, and the Golden Gecko's site lands fairly high among the results. "All I'm trying to do," says Pitsenberger, "is attract the 5 or 10 percent of the public that's tired of the chain stores."
5. Schmooze with your most profitable customers.
Aspen/Snowmass, a Colorado ski resort, experimented with a new mailing during last year's off-season. The company sent a bound journal as a gift to 40,000 people who had visited the resort twice in the past five years. The journal came with photos of Aspen and a letter from the resort's CEO inviting them to return. The piece was produced during the summer and mailed in November, to arrive in homes right around the time most ski vacations are planned. Thirty-seven percent of the people who received the gift booked rooms, according to vice president of marketing Jeanne Mackowski, and those customers were especially profitable. "These loyalty-program customers spent 30 percent more than typical customers," she says, "and they spent double the amount first-time customers spent."
6. Invent holidays!
Blooms Today took a page right out of the Hallmark playbook. Like all florists, this online delivery service in Haymarket, Virginia, bustles on Valentine's Day and Mother's Day. After that, it faces a months-long slump. So the company's marketing team combed through calendars to identify obscure events and celebrations, such as Teacher Appreciation Week (May) and Grandparents' Day (September), that it could promote in e-mail newsletters. It worked: The seven or eight holiday-branded promotions the company sent out produced response rates that were 15 percent to 20 percent higher than those for generic discount e-mail promotions sent throughout the year.Packin’ up an headin’ out
This morning I woke up with a mission. My one and only goal for the day was to finish off the bottomless bag of Stacy’s Pita chips. That’s it. Coffee, whatever. Exercise, puh-lease.
I simply wanted THESE deliciously addictive, wonderfully horrible, pita chips out of my
apartment life. The way these mothahs taunt me is inexplicable…
And lemme tell you, when I set my mind to something, I get ‘er done.
Stacy says the bag has 28 servings. Elise says 8. I wish Stacy were right, but the reality is she’s way off base. Like Charlie Sheen’s wife, she better get her story straight or there could be scary consequences. I kid, I kid. The truth of the matter is, I will probably replenish my stash as soon as I get back to NYC…it’s a sickness really.
Anyways, in case you’re wondering, I did eat more than chips for breakfast. Between licking my salt covered fingers, I had coffee and two yellow apples, before heading off to the gym.
Since I was in a time crunch (flight to catch, packing to finish, hair to tame, layers to apply, etc.), I ripped through 30 minutes on the elliptical and 15 minutes on the bike before stretching and returning home. I may have lost my face on the way back to the apartment. According to the news there were 22 mph winds, but I swear it was more like 50!! It was SO strong I could hardly walk into it. I basically added another 5+ minutes of resistance training into my workout.
Look what I found on my doorstep!
Peek-a-boo! Newman’s I see you.
I won I won I won. Jessie at Vegan Minded had a Newman’s Own giveaway and I was the lucky recipient of a TON of yummies.
The rest of the afternoon I spent racing around the apartment getting myself organized for my flight home.
Bars. Fruit. Tea bags. Starbucks VIA.
Newman’s Own Royal Tea.
Health is Wealth Vegan Chicken-free nuggets.
A corn/cucumber/pea salad (aka random scraps pulled together).
As you can see I was scrounging to find things to bring aboard with me…but I also wasn’t too worried since I was flying on Virgin. THE BEST AIRLINE EVER.
They have (free) vegan snacks aplenty, leg room like whoa, free WIFI, and sexy night club lighting.
So in addition to the above, I had hummus with veggies, crackers with Justin’s almond butter, Popchips, and a granola bar.
Which made the 7 hours “fly” by (pun intended).
Alright, that’s enough rambling about nothingness for the day. Tomorrow I’m going sledding with my sisters. Stay warm peeps!

Summary
(From the publisher):
Never had Eli Podgram expected to return to that dank, decaying castle in vampire-ridden Transylvania which held the dark secrets of his heritage. But the call came, a call from the simple and kindly people of his ancestral estates who had reared and protected him in his youth. It was their plea the Specialist could not ignore.
He could not know that the Twilight World had massed its powers to lure him back to the one place in the world where he was most vulnerable to their powers - the home of the werewolf, the vampire, the part-woman part-cat who was evil incarnate. All these were ready to meet and overpower Eli Podgram on his return home.
How was he to combat the last and most fiendish weapon of all? How could he conquer his own blood?

+1-415-299-2156Regulatory uncertainty, corruption and infrastructural deficiencies could cost Kenya billions of shillings in lost investment.
Chris Bredenhann, PwC Africa Oil & Gas Advisory Leader, believes that delays in passing the Mining Bill, and the resulting regulatory uncertainty, could force investors to put their money elsewhere on the continent.
He cited Nigeria's example where delays cost the country between $50 million (Sh4.4 billion) and $100 million (Sh8.8billion) in lost investment.
The news comes after a review on Africa's oil and gas industries published yesterday showed that key investors had delayed or cancelled projects elsewhere in Africa due to regulatory uncertainty or legislative delays.
In a phone interview on Wednesday, Bredenhann told the Star that delays increase the likelihood that exploration firms will target Kenya's competitors: "There is evidence in Africa that companies indicated they had plans to invest but went elsewhere".
"They cannot move forward with doubts, given the long-term nature of the needed investments," he added.
Oil was first discovered in January 2012, by Tullow Oil Plc, but 18 months later the legal framework is still at the debate stage in parliament. The first off-shore gas deposits were found last September.
Mary M'Mukindia, an industry expert, said in a phone interview yesterday that she believed delays and poor regulation could impact heavily on gas exploration.
"If there aren't rigorous structures in place, including pricing structures or formulas which relate to generating electricity from gas, then that will impact negatively."
"We [Kenya] are are also competing for investment dollars with other attractive locations."
On the subject of infrastructure she added: "Definitely infrastructure is an issue. Back in June one of the logistical companies made a plea to Minister Balala over a bridge that is in danger of collapsing.
"It led to the gas exploration areas, so it would shut down the industry! And that is just one little bridge."
The report adds pressure to Mining Minister Najib Balala, whose exclusive power to grant mineral rights contracts has this week been questioned by MPs.
Members are now planning to introduce amendments that would create a board to exercise some of those powers and check against abuse, a move that will further delay the bill's passing into law.
The review details that, in other countries, companies indicated that uncertain regulatory framework was a significant impediment to developing an oil and gas business.
Although Kenya's oil and gas industry is nascent, its challenges reflect those felt previously by organisations around the continent, with the top three issues of uncertain regulatory framework, corruption and poor physical infrastructure also identified as the biggest challenges facing Africa in 2010 and 2012.
The PwC report shows that despite issues, the oil and gas industry in East Africa continues to show substantial growth, with new hydrocarbon provinces developing at a significant pace.
Earlier this week analysts at Standard Bank reported that recent oil and gas discoveries have the potential to fundamentally transform Kenya's economy through investment in road, rail, power and industrial infrastructure.PlayStation Home: A Festivus for the rest of us!
If you’re a Home user in North America, you may have noticed the “Festive Pole” in the furniture store today, and your initial reaction was probably “WTF”.
What’s it all about? We’ll tell you, because it’s actually quite funny and disturbing.
After browsing through the Home forums today, it has become clear that many people have no clue what this is in reference to. So here’s a little story:
Back in 1997, there was an episode of Seinfield called “The Strike” that made the holiday of Festivus popular. For those that celebrate Christmas, a tree is usually put up and decorated. Well, for Festivus there is no tree and instead there is a an aluminum pole. Down with materialism and commercialism!
What’s so great about Festivus? Everything! During this glorious day you can take part in “The Airing of Grievances”. It’s exactly as it sounds. Still need an explanation? We’ll let Frank Costanza tell you then:
… at the Festivus dinner, you gather your family around, and tell them all the ways they have disappointed you over the past year!
After you’re done eating and all grievances have been aired out, the “Feats of Strength” will begin. Oh yes, the fun has only just begun. The head of the household needs to be wrestled and pinned down by the person chosen in order for the day to finish.
When doing some fact checking on the internet, it was revealed that people actually do celebrate Festivus. They even sell aluminum poles just for that day. Not only that, but there was a weirder version of it that actually existed before it was modified by a scriptwriter for Seinfield. There are even books about it! And here we thought it was all fun and games…
Chun-Li celebrates Festivus. Do you?
Festivus is celebrated on December 23rd, so don’t miss out! You can buy your Festivus pole in the furniture store in the Home Mall for $0.99. In an attempt to not completely waste your time, there are two free items in the furniture store as well. Enjoy!
Happy Festivus!About

Collections: MathematicsYesterday we brought you links to discussion in Parliament about disreputable oil company Trafigura’s legal shenanigans to prevent discussion of their activities on the Côte d’Ivoire.
Today here’s a little more, courtesy of Private Eye’s blog. Ian Hislop, the editor of the magazine, appeared with Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger at a select committee hearing discussing the damage injunctions can do to real, investigative journalism. An unedited verbatim transcript can be found here, with the juicy bits starting around Q850, about halfway down the very long page.
In it, Hislop talks candidly about a number of incidences where he has wanted to report but has been prevented from doing so by court action. Please don’t talk about them in the comments – our pockets are considerably less deep than those of Private Eye! Don’t mention Andrew Marr, either.

PreSaudi housing minister, Shuwaish Al-Duwaihi has said the ministry plans to set up a special company to boost its partnership with the private sector and also to be its executive arm, Saudi Gazette has reported. The ministry has recently launched two national programmes to organise the housing sector in the country, the first of which would determine Saudi families eligible for land and loans, while the second would organise housing rents with a view to keeping them low, the minister told an international symposium in Medellin, Colombia.

That's interesting, but more so is a comment that Brian left on another blog in response to a comment that that blogger, Kevin Gibbons, had left here.
Given the fact that 38cliches is sometimes judgmental and profane (indeed relentlessly so), I wouldn't expect Jerry or someone speaking for him to weigh in here, but you have to respect Brian's sentiment, expressed in the comment on the other blog:
Here's how Brian's message appeared.
A friend emailed me the website 38cliches.com and as i am reading through it i noticed a posting that you mentioned you miss hearing my father behind the microphone for the Red Sox. I would really like to thank you for the kind words, I ask my father from time to time what do you miss most about the job? "His reply, was the fans of Boston, thier passion for the game and for thier team." My dad never got to say goodbye to the fans of Boston. He wishes very much that he could. So from the Trupiano family, thank you kevin for your loyalty, and to the millions in Red Sox nation you will forever hold a place in our hearts.
Regards,
Brian Trupiano
Well done, sir.

Atari parent files for bankruptcy protection in French courts as dire financial situation is revealed
A.
Monday, January 21, 2013
Atari files for bankruptcy protection
Atari Inc has filed for bankruptcy protection today in an attempt to split itself from its loss making French parent company, Atari S.A.
Atari has struggled to be profitable for some time, selling off assets and focusing on low-cost online and mobile gaming - ditching big-budget titles such as the Test Drive franchise.
Whilst today's move in New York could be a positive development as Atari aims to protect its key interests and assets and start again with a clean slate, more worrying is the news that Atari could sell off key intellectual properties such as the rights to Pong and even to the use of the famous Fuji symbol itself , in an attempt to raise cash.
Is this a promising new start or is this just part of Atari's long and agonising death? Is it time for Atari's long-time fans to step in and start up a community effort to save the brand once and for all? Let us know on twitter, hashtag #SAVETHEBRAND .

Delicious! I used beef and 1 can chili beans/1 can spicy chili beans. It's a hit every time - and doesn't last long!!! Make double!
I love this chili, it's perfect as is. Put everything in my crock pot and let it cook for a couple hours and it came out delicious!!
The only change I made was using 1 lb ground turkey and 1 lb ground beef.
I did have to add about 1 cup extra water during the cooking process (crock pot), but this recipe is really good. I enjoyed that it was a little bit different from the normal chili that I make. The chili powder gives it just the right amount of kick! And if you're like me, I add some cheese and sour cream on top to give it a little cooling sensation. I will definitely make this one again. Thanks for sharing!
This is the second time I've made this chilli for my family. I added a bit of garlic, chushed chilli and some pickled jalepenos for a kick.
The family loved it, and said it's better than beef chilli.
This is a keeper recipe.
I made a vegetarian version of this everyone loved it. I changed the recipe a little to add some brown rice.

m^2 -9/2m = 3/2.
m^2 -9/2m + (9/4)^2 = 3/2 + (9/4)^2
m^2 - 9/2m +(9/4)^2 = 24/16 + 81/16
m^2 -9/2m + (9/4)^2 = 105/16
(m - 9/4)^2 = 105/16
Take sqrt of both sides:
m - 9/4 = (sqrt105)/4
m = 9/4 + (sqrt105)/4 = (9 +- sqrt105)/4

of the time. Be that as it may, we talked over the fence the other day and I told him:
"Had a dog once. Convoluted pedigree. So many breeds stirred up in him it was genetic polygamy. OK, he was a mutt.
Neighbors thought the dog was undocumented too, but I had papers from the dog pound.
Thing about that dog was it stuttered real bad. Could never understand what the dog was trying to bark. Kinda drove me nuts if you get the picture.
I mean, come on, what the hell does a bark of: "Ba-ba-ba-ba-borp" and a tail wag mean anyway?
Only saving grace of the dog was that it didn't drool when stuttering. But you know? I thought that dog was brain damaged.
Was always wacking itself up the side of his snoot with his front paws. A real goofy mutt!
Well, I decided to see if I could help that dang dog. Found a woman in the ads that said she could help.
Went to see her and took the dog so she could look him over. She didn't charge for doing that and I wasn't out anything. I mean, what the hell, right?
Anyway, it would cost a grand to help the dog. Hell, my wages were cut twelve years ago and I been making the same since. Bet you are too.
So, I told her I couldn't afford it and I said she could have the dog. At least it was out of my hair and I didn't have to feed it, so that saved me some money. You know?
About two months before I moved in next to you, I got word that the dog was cured. Made me happy for a minute or two.
She not only cured him of stuttering, but that dog could speak perfect English. No wonder the damn dog kept paw-slapping his head. I couldn't understand him because he stuttered and he could actually speak like us.
Woman mated him with a female she had helped earlier that spoke perfect Spanish. When the pups arrived, they were bi-lingual.
She made a fortune off those puppies. I gave away the proverbial goose that lays the golden egg.
That's what I learned."Sale Distressed White and Teal Lantern Item #: 128163 $39.99 $22.47 Temporary Sale Qty: Sorry, this item is currently unavailable online.

I'm looking for info on Henrietta Corey, who married Henry Beckwith, likely in the mid 1800's, in southeastern Connecticut.I know of one daughter, Minnie (Mary) E. Beckwith, born in 1895 approx., born in Voluntown, Connecticut.
Minnie is my wifes grandmother.

He also sends Othello to Cyprus to command the island’s defense against the Turks.
Brabantio: Desdemona’s father and probably a racist, Brabantio objects to his daughter’s marriage to Othello because of his race and his lower social position. In Brabantio’s eyes, eligible suitors for Desdemona would probably have been limited to sons of no more than fifty families of the Venetian aristocracy.
Gratiano: A noble Venetian, Gratiano is a brother of Brabantio.
Lodovico: Another noble Venetian, Lodovico is a kinsman to Brabantio.
Othello: A Christian Moor who is fighting as a hired general for the city of Venice, Othello is noble, proud, and ultimately jealous. By secretly marrying Desdemona, he incurs the wrath of her father—which is soothed somewhat when the duke rules in Othello’s favor. However, when he incurs the wrath of Iago, partly because he passed over him in granting promotions and partly because of Iago’s dark nature, his life begins to come apart. He eventually murders his wife and kills himself, all because of Iago’s misinformation and that “green-eyed monster,” jealousy.
Cassio: Othello’s lieutenant, Cassio was promoted to that position even though Iago had coveted it for some time. Thus, he becomes one of Iago’s many enemies and dupes; and Iago convinces Othello that Cassio is Desdemona’s lover.. He is a master at manipulating appearances so that they seem real, and everyone about him accepts him as the standard of sanity and blunt common sense, as “honest Iago.” He is usually considered Shakespeare’s most genuine villain.
Roderigo: Desdemona’s rejected suitor, Roderigo becomes one of Iago’s dupes as he works his treachery.
Montano: The governor of Cyprus, Montano is a trusted and valiant servant of the duke of Venice.
Clown: A servant of Othello
Desdemona: The “gentle” daughter of Brabantio and the “true and loving” wife of Othello, Desdemona represents the ideal of womanhood. She is captivated by Othello’s strength and charm and secretly marries him, only to be trapped in Iago’s web of deceit and murdered by her misled husband.
Emilia: The wife of Iago and the personal maid of Desdemona, Emilia is also unwittingly manipulated by Iago to bring about his villainy.
Bianca: Cassio’s mistress- US $100 - 1700 / Piece10 Piece/Pieces

But this latest closure is only temporary. A few weeks after the Wisconsin Department of Transportation shut down the exit ramps to 794, crews will close the entrance ramps.
The I-794 westbound ramp from Lincoln Memorial Drive will close for about a week. Drivers are encouraged to use Clybourn Street to the Jackson Street westbound entrance ramp.
The 794 East exit to Lincoln Memorial Drive will be closed until 2015. The Southbound entrance to 794 will also be shut down. The decking on the Hoan Bridge will be replaced and other repairs made. Some drivers are already making others plans to get around.
The DOT hopes to prevent bottle necks with new technology. They plan on using a machine that will lay down movable barriers, and can be re-arranged to open or close more lanes.
Find more information on the closures here.

But Garden Party isn't Shaw's first role as a seductive beauty. That role could arguably be her turn in Ladybugs, but we'll go with the less-jailbaity answer of Shaw's turn as the alluring prostitute, Domino, in Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut. You may also remember her from 2006's The Hills Have Eyes, where she played the pregnant Lynn Carter, the unfortunate object of a lecherous mutant's affection.
Aside from playing sexpot realtors and mutant jailbait, Shaw has had a fairly extensive acting career. The daughter of actress Susan Damante-Shaw, Shaw's first role was in the 1981 slasher, Home Sweet Home, when she was just seven years old.
Shaw's career continued to flourish, with appearances in 1993's Hocus Pocus, 1999's Wayward Son, 2002's 40 Days and 40 Nights and Woody Allen's Melinda and Melinda in 2005. Some of Shaw's more recent appearances have included 3:10 to Yuma, and the compelling war drama, Badland.
What's next for Vinessa Shaw? Well, in addition to Garden Party, Shaw is slated to appear in two other films released this year—a romance-drama starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Joaquin Phoenix called Two Lovers, and a horror film that takes place entirely in the subways of New York called Stag Night.

stage 4 reanal failure
I have had renal failure for a couple of years but was in denial for one of them. I wish I hadn't been and had started dialysis sooner. I have now been on dialysis for about a year. At first it was ok, but about 5 months into it I stopped urinating which brought on alot more problems like retaining fluids in my legs and feet. By the end of the day they hurt so bad that the only thing that will help them is to go to bed. I still have a catheter in my chest because my veins will not support anything in my arms. I have just started the transplant procedure and I am hoping and praying for a donor. I do have siblings that are willing to test. This can't come soon enough because I do not fair well in dialysis.....

Re: stage 4 reanal failure
Hi and welcome. I was in the same boat as you. I didn't start dialysis soon enough, had a neck line, and didn't fare well on hemo. Have you thought about peritoneal dialysis? It is much easier on your body. It would involve a small surgery for the catheter to be inserted, but it's not a big deal.
I was on hemo for 1 year and my cousin gave me a kidney (on her birthday if you can believe it). I am now almost 9 years post transplant and am doing well. Feel free to ask lots of questions. There is good support here.

[QUOTE=Jrobaby;4842176.[/QUOTE]
Hope I am not too late
Stage 5 is the most critical stage.
You have to identify the cause of disorder whether it is chronic or acute.
Better get your dad confined in the hospital..
If it is acute, there is still hope for full recovery...check if the kidneys shrunk ..do a full abdominal test if you still have time..
To reverse the failing kidneys, your doctor may first use steroid transfusion
and inject diuretics to help release some water...Hemodialysis is next...
If you perform dialisys before taking steroids, there is a possibility that your creatinine level and Blood nitrogen urea(BUN) may go up!
If it is chronic...your best option would be stem cell and kidney transplant.
Hope the information is helpful.
Good luck to you dad

For the mean time, try to keep his BP within 125/80
If I am not mistaken, there is currently no cure for PKD.
So it waiting is not a very good option.

Hi,
Just make sure to keep his bp within 125/80 or lower.
I am very sorry to hear about the PKD...sounds really bad.
There is no real cure for it yet...not now..
I guess its the only way to go is kidney transplant.

Re: stage 4 reanal failure
Hi, We are very experienced in the PKD lifestyle, but thank you for your thoughts :-) He has his own kidney specialist that keeps tabs on him and his blood is drawn every 3 weeks for monitoring. He also just got a fistula which will be used when he has to start dialysis. He has been on every blood pressure medicine there is and nothing wants to do the job like minoxidil does, which is fine with him since it makes his hair grow haha! You are correct, there is no cure. Waiting for a donor kidney is the only option now.

Re: stage 4 reanal failure
Hi jrobaby,
Don't worry, kidney transplant is quite safe and common nowadays.
You shouldn't worry too much...if you or your dad wants to have a transplant soon, maybe you can try other countries.
I heard that China's kidney transplant wait time is just two weeks.
Costs are lower as compared to the US.
Looking forward to your dad's speedy recovery.

What did I do wrong? It took forever for the syrup to get to 220 degrees and so much seemed to boil away by the time it got there. It was almost like a thick caramel sauce by the time I was finished. Have not tried any yet, and I think the idea of it is a 4, but I doubt if my batch is going to be. Any suggestions would be greatly appreiated.
Definitely a keeper recipe from this reviewer too - I have already made two batches (and yes, it is worth the investment) and will give these jars out for Christmas gifts this year. I love that another reviewer did not peel their nectarines as this is the most obnoxious part of the recipe. I might have to try just using one box of pectin, as the leftover and added cost is a small deterrent. Overall, an amazing recipe.
Wow! This is a keeper. We used nectarines from our tree, followed the instructions exactly except we didn't peel the fruit, the skin was fine and we think added some extra beautiful color. I used the entire box of low sugar pectin, 1.75 oz, and it worked out fine. A keeper, we'll making this all summer!
Have already made this twice. Perfect accompaniment for a cheese course at the end of the meal.
I used peaches instead of nectarines, but it turned out ok; instead of 7-8 jars, I had 5. It's still good, just didn't have as much as I expected. Also couldn't find "lower sugar" pectin, so used the kind that's ok for use with or without sugar, but followed the rcipe otherwise.Defense Inventory:
Several Actions Are Needed to Further DLA's Efforts to Mitigate Shortages of Critical Parts

DOD's management, funding, and reporting of spending for spare parts programs have been a focus of GAO high risk reports for over a decade. They noted that spare parts shortages adversely affect military operations and readiness. Despite funding of about $1.9 billion over fiscal years 1999-2002 to increase availability of spare parts, managing to mitigate shortages still challenges the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). GAO examined if (1) DLA's strategic planning addresses mitigating critical spare parts shortages that affect readiness, (2) strategic initiatives will likely mitigate these shortages, (3) a DOD-directed initiative has improved availability of critical aviation parts, and (4) DLA can identify the impact of added investment on parts availability.
DLA's Strategic Management System, meant to transform its 2002-2007 logistics operations, addresses the mitigation of readiness-affecting shortages of critical spare parts. The system includes a strategic plan with goals, strategies, and objectives; a balanced scorecard to monitor progress; and a business plan that contains 97 initiatives. Of these initiatives, DLA identified 24 as linked to spare parts shortages. The DLA strategic system incorporates attributes of strategic planning outlined in the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993. The 24 initiatives, if fully implemented, could help mitigate critical spare parts shortages and improve supply readiness because, in part, they address causes for the shortages. Of the 24 DLA-identified initiatives, 18 should improve availability of parts identified by the services as critical to readiness; and 6 should indirectly improve parts availability through modernized logistics systems and business processes. A $500-million DOD-directed aviation investment initiative, not part of DLA's strategic system, increased critical parts availability and likely supply readiness. It improved the aggregate, or total average, availability of three critical groups of DLA-managed parts in the first 3 fiscal years--2000-2002--of the 4-year initiative. However, DLA's aggregate 85-percent goal does not clearly reveal that many parts are still far below 85 percent. For example, at the end of fiscal year 2002, of the 10,291 critical aviation parts selected for investment, about 4,900 met or exceeded the aggregate measure, but over 5,400 did not. Of these, about 2,900 parts were available under 35 percent of the time. A DOD regulation, since revised to allow waivers, caused 3,342 parts to be below the 85-percent availability goal. DLA can estimate the impact of increased funding on supply availability. Investment costs, however, will be significant--DLA estimated $748 million to obtain an 85-percent minimum availability of the 219,071 most critical parts. Also, necessary inventory levels may take years to build, and increases in unit readiness are not assured because supply is only one readiness factor.
Recommendations for Executive Action
Status: Closed - Implemented
Comments: DOD acknowledged that it will submit waivers as appropriate. DOD 4140.1R, dated May 2003, gives the DLA authority to waive the lead time in cases where creditable evidence exists.
Recommendation: To improve the supply availability of critical readiness degrading spare parts that may improve the overall readiness posture of the military services, the Secretary of Defense should direct the Director of the Defense Logistics Agency to submit, as appropriate, requests for waiver(s) of the provisions of the DOD Supply Chain Materiel Management Regulation 4140.1-R that limit the safety level of supply parts to specific demand levels. Such waivers would allow DLA to buy sufficient critical spare parts that affect readiness of service weapon systems to attain an 85-percent minimum availability goal.
Agency Affected: Department of Defense
Status: Closed - Not Implemented
Comments: DOD agreed with the intent of the recommendation, but not the prescribed action. DODIG has closed the recommendation based on its proposal to link item availability to desired readiness levels instead of adopting an 85 percent minimum goal for critical items.
Recommendation: To improve the supply availability of critical readiness degrading spare parts that may improve the overall readiness posture of the military services, the Secretary of Defense should direct the Director of the Defense Logistics Agency to change the agency's current aggregate 85-percent supply availability goal for critical spare parts that affect readiness, to a minimum 85-percent supply availability goal for each critical spare part, and because of the long lead times in acquiring certain critical parts, establish annual performance targets for achieving the 85-percent minimum goal.
Agency Affected: Department of Defense
Status: Closed - Not Implemented
Comments: DODIG has closed this recommendation because DOD's proposed action is to fund according to agreed priorities for item availability and desired readiness levels. DOD will not be replacing the aggregate 85-percent supply availability goal with an 85-percent minimum goal.
Recommendation: To improve the supply availability of critical readiness degrading spare parts that may improve the overall readiness posture of the military services, the Secretary of Defense should direct the Director of the Defense Logistics Agency to prioritize funding as necessary to achieve the annual performance targets and ultimately the 85-percent minimum supply availability goal.I live in a house that was built in the mid 60s. The exterior wall of the garage leaks between the slab and the bricks that is the exterior wall. I dug it up put tar and plastic over the tar and perforated pipe to drain the water it still leaks. I think the mortar might be breaking down. What I was thinking is pouring a small knee wall about 1' X 3" wide then tar and plastic sheeting. Will that fix it ? Or is there a better way of doing this?Book your room at Hotel Esperanto

The experimental investigation reported by Nachef et al. (see preceding abstract) represents a good opportunity to assert the validity of the transformed beam equation and its numerical implementation [Naze Tj(slashed oh)tta et al., J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 88, 2859--2870 (1990)], and their usefulness to simulate highly intense sound beams. Comparison between theoretical and experimental results shows that in spite of the fact that it does not account for higher-order nonlinear effects, the model reveals a remarkable ability to accurately simulate the fine structure of the sound field, at any range and level of excitation under consideration. The present theoretical investigation confirms the nonlinearly induced shift in the near-field structure of the beam (defocusing) experimentally discovered by Nachef et al. [Work supported by The Norwegian Research Council for Science and Humanities (NAVF), and Fondation Scientifique de Lyon et du Sud-Est, France.]LAS VEGAS (JTA) — The recently released study of the impact of Birthright Israel trips should be very welcome news for the Jewish people.
Ever since the release of the 1990 National Jewish Population Survey, experts have been seeking ways to maximize Jewish continuity. Quite simply, this new study, conducted by Brandeis University’s Cohen Center for Modern Jewish Studies, shows that the Birthright Israel program represents a truly effective way to change the course of Jewish history.
Now that we have this research, increasing the number of Birthright Israel participants should become a top priority of Jewish philanthropy.
We cannot take credit for coming up with the idea for Birthright Israel, which offers a free 10-day trip to Israel for Jews ages 18 to 26; that distinction goes to Michael Steinhardt and Charles Bronfman. Despite opposition from many skeptics, these visionary philanthropists persisted in making their creative idea a reality starting in 2000.
When we were approached to support Birthright Israel at the end of 2006, it appeared to us to be a transformative program based on the anecdotal evidence we heard.
Now there is research that validates our impression: The Birthright Israel experience significantly increases participants’ connections to Israel and the Jewish people, rates of in-marriage and the value placed on raising Jewish children, among other desirable outcomes.
In the past three years, our family has been privileged to help Birthright Israel demonstrate the scalability of this remarkable program by committing more than $90 million to increase the number of participants.
Last year more than 40,000 young adults went on Birthright Israel trips. If the program can achieve that rate for several years, we will come close to reaching a majority of young Jews.
This becomes a real tipping point that can transform an entire generation. With so many demographic and geopolitical forces arrayed against our people and the Jewish state, increasing the number of Birthright Israel participants should be a no-brainer.
By no means are we understating the importance of other formal and informal means of promoting Jewish continuity. But in Birthright Israel we have a proven product that can be targeted at young adults who are the least affiliated with our community and constitute a rapidly growing segment of the Jewish population. Birthright Israel can provide effective “booster shots” for Jewish continuity for less than $3,000 per person.
Maintaining a level of 40,000 participants per year will be an enormous challenge. It means a budget of more than $100 million per year. To date, the program has benefited from very generous support from the government of Israel, and we hope that support will continue to grow.
The benefits to Israel are clear — most of the Birthright Israel dollars are spent there. Even more important, however, is a strengthening of Israel’s base of support in the Diaspora, not to mention the Birthright alumni who make aliyah.
Federations, foundations and individual philanthropists also have played an important role in the program’s growth, but it is time to significantly expand the number of players and ramp up the level of support.
The recently released study confirms the tremendous potential of Birthright Israel as a proven and simple way to use our charitable dollars to strengthen the Jewish people and the Jewish state.
We hope you will join us by putting this extraordinary program at the top of your charitable list, and together we can literally change the course of Jewish history.

Hope in the Struggle
Welcome to New City Counseling. Like all of us, your story is likely one of struggling to live faithfully and honestly in a world full of brokenness and beauty. We are honored to walk with you, hoping with you for renewal and restoration.They Are Physically RealWell let me start by saying, for those people keep B Sing other werewolves (which i highly respect to those who are and which i am one) to leave the group if you are doing that. . Now let me introduce myself (i will not give my real name) i am TheBloodWolf( my wolf pack sisters call me Dante). I have been doing studies on the werewolf species for some time now. i'm 14 in eighth grade and in a band called Tragedy. im one of the guitarist of the band. i'm in a wolf pack with other werewolves that a couple of years older than me. The alpha of the pack doesn't know anything about the werewolf species. (im the only male in the pack). i think i should be the alpha for our pack and vote her out.
i apologize for the original content that was was here i did even further research and there is an actual physical transformation. there was a video i just watched that i believe happened in Portugal where a man had video taped a wolf-man type creature.
for those who are a brother/sister of the wolf bands out there, i just want to say thanks for reading this
Trust me when I say don't mess with a female alpha they tend to be much less forgiving
I think you are off to a good start but you have a loooooong way to go. I do like your manners though.
thank you very much
I find it silly that people make more of a connection with your age, an irrelevant number, than with your words...
I understand that you are young, but me personally, I always feel the need to doubt people who would judge someone simply by age...like I said it is rather irrelevant, a measurement of personal time and nothing more... age does not equal wisdom or intelligence...intelligence and wisdom relating to age makes about as much sense as Obama being related to martians...
Good luck with your learning, your best bet is to learn from others of your kind, while I get that it is hard since they are too busy judging you by your age, there are some who may be willing to help you learn.
Because it's like listening to a 13 year old kid talk about what it's like to support themselves. I'm mot saying it doesn't happen just that it is extremely unlikely and a hard thing to accept.
i hope to learn more. thanks
"extremely unlikely" about as unlikely as breathing sheangel...
Intelligent children are not hard to come by, adults do not suddenly become smart or wise because they are older, nor does our age mean we have experienced more. For one thing don't read it, and then you will not feel the need to comment, simply look at the persons age and continue on if you are so offended. Theoretically since you are older than I based on what this site says...you should already know these things, which only further proves my point. Another thing...is that not what this site is for? "supporting themselves", in a way it's like your saying "No you cannot love yourself! You must only show hate unto yourself!"
how about constructive critisism instead? Explain to them what you feel they do not know, so that they may learn. Teach, a person can not gain knowledge if the knowledge cannot be found.
Otherwise you only bring yourself below the person you are directing your derogatory, spiteful, cruel and/or hateful words towards....that is not what the youth should learn to do...unless we simply want civilized societies to grow less and less intelligent on average over the course of centuries...instead of the opposite.
Since I am out and about I will answer further on this later. But for now.....a light hand is the problem with today's youth. Everyone is soooo sensitive and overreact. Like you are doing right now. And fyi.....I did teach. For little over five years thank you very much.
Oh and since you horribly misunderstood in your desire to scold me....support as in living on their own and caring for themselves, truly independent. Has nothing to do with loving oneself. If you wish to try and go toe to toe with me then by all means.
sensitive?overreact?me?your freaking hilarious...I agree a light hand is a huge problem with todays youth, along with the lack of the willingness to teach. I don't think you get what I mean about teaching...I don't mean as a job, I mean anytime you encounter a younger person making a mistake. Hell why not just anybody making a mistake, fix it now or it WILL happen again with the same person.
I see I missunderstood your support, regardless there are children that can and do support themselves as you say.
so you answer a couple of things and think you've outdone me? How silly, its not going toe to toe when your far over the head of the other. How about instead of trying to compete, you simply take my advice to help instead of berrate? I was not trying to outdo you, or make you look bad (you've done that plenty well yourself mind you.), I was simply asking you to be the adult, not the teenage kid who feels the need for a rude attitude because of your belief in superiority. We are a civilized society, not barbarians. While strict discipline is a requirement for intelligence, teaching, and learning all the same, ignorance is not.
Yes but you can't help those who refuse to learn. I can correct all day long but it makes no difference when they dont listen. And I'm sorry hun but you thinking your superior is the joke since legitimate debate is beyond you. I would also like to point out I didn't say there weren't kids that support themselves. I said it was extremely rare. Some how doesn't seem I'm the one making an *** out of themselves....
To jump on someones tail before attemting to help doesn't help anyways, you can't tell when someone is refusing to learn when you instantly snap at them.
Me thinking I am superior? pffft I know I am superior!
I was more rephrasing the statement than arguing whether you stated how rare it was or wasn't, notice the "as you say"?
I am not the one angry at someone else due to their age, so yeah it's kinda you making the *** of yourself...not that I was originally implying that anyways, but hey thanks for bringing that up.
So if I can't bring a legitimate debate...what does this say about you? You seemingly refuse to read anything other than what you want me to say, adding and changing as you please. You bring out sides of an argument that are agreed upon as if we still argued over them. If that is how you debate than maybe me joking about superiority (stemming from your acting superior mind you. Not a good factor in any debate.) might be more of a fact than a joke.
Once again my whole point was simply to explain explaining before biting. (I am having fun with these werewolf puns...It really was not originally intended but due to my manner of typing they did appear)
Actually I'm not getting too detailed because this keeps getting bought up while I'm occupied with more important things. I.e. I was on a date last night and at work tonight.
not getting too detailed...when your adding new chains to the argument...cool...not sure what you mean by bought up, unless your trying to say your trolling or something like that...but that doesn't matter to me anyways...(I like trolls...they argue...alot...I...like....arguing...funfunfun.)
I hope your date went well btw, but no worries, I've never been keen on peoples love lives so I won't pry. What's your job?
Great date and I'm a press operator in a factory and a mma coach
Really? That's pretty neat, I never would have guessed mma coach, I got the feeling you were a hands on working type, but never would have guessed mma coach. How much does one make coaching mixed martial arts? If you don't mind me asking.
I volunteer. Actually I've had a wide spectrum of jobs. Everything from web design to detention officer to tattoo artist, freelance writing, office worker and bookkeeperand yes I taught metaphysics and such to young wolves and others for a number of years. Not everything I do is hands on.
That is cool too, free lessons are the best lessons.I am not an artist, tattooing is something I probably wont ever do. Other than that and the detention officer I have done those things too. Wasn't trying to imply that you were some kind of brute or something, I was just meaning that I get the feeling that you tend to enjoy more physical activities than other people, not afraid to get dirty maybe is a good way to put it? yes?no?yes? well I will just leave it at that, take it as you will!
I myself hate the idea of an office job, much less actually doing any office work. I am writing a book but that is very different and so much more fun.
Thats also the only draw back for what I am in college for, I am going to be CSI...meaning I have to do paperwork. Had I not severly injured my shoulder I would be happily living out my days as a borin' ol cop (which wouldn't be boring to me!!).
Thank you :D I am not just a cleaver, but a butcher too. >_< okay that play off your cleaver/clever mispell just was too cheasy...I apologize.
I also apologize to whomever you may have been refering to if you were not calling me clever. (Don't wan't to take someone elses credit)
hey if you want i wil delete my article and we can forget all that was on here. and i will also delete the other one.
I thought wolves were peaceful creature we arent being peaceful maybe he is real maybe hes not but we cant judge like this and if we keep on like this we arent wolves were the horrible creatures hollywood makes us out to be
hollywood is out to us look bad. we are a peaceful race of beings. i just decide to only show my true self to those i trust. i really do hate the alpha of my pack, same with the rest of the people in my pack. so sorry if i said anything bad that offended you killer123456
not you the ppl that are saying crap about you
there i re-wrote my article. i hope its better than the original.
hey we are all brethren here no need to diss anyone.we are all trying to help eachother out. i know alot about our species. just give me credit for doing this.
Then humor me. Show me what you know. I'm having a very low tolerance for young ones this week. Thank some of the children here for that.
so are you saying i did an ok job for this article? cause if you are thanks, at least i know im not alone here
i know how you feel about low tolerance of the young ones. i have two little sisters who im always annoyed at
This is crap your just a pup and in no position to teach or lead anything. to..

Visit DogsterSo the two best teams -- Scotch Plains-Fanwood (12-2-2) and Westfield (12-2-1) -- advanced to the championship game of the Union County Tournament. It was semifinal twinbill worth savoring.
In the first game of Sunday's UCT action at Kean University in Union, Scotch Plains registered a decisive 3-0 victory over Gov. Livingston (11-3-1). With the 2-2 tie between these teams last month a memory -- and GL looking for revenge after a 2-0 defeat Oct. 17 -- it became apparent rather quickly that Scotch Plains has too many weapons, at least for Gov. Livingston.
Gov. Livingston is a very good side. Coach Mike Roof's team has weapons -- Jessica Jankowski and Jenn French, to name a couple, are extremely skillful -- but there weren't enough Jankowskis and Frenchs on the field for GL to stop Scotch Plains, which has a wealth of skill players coming off the bench to wear down the opposition.
One of those bench players is unheralded sophomore Katie Harper, who made the biggest impact. She scored twice in a three-minute span to give Scotch Plains a 2-0 lead with 12 minutes left in the first half.
The moment was not lost on junior Christy Monroy, who is 2-for-3 in UCT finals for her career, including last year's 2-0 victory over Westfield. Harper was on the JV team last season.
``This is great because we're in the final again and we have a lot of new players this year,'' Monroy said. ``We want them to experience everything we've done.''
In the second game, it couldn't get any weirder.
First, a ball shot by Summit's Kate Martino zipped right through Westfield keeper Sophia Devita's hands. I give all the credit in the world to Martino, who put some mustard on her shot in the 31st minute. But I've seen Devita play five times this season, and I'm telling you the girl just does not let that happen. Credit Devita for keeping her head.
``After you make a mistake, you just have to let it go,'' Devita said. ``I didn't think about it for very long at all.''
Westfield evened the score in the 46th minute when Summit defender Anna Johnson pounded a ball in the box with the purpose of sending it into Kenilworth. The only problem was that Westfield's Sarah Freer was standing in the way, but looking upfield, so Johnson's shot bounded off Freer's backside and into the net, past a shocked Jackie Zalis, tending goal for Summit (8-5-3).
With each team receiving a fluke goal, it was time to start from scratch.
Actually, Westfield's fluke goal was a partial product of putting lots more pressure on the Summit D in the second half -- Summit spent hardly any time in its offensive third -- and that pressure eventually produced the game-winner, a blistering eight-yarder which senior back Mercedes Smith sent into the net just below the crossbar.
Heckuva shot, except that Summit coach Mike Poller wanted the goal disallowed because he saw an offside penalty.
``It's a tough way to lose. She was in the penalty box and we all stepped out,'' Poller said. ``That said, that's the difference between a Group 4 school with so much depth and a Group 2 school with not so much depth.''
Summit may not have as much depth, but Smith had nothing but good things to say about her opponent. Westfield won the first matchup, 3-0, on Sept. 20, and these teams tied, 1-1 on Oct. 18.
``They are a really good team, and I think this one could have gone either way,'' she said. ``They played us hard in both games before today, and this one was extremely tough.''
There's lots to talk about for the final between the two county titans, but I'll save that for later in the week. Good luck to Gov. Livingston and Summit in their respective sectional tournaments, and I'll see you on Saturday at 7:30 p.m. at Kean for the 31st UCT final. Thanks for watching.It’s that time of the year when cabin fever has gotten the best of you. You are ready to get away and relax. It’s never too late to plan for an escape from the hustle and bustle of life. With so many effective ways to save for your family vacation, there is no better time than now. When you spend 40 hours a week slaving on your job, you deserve to have some time to get away from the rat race, relax and enjoy your family. Unless you’re independently wealthy, you’ll need a plan for saving up the money you need for this getaway. While this may seem like a simple proposition, some people find it difficult to lay aside some money each pay period. In reality, it can be somewhat difficult. The key to success is discipline. Below are 4 tips to help start you on your mission. If you are serious about making this happen, you can do it.
Tip #1 Open up a separate savings account specifically meant for your vacation money. If your employer offers direct deposit, you can usually specify a certain amount of money to be put into this account. Some banks will schedule an automatic direct transfer to your savings account if you don’t have direct deposit or if you are not able to deposit money into two separate accounts. Examine the amount of money your family spends weekly or monthly on family entertainment and fast food restaurants. Then reduce that amount, storing the remainder away for your trip. So that a pending vacation doesn't become a joy-buster, shop around for freebie and reduced-cost entertainment options to enjoy during the months before you depart on your excursion.
Tip # 2 Save your change, even the pennies. When you use cash, resolve to only use paper money. Then take the change you receive and put it aside at the end of every day. You’ll be surprised at how quickly it can build up. One family reported that they kept a vacation jar in a convenient place and each family member would deposit change and the occasional dollar bill into it. When they emptied the jar and had it counted, they had managed to save $5,000. It was enough for them to enjoy a tropical getaway to Grand Cayman Island! Wow!! Determination pays off!! While you may not have that much in your change jar, emptying it at vacation time can mean extra spending money or that little boost you need to go on your dream vacation.
Tip #3 Involve your kids in the adventures of saving. This is a great time to teach the valuable lessons of saving and budgeting money. Share with them that conserving money on one day allows them to go to a water park on another day. Be creative and convincing!! To save money, advise them that you will be conserving cost until that time. This involves the whole family and no one will feel slighted by this decision. The kids will feel proud that they are working to achieve a goal and feel important. It will also minimize potential arguments.
Tip #4 Open a separate account for your vacation savings. By keeping vacation money separate from everyday expenses, it allows you to focus on your optimal goal, a vacation. Robbing Peter to pay Paul can cause unnecessary stress. It also takes away from the enjoyment of a great time. A good point to keep in mind when determining how much you can afford to spend on a vacation is to be sure that you consider other periodic expenses that may be waiting for you when you return, such as back-to-school costs, holiday expenses and next year’s taxes.
This will keep you in perspective as to what you can afford and allow you to be prepared for the unexpected.
Plan, get ready, get set, be on your way to a well needed family good time!! Check out my book, “The Master Tip Manual for Personal Success” @.

Who wouldn't be on a Satanist's speed dial: Elmer Fudd, Bugs Bunny or Judge Dredd?
Who wouldn't be on a Satanist's speed dial: Elmer Fudd, Bugs Bunny or Judge Dredd?
by Umberto Ray Published
Visitors to The Church Of Satan website are often bewildered when confronted by an image of Anton LaVey fronting a group of black-robed Satanic ritual participants, their faces concealed by the donning of animal masks. When juxtaposed with the pragmatic philosophy that Satanism is purported to be founded on, the question that the curious are prompted to ask is: “well, if you don’t believe in the Devil, why all the demonic imagery?”
The image in the aforementioned example depicts a ritual outlined in The Satanic Rituals known as Das Tierdrama. The rite was originally performed by The Order Of The Illuminati founded in 1776 by Adam Weishaupt, and the purpose of the ritual is for its participants to willingly assume the animalistic attributes of purity, honesty and increased sensory perception. If you are wondering what possible advantage the assuming of such attributes might offer someone, well... you try creeping up on a sleeping lion. Think of it as a sharpening of the acumen.
In his book The Satanic Scriptures, High Priest Peter H. Gilmore stipulates that there is no requirement for anyone to believe that ritual operates as anything other than self-therapy. Although these rituals are orchestrated as what we term to be a “Psycho-drama”, Gilmore adds that it is through personal practice and verification that one may discover that they also effect some very real results in accordance with one’s will.
The fact is that the nature of how ritual works with its multitude of theories and possibilities would be far too broad a spectrum to be explored with sufficient depth in the space afforded me here. Suffice to say, I can briefly encapsulate it thusly – our desires and emotions, even the human psyche itself, exist without quantifiable form. It is through symbolism that such concepts are afforded the substance required to help bolster the will, offering it direction through increased focus. In Man And His Symbols, Carl Jung posits that “because there are innumerable things beyond the range of human understanding, we constantly use symbolic terms to represent concepts that we cannot define or fully comprehend. This is one reason why all religions employ symbolic language.”
The difference in the Satanic credo here is that our own use of such symbols is a method by which we focus the carnal human will rather than entrusting the fruition of our desires to the auspices of some intangible deity. It is here where the distinction can be made that; although, we do indeed employ what some have seen as demonic imagery it is still administered with a more pragmatically orientated rationale than it might first appear.
To end on a lighter note it should be added that the ceremonies and practices outlined in both The Satanic Bible and The Satanic Rituals are standardised guidelines which will set the able practitioner on the road of his own personal discovery where only the limitless parameters of the imagination are the final arbiter of what he might achieve. One thing is certain – it is not at all about doom and gloom. Above all, Satanism is fun! Anton LaVey once said “a Satanist without a sense of humour would be intolerable”. With this in mind it is easier to understand why and how the black magician is just as likely to symbolically summon the aid of Bugs Bunny as a trickster as he is to Loki. Or Judge Dredd as a metre of justice as to Satan himself, though I doubt you’d find many a Satanist summoning the help of the hapless and so easily hoodwinked Elmer Fudd.
In closing I hope I have addressed, and at least with a little humour, the charges some people level against us that our rituals are based on some reverse Christian ideology.szise mentioned another new proxy script a few days ago, phpMyProxy.

When Private Manookian entered his office, McClellan, aged 43,-paneled design of graphics and historical vignettes. Around the same time, he painted an oil portrait of McClellan's young son Donald (now lost) and sketched an ink portrait of McClellan from a photo.

Around this same time, Manookian met Cyril Lemmon, a young architect who was dabbling in painting. They began to paint together, and by late 1930 Arman was living downstairs in Lemmon's Black Point home. Anne Simms Stubenberg, the daughter of next door neighbor Arthur Simms, still remembers taking an art lesson from Manookian as a seven year old. He patiently spent hours assisting her with a painting of a red blossomed tree, and gave her a tin painting box. He also, on another occasion, picked her up by the hair, something that even a child could understand as a hint that something was wrong with the artist.
The Lemmon's living room was filled with paintings, salon style, including a Diego Rivera. At Black Point, in the last months of his life, Manookian was experimenting with a more modern style of painting, adding hints of cubist distortion borrowed from Rivera. It didn't always go well, and he apparently destroyed a number of his own artworks along the way. A meticulous artist, he still planned each work on a grid, but he was blending his paint more, softening colors, and attempting to emulate the greater distortions of Modernism. He also attempted, in a 1930 painting of a woman weaving a mat, to move away from the world of myth into the depiction of the contemporary.
A. T. Manookian, "Untitled (Hawaiian Genre Scene)", 1930, The Honolulu Academy
As Arman struggled in Hawai'i, his brother, Vahe, had become a student in a seminary in Geneva, learning French. Two years younger, he had taken on the responsibility of earning enough money to bring his mother and sister out of Turkey. Eight thousand miles away, Arman was unable to help.
His sister Adrienne wrote to a friend in a 1975 letter recounting Manookian's fate: "He did not write too often and we worried a lot."
She was right to worry, as her brother was emotionally fragile. His obituary in the Star-Bulletin reported that:
"On one occasion he took down a group of paintings that were on exhibition, tore them across and threw them into a waste basket."

He also apparently once turned down a mural commission because he was busy and "could not be bothered."
He delivered his last painting, "Flamingos in Flight," on Thursday, May 7, 1931, to the home of Charles Mackintosh. Three days later he was dead.
A. T. Manookian, "Flamingos in Flight", 1931, private collection
The artist's last painting.
The artist's last painting..
The last known photo of Manookian
Manookian's art had celebrated adventure and heroic myths, yet he killed himself pointlessly and created a world of pain for those he left in the present.
A simple way of explaining Manookian today would be to say he was manic-depressive. That would be too simple, as it ignores the terror that Tateos had to comprehend as a boy. Perhaps the words of the Armenian poet Daniel Varoujan, the martyred principal of Manookian's boyhood school echoed in Arman's soul:
"The Armenian nation wept and roared in me."
In April of 1931, Manookian's mother, sister and brother were shocked when they received letters of condolence from artists Verna Tallman and Cyril Lemmon. They read and re-read copies of the headlines about his death, which his brother Vahe, a photoengraver, carefully copied onto plates in his grief. They petitioned the American Embassy to retrieve his belongings, but were told that Arman had left nothing behind.
Their main consolation, since they could not afford to go to Honolulu, was a visit by Manookian's friend Cyril Lemmon who came to Paris in 1932, separated from his wife, and making a stab at being a painter. They also received a painting and a few drawings sent by Verna Tallman which his sister-in-law Andree still treasures. The family did not have the financial means to attend the Memorial Exhibit for Manookian which was held at the Honolulu Academy in the Fall of 1933.
Mc Clellan was away from Hawaii at the time of his friend's death, and no article or mention of Manookian's death was ever to appear in "Leatherneck" where his career had started. Had Manookian lived he would have had to cope with the disappointment of knowing that the massive history he illustrated for McClellan was never published. The Depression made publication of such a large book unfeasible, and McClellan resorted to mimeographing sections, chapter by chapter. The only complete record of the "History of U. S. Marines and Origin of Sea Soldiers" by Edwin North McClellan, illustrated by A. T. Manookian, exists on microfilm as recorded by the New York Public Library in 1954.
Mc Clellan retired from the Marines in 1936, continuing to edit "Paradise of the Pacific" until his departure from Hawaii not long before the attack on Pearl Harbor. It must have been wrenching for him to hear of the carnage at Pearl Harbor and the sinking of the Arizona on which he had served as a young man. Like all Americans, at the War's end he must have also been stunned by the emerging details of the Holocaust. Had Manookian lived, he, like all Armenians would have known that his family had lived through the rehearsal for the genocide in Germany.
While Manookian never lived to know the full impact of his work, McClellan was able to have his achievements recognized during his lifetime. In 1968 he was honored at a ceremony at the Philadelphia Naval Base where General Leonard Chapman called his history "the essential starting point for any meaningful research into our past."
One has to wonder if Major McClellan ever looked through the box of Manookian illustrations in his office and remembered the young clerk with big ears he had met in 1924. When Mc Clellan died in 1971 at the age of eighty-nine, it had been decades since the proud young artist who had blossomed in Hawaii told a reporter, in a 1928 interview, that the underlying principles of his work were "those adapted by every earnest painter since (Michel)Angelo and Rubens."
Manookian, when he gave that interview in 1928, had only three years left to live. He was already carefully aligning himself with the past and its rose-colored myths. His broken childhood had taught him not to trust the future, even in paradise.
From "Paradise of the Pacific": "A fancy of ancient Hawaii, decorative of the tale of some noble warrior's shell being borne afloat to sanctified repository" by A. T. Manookian
Great story!!
A nice read - thanks. Just saw several of Manookian's paintings at the Honolulu Museum of Art this past week.

CBS News – is the first person connected to the attack, which left four Americans dead, to be brought into custody. Republicans have been extremely critical of the Obama administration for failing to bring to justice anyone involved in the attack despite the nearly two years that have gone by since it took place.
In his first public appearance of the day, a manufacturing-focused event in Pittsburgh, Mr.,” Mr..”
The president added that America’s diplomats “need to know that this country has their back and will always go after anybody who goes after us
In a statement released before the news of Khattala’s death became public, the Mr. Obama also commemorated Ambassador Chris Stevens, Sean Smith, Tyrone Woods, and Glen Doherty, the four Americans killed in the attack.
White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters that the operation — whichwas first reported by the Washington Post — is not the end of the U.S. search for suspects, but “marks an important milestone.” He called Khattalah a “key figure in the attack.”
Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said that the raid was carried out Sunday in cooperation with law enforcement personnel. Khattala was being held in a secure location outside of Libya, and all U.S. personnel involved in the operation have departed the country. There were no civilian casualties, Kirby said.
The Obama administration in January named Khattala a global terrorist along with Sufian bin Qumu, the leader of the Derna branch of Ansar al-Sharia in Libya. The branches of the Islamist militia in Benghazi and Tunisia were also designated foreign terrorist organizations.
Khattala was the first person charged in connection with the attack by federal prosecutors last August. CBS News Justice and Homeland Security correspondent Bob Orr reports that he has been put on a ship and is being interrogated. It is expected that he will eventually be read his rights and brought to D.C. to face criminal charges in federal court.
He told the Associated Press in 2012 that he was not involved in the Benghazi attacks but rather went to the U.S. compound to rescue men who were trapped inside. But other eyewitnesses said he was present at the attacks directing fighters.
Khattala began moving around within Libya more and more after U.S. special forces carried out a raid in Libya last October to capture Anas al-Libi, an al-Qaeda leader linked to the 1998 American Embassy bombings in East Africa, Orr reports. The U.S. received intelligence indicating Khattala was possibly at a villa on the coast Sunday night, leading to his capture.
But one month after the attack he seemed unconcerned about the accusations of his involvement. In an interview with CBS News’ Liz Palmer, he said that if the Libyan president was accusing him of perpetrating the attacks, “Then he should come to my house and arrest me.”
“It is obviously good news that this terrorist is now in American custody, and I am grateful for the work of our military – assisted by the FBI – in capturing him,” House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said in a statement. “I look forward to hearing more details regarding the raid, and I expect the administration to give our military professionals time to properly gather any useful intelligence he has.”
Georgia Sen. Saxby Chambliss, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the administration had been in touch with lawmakers for several days about the raid. It stood in contrast to the prisoner swap that secured the release of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, when the administration failed to give Congress the required 30-days notice before releasing detainees from Guantanamo Bay.
Some Republicans, including Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina have said Khattala should be held at Guantanamo Bay as an enemy combatant. But Dianne Feinstein, the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said she gave her full support to the administration’s plan to gather intelligence from him and then,” Feinstein said.

Republican do support lower taxes, except they only support them for the wealthy, NOT the rest of us. Even as they crusade to eliminate taxes on corporations and the wealthy, Republicans fully support a new proposal that would actually raise taxes on the rest of us. And guess who opposes it? That’s right. President Obama. Republicans usually crusaded for lower taxes for everyone, but since they support class warfare now, they have partly reversed themselves.

The ease with which Fremantle disposed of Sydney in their preliminary final at Patersons Stadium on Saturday night is what would concern Hawthorn the most.
Ignore the 25-point margin - the Swans kicked six late goals to make the result respectable.
The Dockers had disposed of the reigning premier by half-time, to win their way to their first grand final in since joining the AFL 19 years ago.
The Hawks, who limped in to the premiership play-off on Friday night with a five-point win over Geelong at the MCG, would have hoped for more from the Swans.
And coach John Longmire would have hoped for more from the Swans.
The statistics will show that Sydney put up a greater fight in the second half, winning the second half by 14 points, but it was certainly a case of too little, too late.
But with seven players from their 2012 premiership winning side missing, it was always going to be a big challenge.
And with the likes of Adam Goodes, Sam Reid and Kurt Tippett among those, Sydney was lucky to have still been in the contest at quarter-time. The signs were therethorn won't be so accommodating.
The Hawks have also shown that they are better equipped to deal with the Dockers' forward press, which is something the Swans just couldn't handle.
Every time the Swans kicked the ball out of Fremantle's forward line, it came straight back with the next kick.
The Dockers will take close to their best side of the year in to the grand final and it showed what it is capable of.
Their dominance of Sydney started from the opening bounce, with David Mundy winning the first clearance of the game and captain Matthew Pavlich having a set shot for goal only seconds from the first siren. He missed and that set the tone for the term.
Fremantle had 95 touches to Sydney's 78 for the quarter and 17 inside 50s to the Swans' seven.
But the Dockers could not capitalise. They took eight marks inside their attacking 50 for the term, but put just 2.9 on the board.
It wasn't the Swans' pressure that was having an impact though, it was the moment.
The Dockers kicked 2.6 from set shots and it was their usually reliable goalkickers, Chris Mayne and Michael Walters, who faltered.
If 43,249 home fans can give a side the jitters, what is 90,000-plus at the MCG going to do?
Walters did recover, though, to finish with three goals.
The Swans' two goals in the opening term were not the result of impressive set passages of play either. Their first goal came through a rare minute of play when they had a couple of consecutive entries into the 50.. Saturday night was the first time they.
As is expected from a Ross Lyon-coached side, the defensive effort was provided by everyone.
The Swans went inside their 50 on 14 occasions in the second term, but when Jesse White marked and kicked a behind one minute before the siren, it was their first score for the quarter. Actually, it was the first time they had a possession inside 50.

The country’s famed two-party electoral system appears in reasonable health. Incumbent president John Mahama has been voted back in, giving the National Democratic Congress (the Jerry Rawlings vehicle) a second term. Nana Akufo-Addo, the candidate of the New Patriotic Party (which backed two-time president John Kufuor), has been defeated despite attracting nearly 48% of votes. In short, both parties had substantial success but voters opted to give the NDC a second four-year period in office – what Ghanaian parties have come to expect.
Of course, there are claims that the voting was unfair. Even so, it is hard to disagree with President Mahama’s statement, as quoted recently in a Kenyan newspaper: ‘Over the past 20 years, Ghana’s democracy has become a beacon of hope for the entire African continent and in the process, drawn useful lessons for the rest of the world’.
Because this seems so obviously right, and because Ghana is also registering very fast economic growth, this may appear a knock-down argument for the UK’s current foreign policy mantra: poor developing countries need liberal-democratic capitalism, and they need it now.
But hang on a second. The ‘beacon of hope’ metaphor is attractive but even as a judgement on Ghana’s development prospects, it is a bit overblown. And what it says about the rest of the world is seriously inconsistent with the best comparative evidence.
Journalists writing about Ghana are rightly concerned by the storm-clouds forming around the country’s prospective oil boom. Will Ghana be a country where oil wealth proves to be a curse, or one whose institutions are robust enough to turn it into a blessing?
Research by Lindsay Whitfield of Roskilde University provides a solid basis for speculation on this subject. According to this work, Ghana’ competitive but highly clientelistic politics impacts negatively on the prospects for achieving real structural change and upgrading in the national economy. Competitive clientelism has combined with a weak indigenous capitalism and the availability of easy finance from aid to give political leaders an extremely short-term time-horizon. Policies geared to the long-term economic needs of the country are of little interest to them. Consequently, entrepreneurs with the potential to accumulate capital and technological capabilities in productive activities are systematically discouraged from doing so. So even for Ghana, the Ghana model has its problems.
The other reason for caution is the commonplace that institutions have different effects in different contexts. Two-party competitive politics may find a welcoming environment in Ghana, but that does not mean it can be exported just anywhere. It is surely no accident that other African countries have adjusted the institutional templates inherited from their colonial masters in very different ways. Of course, nearly everywhere we now see electoral contests that are in principle free. But the actual functioning of these systems varies hugely (just take the very different examples of Kenya, Malawi, and Mozambique). It does not seem to be an accident that these countries’ systems differ from each other and from the Ghana model.
What then accounts for the friendliness of the Ghanaian environment to the institutionalisation of a two-party system? There isn’t an easy answer, but a rich literature now exists on the more general question of how the functioning of institutions is shaped by context. The excellent recent sequel to Violence and Social Orders by Douglass North and team focuses on how different forms of ‘limited access order’ avert the threat of internal war by sharing out rents among powerful elite groups. The basic idea is that the fundamental power distribution in society determines what institutions work and how they work.
In the spirit of that theory, a key aspect of the Ghana story is a distinctive historical trajectory that has given Ghana a unique sort of fundamental power distribution among elites, one that is based on an understanding between two large blocs. In that context, it makes sense to all concerned to share access to rents by having political parties alternating in office. In countries with other social and economic structures, access to rents is more naturally shared among elites through some other arrangement – perpetually recomposing ethnic coalitions in Kenya; a single dominant party in Mozambique; a highly fluid presidential following in Malawi.
For sure, each one of these political modalities has shortcomings from the point of view of developmental political leadership. They are all in need of radical changes to make them better drivers of processes of sustainable structural transformation. But the changes that might work in this sense have to start from where each country is, not from where it might wish to be. Successful reforms will be less likely if the assumption is made that there is a unique beacon of hope, represented by Ghana.Built out of an old mayonnaise factory in Brooklyn, Public Assembly is 4000 square feet of arts space, a multi-room music venue made with brick, glass, and steel.

Since April 2012 we would like to invite You to our new EU standard campsite, suitable for Campers, Camping Trailers and all other camping lovers. The center offers 24 boxes for Campers and Camping Trailers and 30 tent sites.
Recreational Center „Diabla Góra” lies in the heart of the Słonne Mountains Landscape Park, in a small place called Tyrawa Solna, which is “The Northern Gateway of the Bieszczady Mountains.” It is located along the river San and stream Tyrawka, right on the slope of the Devil’s Mountain (354 m.a.s.l.). To add more beauty to this picture, one must not forget to mention that the center stands on one of the most famous routs in Europe of Subcarpathian Orthodox Churches and Icons. Additionally, 2,5 km from the center there are 54 hectars of lakes, which make the region every fisherman's heaven.
Recreational Center "Diabla Góra" has in its offer rooms for 3-4 people with bathrooms (30m2), houses for 6-8 people (70m2) and houses for 8-10 people (90m2).

I watched the MTV Video Music Awards last night, which did nothing but remind me of how much I miss the NBA. During this weird thing called 5 Seconds of Summer, I realized that I’d rather watch YouTube videos of NBA players singing songs.
So that’s what happened.
After hours and hours down the NBA singing rabbit hole, I’m proud to present: the NBA Video Music Awards.
Best Duet: Patty Mills and Boris Diaw — “Killing Me Softly”
Started at the bottom in a low-key karaoke bar with Conan playing in the background, Patty and Boris deliver a strong performance of “Killing Me Softly.” A few quick points:
1. Basketball or no basketball, Patty Mills was born to be a star.
2. Boris Diaw proves, once again, that he is able to stay within his role and provide solid backup when needed.
3. Some people at the bar are way too chill for what’s taking place in front of them.
Skip to 2:30 to see a whole mess of finger-pointing, fist-clinching, and eyes-wide-shut singing from these two. I almost can’t handle how great this is. ONE TIME.
Best Performance by a Group: 2009 Phoenix Suns — “All Night Long”
The Celine Dion Vibrato Award: Leandro Barbosa — “All Night Long” (Lead)
Here we have Jared Dudley, Grant Hill, Amar’e Stoudemire, Channing Frye, Jason Richardson, and Lou Amundson showing you that they are the best. Yeah, THAT Lou Amundson.
You know who’s the best of the best? LEANDRO BARBOSA.
The vibrato is an important element to a beautiful singing voice. If one can capture this in full voice, they can move mountains. Sadly, most people are not born with the necessary skills to achieve vibrato. Leandro is one of those people, but that’s OK because LEANDRO MAKES HIS OWN VIBRATO. He’s the GOAT of the video, and by GOAT I mean he sounds like an actual goat. Skip ahead to 1:35 to see Leandro at his best in every way possible.
The Props Master Award: Russell Westbrook — “Stay Stay Stay”
You can gather two things from this video:
- Russell will steal your heart sooner or later.
- Russell doesn’t use a pick.
Best Dance Ensemble: The Miami Heat — “Get Low”
I knew going in that I’d have a good time watching LeBron, Michael Beasley, and Roger Mason Jr. sing the words “Ah skeet skeet, motherfucker” in front of a live audience. The singing was good. The dancing was good. This was an all-around fun time.
Take another look at the dance.
TO THE WINDOW …
TO THE WALL …
TILL THE SWEAT DRIPS DOWN MY BALLS.
Worst Performance by an Ensemble: 2012 Rookie Golden State Warriors
Don’t let Draymond Green’s inspiring performance of “Lean on Me” fool you— the rest of this video is full of bad rapping, bad children’s songs, and, worst of all, bad “Gangnam Style.”
The Bon Iver Falsetto Award: Dirk Nowitzki — “End of the Road”
Actually, this isn’t that far off from Dirk’s aging game, the way he cleverly finds ways to deliver despite what he lacks in raw talent.
For example: Dirk’s full voice is his ability to blow by defenders, which is now nonexistent.
And Dirk’s falsetto is his one-legged fade, à la “End of the Road.” The notes are there, it just looks and feels and sounds really bad.
The Mo Cheeks Humanitarian Award for Achieving Goodwill: Mo Cheeks — “National Anthem”
The single reason I’ve always cheered for Mo Cheeks.
Best Cameo-Saving Performance by a Group: Boyz II Men (for Charles Barkley) — “End of the Road”
Chuck suffers from being tone-deaf, especially when he’s had a drink or seven. So naturally, this performance isn’t going well until about 00:59. Just when the audience thinks this can’t get much worse … BOYZ II MEN, ABC, BBD.
Chuck is a notch above Dirk when it comes to this song, but all the credit goes to Boyz II Men, who are apparently very free these days.
The Bob Dylan “Lyrics” Award for Not Knowing the Lyrics: LeBron James — “Stayin’ Alive”
Lyrics to “Stayin’ Alive” — according to LeBron
[Silence.]
By the way I use my walk, I’m a woman’s man
No time to talk.
[FIVE SECONDS OF SILENCE.]
Stayin’ alive. Ish eh ah. And you an — eh — eh — eh — eh — ah.
Deh deh duh. Deh deh duh …
[11 SECONDS OF SILENCE.]
Stayin’ alive.
Hah. Hah. Hah. Hah. Stayin’ alive. Stayin’ alive.
All hail King James.
The Icon Award for Best Performance / Best Timing / Best “Wave ’Em Off” Game / Best Emotional Eyebrows / Best Reminder of Why I Love the Internet / Best Use of Shuttin’ Eyes / Best Performance by a Player Who Gives Very Few Shits About What Any of us Think: Pau Gasol — “How to Save a Life”
As many popular artists can tell you, there’s more to a performance than just a voice. To be considered a true entertainer, you must maintain an aura and a swagger onstage that cannot be taught. It’s just something you’re born with.
It’s just something Pau Gasol is born with. A quick rundown:
0:01 Passionately shuts eyes.
0:06 Pau waves off “the things you told him all along.”
0:09 We explore the depths of Pau’s spirituality as he whips his head back during “Pray to god he hears you.”
0:16 Perfectly air-punches the moment the chorus comes in.
0:18 A question is asked. “Where did I go wrong?” Pau puts his hand out as if to say, “Let me tell you.” Then he sets his eyebrows to EMOTIONAL STATUS, shuts his eyes, and sings, “I lost a friend.”
0:26 EYEBROWS.
0:25 Well-timed head nod.
0:34 Raises eyebrows like, “You asked for the best.”

See all from Jason Gallagher’Summer months in the Regional Parks Botanic Garden are an excellent time to view the richness and diversity of California's native buckwheats (Eriogonum species). Just as buckwheats can be found in almost every plant community throughout the state, they can be found in almost every section of the Garden. The dense assemblage of small flowers range in colors from creamy white to soft pink; bold reds or glowing yellows. Foliage size and color range from soft, grey oval leaves, to large, nearly white linear leaves, or tiny, green needlelike leaves. Buckwheats are not only revered for the ornamental significance, but also valued for the ability to provide sustenance for birds, bees and butterflies, and shelter for countless small animals.
Look for these buckwheats throughout the garden:Santa Cruz Island buckwheat (E. arborescens)
Conejo buckwheat (E. crocatum)
Santa Catalina Island buckwheat (E. giganteum var. giganteum)
California buckwheat (E. fasciculatum)
Coast buckwheat (E. latifolium)
Parish's buckwheat (Eriogonum parishii)
Sulfur flower buckwheat (E. umbellatum)
Other spectacular plants in bloom (that are not buckwheats):
White-stemmed clarkia (Clarkia gracilis ssp. albicaulis)
Vine Hill clarkia (C. imbricata)
Fort Miller clarkia (C. williamsonii)
Bluff lettuce (Dudleya farinosa)
Diffuse daisy (Erigeron divergens)
Heartleaf keckiella (Keckiella cordifolia)
Bush monkey flower (Mimulus aurantiacus)

Issa's Making It Easier For You to Get Your Hands on Kate Middleton's Dress
Admittedly, we've been eying Kate Middleton's engagement photos with envy, but it's not just because of the rock, or her fiancé. Actually, since we spied the soon-to-be princess smiling in her easy, sexy, royal blue silk jersey dress, we've wanted to add a piece of the Issa label to our own wardrobes. As luck would have it, the London-based Issa founder and designer, Daniella Helayel, got the message. With sights set on expanding the label into a global brand, Daniella announced plans to relaunch in the US, offer ecommerce through the Issa website, and open six stores in her native Brazil. And, if you're wondering what might be in store for Fall, this designer's got more to love than Kate's little blue dress: "I've got an amazing print archive and hundreds of dress shapes — most of which have never been used."
Why she was selected: Competed as part of record-setting 4x800 and 4x400 relays at Friday’s Kane County Girls Track and Field Meet at Geneva.
St. Charles East senior girls track and field standout Britney Williams helped the Saints to a runner-up finish at Friday’s Kane County Meet at Geneva, completing the anchor leg of the 4x800-meter realay before running the second leg of the 4x400. Both victorious relays established new county records, and Williams’ efforts established her as the St. Charles Bank & Trust-Kane County Chronicle Athlete of the Week. Chronicle sports reporter Kevin Druley caught up with Williams about her night. The following is an edited transcript:
What was your mindset when you took the baton trailing in the [4x400]?
I just tried to relax. Tried not to panic. And I guess I just trusted my training.
Coach [Tim Wolf] threw you and Jordan [Shead] on the 4x800 last-minute. Are you there to stay?
We didn’t expect to do that this year, but we love opportunties, so we’re not really sure where that’s going yet.
How is team morale with the state series on the horizon?
I’m just really proud of my team. I mean, they work so hard and we’re seeing results, and I think it’s really positive. I just can’t stress that [enough]. I love my team so much. They’re doing real well.Jun 27 2011

Kristen, I agree and the more I read this the more I was reminded of how this is what makes home education different than a school setting. We can sit back and let them workout the answer. Even more so, we encourage self education and exploration by allowing them to determine their answer. And the really neat thing is that they may come up with an answer that is different, and yet correct, from the one we would have provided. I’ve heard from college professors that their number one complaint is that students don’t know how to think and they are shocked that the college wants their opinion. Let’s hope we send them students from our homes that actually think and base it on good evidence. Thanks…for a great post and a reminder to teach our children to think and find the answer on their own!

Kristen,
What about your daughter teaching herself piano via YouTube or other self-teaching curricula?
It sounds like you have a good teacher but there’s really only a slight difference between you correcting your daughter and outsourcing that to someone else.
KittyHere On Monday, June 27 at 9:49 am
Piano via YouTube or self-teaching curricula could lead to some very big problems. Would you have a child learn to ski or swim that way? Piano, violin, any musical instrument involves physical technique that requires an instructor just as much as skiing for swimming. YouTube & self-teaching curricula can be used as supplements but not for quality primary instruction.
And yes this piano instructor certainly sounds like an excellent one.
outsourcing vs. public school On Monday, June 27 at 12:05 pm
KittyHere,
Would you outsource in-depth classes that involve labs?, i.e. chemistry (I’m not talking kitchen experiments out of a kit with baking soda here), or pig dissection in biology, or theatre….??
My point is that “outsourcing” to you homeschoolers is pretty much what the advantage of public school for us ps’ers is….
WendyT On Monday, June 27 at 5:25 pm
The problem with that is that YouTube can’t see or hear if you are playing correctly. KittyHere is correct in comparing music to athletics in this way. Even Olympic athletes and symphony musicians still need trainers to help them improve.
CaptiousNut On Monday, June 27 at 6:00 pm
Except that there are plenty of self-taught pro-golfers, self-taught famous musicians, self-taught renowned scientists, et al. There are self-taught/self-made billionaires….
WendyT On Sunday, July 3 at 8:29 am
It depends on how you define self-taught. You can teach yourself the basics, but eventually you need some dialogue to improve. I taught myself piano before the age of YouTube. I read my mom’s old books and learned to read music – notes, both treble and bass clef, dynamics, fingering charts, everything. I could play simple pieces on my own, but once I started with a teacher, I had a better understanding of more complex ideas such as keys, theory, and expression. I had hit a wall in the self-taught mode and needed more guidance.

I should have added…. I started learning around age 7 but did not have a teacher until I was 11…

Conviction! Wow. I don’t know if we would “pass” that test. It’s one of the things that I have been working on with her. Because it is just the 2 of us most of the time, I know I help her more than I should. Thanks for encouraging me in that journey.

What a wonderfully written lesson! I felt I was there with you, almost pushing myself off my chair and forcing myself to let her work it out herself.
Such a good post …
homegrown countrygirl On Monday, June 27 at 2:57 pm
Ditto. This is a beautiful post. And it’s a gentle reminder of a lesson we all need to remember about life… that it’s always about the journey.

Abigail On Monday, June 27 at 8:09 am
Sounds like you found a great teacher! I was homeschooled and now teach piano and I partially attribute my success as a teacher to my schooling background. Since I was encouraged to find and pursue my own interests, and taught to find things out on my own, I can pass those things on to my students, and most love it.
I haven’t had enough homeschool students to notice similarities with them, but I’ve noticed the Montessori students do amazingly well because it’s a self-directed learning method. The story of your teacher was also inspiring because I do tend to give the answer too soon sometimes. Gotta remember that teaching the child to teach themselves is more important than having quick success.

JudyB On Monday, June 27 at 8:20 am
Very awesome. So many times, whether home schooled or not, we want to jump in and intervene. Let ‘em work it out on their own!

Leslie O On Monday, June 27 at 8:41 am
Yes, Yes and YES! Homeschooling parents – read and re-read this post. I’m a former home-school parent of 3 daughters now 22, 24 and 26 years of age. Run with this advice TODAY. Our heart and our heads must team teach or our kids will be robbed of some much valued ‘process.’ Take it from someone who made (and still makes) some heart mistakes. Think tough love in homeschooling.

I needed this reminder. I have the tendency to NOT wait long enough for an answer to a question especially when time is a factor. This is a good lesson to learn!

lindy On Monday, June 27 at 8:49 am
I think that’s a good lesson for all parents. My kids won’t be home-schooled, but I know I will be dealing with homework and lessons that we will work on outside of school time. Hopefully I can find the patience to let them learn as a journey instead of as a destination.
Pam D On Monday, June 27 at 10:55 am
I was just going to say the same thing, Lindy. It isn’t just homeschool parents who need to read this. I wish that I had pushed my boy harder when he was very young to do more on his own. He is 11, and I am paying for it by having to push a lot harder now. We’re getting there, but it’s much more painful now than it would have been. This piano teacher is a keeper… and needs to be teaching other teachers “how to teach”!

Sarah On Monday, June 27 at 8:56 am
Wow – What a great lesson. This really spoke to me spitirually as well in the sense that God does the same for us. He guides us if we earnestly seek Him, but He allows trials and tribulations to stregthen us and build our faith. Giving us the answers to life’s problems would rob us of the many lessons of life. Amazing!
Christine On Monday, June 27 at 12:34 pm
Amen! And life’s examples always point back to Him.

Chrissy - Boots & Pearls On Monday, June 27 at 9:03 am
Kristen –
I must admit that I am not overly supportive of homeschooling. Why? Because I have seen way too many cases where the responsible adults involved took what had the potential to be something great and basically allowed it to stagnate, making a minimal effort to reach minimum requirements. Your post this morning, however, reminded me of why homeschooling can be (and still is in some households!) a fantastic option for the education of children. Thank you for serving as a wonderful example of what homeschooling is meant to be – an opportunity for children to not only learn “book knowledge,” but to learn how to excell in the world.

Shelly On Monday, June 27 at 9:31 am
This reminds me of the story that the kindergarten teacher at our small town public school handed to the parents at open house. You may have heard it, but it’s really appropriate!.
Darci On Monday, June 27 at 2:29 pm
I actually read this to my eighth graders during the first week of school, along with a traditional jewish tale about a village and Buddhist tale of self preservation. I use them as writing prompts as well as Chalk Talk prompts.
14
Emily @ Write Twenty Eleven On Monday, June 27 at 9:37 am
Yes! I met a teacher recently who really emphasized not giving students the answer. When a student asked a question, she would say, “Let’s research that” or “How can we find out?” This is so much more valuable and empowering than just giving a quick answer.
Jeremy Hobbs On Monday, June 27 at 2:15 pm
Absolutely right! And great article, thanks for the info.

Did I ever need to see this! We’re beginning homeschooling Kindergarten with our 5-year-old twin girls this summer. I’ve already been working with them for a while, and after reading your excellent post I can see that I probably do jump the gun on helping them. Thanks for your wise thoughts. I’m grateful that I read them now, at the beginning of our homeschooling journey, rather than later.

Sounds like you have a very smart young lady on your hands and an even smarter teacher I would hang to her for all your might – great music teachers are so hard to find. My daughter had a terrible violin teacher this past year and I kept putting off changing… thinking things would get better… needless to say they didn’t get better at all and finally I changed to a new one and our lives have changed for ever!!! We went from a kid who loved her music and played despite the poor teacher to child that is passionate and practices and practices and practices!!! Yup our new teacher is a definite keeper!!! You can just tell the fabulous ones!!!

Glad you shared this! I teach my students this adage by William Shedd, “A ship is safe in harbor, but that is not what ships are made for.” I tell them harbor is working with me but they are meant to be out to sea, tackling the waves and bumps on their own just like your daughter did during the lesson.

Tina Cole On Monday, June 27 at 11:51 am
Thank you so much for sharing this!
Love the encouragement to experience the process. Good idea to step away from arbitrary right/wrong/time limits and embark on the journey itself. As a parent it is a thrill to see my child learning something new through his own eyes, heart, hands, mind. I need to respect the process- and the child- as well as providing the environment and support for growth.
21
Faye On Monday, June 27 at 11:52 am
I LOVE this post! My personality as a Mom is to hover and rescue, like a mother bear. I’m constantly fighting my tendency to intervene and solve my kids’ problems. As a homeschooling Mom, it’s even more vital for me to curb that urge, since I’m the biggest influence in my kids’ lives. If not, I could end up raising them up into helplessness. Thanks for sharing your story and perspective.

ColeyCook On Monday, June 27 at 12:06 pm
As a piano teacher, I just love this! First, because I think learning an instrument, and namely piano, is one of the best things for growing minds. Second because I find myself doing a lot of the same – waiting, listening, cheering them on and letting them find their way around the keyboard. It creates a love and curiosity for playing that just pointing out their mistakes will never do.
24
Christine On Monday, June 27 at 12:42 pm
This post is a wonderful reminder to all of us. We need to guide and lead our children to the answers. By discovering them themselves the results are planted in their minds as opposed to fleeting memories that disappear when a test is over. When my daughter was growing up, even in the small things, I had her find the answer, then we would talk about it. For instance, when she’d ask, “Mom, what does exemplify mean?” I would have her look it up. It also teaches resourcefulness.
And just a small note to a post a saw…it not pushing our children harder that gets better results. Alot of times this just causes frustration and resentment. Its stepping back and giving them a chance to figure it out for themselves, even if this means failing. But being there to guide them back and encouraging them either way.
25
troze On Monday, June 27 at 1:28 pm
This is a great post. Very interesting. I am not homeschooling, however I have gotten a book to teach my 4-year-old to read over the summer. We’ve done the first two of twenty lessons. He’s doing well – the book most thankfully instructs me on how to instruct him! But I do have, at times, a physical feeling that I want to just jump in and tell him the answer. It takes a lot of energy to hold myself back. But I try to remember to let him figure it out and cheer him when he gets it, and not emphasize what may have been wrong. His reading progress is actually remarkable.
I attended a lecture at my children’s school and one of the things I learned that night was why I can’t spell. I’d take spelling tests and the teacher would correct it in red – underlining the wrong spelling I had chosen. All the emphasis on what was wrong stuck with me. And studies show that this is the case with most people. Therefore, I try to point out quickly only once that something isn’t right yet and encourage him to keep trying when he looks at me for help. And when he gets it I make a big deal out of it.
Teaching is such an art!

Kenna R On Monday, June 27 at 2:12 pm
This is an awesome post that I appreciate very much! I was not homeschooled, nor were my children. When helping my grandchildren with their homework, tho, I often find myself “helping” maybe a little too much. This is a reminder and validation that maybe I should allow them to figure it out on their own more often. Thank you for that reminder!!
27
Darci On Monday, June 27 at 2:39 pm
As a public school teacher I look to also sources for inspiration, so I appreciate this concept of waiting and observing. I struggle at the beginning of every year with what is called “learned helplessness” – students who know a teacher will guide them through the assignment or project therefore refuse to hear directions, make no effort until lead to the result and disrupt others learning process. When I was first in the classroom I had to have a glass/bottle of water near me at all times. After asking a question/prompt/query I would have to take 3 drinks before I would allow myself to lead to a result. Now, I have a large poster in my room stating “3 before Me” – students must as 2 at their group and 1 out of their group for direction before coming to me. This makes the students look for answers outside of me as well as meet new people.
As a parent the concept of of coddling and not cuddling is difficult lesson to learn, but I have sent 1 daughter and soon to send another daughter off to college with the ability to fend for herself. When she is 3200 miles away, I can’t figure out why her printer is not printing…figure it out yourself but I can tell her what her favorite recipe for mac and cheese is – and then cook it together over iChat.

Susannah On Monday, June 27 at 2:40 pm
Thank you for this post. As others have mentioned, it’s a needed reminder for any parent–homeschooling or not. While children do sometimes truly need our assistance, I easily forget that by jumping in to “help” I am often stealing the satisfaction that can only come when they’ve had the opportunity to persevere and achieve something on their own.
I am going to print out this post and put it with my notes for this fall so it will be where I can read and reread it. We will begin homeschooling my son in August and this is a great reminder to me to let him enjoy (and tackle!) the journey of learning!

Lynette On Monday, June 27 at 3:47 pm
Excellent post!! I feel like I jump in too often as well…It is so very hard to pull back and let my children figure it out. It’s the greatest lesson I’m learning as a homeschool mom, myself!

Kimberly, OKC On Monday, June 27 at 5:08 pm
I don’t have a comment on this post but a week or so ago I was reading the comments to your post titled something like…Is it the parents fault if kids are failing. Among the first few comments someone linked to a dyslexia video and I don’t know why, well, now I know it was God, but I actually clicked on it and watched the video. Within minutes I knew my husband and my son and possibly my daughter was dyslexic, tho mildly so. Since then I have had several conversations with other moms and grandmas about this learning disability and I am amazed at how common it is. We are beginning the process of fixing this situation for my homeschooling kids. I hate it that I was so hard on my son about spelling and handwriting and learning to read when it was not his fault if he didn’t understand within my time frame.
So…I say all this to say, THANK YOU to whomever it was (they didn’t have a blog) that added the link and thanks to you, Kristen, for taking the time to post such worthy information.
34
Kimberly, OKC On Monday, June 27 at 5:13 pm
I wanted to add…
Perhaps someone else can be helped, go to the brightsolutions.us website for more info on dyslexia. It is the number one learning disability and the one learning disability we have more info on than any other. Give these kids what they need early and the sky is the limit, it turns out that they are smarter than the rest of us!!!!

Kelly On Monday, June 27 at 5:48 pm
I was guilty of jumping in A LOT because I did want my children to succeed but I really fought it hard during lessons – violin and piano. I got too many hard looks from teachers! Ha! No, really, I learned to stop doing that in public but it was a fight. I sat thru every violin lesson and took notes because my daughter’s teacher insisted and this lady was among the very best so I did what she asked. Even other parents who were accomplished violinist had to do the same for their kids. Looking back, I would suggest always staying with them especially when they are young, then there are no questions about what they heard or what was really said to them. You will be better able to help them practice. My son’s cello teacher, also very excellent, insisted the same. By age 11 my daughter had several concertos under her belt and it was sooo fun. She took private lessons for 10 years. She is in college now, a pre-med major but still blows us away with her playing. I would do it all over again – even the jumping in occasionally part!

Annie On Monday, June 27 at 6:58 pm
Ha. I am going through this on a smaller scale, with my daughter too. Only for me it’s different. It’s partly because I want to prove to her that she is becoming more capable of helping herself, and partly because I’m a little lazy. My approach with her when she asks me to do something for her, something I know she is or could be capable of, I make her try first. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t, but when it does…? Oh, she is so proud of herself. So I am doing it to teach her she is capable, to build her confidence in her own abilities, and to get me out of having to do it every time! Total bonus. Thanks for the encouragement, that I’m not too far off!

Angie On Monday, June 27 at 7:56 pm
So true, so true! I am learning this much later in my children’s lives. Do you think we wish to rescue them so soon to make us look better? There’s a lot of reputation on the line as a parent anyway, but as a homeschool parent? It’s off the chain pressure to save face and look like you have it all together as a teacher and as a parent.

Corey On Monday, June 27 at 9:02 pm
Thank you for this post. It’s something that I take very seriously when i coach gymnastics. I make sure the child figures out what they may be doing wrong first. Of course to a kid, body awareness isn’t always something they have right away so i give them hints but I make sure that i do my best for these kids (most of them schoolers) so that they can at least retain SOME of their “let me do it” attitude.
41
Emily B. On Monday, June 27 at 10:08 pm
This reminds me of an article I read recently in The Atlantic, which also discusses whether helping kids too much is actually hindering them. I found both it and your post to be very interesting and thought provoking.

What an inspirational story. I have a 2 year-old and often find myself wanting to jump in and help her. I hold myself back longer than most people would and she eventually figures it all out. And then she’s so proud of herself

Oh. I so needed to hear this. Thank you for posting. I am very much similar to my oldest daughter. She is smarter than me and plays the Mom will do it for me card often. Sad to say I fall for it sometimes. Going to dig in and let her figure things out on her own more.

What a great article and so true. I’ve often struggled with the same issue, when to help and when to sit back and wait. It’s seems like such an easy thing to do but it really isn’t, and for some of us it’s much harder than others. Thanks for addressing this issue so eloquently!

I agree… but everything including school starts and ends at your home.. how much you put in your children will come back out.. more practice at violin and piano the better player they will be!

“the right answer isn’t always as important as what they learn on their way to finding it.” This is printed out and ready to hang in a prominent place in my home. I need help remembering that every single day!

LoriAngela On Wednesday, June 29 at 5:46 pm
I’m reading this just as my baby is heading off for her grad prom. I have learned so much from her music teachers and coaches. I have also learned from teaching other children (like cleaning someone else’s house). I think the most important thing in all her years is accepting who she really is and that she has her own way of going through it.
She is going on to university to be a band teacher!

Laurel On Wednesday, June 29 at 11:04 pm
Thanks so much for this post! I love getting the perspective of other homeschooling families. Does anyone have any experience with in-house tutors for other subject areas? I was offered a really amazing job opportunity but would love to continue homeschooling my children. Would I even be a homeschooling Mama if I hired tutors? Oh my. These decisions are so difficult. Being a grown up really stinks!

BY Anthony Powter | Australian Mens Amateur Tour | 2010 New South Wales Amateur | Grand Final | 03 Feb 2010
Jake Higginbottom

Jake Higginbottom has accounted for England’s, Tommy Fleetwood, in the NSW Amateur Championship final with a 3&2 victory today at Royal Sydney Golf Club.
Higginbottom, 16, powered to his biggest amateur career title so far with a stellar display of golf, moving at one stage to be five-up with nine to play in the afternoon session of the final, through a peerless display of putting that effectively shut out Fleetwood from the championship.
Fleetwood on paper going into today’s final had all the goods and certainly started as the favourite. A Walker Cup representative for Great Britain and Ireland in 2009, in 2008 Fleetwood was a finalist at the British Amateur Championship, loosing, 3&2, to Reiner Saxton from the Netherlands at Turnberry, won the 2009 Scottish Open Amateur and was a quarter-finalist at last year’s British Amateur.
At the turn Fleetwood was 1-down after the morning’s eighteen holes and mounted a min-challenge late in the afternoon session to get to three-down by the 33rd hole, yet it was all in vein for the Englishman, with Higginbottom claiming the title on the 34th hole when they both halved the hole.
Higginbottom had approached his first major amateur title final this morning with an open mind, knowing that he was against one of the world’s seasoned amateurs in Fleetwood.
“I went out there with no expectations,” remarked Higginbottom after his victory.
“I was putting and striking to the ball well, so it all came together for me. This is easily my best win.”
Higginbottom’s progression to his first major amateur championship final came after winning yesterday’s quarter-final match against Alex Pitty on the 19th and then followed that with a solid 4&3 semi-final win in the afternoon over Long Reef’s, Patrick Wilson.
Originally from the Newcastle region, Higginbottom plays out of The Australian Golf Club in Sydney under an Australian Golf Club Foundation Scholarship. Higginbottom originally honed his game under the watchful eye of Mark Rainey, the professional at Charlestown Golf Club just south of Newcastle, where Higginbottom still remains a member.
“I owe a lot from Mark’s guidance and help,” says Higginbottom.
“Mark and I have been working hard with my game over the last few months, especially with my chipping and putting. Coming to Sydney to play at The Australian has also been a great experience, as its a tough course to play and I’ve learnt so much from the experience.
Higginbottom’s best international result before today’s victory was a runner-up finish at the 2009 Aaron Baddeley International Junior. As a 15-year-old Higginbottom qualified for the NSW Open and in 2006 he won his age group in all 25 Jack Newton Junior tournaments he played.
“This is probably my second year out with playing golf seriously,” says Higginbottom.
“I want to make more Australian teams moving forward. I played in the Trans-Tasman and enjoyed every bit. My goals as to try and get into more national teams in the future.”
The signs of a promising amateur career where there early for Higginbottom. At just 13 years-of-age, Higginbottom shot an impressive 8-under-par 64 around Waratah Golf Club to claim the Lake Macquarie Junior Classic.
Today’s win for Higginbottom against the like of Tommy Fleetwood certainly represented another feather in Higginbottom’s cap.
The win was richly deserved and sets Higginbottom up, not only with at start at this year’s British Amateur, but the victory also sends a message that this 16-year-old is a name to watch in the future.

I think Stefan Audio produces excellent well known special headphone cables for most of high end models. When you want absolutely individualy preciselly built uncompromise high end cable for your K 1000, then you can contact Mr. Kraut from Czech republic from Prague who can produce for you one very special for your caps. He can do very specialized cable perfectly satisfying all parameters of K1000, include uncompromise high end technologies. All depends what you expect from it, when you connect K 1k with true high end amps like Rudistor RP 010B, RS B52, Balancing act ..., so there you need serious high end cable to obtain true potential from these legendary caps. But naturally, these serious high end cables costs much more then „consume productions“. The reasons are significant as for al high end or super high end models. Simply said, all what you consider from it is all what you decide to purchase and all what you decide to purchase is all what you get.

Yeah, I turned down a lot of recables while I was busy with personal things for a few months (and I know I missed replying at all to a lot of messages). Sorry guys.
I'm trying to get caught back up on things around here, but the new website makes it unnecessarily difficult.

Kent 11U White Sox Open With Big Win Over Mahopac
KENT- For one inning it looked like the 11U Kent White Sox might be in trouble in their WPBA opener against Mahopac on Saturday, but things quickly turned around. After falling behind 4-0 after one, the Sox took over and scored the last 14 runs in a game that was called after five.

The clinical aspects are characterized by intense local tissue pain, which may radiate deeply into muscle. There may be redness and swelling, or perhaps punctate:
1. Extract any easily grasped spine fragments. Do not crush spines within the soft tissues.
2. If any pedecellariae (seizing organs) are still attached, remove these with a sharp edge and something like shaving cream.
3. For pain relief at any time during the process, immerse the wound(s) into non-scalding hot (113 degrees Fahrenheit or 45 degrees Centigrade) water to tolerance for 30 to 90 minutes. If pain recurs, repeat the hot water immersion.
4. A doctor may need to use a local anesthetic for pain control.
5. A doctor may need to obtain an x-ray, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasound exam to locate the spine(s).
6. If a spine is situated near or within a joint and is causing severe symptoms (e.g., inflammation, infection), it may need to be removed.
7. A deep puncture wound of immune suppression of the victim is a possible indication of administration of a prophylactic antibiotic (such as ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, or trimethoprin-sulfamethoxazole).
These treatment suggestions are similar to those that are recommended for puncture wounds from the spines of crown-of-thorns starfish.

These efforts included the imaging of ancient Hindu manuscripts, shown above.
RIT was part of an Indiana University-led research team that was recently awarded first place in the Bandwidth Challenge at Super Computing 2007, an international competition for leading edge, high-bandwidth computing applications. The event is the world’s largest international conference for high-performance computing, networking, storage and analysis.
As part of the competition, teams were challenged to create methods for fully utilizing a high-speed network path to support end-to-end applications running across a grid. The team ran several cutting-edge computer applications simultaneously, including image transfers of ancient Sanskrit manuscripts from the Center for the Preservation of Ancient Manuscripts, headed by P.R. Mukund, RIT professor of electrical engineering.
The team ultimately produced speeds that were double the rate of its nearest competitors, 18.21 gigabits per second over networks that included NYSERNet, Internet2, GEANT and DFN research links.
RIT participants were organized by James Stefano in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Andrew Elble from Information and Technology Services, who worked with NYSERNet to increase RIT’s internet connectivity. Gurcharan Khanna, director of research computing, also engaged Sun Microsystems Inc. as a partner that provided a SunFire x4500 24 Terabyte server for the team’s use. In addition, Paul Mezzanini, senior systems administrator/engineer for Research Computing, configured the server with the Lustre filesystem. Additional team members came from the Technical University of Dresden, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center.THURMAN DANIELS

By Zeke MacCormack
zeke@express-news.net
:
April 27, 2011
The Boerne City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to switch its wholesale electricity supplier, with CPS Energy replacing the Lower Colorado River Authority when the current LCRA contract expires in five years.
Mayor Dan Heckler said the seven-year CPS Energy contract offered “substantial savings” and more flexibility than a new 25-year contract with LCRA.
The exact savings won't be announced until after the contract is signed Thursday.
The city faced a June 11 deadline from LCRA to say whether it would enter a new contract.
Boerne is now allowed to buy up to 24 percent of its power from a non-LCRA source, but Heckler said that option was not offered in the early years of the new LCRA contract.
“They're treating us like a brand new customer instead of a long-term customer,” he said.No booking fees

Fantastic!
I made this last night. My family of 4 (3 boys) had only one complaint. I didn't make enough. My only modification to the recipe is that I retained about 2 cups of the soup (picking out the potatoes) prior to pureeing in the blender. My guys like to be able to chew on something in their soup. They aren't fans of purely cream soups, at least not as a main course. After pureeing the rest I returned the two cups of soup to the pot.

I can show or hide content.
if i use
$Cart.Products.Count
then i can get a figure to show at front end but it seems to be based on product count, ie: if i purchase 2 items from the same product it will show "1" on the page, if then i go purchase items of a different product it will increase by 1 ( counting products, rather than items) which seems logical to me.
Im racking my brains as to why
wont work, it does show a figure, but this again seems to be on number of different products in cart rather than total number of items.wont work, it does show a figure, but this again seems to be on number of different products in cart rather than total number of items.

Dear OncoLink "Ask The Experts,"
I am a 33-year-old female and have had treatment for CIN1 cells, which affected 3/4 of my cervix. I also have had my mother and grandmother die from ovarian cancer. I have been advised that I should have DNA testing to determine if I carry "The Gene". Upon going to the Genetics Specialist, was advised testing would take 1 year and as I was only 30 years old and no children, testing would be better suited to me after I had a family and or at age 35. I have since had one child. I have been having annual CA125 and Intravaginal scans. If I have the gene fault, is my only option to have a full hysterectomy, as I have been advised? Is my early detection program sufficient?
Stephen C. Rubin, MD, Professor and Chief of the Division of Gynecologic Oncology, University of Pennsylvania Health System, responds:
Your questions raise some very complex issues. Although most ovarian and breast cancer has nothing to do with heredity, approximately 10% of cases occur in patients with genetic abnormalities (mutations) that predispose to cancer. Most of these abnormalities are in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Women with such abnormalities have a much-increased risk of getting both breast and ovarian cancer. Fortunately, fairly accurate genetic testing is now available to identify carriers of these mutations. Because most BRCA-related cancers do not occur until after age 35, testing may not be offered to younger women. For women with documented (or strongly suspected) gene mutations, a program of surveillance for breast and ovarian cancer is recommended. Once women have completed childbearing, most authorities recommend prophylactic removal of the ovaries, which will markedly reduce the risk of a subsequent ovarian cancer, and reduce the risk of breast cancer as well. I would suggest that you return to see the genetic counselor to review your situation. Your Pap smear problem is unrelated, although it could affect the decision to remove the uterus or not if prophylactic surgery is done.

Here’s our blow-by-blow recap of the episode:
PHOTOS: ‘Game Of Thrones’ Characters Who Have Died On The Show
The Wedding Banquet, King’s Landing: “You did this,” Cersei screams at Tyrion, as she cradles her dead son, King Joffrey. In the chaos of the moment, Ser Dontos grabs Sansa and they bolt. A moment later, Cersei notices Sansa is missing. “Bar the gates of the city. Seize every ship in the harbor,” Tywin shouts. “The two of them did it. I know it. Where is she?” Cersei screams.
Bells toll across the capitol as Sansa runs for her life, down passageways and stairs, and into a tiny boat. Ser Dontos assures Sansa he’s taking her somewhere safe, as he rows her out to what looks like a lifeless ship.
‘Game Of Thrones’ Cast On Jack Gleeson Vs. Joffrey
It is anything but. At the top of the ship’s rope ladder, a man grabs Sansa’s shoulders and helps her over. “Lord Baelish,” Sansa says, quite stunned to see Littlefinger. “Peytr,” he tells her to call him. “I’m sure you had quite a fright. Rest easy,” he adds. In the boat below, Ser Dontos prepares to say his goodbyes (so he can get back before someone notices), when Littlefinger reminds him to collect his fee – 10,000. Instead, he gets an arrow through the head. “You don’t want the queen to hear, do you?” Petyr tells Sansa when she screams. “A thousand gold cloaks are searching for you. And if they found you? How do you think they’d punish the girl who murdered the king,” he asks her. “You must admit it looks suspicious. The King who executed your father, tormented you for years, and you fled the scene of his murder,” Littlefinger points out. “Why did you kill him?” Sansa says, not referring to Joffrey, but Ser Dontos. “Because he was a drunk and a fool and I don’t trust drunk fools,” Littlefinger says, informing Sansa that Ser Dontos followed his orders – for coin. “Money buys a man’s silence for a time; a bolt in the heart buys it forever,” he says. He goes on to reveal that the family necklace Ser Dontos gave Sansa previously was something Peytr had made recently. “You’re safe with me, sailing home,” Littlefinger adds.
Margaery & Lady Olenna, King’s Landing: Sitting overlooking the sea, Margaery is feeling cursed. Both of her husbands have died (Renly and Joffrey). “Nonsense, your circumstances have improved remarkably,” Lady Olenna says. “You may not have enjoyed watching him die, but you enjoyed it more than you would have enjoyed being married to him.” To cheer her granddaughter up, Lady Olenna hints at something. “Our alliance with the Lannisters remains every bit as necessary for them as it remains unpleasant for us. You did wonderful work on Joffrey,” Lady Olenna says. “The next one should be easier.”
The Lannisters, King’s Landing: Standing next to his grieving mother, Tommen Baratheon looks at his late brother, King Joffrey, whose remains are laid out on a table. Asked what the moment means, by Tywin, Tommen says he knows he will now be crowned king. In order to be a good king, he needs wisdom most – and to listen to his counselors and advisers, who can help him do what’s best, Tywin tells his grandson. “Now, as the king, you’ll have to marry. Do you understand why?” Tywin says, leading Tommen off to explain the birds and the bees.
Dismissing the men watching over Joffrey’s body, Jaime Lannister enters the room and walks up to Cersei. “It was Tyrion. He killed him,” Cersei tells Jaime, before asking him to, “avenge our son,” by killing their brother. Jaime says the trial will get to the truth, but Cersei is convinced Tyrion will “squirm his way to freedom. … I want him dead,” she says pleading and crying. Jaime hugs her close and after a moment, Cersei kisses him, before quickly pulling away. “You’re a hateful woman. Why have the gods made me love a hateful woman,” Jaime says, spinning Cersei around to face him. He kisses her hard and starts unwrapping her dress as she stands with her back to Joffrey’s displayed remains. As Jaime rips her clothing, Cersei tells him to stop. She starts to give in, and then changes her mind again. “It’s not right,” she says, as Jaime takes her, on the floor, just beneath Joffrey’s lifeless body. “I don’t care,” Jaime says.
PHOTOS: Scenes From ‘Game Of Thrones’ — ‘Breaker Of Chains’ & More
Arya & The Hound, Near Fairmarket: How close are they to the Eyrie, where Arya’s aunt Lysa lives? The Hound doesn’t know, but he’s not trying to delay their journey. “Believe me girl, I want you there as soon as I can. Get my gold, be on my way,” he tells her, suggesting he might end up fighting as a sellsword for the Second Sons (note – the group Daario originally came from). Thinking about her own future, Arya suggests she’d like to visit Braavos one day, a place she has friends (a reference to Season 2’s Jaqen H’ghar). Before she can explain any further, a man and his daughter spot them. Arya handles the situation, explaing The Hound (she calls him her “father”), fought for The Tullys of Riverrun (Catelyn Stark’s family). Pleased to hear it, the man invites them over for rabbit stew.
After eating, conversing and The Hound agreeing to stay to help with farm work and fending off the Freys (as in Walder Frey) who are plundering and stealing, Arya gets some rest. The next morning, she’s woken by screams. Running outside she sees the man has been knocked to the ground and The Hound is walking away with his silver.
“You told me you weren’t a thief,” Arya screams. “He’s a good man, his daughter makes a nice stew, and they’ll both be dead come winter,” The Hound explains. “You’re the worst sh** in the Seven Kingdoms,” an outraged Arya spits back. “There’s plenty worse than me. I just understand the way things are. How many Stark’s they got to behead before you figure it out?” The Hound asks her.
Davos Seaworth & Stannis Baratheon, Dragonstone: “I am now faced with a great opportunity, and I am powerless to take advantage of it,” Stannis tells Davos as news arrives of Joffrey’s death (he’s still furious at Davos for saving Gendry, the royal bastard Melisandre was going to sacrifice in Season 3 for Stannis’ political gain).
Angry that Davos has only rallied a few Houses to his side, he grows even angrier when Davos suggests they get sellswords, or an army from across the sea. “We’re willing to use blood magic to put you on the throne, but we’re not willing to pay men to fight?” Davos asks. It doesn’t matter anyway. They have no gold. “If I do not press my claim, my claim will be forgotten. I will not become a page in someone else’s history book,” Stannis tells him. “I’m running out of time, Ser Davos, which means you’re running out of time.”
In the bowels of Dragonstone, while meeting for his regular reading lesson with Stannis’ daughter, Shireen, Davos gets an idea for how to get that gold, and asks the girl to write a letter, “To the officers of the Iron Bank of Braavos, from Stannis Baratheon, the one true King of Westeros.”

Samwell & Gilly, Mole’s Town: In order to protect her from the men at The Wall, Sam brings Gilly to an establishment in Mole’s Town for room and board only. “No other work,” he insists to the woman running the house.
Prince Oberyn, King’s Landing: Mid-orgy, the door to the brothel opens. “May we have the room,” Tywin says, sending the participants to the exit, leaving just Oberyn and Tywin in the room. Alone, Tywin presses Oberyn to tell him what he discussed with Tyrion at the brothel, previously. It was the death of his sister Elia, Oberyn tells him, an act he blames Tywin for (and which Tywin denies involvement in). Vengeance in his heart, Oberyn asks for a meeting with The Mountain (the man who killed Elia), and Tywin proposes a deal — serve as a judge in Tyrion’s trial, and he’ll set it up. And there is another reveal – he wants Oberyn on the Small Council for the new king. Daenerys Targaryen has three dragons, and only Oberyn’s people – the Dornish — were able to resist dragons in the past. “We need each other. You help me serve justice to the King’s assassins and I’ll help you serve justice to Elia’s,” Tywin says holding out his hand.

Tyrion, Podrick, King’s Landing: After removing the contraband he had hidden away in his leathers and fabrics, Pod breaks the latest news to Tyrion – he’ll stand trial in two weeks for a crime he didn’t commit. And Pod has more news — Oberyn will be one of the judges. The discussion turning to potential defense witnesses, Tyrion learns Sansa has been missing since Joffrey’s death. “The girl’s no assassin. Whoever killed the King wanted me to lose my head for it, and with my wife’s disappearance, it makes me seem that much more guilty,” Tyrion notes. Unable to see Bronn (who is under suspicion now), Tyrion asks Pod to ask Jaime to come visit him. Heading out of the cell, Pod stops and turns. “There’s something else,” the young man says. He’s been asked to testify against Tyrion (in exchange for being named a Ser). Concern fills Tyrion’s face. “If I have to take that long walk to the executioner’s block, I don’t want to see your head already mounted,” he tells the young man. “Get yourself out of King’s Landing before it’s too late. Pod, this is farewell.”
A Village In The North: Wildling attack! A young man runs and hides as Ygritte, Tormund Giantsbane and those cannibal Thenns tear apart a village, slashing the people with swords and knives. A hand reaches under a wagon, grabbing a young boy trying to hide from the carnage. Styr, the leader of the Thenn, tells the boy he will kill his parents, and eat them afterward. “Go tell the Crows at Castle Black,” Styr says, releasing the terrified boy.
Rose Leslie On The New Wildlings In ‘Thrones’ & Her Old ‘Downton Abbey’ Character
The Night’s Watch, The Wall: Arguments erupt over how to retaliate against the Wildlings, as the boy stands at Jon Snow’s side. Maester Aemon reminds them they are “the watchers on The Wall,” and Ser Alliser Thorne turns to Jon for his thoughts. “Mance Rayder is coming. If the Wildlings breach The Wall, they’ll roll over everything and everyone for a thousand miles before they reach an army that can stop them,” he says. Ser Alliser Thorne surprisingly agrees – they’ll sure up Castle Black.
Horns sound in the distance. It’s Grenn and Edd arriving back at Castle Black, having barely survived the mutiny at Craster’s Keep, where former Night’s Watch man Karl is now running things. “We need to ride North and kill them all,” Jon says, worried. “I told the Wildlings we had over a thousand men at Castle Black alone. Karl and the others know the truth as well as we do. How long do you think they’ll keep that information to themselves when the Wildlings are peeling their fingernails off?” Jon says. “Mance has all he needs to crush us, he just doesn’t know it yet. Once he gets his hands on them, he will.”
Daenerys, Outside The Gates Of Mereen: A light appears through the gates of the city as Dany and her army stand outside of Mereen. The champion of the city has come out to face hers. Dany’s most loyal (Grey Worm, Ser Jorah and Ser Barristan) offer their services, but she refuses all of them due to their value. She doesn’t refuse Daario Naharis, who offers to fight for her.
Mereen’s champion laughs, and urinates in front of her forces, before mounting his horse and charging at Daario who just stands in the dust. Aware he isn’t moving, Dany shoots Daario a worried glance. He grins, turns back, quietly pulls out his knife, puts it on his shoulder, and kisses it. “Argh,” he grunts, flinging the knife into the horse’s eye. The great stallion falls, his rider with him. Whipping out his curved blade, he kills Mereen’s champion who rolls to his feet in the dust. Daario turns to Dany and nods.
Outraged, the Mereen soldiers fire their arrows toward Dany’s people (none of them reach her army). In turn, Daario urinates on the ground, shocking those in Mereen. The contest over, Dany speaks. “Your enemy is beside you,” she tells the slaves of Mereen. “I bring you a choice and I bring your enemies what they deserve,” she says as giant catapults are rolled forward. “Fire!” she cries, as barrels are chucked at Mereen’s city walls. Breaking open, their contents – broken collars – spill onto Mereen’s streets. A slave in his collar picks one up and turns to look at his master.

Animal Fair couldn’t be more excited for Seth Meyers to have hosted last night’s Emmy Awards! He is such a nice and down to earth guy. A either love a man who can make us laugh, or a man who has a soft spot for furry animals and it seems as if Saturday Night Lives’ head writer Seth Meyers has both of those melting attributes; so I’ll take that back, we LOVE a man who can make us laugh and a man who loves his dog.
Now days it seems as if funny man Meyers is all over the place. Aside from seeing him as SNL’s Weekend Update anchor man, he has also hosted the Espy Awards the last three years, hosted the 2011 White House Correspondents Association dinner and has been seen hosting and attending many events all over the country. It’s safe to say that Meyers has, if not already started taking over the comedic era of our generation. So when we found out here at AnimalFair that Seth Meyers has a love for dogs we just couldn’t resist digging our little paws in and finding out what it is, or should I say WHO it is that is taking up the comedian’s time off camera and it turns out her name is Frisbee, Frisbee the Italian Greyhound.
Comedian Seth Myers resides in NYC with his Italian Greyhound, Frisbee.
Meyers grew up with dogs in his family’s home in the town of Bedford, New Hampshire. Catchy, none the least, Meyers talked about ‘a giant Pyrenees that so was big, he could open the doors with his paws.’ Always having a dog around the Meyers family also kept it all in the same dog breed when it came to the two dogs they always kept in their home, one Great Pyrenees and one Old English Sheep dog. He explained, when one passed away, they would replace him or her with another dog of the same breed. As a matter of fact, the family has had five sheep dogs, all named Albert! So when one of the dogs passed away while Seth was away in college his parents gave him the horrific job of telling his younger brother Josh, who attended the same school as Seth about the passing. He told his brother that he was stopping by his dorm room to hangout and that he’ll bring some sandwiches. When Meyers got to his brothers dorm room he found his brother crying. Josh stated to Seth that he already knew that the dog had died because as he said, ‘you would never bring sandwiches over to my room for no reason!’
Now let’s fast forward a couple of decades later in the lovely city of New York where Meyers lives and has his first dog ever in the city, Frisbee. Meyers and his wife decided to get the Italian Greyhound when they babysat a dog of the same breed for a friend and decided that an Italian Greyhound is perfect for them. Being that it’s the holidays aka Meyers favorite time of year he explains all the excitement as well as all the holiday parties and to no surprise it’s also Frisbee’s favorite time. There’s no better partner in crime at a holiday party than your very own four legged best friend, but even Meyers has a hard time keeping an eye on his Greyhounds every move. “My biggest food fear when I host a holiday party is Frisbee,” Meyers explains. “She can jump on a table and get away with a large amount of finger food before you even notice the blur.”
Seth Meyers and Frisbee eaiting in Vogue!
With his new job, it’s safe to say that Seth Meyers has a lot going on in his life between his career, and Frisbee. It’s not every day you hear about celebrities and their personal stories about them and their pets but when you do, it’s always a good one and I’m sure Frisbee will be going into 2013 full swing with her comedian owner. They do say that’s a man’s best friend so hey, if Seth loves the game of Frisbee, so do we!

I decided to test a technique I read about eons ago. You know, those little tidbits of information you store in the "That's interesting, I need to try that one day" folder in your memory filing cabinet. This week was it was time to pull this one out of the filing cabinet.
The "in a nutshell version" is an embossing technique for clay. Their version was carving Foam Core or something. I don't have the time or patience for carving right now. I don't mind my designs being recessed, most of mine are for that matter. I was thinking about using puffy paints. Of all the supplies in my studio, Puffy Paint isn't one. I have had them in the past, a must with kids. I remembered I purchased a product with a fine that you could make raised dots & lines, it dried hard and the lines stayed raised. Perfect!
I made a design on the side of a box to see if I could draw holding and squeezing a bottle at the same time. It is hard sometimes to get the liquid to flow smoothly and then comes the annoying air bubbles. Then I realized it didn't have to be perfect (the anal Graphic Artist in me has to have it perfect). After all I was going to be pressing a clay slab on top of the design and I could make corrections to the clay impression. Above is how it dried.
This is the result of pressing clay down onto the design. Pretty cool!!
My little test worked! And the crowd goes wild!!
I found a shelf I have taken out of my cabinet…recycle, reuse. The shelf had a texture I liked, so let the doodling design begin!! The plan is to continue to add to the design so I have about an 8.5" x 11" design space to work with…bowls, mugs, plates, pendants, many possibilities. Enough space so the design changes with each piece. I like possibilities!
Stay tuned for the results in 3D.
My question is:
What have you tried in your "That's interesting, I need to try that one day" folder in your memory filing cabinet?
Leave a comment answering the question and you could win a Circle Button!
Have a great day!!

I recently had an opportunity to use a rolling mill! Way fun!
Oh how clever! I will have to try that one myself one day! As for other things, well, the list keeps growing. At the moment, I am trying to find time to do some more simple metal work and polymer clay play.
I recently built up the courage to make some polymer clay beads and was pretty happy with them.
Last month I used Paperclay for the first time and made art beads for the challenge.
I'm thinking of ways to do that for this month's challenge.
Love the circle button. Looks like an eye.
Haven't tried anything new lately, but I am definitely add this one to my file of "cool new ideas"! Love that you shared it with us, Tari. Thanks so much.
Beaded roller beads. I've always liked nice leather. Like everyone else, have seen lots of it lately, but I longed to use it in a distinctive way. When I ran across some 5mm round leather, it struck a cord (pardon the pun). I knew exactly what I wanted to do with them--beaded roller beads.
At least I thought I knew, but I didn't count on their affinity for congregating into 2-inch slides. Funny how they have a mind of their own, isn't it?
I always meant to try to make a basket out of polymer clay.
For a recent Fall themed challenge I created a cornucopia and filled it with two toned orange roses.
I look forward to making more baskets when my muse inspires.

That right there is genius! I have been looking for a way to make my own designs but all the usual ways have fallen short. I love this and think I will test it out with my polymer clay. First I have to go shopping for puffy paint!
I love it! I think I have some left over paints from the 'when my kids were little days'. I am going to have to play with this idea (it is going into my must try file). To answer your question I recently tried techniques that have been on my must try list. I painted on copper and I used colored pencil on copper. I think I need to work on these techniques a bit more but it is fun to try new ideas. I'll be blogging about those two techniques soon.Hip Hop supergroup Slaughterhouse recently spoke about having a grammy-winning rapper like Eminem as their boss and how much creative freedom the Shady family gives them.
"He's kinda walking eggshells around us creatively. He's telling us basically, 'Do exactly what y'all did last time. We're just gonna do it on a bigger level. Y'all don't need me to make records; y'all can do that,' " Royce said backstage at Rock the Bells of Slim Shady's involvement. )

—Attributed to Sonny Boy Williamson
Every once in awhile, in the oceans of re-issues and re-releases of “classic” music oversaturating the market, inundating and confusing the consumer, a few genuinely good ones come in on the surge. Anyone with a lick of musical sense will want to hear this long set by Sonny Boy Williamson, and once they do, they will likely seek out more music by him and soon swell the legions of Sonny Boy’s fans.
Sonny Boy Williamson
The Real Folk Blues / More Real Folk Blues
(Chess)
US: 12 Mar 2002
He was one of the most innovative, clever, and talented blues harpists ever recorded, maybe ever period. That alone would have been enough to secure him a place in anyone’s personal blues hall of fame, but he also sang as he played, and you wonder when it was he ever stopped to take a breath of air. Adding to his skilled performance level, he usually performed highly original songs he had fashioned himself, occasionally self-deprecating rather than blues bluff but all with vivid story elements selected by a master story teller.
The Real Folk Blues series at the time of first release in the middle sixties was met with a cooler than usual reception, viewed as a brazen if not cynical marketing ploy aimed at the middle-class, college-aged, folk festival going, finger-snappy blues digging, baby beatnik, deep pockets in their faded levis market by the very market that had been targeted. There was a slight feeling of embarrassment, suspecting that we were being pandered to. Then some ineffable visceral reaction in the gut passed unspoken from person to person like a flu, a viler convulsion erupted since we harbored collective but unmentioned dark suspicions this product was a blatant raking in of profits squeezed from musical geniuses paid as work-for-hire. We imagined that a quart of whiskey and a few folded twenties counted out and slapped down on the counter for the session players to pick up would be all any of these musicians would ever see from this, no matter whose name was given writer’s credits.
What we might have been thinking and feeling probably didn’t bother Chess Records at all. Nor would it have effected Mr. Williamson too much, as he had died in 1965 just slightly prior to the release of the first of these records. Just as he was on the cusp of becoming even more famous, but assuredly never to become rich and famous. But that was then, and this is now. Now we’re the middle-aged, college-educated, finger-snappy blues digging et ceteras and this is a value-loaded budget-priced series re-released maybe with us in mind once again. So much time has elapsed, all there is left to talk about is the music, which seems even more splendid now than it did originally, if that’s possible. And so it should rightly be listened to.
On these 24 selections, which were originally released as two separate LP’s, Williamson is surrounded in Chess studio sessions by some of the greatest sidemen of an era, and there is no other music like it. Drummers who tastefully ride just behind the beat, bass players like Willie Dixon who bounce around that backbeat and wriggle more rhythm around and out; Robert Lockwood, Luther Tucker, Matt Murphy, or Buddy Guy sparkling on guitars without overdoing a single note. The usual economic four-piece group expanded to include Otis Spann or Lafayette Leake chiming their keyboards, and funky R&B saxophones. Dropping into each tune means a complex lead-in that is never once the same. Williamson’s singing is mellow, rich with vibrato, and sweetly rough, and his playing is out of this world.
This is probably not the same sort of music that was broadcast in 1941 on the old King Biscuit Flour Time. When the hottest part of the day arrived and the whistle blew to allow people to leave their work and head home to eat. As they joined together around the family table, for fifteen minutes they could listen to Sonny Boy Williamson live on the air, blowing his horn, singing, and talking. He was famous within broadcast range, his style of playing went out to influence people in the audience; and his image even went on a sack of cornmeal. Moving around in the South could be difficult, and legends of his incarcerations abound. One time, he got in a little trouble for public intoxication and he talked the sheriff into letting him go on with his scheduled radio appearance on King Biscuit; he played that show in leg shackles. Another time, he and fellow blues traveler Robert Lockwood were picked up for vagrancy and locked in a cell. A windstorm hit, blowing down the building, allowing them to go free.
There are some great blues here, especially with Williamson at the forefront with his masterful broad range of technique, phrasing, and timing. His greatest R&B hit from 1955 “Don’t Start Me To Talking” wasn’t included as the selections are drawn from Williamson’s later years playing (1960-1964). “Help Me” has a spooky-sounding organ (by either Lafayette Leake or Billy Emerson); “Nine Below Zero” is essential Chicago blues, really being tossed out into the cold. “Trying to Get Back on My Feet Again” is the slinkiest R&B. Tenor and baritone sax are moaning blues notes with muted guitar notes plucked out in between that echo the exact same lines the saxes are playing.
Winding the clock back is “The Hunt”. This is a novelty tune complete with lively piano, like a vaudeville routine about going coon hunting, down there by Big Black where there are some of the biggest coons ever seen. The dogs are turned loose and begin circling, while Lockwood’s guitar bays like hounds. The image of Willie Dixon and Sonny Boy Williamson standing around the microphone, yelping, barking, yipping, and growling, once imagined is never to be forgotten. The hunt continues all the way out of sight down into the river. But there’s something about the way the song ends with the coon killing the dog that tells me this might be one of those “coded” songs I’ve heard so muchKong Pull & Squeak Bone is a revolutionary dog toy that pulls and squeaks!

A:Those of us who are really into hammered dulcimers and the instruments that sound so great with them seem to have a passion for festivals. It's where we see our closest friends and make new ones. It's where we learn the "hot new tunes," or learn from old-timers the tunes of previous eras.
In Michigan, our festivals are primarily "outdoors" so they are held in the summer months. But they range greatly in structure. Some are very organized, some are really just camping weekends. It doesn't matter, we all want to be there!
The biggest hammered dulcimer events in the world are held in Michigan. The largest is the Evart Funfest, which has been on-going for something like 37 years! If you are a dulcimer player (of the hammered variety), you've heard of the ODPC Funfest. It's Mecca for dulcimer players. It's the one "must attend" event.
We've had folks fly in from Japan, stay for the three days of the festival, and fly back. We've had folks who have scheduled weddings around the festival. There have been others who have driven from Mexico, or regularly from California, JUST so they can attend the festival.
It would be interesting to see just how many events have been re-scheduled because of the funfest, or how many events have been "missed" because the Evart Funfest is the most important event of the year for a great share of the people who attend.
So put the date of the ODPC Funfest on your future calendars in ink and don't miss any of them. In the meanwhile, you can find other smaller events around the country. They are also wonderful with a loyal following.Share this news story Club co-founder Christoph Klenzendorf expects the new project at the former site of Bar25 to begin in less than a year. KaterHolzig co-founder Christoph Klenzendorf says his club will throw its final party in August of 2013, three months after his next project, Holzmarkt, is set to open. Klenzendorf was one of the main forces behind the now-defunct Bar25, and currently works (and lives) across the Spree at KaterHolzig. He confirmed plans to close KaterHolzig during an interview with Resident Advisor as part of this week's BerMuDa conference. "Our lease is finished in September, so I think we will hold the closing party in August," he said. Unlike Bar 25, it seems KaterHolzig will actually shut for good after its first closing party, as Klenzendorf and co already have their eye on the next place. "We will have the opening party for Holzmarkt on May 1st, just like we always have." Holzmarkt is the result of a coup by Klenzendorf and other members of the collective behind KaterHolzig, many of whom were also involved in Bar25. This May, two years after Bar25 was forced to close, its former site along the Spree was auctioned off by its owner, a waste disposal company called BSR. With the help of investors, Klenzendorf and his associates managed to win the auction, effectively buying back the exact spot they'd been kicked off of. By then they already knew what they'd build there: a public space for artists, students, kids, entrepreneurs and whoever else wandered in or got involved. Plans for Holzmarkt (which means "timber market," the site's use until the 19th century) include a public park (the Mörchenpark), a hotel, a village of artist studios (most of which will have rolling three-month leases to keep things fresh), a restaurant and a 24-hour day care center with space for 30 kids. There will also be a nightclub, and this is the part of Holzmarkt that Klenzendorf expects to be finished in time for an opening party on May 1st, 2013. No further details are available at this point, and naturally there's no way of knowing what kind of complications might arise that would set that opening date back. For more info on Holzmarkt, have a look at their website or this official brochure. Venue: KaterHolzigComposite Of The Sun Showing A Year Of Solar Activity

If the thought of new stiff boots makes you cringe, think again with the Full Tilt Men's First Chair Ski Boot. The stiffest boot in the Full Tilt lineup, this all-mountain boot has a maximum flex index and rigid boo board for ripping foot-to-boot performance but not the agonizing pain. Its ribbed tongue gives the flex a silky smoothness, and the closed-cell Intuition Pro liner with Powerwrap and J-Bar fit mold to your foot for a glove-like fit so you're not unbuckling every run. This wonder-liner also keeps your foot warm and comfy so you don't have to run in and get five-dollar hot cocoa, unless you want to. Widetrack aluminum buckles make cranking down for a precise fit a breeze, and the replaceable rubber sole gives you everlasting grip on slick surfaces. Oh yeah, and then there's the stiffest-boot performance, but you know all about that balls-to-the-walls big-mountain skiing, or else you'd be looking elsewhere.

First Chair as a progressive boot?
Would this boot be too stiff to use for an intermediate like me? Even if I were to switch out the #10 tongue for a softer flex tongue like a #6? I want to consider this boot because it would allow me switch out tongues as I progress in my ability. I'm more of an all mountain carver, and i like to ski trees. I'm 5'10" and around 130 lbs. I read the reviews for the wallisch full tilts but i don't like the way the new ones look and nobody has my size the in old ones.

Doujins...
aren't always porn.
First question says that Hentai means pervert, which is right. Then the next question asks what year was hentai first drawn? I think perverts have been drawn way before that.
I'm as much a fan as anime porn, and I actually liked some of the pictures. The only thing I don't really like is the use of the word "Hentai" in such a way. Some say that it has evolved into what people outside Japan (I'm not Japanese by the way) use it as, but I don't really see it that way. Looks more like the misunderstanding is just going on and on and on.

- Jaden: I saw a kid on TV and I wanted to be that kid, and be on TV too. So, my mom enrolled me at AGI performing arts school in Atlanta where I took dance, vocal and acting classes.
Kidzworld: We hear you’re also a model, who have you modeled for? What was your most fun gig?
- Jaden: Disney, Nivea, Ford Automobile, Chase Bank, Target, Kohl's, Crocs, Gap are a few I have done. My most fun modeling Job was Target because it was a backyard shoot and I got to play with my friend. And it was the first poster I ever saw of myself back home in Atlanta. I was getting socks and looked up and was like, “Mom, that's me!”
Kidzworld: You have a part in the new sci-fi movie After Earth, can you tell us about your character?
- Jaden: I play 9-year-old Kitai Raige, who is the younger Jaden Smith in the movie. My sister is Zoe Kravitz and our dad is Will Smith in the film. He is away a lot of the time, but he always tells us that he loves us.
Kidzworld: Are you a sci-fi fan?
- Jaden: Yes, I Love futuristic movies, and seeing how they are created is so exciting to me!
Kidzworld: What was it like working with Will Smith and Jaden Smith?
- Jaden: Well I really didn't get to work with Jaden Smith as I play his younger version in the movie. However, I met him and he was really cool. He actually asked to meet me my first day on set. Mr. Will Smith was really down to earth and he treated me like family. I first met him in hair and makeup and I said, “Hey, dad!” and he said, “Hey, son,” and we bonded. He also invited me to hang out at his trailer base camp when were where not filming.
Kidzworld: What was the best part of filming After Earth?
- Jaden: Seeing all the cool things on set and how they made the futuristic homes and spaceships was awesome. But the best part was The best part was that I got to work with my idol, Will Smith, and hang out with him at base camp. They had a basketball court, pool table, ping-pong table and flat screen TVs.
Kidzworld: What is the best piece of advice you've received since starting out?
- Jaden: Don't be afraid to go out of your comfort zone.
Kidzworld: Which actors do you look up to the most?
- Jaden: Will Smith, and not just because I did a movie with him, but because he always gives positive advice and he's a great actor.
Kidzworld: What kinds of roles would you like to play in the future?
- Jaden: Definitely a super hero, like Spider-Man or Iron Man. I would love to do stunts and save people. I think that's cool!
Kidzworld: What has been your fave role to play so far?
- Jaden: Spindle in "Mr. Monster", where I'm the cool brave kid that all the other kids look up to. Being on set was so fun because it was all kids so filming was just like playing with your friends. Plus, the wardrobe was cool and I got to carry a crossbow as my weapon.
Your Fave...
- Movie: Iron Man 3, but I'm sure it's going to be After Earth once it comes out!

Posted Dec 1, 2011 3:04 PM
Ok, the day is here. My BIL came last night and ER is early tomorrow. So yesterday I had about 5 follis that were 16mm or more and a ton of little ones that probably wont have anything in them. The biggest one was 22mm so I had to trigger. My E2 on Tuesday was over 1100, they didnt tell me my results yesterday. I am really hoping for at least 5 mature eggs and 4 decent embryos. We are going to ICSI them. My sister comes in on Sunday for a Monday 3day transfer. Please pray that this works for her. I am so hopeful and I am cheering on my ovaries for at least one good egg! This cycle looks like the one I had with my DS in 1/08 where I only had 6 follis but 5 produced good embryos, I transferred 2, m/c'd 1 and 2 made it to blast to freeze. However, I was only 34 then and FSH was 10, same AFC. Wish us?)[Date Index]

Re: problem with append
There are some errors here
1. The function name is AppendTo (with capital T) - Mathematica is case
sensitive
2. Even this would not help, since r={} in the body of AppendTo refers to
the return value of the assignment rather than to rr
Combining 1 and 2 above results with the immediate correction
rr = {};
For[a = 2, a < 6, a++, For[b = 2, b < 6, b++, AppendTo[rr, a^b]]]
rr
But any decent Mathematica programmer is aware of how inefficient Append,
AppendTo, Prepend, PrependTo and Insert are
You have many other ways, which are more efficient. Note that Do and For
return Null, and what you do is adopting the concept of side effects to
generate lists - a highly inefficient way in Mathematica
Read the documentation on
Table, Array, Flatten
to enhance your programming in Mathematica

The meeting between these two teams is always filled with aggression, hard hits, and until recently, the Big Ten Championship.
Technically this game is meaningless to the Buckeyes, but Jim Tressel won't admit that. OSU clinched a Rose Bowl appearance with their win over Iowa last weekend. Quarterback Terrelle Pryor will be heading into hostile Ann Arbor, looking for his first win at "The Big House."
The importance of this game leans towards the maize and blue. Talk has stirred this season of the firing of coach Rich Rodriguez. I feel this is ridiculous, but that argument is meant for another article. Rodriguez is 1-5 against his rivals (OSU, MSU, and ND). No one realizes the importance of this game more then the head coach of Michigan. If Tate Forcier can lead this team to a win, Michigan fans will decrease the temperature for Rich Rod's hot seat.
A win for the Wolverines doesn't only mean a win over their arch-rival, but a bowl appearance. Before the "Rich-Rod era," Michigan went to 34 straight bowl games, and had been a dominant powerhouse in college football. The Michigan tour bus has encountered some bumps in the road recently, and trust me, two years without a bowl game would be too much torture for the program and its fans.
If the Wolverines can pull out an upset, a 5-7 record will turn into 6-6 and a bowl game. If the Wolverines fail again at beating the Buckeyes, Rich Rod will continue to hear chants of his termination from the program. And with a new coach and a new offensive system, this program may have to start over from scratch, again.
Remember when Michigan went 4-0, Rich Rod had a safe job, and Wolverine fans thought the program was "back?" Well, now they have fallen from the rankings, lost six of their last seven, and the sure bowl game isn't so sure anymore.
The will to win may not be enough for Michigan to get a win on Saturday. The defense will need to slow down Pryor, especially on third down. They must stay consistent throughout the game and dominate in the trenches.
Michigan has had a trend this year to play great for one half, and completely collapse in the other. The offense can not fall behind by much, since OSU has been firing on all cylinders lately. Michigan will not be favored to win, that's a given, they will need to out-perform Ohio State, because they may be fighting for their coach's job.
Ohio State has dominated the rivalry in recent years, and fans have began to think this game as not much of a rivalry. Just to make this clear, Michigan is still winning in the head to head record, so before this rivalry is forgotten, OSU must take the record. Michigan is slipping in the rivalry lately, but if they bounce back they could remind people that this cross-state battle still is one of the best rivalries in college sports.

Back to Top“We're looking to hire energetic, personable activists that want to make a difference in the 2008 election cycle.”- Senator Russ Feingold
Senator Feingold has long believed that a strong
grassroots field program is the key to electoral victory. As such,
Senator Feingold's Progressive Patriots
Fund created the Patriot Corps in 2006 as a
way to support progressive candidates across the nation. In the lead-up
to the 2008 election, the Progressive Patriots Fund will again
be hiring, training and sending field staff to key races across the
country.
The program will run from September 4th – November 12th,
2008. Participants will be paid $500/week and will be provided housing
free of charge on their assigned campaigns.Once chosen, Patriot Corps
members will participate in an extensive, multi-day training program in
Milwaukee, WI. Senator Feingold’s senior staff will personally train
participants. Training will run from Thursday, Sept. 4th – Saturday,
Sept. 6th. Participants will be expected to report to their assigned
campaign on Tuesday, Sept. 9th. This training will focus on volunteer
recruitment, organizing a canvass, running a phone bank, working with
local activists, advanced GOTV training, and staffing a
candidate.Patriot Corps members will then be placed on targeted
campaigns across the country for the last two months leading up to the
election.
In 2006, Patriot Corps staff members were placed on a
wide variety of campaigns including Amy Klobuchar for Senate, Jennifer
Granholm for Governor, Bill Winter for Congress, Steve Kagen for
Congress, Ned Lamont for Senate, Rich Olive for State Senate, John
Courage for Congress and Patricia Madrid for Congress.While we’re
looking for organizers with experience, we’re also hoping to hire
activists with a willingness to learn, word hard, and bring victory home
this fall. To apply for the Patriots Corps Program, please send a resume and cover letter to Paula Zellner at zellner@progressivepatriotsfund.com. All applications must be submitted by Monday, July 28th.
What will my work schedule be like?
While your workweek will be established by your
individual campaigns, field organizers on a competitive campaign are
often expected to work 7 days a week. It is not uncommon for campaigns
to establish a workday that can be 10-12 hours per day. We are looking
for a significant commitment from Patriot Corps participants and you
should understand this before you decide if this program is right for
you. Participants should not expect to leave the campaign site for any
significant amount of time during the eight weeks they are working on
their assigned campaign.
How will I get to the training in Milwaukee and to and from my assigned campaign?
Participants are expected to make their own arrangements
for travel to Milwaukee for the initial Patriot Corps training in
September. The Progressive Patriots Fund will help subsidize your
expenses by reimbursing you for your gas costs for travel from the
Milwaukee training to your assigned campaign and your return to
Milwaukee following the election. While having access to a car is not a
requirement for participation in the program, it is strongly recommended
that Patriot Corps participants have their own vehicle. In order to be
effective campaigners, applicants are generally expected to be able to
provide transportation to travel around their district.
Where will I be housed during the training in Milwaukee and after being assigned to a campaign?
Housing will be provided for all participants during the
training in Milwaukee. Once on the campaign, housing will be provided
at no cost to you by the local campaigns. The Progressive Patriots Fund
will work with local campaigns to ensure basic housing arrangements are
made for all Patriot Corps employees. In most cases this will mean
living with a local campaign staff person or volunteer.
What support will I get from the Progressive Patriots Fund while working on my assigned campaign?
Guidance and support will be provided through weekly
conference calls with Progressive Patriots Fund staff. In addition, your
trainers will be available to answer any questions you may have and
will work with you to address any challenges you face while working on
your assigned campaign.
What campaign will I be sent to?
Senator Feingold will be deciding throughout the summer
and fall as to which campaigns we will be targeting. The Progressive
Patriots Fund will match Patriot Corp participants with campaigns where
they will have the greatest impact. Participants will not be given a
list of campaigns from which to choose for their placement.

For tax periods beginning on or after January 1, 2009 and ending on or before December 31, 2017, the Act allows a gasoline tax exemption for that portion of petroleum-based fuel that consists of eligible cellulosic biofuel. St. 2008, c. 206, § 8; M.G.L. c. 64A, §1A. The exemption consists of a reduction in the tax per gallon of gasoline in proportion to the percentage of the fuel content consisting of eligible cellulosic biofuel.
II. Eligible Cellulosic Biofuel
A. Definitions and Determination of Eligible Cellulosic Biofuels
The determination of what fuels qualify as eligible cellulosic biofuels will be made by the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources ("DOER") in consultation with the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection ("DEP") and the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs ("EEA"). M.G.L. c. 64A, §§ 1, 1A.
1. Definition of Cellulosic Biofuel
Generally, cellulosic biofuel is derived from cellulose, hemicellulose or lignin [1] derived from renewable biomass. M.G.L. c. 64A, § 1.
2. Definition of Eligible Cellulosic Biofuel
Under the Act, cellulosic biofuel eligible for the gasoline exemption is defined as a cellulosic biofuel that yields at least a 60 per cent reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions relative to average lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions for petroleum-based fuel sold in 2005, as determined by DOER in consultation with DEP and EEA.
3. Definition and Determination of Renewable Biomass
Under the Act, renewable biomass is defined as non-fossil fuel based material including:
- planted crops, crop residues, planted trees, tree residues from sustainably managed forests;
- waste materials including animal waste and animal by-products;
- organic portions of municipal solid waste, grease trap waste;
- construction and demolition debris; and
- algae
In addition, DOER may determine that other materials are qualified renewable biomass, in consultation with the DEP and EEA. M.G.L. c. 64A, §1.
B. Definitions and Determination of Lifecycle Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Under the Act, lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions are defined as:
- the aggregate quantity of greenhouse gas emissions, including direct emissions and significant indirect emissions such as significant emissions from and use changes, as determined by DOER in consultation with DEP and EEA,
related to:
- the full fuel cycle. M.G.L. c. 64A, §1.
- Feedstock is further defined as raw material used to produce fuel.
III. Gasoline Tax Exemption Implementation
A. Application for Classification of Eligible Cellulosic Biofuel; Statement of Qualification
DOER is responsible for determining what cellulosic biofuels qualify as "eligible cellulosic biofuels." Manufacturers and wholesale distributors of cellulosic biofuel who seek to have their fuel classified as eligible cellulosic biofuel shall provide documentation satisfactory to DOER that such fuel yields at least a 60 per cent reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions per unit of delivered energy, in comparison to the petroleum-based fuel displaced. M.G.L. c. 64A, §1A.
If DOER finds that a cellulosic biofuel meets all the eligibility criteria of an eligible cellulosic biofuel, DOER will provide the manufacturer or wholesale distributor of such cellulosic biofuel with a statement of qualification, including any applicable restrictions and conditions. For further details and information regarding the classification of eligible cellulosic biofuels and the statement of qualification, see regulation 22 CMR 17.00, Advanced Biofuels Qualification and Minimum Content Requirements.
B. Determination of Reduction in Lifecycle Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Under the Act, DOER in consultation with DEP and EEA determines the percentage reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions relative to petroleum-based fuel achieved by particular supplies of cellulosic biofuel. In making such determination, DOER shall use information and best practices available from other sources, including other states, the federal government, foreign governments, academic research and private and non-private organizations. M.G.L. c. 64A, §1A.
1. Waste Feedstock; Exemption from Full Lifecycle Analysis
DOER may exempt fuel produced from waste feedstock from a full lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions analysis. [2] In considering such exemption, DOER will determine through an initial review that a waste feedstock will yield at least a 60 per cent lifecycle greenhouse gas reduction, is free of hazardous materials and hazardous waste, and meets any other conditions established by DOER. M.G.L. c. 64A, §1A.
2. Definition of Waste Feedstock
Waste feedstock is defined under the Act as previously used or discarded solid, liquid or contained gaseous material with heating value resulting from industrial, commercial or household food service activities that would otherwise be stored, treated, transferred or disposed. Waste feedstock includes, but is not limited to, waste vegetable oils, waste animal fats, substances derived from wastewater and the treatment of wastewater or grease trap waste. Waste feedstock shall not include petroleum-based waste or waste that otherwise meets the definition of hazardous waste, unless otherwise determined by DEP. M.G.L. c. 64A, §1.
C. Administration of Exemption
The production of cellulosic biofuels, worldwide and in the Commonwealth, is in early development and experimental stages. As described in this TIR and in regulation 225 CMR 17.00, DOER, in consultation with DEP and EEA, will determine which cellulosic biofuels are in commercial production, available in the Commonwealth, and eligible for the exemption. Upon receipt of a statement of qualification issued by DOER, and on a form to be provided by the Department of Revenue ("DOR"), a manufacturer or wholesale distributor may obtain the benefit of the exemption by applying for a refund of gasoline taxes paid on eligible cellulosic biofuels to the extent that an exemption is authorized by the Act. St. 2008, c. 206, § 4. At this time, DOR anticipates that such refund application will be filed with the monthly gasoline tax return.

All your stuff is great, one character suggestion?
Ok I've watched all of your cartoons more than twice, so i figured i should start giving you ratings for your good work ^^;
I love pretty much ALL of your stuff. This one is pretty good even though i get confused about to what it is refering.
My fav X-Men characters are Gambit and Nightcrawler, I'd love it if you did more with them ? ^^; pwease? Though they seem to be sort of supporting characters for many of the comics. And I dont like the way Gambit is draw/written for in various issues. They make him a bit too pathetic.

New Girl: Welp, it's official, folks—Nick and Jess are officially over. The morning after their break-up, we witnessed the most uncomfortably awkward scene in New Girl's history. Seriously is there was an award for the most realistically cringe-worthy moment of awkwardness, that scene would definitely win it. After spending the entire episode trying to prove that they were "OK" with the break-up, Nick (who was high on anti-anxiety medicine) and Jess (who was drunk out of her mind) finally admitted that they are so not OK.
Jess ended the episode with the exact same post-breakup ritual we were introduced to in the pilot: she was alone on the couch and bawling her eyes out while watching Dirty Dancing over and over again. Nick, from the other room, called Jess to check in on her and even sweetly tossed her some tissues when she ran out. It was a touching scene, but honestly we've just got to say it: Why on earth are they still living together?!

Glee: Seriously?! What on earth are we going to do with you, Glee? Tonight's episode was an awkward sex-filled mess, and the only good thing this episode brought was a sweet Finchel flashback when Rachel was recalling her first time with Finn to Mercedes. Here's the sitch (and yes that was a Kim Possible reference): Artie has apparently turned into a sex-crazed, condom-hating man who will sleep with any bimbo that walks down the hall. His karma punishment for being a player? Chalmydia. Ew.
Meanwhile, Blaine has been scarfing down as much fatty foods as possible, watching porn, and secretly sabotaging his fiancé's newfound hotness out of jealousy. Once again Klaine had a super rocky episode and we're starting to seriously doubt that the writers are going to keep these too together. As for Samcedes, Sam set up a romantic room full of candles to tell Mercedes that he's willing to wait to have sex for as long as she wants. Awww!

The Mindy Project: What do you do when your heart is broken and you want to move on? Think like a Peter! The always-hilarious Peter took control of Mindy's love-life this week and pushed her to hit on the hottest guy in the bar. So who was this mystery man? None other than New Girl's Max Greenfield! Although Lee seemed like a sweet guy at first, by the end of the episode he was such a douchebag that he made Schmidt look like a freakin' angel.
Not only did Lee sneak out of Mindy's apartment after their one-night stand, we also discovered that he's a cheating creep who is also married! Tool, party of one?! We know that Mindy will be OK, because well, duh she's Mindy and she's the best. In other news, Danny convinced Tamra to break off things with Morgan because "office relationships never work." Hmm, projecting much, Dr. Castellano? By the end of the episode, Danny called up Sally and invited her over to his place for a little late night TV sesh.

Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: After last week's shocking episode, Ward continued to be a two-timing secret agent working as Garrett's right-hand man at Hydra and his first act was to free Raina and welcome her to the dark side. We hate to admit it, but we kind of really like watching this new twist in Ward's character—he's much less boring now. Since S.H.I.EL.D is officially over, Skye and Coulson decided that the team needs to have their identities erased and their former badges destroyed in order to become ghosts, to become "Agents of Nothing". Eerie
Agent Koenig, played by the always-hilarious Patton Oswalt, informed the team that Fury set up a secret base in case an event like this were to happen. He also assured the team that Nick Fury is indeed dead (Noo!) Until, of course, he took Coulson aside and let him know the secret twist: Fury is alive! (Yaaay!) Together, Ward and Garrett invaded The Fridge and pretty much undid everything the agents accomplished this season by releasing all the previous villains and acquiring all the weapons confiscated—including the Gravitonium!

However now the witchy ancestors have a new plan: Genevieve will be allowed to live as long as the witches succeed in murdering Klaus' child. Yikes! Elijah killed Marcel's right-hand man, Thierry, and that was the final straw for our former leader of the French Quarter.

Supernatural: Did you really think that Lucifer killed Gabriel for good way back in season five? Well, guess again! Gabriel revealed that he is actually alive to Castiel and explained that he has been hiding out in Heaven until the Fall. Now he has finally decided to become a leader and fight back against Metatron. Did all of that seem too good to be true? Well it was, and it was a mean trick for Supernatural to play on us.
Cas discovered that he was tied up and Metatron has been writing a story. He wants Cas to lead an army of angels against him because every good story needs a hero and a villain. (But of course, Metatron thinks he's the hero and wants Cas to be the villain.) He used Gabriel because our beloved angel had a gift for getting people to accept their destined roles. By the end of the episode, Cas set off to find a stairway to heaven and summoned other angels to help him defeat Metatron.

Questions & Answers
good reviews<<The Kerala government on Thursday decided to move the Supreme Court and also file a clarification petition before the Cauvery tribunal in protest against its decision.
Kerala is not satisfied with the share of water allocated to Kerala by the tribunal.
Addressing a press conference after a high-level review meeting chaired by Chief Minister V S Achuthanandan, Water Resources Minister N K Preamchandran said the award did not do justice to the genuine interest of Kerala.
The state had been allocated only 30 tmcft water against its total contribution of 147 tmcft to the Cauvery system, he said. The drastic short fall would seriously affect the state's Banasurasagar hydro electric project implemented at a cost of Rs.365 crores, he said.
The state's assessment was that the tribunal did not make it clear how to share the excess water in Cauvery basin among the riparian states, he said. The award did not even mention the Mukali project that the Supreme Court had referred to the tribunal, he said.
The meeting decided to formulate projects to utilise the 30 tmcft water allocated by the tribunal, he said.
A special cell with officials from Irrigation, Kerala State Electricity Board, Water Resources and agriculture departments would be constituted within a month to prepare projects, he added.I

Lisa is a sweet, loving, older puppy looking for a forever home. As you can see in the video, she is very playful and gentle. Lisa is just out of the puppy stage but still less than a year old. She is pretty much full grown and is a medium sized dog. She is often complimented on her unusually beautiful burnt orange one tone color.
She is potty trained and loves to use the doggie door. Exercise is one of her favorite activities, she swims voluntarily in the pool and loves to run leashed along the side of a bike for rides in the neighborhood. She is crate trained for day trips and sleeping at night, but she doesn't mind sleeping on the bed if you allow her to. She also likes to take car rides to the dog park or anywhere to spend time with you. While home she likes to be in the same room with you and will lay down near by while you do your daily activities. She loves small children and she loves to play with other dogs. She was super gentle when playing with her previous owner's son and submissive to him and the entire family, even when the little boy would tug on her ears. She likes to spend time on her back stretching out on her dog pillow and enjoying everyone's company.
She will pull on a standard leash but behaves perfectly with a restricting color. She loves to chew on toys and Tupperware but never on furniture and really hasn't caused any damage. She has never displayed any anger or aggression but can be shy at first introduction of strangers. She doesn't bark much at all unless there is unknown activity outside in her yard. She is very obedient and well trained. She's a very smart girl.
Unfortunately her previous owners had to move out of the country and it was not possible for them to hake her with them. So, now she is looking for her forever home. Lisa would make a great addition to any family. Please give her the chance that she deserves..

The Hawaii Superferry is adding a second trip to Maui instead of returning to Kauai, a move that caught Maui County officials by surprise.
Maui Mayor Charmaine Tavares said she is "disappointed" in the decision and that the company did not consult with the Maui community.
Tavares noted that the ferry service remains a "contentious matter for many in our community."
Hawaii Superferry President John Garibaldi said the company needs more time to work with the Kauai community before resuming service there.
The company also announced that a promotional fare of $39 will be extended through June..
FULL STORY »
WAILUKU » The Hawaii Superferry is expanding its Oahu-Maui service from once to twice a day and putting off, for now, service to Kauai.
Company officials said they are still meeting with communities on Kauai to ensure a safe and successful resumption of operation.
Service to Kauai was halted in August because of protesters in Nawiliwili Harbor.
Hawaii Superferry President John Garibaldi said the firm's business model calls for running two round trips a day.
"Right now we've got to meet those needs," he said.
But Maui Mayor Charmaine Tavares said she was surprised that Superferry officials did not meet with anyone on her island before adding a second Maui trip.
"I am very disappointed that Hawaii Superferry has made this decision without consulting county officials and members of our community," Tavares said.
"Since the Superferry first arrival less than a month ago, it continues to be a contentious matter for many in our community," the mayor said.
Garibaldi said the second sailing to Maui will benefit customers who want the convenience of having an afternoon voyage. "The second voyage also will greatly benefit our commercial customers, giving them more flexibility in reaching their markets," he added.
Maui Tomorrow Executive Director Irene Bowie said it will be difficult for spotters on the Superferry to see humpback whales at night.
Superferry official Terry O'Halloran said only the return portion of the Oahu-Maui trip takes place at night and that the preferred northern route is out of the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary.
O'Halloran said in addition to the spotters, the first mate and captain will be looking out for whales, and the captain has a built-in night vision scope.
Bowie said the Superferry also has not done a study about the new schedule's impact on traffic.
She said the traffic issue was still being reviewed by Maui Circuit Judge Joel August and that a court hearing was scheduled in February.
Tavares said the county has not been told if the state Department of Transportation had complied with a court order to prepare a traffic impact study for the Superferry, including ways to limit its impact.
O'Halloran said there have been no problems with traffic when the Superferry disembarks passengers and vehicles at Kahului Harbor from 10:15 to 11:15 a.m. during peak daytime hours.
He said the additional trip occurs at off-peak hours and will not cause a traffic problem.
The second Oahu-Maui trip will start Jan. 16 and run Sunday through Friday, leaving Oahu at 3:15 p.m. and arriving on the Valley Isle at 7 p.m.
The Superferry will depart Maui at 8 p.m. and arrive in Honolulu at 11 p.m.
The first daily voyage will continue its regular seven-days-per-week schedule, departing Honolulu at 6:30 a.m. and arriving in Kahului at 10:15 a.m., and departing Kahului at 11:15 a.m. and arriving in Honolulu at 2:15 p.m.
Superferry officials said the current promotional $39 one-way passenger fares and $55 one-way passenger vehicle fares have been extended for travel through June 5, provided tickets are purchased by March 31.B, as well as options on a further two vessels.
“Viking Cruises has a long tradition of working with Bolidt through our extensive ‘Longship’ river cruise program,” said.”
Viking is renowned within the river cruise sector, where it has experienced unprecedented expansion over the past few years. Its decisive move into the ocean cruise market will build on the same attention to ship design, itinerary, privileged access excursions and on-board experiences for a discerning clientele. The fleet will be comfortable, state–of-the-art ships that are intimate and thoughtfully created by experienced naval architects and designers to enrich the passengers’ interaction with their destinations in every way.
The interior design of Viking Star, from London-based SMC Design and Los Angeles-based Rottet Studios, offers a modern and contemporary feel. Bolidt’s products lend themselves perfectly to delivering this vision. The Dutch flooring and decking specialist offer flexible systems that can be used within many different design frameworks and yet still meet requirements in terms of cost, ease of maintenance and environmental protection.
Bolideck Future Teak, an environmentally-friendly, slip-resistant and cost-effective alternative to traditional teak will feature in the ‘Wintergarden’ as well as on all outdoor decks, balconies and terraces. The choice of this sustainable product supports the overall environmentally-conscious design of the 47,800dwt vessel, which will feature a hydro-dynamically streamlined hull and bow and be fitted with energy-efficient engines to maximize fuel efficiency. The vessel will also feature equipment to minimize exhaust pollution.
Bolideck Select Soft will be used for areas such as the sports deck and jogging track. This system has been specifically developed for its excellent sound attenuation qualities, combined with ease of maintenance and durability. Bolideck Select Soft provides a safe surface that is extremely comfortable, even when barefoot.

Günther Braun
Thank you and good morning or good afternoon to everyone. I'm here in Plymouth, in Michigan; together with Ingrid, our CFO. I hope you all got the press release containing our second quarter results. We will give you some comments about our business and performance and then we will open it up for questions.
Now before we start, I would like to make the usual statement about the information you are getting in this conference call.
Safe Harbor Statements our discussion may include predictions, estimates or other information that may be considered forward-looking. While these forward-looking statements represent our best current judgments on what the future holds, they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Throughout our discussions, we will attempt to discuss important factors relating to our business that may affect our predictions. You may also want to review our last 10-Q and 10-K filings for a more complete disclosure of financial risks.
Okay, before I comment on the business environment, we would like to do the standard review of our performance in the period ending March 31, 2009.
First a quick overview of our second quarter. As you have seen from our press release, we reached sales in the second quarter of $75.6 million, which is $61 million or 45% lower than in the comparable quarter in fiscal year '08.
The strengthening of the US dollar exchange rates decreased sales by approximately 14% or $10.7 million. Net income was $1.2 million or approximately 2% of net sales 89% lower compared to last year second quarter.
We know that the numbers are not outstanding but I think quite satisfying, given the low sales volume. Again we face the substantial number of delivery delays especially during the second half of March and Ingrid will give you a number to that. Given the strong decline in sales of approximately $78 million over the last six months, think about in our fourth quarter last year which was $154 million now $76 million in the second quarter and not losing money I think was quite a success.
The macroeconomic environment, which we currently face is still very challenging and the financial crisis has leads to significant reduction in financing of capital equipment. Many of the industries we serve are affected and there are only few industries, which are relatively stable and later on I will comment on this one.
I will continue this, some other statistics here, sales in our micro, marking business decreased 44% over the comparable quarter to $35 million and it’s now 46% of total sales.
The sales of our macro business was also significantly below the previous quarters, business decreased by 49% to $30.3 million or 40% of total sales. Our component business, and you know, it’s laser diodes, it’s the active passive fibers, power supplies, fiber optics and so on decreased 29% and reached $10.3 million, representing 14% of quarterly sales.
Now the geographical spilt; sales to Asian countries decreased by 40% to 23% of quarterly sales and reached $17.1 million. Basically, all of the industries we serve were down. The strongest countries were China and Japan for us but there is also positive message which is that the Chinese business already increased sequentially by approximately 40% from Q1 to Q2 and that’s nice.
North America, as expected contributed only $17.2 million or 23% of quarterly sales. No surprise I think hopefully business conditions improve. Europe was responsible for the remaining 54% of the quarterly sales. Sales decreased 45% to $41.3 million comparing to last year's second quarter. Missing the strong PV business by the way. And of course do not forget the negative currency impact on the numbers in Europe and Asia.
Our spare parts and service business decreased 38% and accounted for approximately 31% of net sales for the quarter. Some other statistics now coming through the breakdown of our quarterly laser sales by industry. Automotive, last quarter was 5% versus 9% in '08. The machine tool reached 33% versus 38% in '08. Semiconductor, electronics, PV and so on 21% same percentage in '08, and others were 41% versus 32% in '08. But don’t forget low sales volume.
During the second quarter, we shipped to total of 500 lasers versus 899 lasers last year. That’s approximately 44% less compared to last year second quarter, 181 units were for macro applications and 319 units were for marking and micro application.
Now, let me start to comment on the six months results, we realized sales of $182.6 million in the last six months versus $271.3 million last year. The result is a decrease of 33% or $88.7 million from the comparable period of fiscal '08. And difference in the US dollar exchange rate decreased sales by approximately 10% or $18.4 million.

Many in Soldotna came to celebrate the opening of the new library. In this photo, Senator Micciche makes opening remarks.
Who doesn’t love the library? Apparently, not many of us, according to a recent report from the Pew Trust, which classified people by their degree of engagement with libraries. It found that 69 percent of the population are actively engaged while just 14 percent of the population aren’t engaged at all. Count us among the highly engaged.
I practically grew up inside my local library in Brooklyn, New York, as did my husband in his in Seward. One recent day it seemed everywhere I looked there was news about public libraries. Browsing on the net, I stumbled on a wonderful video, Why Libraries Matter: A day in the life of New York City’s public libraries. Later that morning, the local paper carried a small announcement about the opening of the new library in Togiak, a project funded in part by a grant from the Foundation.
The Foundation has a long history of supporting public libraries. A search of our awards database came up with more than 100 awards totaling more than $15 million among 38 communities. Yes, Rasmuson Foundation loves libraries.
Last January, I attended the grand opening celebration of the Joyce K. Carver Memorial Soldotna Public Library. The Foundation had provided a direct grant of $395,000 and a challenge grant of $100,000. The whole project cost $6.9 million. The expansion and improvements include contemporary media and communication tools for youth, expanded computer and Internet access, enclosed study spaces and expanded community meeting spaces.
Two links struck me at the community celebration: one between philanthropy and freedom of speech; the other between a community and its library.
What is free speech without knowledge to inform it? To me, public libraries embody, celebrate and feed free speech. Public libraries offer full and open access to the wide world of thought, exploration, ideas, culture, entertainment – all forms of knowledge. And in this country, philanthropy historically has been an important player in the support and proliferation of public libraries.
The self-taught industrialist Andrew Carnegie had the biggest influence in financing libraries in the U.S. From 1900 to 1917, Carnegie’s foundation built nearly 1,700 libraries, on condition that local communities guarantee tax support to maintain them.
But you don’t have to be a Carnegie to be a library philanthropist. That was delightfully obvious in the deep and broad community support for the Carver Memorial Soldotna Public Library. Dave Carey, a former Soldotna mayor and former president of Friends of the Library, composed a poem for the occasion, prefaced by inspiring remarks. See them here.
“It’s very much a community library,” Carey said. “It’s part of our identity and humanizes who we are.”
Rasmuson Foundation is proud to support such a vital and vibrant community asset.

Thank you Diane for reminding us that libraries continue to be a valuable community hub and thank you to the Rasmuson Foundation for all the support given to libraries in Alaska. I know it has made a huge difference in Haines and in many other communities around the state.
I brag to librarians in other states about the role the Rasmuson Foundation has played in this state in improving libraries. You get it….you understand our role in the community, as well as understand how we are responsive to needs unfilled by other agencies. Thank you for your continued support of libraries around the state!

If you’ve been reading our blog since the beginning (I can name a few of you by name, but I won’t :)), you probably already know more about us than you’d like to. Like how Johnny doesn’t like having his picture taken. Or how I’m opposed to driving a minivan. But when it comes to personal finance, Johnny and I have never really laid out just how we feel. That’s right, this is a post about feelings. How can we take this Internet-stranger relationship to the next level if we don’t express how we feel, right? So let’s get started!
What We Are & What We Aren’t
We’re all about getting the best deal. We aren’t all about getting the cheapest thing.
As we’ve documented on this blog, Johnny and I will spend hours figuring out how to get the best deals on the Internets or on an upcoming vacation. But we aren’t just looking for the cheapest deal. If the best deal also happens to be the cheapest deal? Well, that is a unicorn that we will tame and make our pet.
We’re adamant about having a budget. We aren’t adamant about how to budget.
The important thing is having a budget. And we do think budgets should be regularly updated and somewhat itemized. But we don’t think there’s any one way to do that. Whether it’s a spreadsheet, an app, or a piece of paper, someone’s personal method of budgeting is just that — personal.
We’re going to live within our means. We aren’t going to vilify living comfortably.
As long as we’re living within our means and meeting our savings goals, we’re also going to take part in some of the comforts of life. Johnny and I splurge on cable, and we probably always will. It’s not a necessity, but we like it, and it fits into our budget.
We’re going to save every day of our lives. We aren’t going to resort to an extreme lifestyle to retire early.
While we believe in saving, we will never take it to the extreme. We’re not trying to shock others with our transcendent view on personal finance. The way others choose to live is their decision to make, and we’re not gonna preach hell and damnation to ye all. We will work hard, play hard, and save hard. And we’re not gonna wait until we’re old and wrinkly to do it.
We’re against going into debt. We aren’t against having nice stuff.
Johnny and I like nice stuff. And we don’t think that’s a bad thing. But staying out of debt and saving will always come first. Aside from a future mortgage, we’re committed to avoiding the Debt Monster at all costs.
How do our feelings align with your feelings? How are we all feeling? Did we hurt any of your feelings? Let’s just talk about our feelings.

No feelings hurt here! I really enjoy all of yours posts and how relatable they are. Although, I don’t have a adorable kiddo, I feel like I get all the things you talk about (avoiding debt, really try to budget, check reviews before purchases, cheap but funny gifts).
Quick question, have you done the money-habitudes card game? It tells you what your money habits and attitudes are (carefree, spontaneous, giving, security, planner, status) and gives your habit-tude tips and tricks to work on. It would be interesting to see what your two styles are. Anywho, have a good one!
We’ve never heard of that game, but now I’m super interested. I know it’d expose some interesting differences… maybe it’s better we don’t play and pretend like we agree on everything.
We also like nice stuff and try (notice I said ‘try’ – I’m not perfect) and stay out of debt to obtain these “nice” things. Sometimes, I think I really could live a more “extreme” lifestyle, but Mr. LH couldn’t and for now I’m very comfortable with what we have and how we’re achieving our goals. I personally believe that each person needs to find their own way to being debt free and saving more (because everyone should probably be saving more), but how they do it is their choice. I’ve also been trying to remind myself that not every decision needs to revolve around money – hard for me to do sometimes, but important to really think about the ‘why’.
I’m very similar. I have to constantly remind myself that money shouldn’t be the basis of every decision. There’s much more life than those dumb, but important, pieces of paper. Joanna usually helps to give me perspective, and for that I’m grateful.
Everything you said is just common sense but as a society I feel like we’ve wandered so far from common sense. I love that you are so clearly committed to staying out of debt; it makes your life so much more free.
You can take our money, but you can’t take… our freeeedddoooommmm!!
I think our philosophies are pretty similar. Lee live a really nice life, but try and do it without spending a fortune. We did it when our incomes were a lot lower, and now since they’ve increased we’re still living that nice life, we’re just banking more money away. It might look “extreme”, but really it isn’t.
While I wouldn’t wish debt upon anyone, our getting-out-of-debt days helped us to learn that lesson — you don’t need much to be happy. It’s a great reminder when debts go away and income increases.
Your feelings align quite nicely with mine, which is one reason I have kept reading.
If there was a thumbs up key, I’d use that right now. Thanks, Meghan.
Hmmm… well, I’m certainly NOT about suffering or deprivation, but I think I probably tend to be a tad bit more on the extreme side of things. But I think it may just be a different definition of what “living comfortably” means.
I HATED having a job… like hated it with an extreme passion – even though I loved the organization that I worked for, and the people, and I wasn’t anywhere near corporate America… I just had some sort of a profound and deeply seeded resentment for the fact that my time was not my own.
So, for me, “living comfortably” meant finding a way to make ends meet without employment – which I managed to do by age 39. I guess having my time and freedom, and not having to “play the game” was just infinitely more important to me than having nicer things.
That being said, I think that for people who can stomach the 9-5 thing without feeling like slitting their wrists on a regular basis, the “middle road” is definitely the way to go.
Great, great point. “Comfort” is totally in the eyes of the beholder. I love the idea of being self-employed by 40, but I think I’d lose my mind. So “comfort” for us looks a little different. And that’s just fine and dandy.
And good for you for making it a reality. That’s seriously impressive.
I’m not a pf blogger, but I am an avid reader of pf blogs {and a newish reader + first-time commenter here — hey guys!} and I have to say, I love your views on how to live and save. They definitely align with mine, though sometimes reading so much in the pf blogosphere makes me feel a bit guilty for treating myself to something I can afford and would enjoy, but don’t necessarily need. What’s the point in saving and budgeting if you can’t use your good sense to determine when you deserve a little something that’ll make you smile?? That’s my philosophy at least
Glad I stumbled across you guys to take the edge off the early retirement/”never treat yourself, ever” messages that sometimes make the pf circle feel a little scary!
Thanks so much for your comment, Alyssa! We like your philosophy, and we feel that same anxiety sometimes in the PF world. We should always look to better our financial standing, but that quest needs to be balanced. Money’s cool, but being happy is cooler.
Hi guys! Well, as you know, I’ve been a faithful reader of your blog for quite some time now and, as you also know, you guys and me and my wife are pretty much on the same page relating to financial matters. We believe in all things in moderation, being disciplined and will to make sacrifices (as needed) to get those things that we consider to be important in our lives. That all said, however, I figure that we may differ in one area and that is going into debt.
You state “staying out of debt and saving will always come first.”. And to that we agree – however – I feel that managed controlled debt is not always a bad thing if handled correctly. Besides taking on a mortgage (which I think we both agree is “good debt”), I’ve also in the past gone into debt for things like tuition expenses, home purchases, and money used for annual retirement investment contributions. I’ve always done this though with the strict intention to always fully paying these debts off promptly, with a minimum of service charge interest incurred, and usually within one year. This has also been done with the goal of improving our credit score long term. Of course, as we know, mortgages are a long term thing but here too one must be practical and not take on too much long term debt, current low interest rates notwithstanding. Just my personal opinion and certainly not one that others need follow. Just so you know.
We probably should have asterisked our remark, because I think we mostly agree with your views on debt. Had we decided to pursue graduate school, that would have likely been another worthy debt, in addition to a future mortgage (which we’ve mentioned previously).
I’d be interested to hear more about going into debt for your retirement investment contributions, because that’s the one where I think we might differ. Knowing you, I’m sure it was for good reason, but that one doesn’t come across my radar as something I’d be willing to zero out my account for.
Johnny, regarding my occasionally going into debt for my retirement investment contributions – a couple of additional points to make to further clarify:
(1) I would only do this when I didn’t have sufficient cash to top up my RSP yearly contribution limit.
(2) Back in those years, the interest on a Canadian RSP contribution loan was tax deductible (sadly, this is not so today).
(3) Point (2) notwithstanding, if you read my original comment I mentioned “fully paying these debts off promptly, with a minimum of service charge interest incurred, and usually within one year.” The “within one year” being the important part.
(4) When I would later receive my tax refund (after having made an RSP contribution in this manner), I would throw the entire refund against paying down the debt faster. That way it was a win-win in the goal for saving for a better retirement funding using leverage. Catch my drift?
Ahhh, yeah. That makes a lot more sense, especially with #4.
Oh, man! I love your humour Joanna. That last paragraph about feelings had me giggling.
The reason I follow you on Bloglovin’ is precisely due to what other’s have said: I identify with your reasoning and aspire to be as financially capable as your wee family. As it stands, I’m neck-high in debt at present…mortgage, student loan, car loan…ugh.
Reading pf blogs and knowing what potential debt free living has for me keeps me focused!
Thanks for your comment, Kelly! And good for you for staying on the horse. Nothing kept us more motivated than reading and listening to others’ successes. Neck-high will become chest-high, then knee-high, then nada, zilch, zero. Keep at it!
I really thing most of your views make sense, and are in alignment with mine, though it took me a lot longer in life to figure it all out. I had the disadvantage of starting out with a husband who had wildly different views on debt and spending money, though that was not apparent until after we were married. Live & learn…
Staying out of debt (within reason) and living within your means are key! I’m all about getting the best deal possible, without buying the cheapest thing possible. My general rule is to go with the upper middle quality of an item, while getting the best deal possible. I don’t want the cheapest and I don’t need the most expensive.
The places we don’t agree include Johnny’s dislike of having his picture taken and your totally unreasonable position on mini-vans~ LOL! Sorry, Joanna, but when it comes to families, minivans RULE! 😉
Your “upper middle quality” is probably a good benchmark for where we strive to buy.
I will say that since Sally’s birth, I’ve gotten incrementally better at photos (since I don’t want to be the reason we don’t document her growing up) AND Joanna has become much more open to the idea of minivans. No breakthroughs yet, but we’re getting there.
I love that you’re one of the few blogs I see that focuses on moderation and balance. Extreme just drives me insane! Definitely hear you on the “no debt, but we like nice stuff” point. We just redid part of our kitchen and intentionally went with the best contractor we could find. We’re paying an arm and a leg, but I saw what happened when my parents went with cheap (not frugal, but super cheap) contractors. We had to skip getting new cabinets in order to make it happen and unfortunately took out a 1.99% interest loan on half the cost of the renovation, but in the end we wanted quality work.We don’t like debt but were okay with a small loan with a super low interest rate. Balance helped us find that point, and we love our new kitchen!
While I’m excited for a stage of life when kitchen remodeling is a possibility, knowing the horror stories of cheap contractors and shoddy work makes me glad we haven’t had to cross that bridge yet. Congrats on your kitchen, though! Super exciting.
This might be my favorite post yet! I love that you guys want nice things, want to have a fun and happy life, and arent looking to live a completely minimalist life to achieve your goals. I like that you aren’t going to vilify certain things. Sometimes Dave Ramsey gets on my nerves because he seems like such a Debby Downer all the time… sometimes I just want to say “Okay, I go to Starbucks sometimes!! But I use a gift card, or I use a coupon! But I LIKE it even though the price is ridiculous!” So this post felt like a breath of fresh air. Yes, I’d have a lot more in savings had I not traveled here or there…but I think a balance of being conservative w/ your money and reaching goals, along with enjoying life, is truly the way to go
Haha. Spot on. We’re already hard enough on ourselves with our finances and budgeting, the last thing we need is someone else breathing down our neck and making us feel like failures.
It’s all about balance. Thanks for your comment!
Why pay more just because you can? That would be silly and you two are smart-that’s why your philosophy totally makes sense to me. We are on the same page!
Glad to hear it, Michelle! We just get each other, don’t we?
[…] their approach: What We Are & What We’re Not via Our Freaking […]
I am glad I just found your blog. All your reasoning speaks so much to me. The best deal might not be the cheapest but why go cheaper if it’s missing something you need? I love your approach to budgeting and I cannot wait to read more of your blog!
Hooray for new friends! We agree with your agreement. We’re always slightly surprised when people agree with us and don’t just point their finger and laugh at us. So thanks for stopping by and making us feel normal.
I love your outlook on this. I think it’s good to have a comfortable middle ground. My fiancé and I are starting our debt snow ball and trying to pay as much debt as we can, but we aren’t going to only eat Ramen noodles for a year to get it done that much earlier. Although we’ve joked about that before!
Hold up, you mean you’re not going to eat 2000% of your daily sodium intake in order to debt snowball? That’s crazy talk. But for real, congrats on starting your debt snowball!
Just came across your blog from BeanBytes at Lean Green Bean! I am thankful I have a snow day today so I can read through all the links off this post. And no hurt feelings, I think I am really going to like you guys
Haha. We could really go for a snow day right about now. But since we’re in Utah and snow-packed streets is the norm, that doesn’t happen very often.
Thanks for your comment!

To fuse these two into a cup of tea, it goes through the process of brewing, and as every tea drinker who’s ever tried an overbrewed cup of tea knows, even the best leaves and water can make a terrible cup if the brewing method is flawed, whether by design or accident. In fact, among all the major beverages of the world, tea is perhaps the most demanding on the drinker in terms of what it asks for — to make a nice cup of tea, the drinker must be able to brew the tea, and hopefully, brew it well. It is not an accident that we call the Chinese style of tea making these days “gongfu cha”. Gongfu roughly translates into skill and ability, and the tea that results is really determined not by the ingredients that went into it, but by the hands of the person brewing it.
What exactly does this skill consist of? One way of thinking about it is to start with the end goal — a pleasant, presumably fragrant, and enjoyable cup of tea. This means that the cup should possess as few undesirable traits as possible, such as an overabundance of roughness, bitterness, or odd flavours, and also be flavourful, has depth, and a good body. An insipid cup does not have any bad traits, but the absence of any distinctive features at all is itself undesirable.
Now, the question is really how to get from leaves and water to an enjoyable cup of tea. If we leave out the issue of the leaves and water (you can read the rest of this blog for my thoughts on those issues) the only variables that we can actively influence as the tea brewer are the teaware, the leaves/water ratio, the temperature, and the time. Let’s talk about them in turn.
For most of us, teaware is often an automatic choice based on the type of tea in question and the number of people drinking. The most versatile, of course, is the gaiwan, and it is also perhaps the most neutral. For those of us who, by and large, use yixing or other kinds of teapots for brewing, there are a few things worth thinking about when assigning pots to teas. For example, is this an aged tea with a strong flavour, or a fragrant one with a delicate aroma? For the former, a more porous pot may be more useful, while the latter might suit a high density pot like a zhuni better. The shape of the pot may also come into play, as I generally find flatter pots with large openings more suitable for Wuyi yancha, while rounder shapes work better for rolled oolongs. How the pot pours is of paramount importance — not in terms of whether the flow stops if you stop the air hole (which I believe is of zero relevance) but rather how fast the water drains from the pot. If it takes too long, you should take that into consideration for the next question, which is the water/leaf ratio.
The question of how much leaves to use in a particular pot/gaiwan is really one of the biggest decision a tea brewer can make, and has implications for all kinds of issues like how fast to pour and what to expect from the cup. Examining the dry leaves and knowing what type/nature it is will help determine the amount of leaves to use. Lighter teas generally require less leaves, while heavier ones can take more, even though that may sound odd. When I say light, I mean lightly processed — greens, whites, qingxiang (little to no roast) oolongs, very young puerhs. When I say heavy, I have in mind nongxiang (heavily roasted) oolongs, aged teas of all kinds, heavily oxidized teas, etc. The amount of leaves, in grams, is really not a very useful unit to measure, because what really matters in terms of brewing is how much leaves there are versus how much water there will be in the vessel. 7g of tea is a lot in a 50ml gaiwan, but is not a lot in a 150ml pot. I always measure the amount of tea I use by how much of the vessel I’m filling up with the dry leaves. This can range from 1/8 to 3/4 of the vessel, depending on the tea and the nature of the leaves. Rolled leaves, for example, will expand greatly, so you need to leave room for it to do so, whereas flat leaves, such as certain Wuyis and dancongs, unfurl pretty much in place, and you sometimes need to pack more in to achieve certain tastes. There are also the special cases of brewing using Chaozhou style techniques (that’s another subject entirely) which needs different types of preparations.
The amount of leaves used determines, again, how fast the infusions should be, and also to a slightly lesser extent, the temperature of the water used. The teas I drink tend to be on the “heavy” side of the scale, so boiling water is generally required. When making lighter teas though, starting from qingxiang oolongs, it is often important to pay attention to how hot the water is and adjust accordingly. Lighter generally means cooler, as most of you already know. Cooler, however, also means longer steeps, and this is where it gets tricky, often involving active adjustments on the brewer’s part to get it right. Whereas using boiling hot water often means pouring the tea out quickly, often immediately, using cooler, longer steeps will result in different kinds of tastes. A heavy tea that is steeped quickly with hot water should be full bodied with the fragrance that is desired, but not the bitterness and roughness that will surely follow if steeped even slightly too long. With lighter teas, water that’s too hot will scald the leaves and can make the tea less fragrant or even bitter and nasty almost immediately, with no remedy possible once done. Cooler water with longer steeps will bring out the fragrant and sweet elements of the leaves without the tea suffering from damage.
It is, however, in the adjustment process where I think gongfu tea really gets its name. How to manage all these moving parts in a satisfactory way is the key to making a good cup of tea, Chinese style, and to be able to do that, it involves a certain amount of practice and experience, which then translates the act of brewing into an intuitive process that flows naturally, rather than something that resembles a science experiment, with measurements and timers and thermometers. Part of this is very much a practical problem — I’ve observed people who learned tea making a certain way who then follow the directions given to the letter (heck, I’ve done it myself early on — we all have) and it just doesn’t work. 5/10/15/30/30/60/60 is not how you make a good cup of puerh, or oolong, or anything. Being able to mix and match and adjust on the fly depending on what’s coming out from the pot is. If the last cup is too weak? Brew a little longer, or if the water hasn’t been reboiled in a few minutes (depending on the way you handle water in the brewing process) maybe it needs to be heated again. Or, if you’re not achieving a certain taste, perhaps you can push the tea a little further. Likewise, don’t be afraid to actually take leaves out of the pot — sometimes there’s just too much leaves in the pot, and as non-intuitive as this is, pull some leaves out. The resulting cup may actually be better.
Most importantly though, the adjustment process allows the tea to be brewed according to individual taste. I know that I like the tea certain people make more than others. They are just better tea brewers, at least in my eyes, regardless of what tea is given to them. There are those whose tea I had the misfortune of drinking, and by mangling it thoroughly, what should have been a great cup is destroyed. Sourness that should have been subdued became pronounced, Wuyi that should have that strong rock aftertaste turns into insipid brown tea, and young puerh brewed in such a way as to make me wonder if I should be drinking some white tea instead. When making tea for ourselves and ourselves alone, the adjustment process is easy — you have perfect feedback from yourself, and can tune the tea making a certain way. When making for a group of people, asking them how the tea is coming out is equally important. It is easy to fall into the routine of our own tea habits without thinking about the fact that now someone else has to drink that cup of tea. Maybe they don’t actually like (or can handle) 10g of Lao Banzhang in a 60ml pot. Maybe lightening up on the leaves will be a good idea. Drinking tea by yourself or with others is always a learning experience. The end goal, I think, is elusive, but every day we think about what we’re drinking, we’re getting closer to a better cup of tea.
Great post & nice to see some basic issues addressed that are often overlooked or misinterpreted by many.
My heart sinks when I hear of people drinking tea with a stopwatch. Despite not having the mental flexibility to adjust the parameters as needed, how much can one really be enjoying the tea when there’s 5/10/15/30/30/60/60 to worry about.
Indeed, and thanks for reading!
Great read!!!
Thanks!
Been reading your blog for awhile and have been developing a craving for pu’er. I haven’t found a good place to buy pu’er since 5 or 6 years ago, last time was when I was in Vancouver. Are there any good online stores you could recommend?
Thanks for reading. As for the question of pu — do you mean you want pu from, say, 2004/5? Those are best found on Taobao, I’m afraid.
No I just meant I haven’t drank pu’er for a long time! I’m not particular about the age of the pu’er itself, as long as it’s good.
Ah, hmm. I think it’s hard to say — each vendor has a few things that are decent, but probably more that are not. It’s hard to recommend by vendor, really… and I generally don’t buy much from online sources, aside from the occasional taobao purchase.We.
On Saturday the President stated that he "authorized the National Security Agency, consistent with U.S. law and the Constitution, to intercept the international communications of people with known links to al Qaeda and related terrorist organizations." It is critical that Congress determine, as quickly as possible, exactly what collection activities were authorized, what were actually undertaken, how many names and numbers were involved over what period, and what was the asserted legal authority for such activities. In sum, we must determine the facts.. Specter wrote: ." Excerpts from Specter's letter follows:

...Our enemy recognizes that we will use surveillance and wiretapping to try to collect intelligence. And I don't think it's plausible to believe that any kind of discussion in theory that the President has extraordinary powers to surveil in wartime would permit the enemy to evade any kind of particular practice.
But, anyway, the Congress explicitly addressed the idea of the powers of the President during wartime and wiretapping.
The authorization of force statute doesn't refer to FISA.
The administration's claims that it sub silentio overruled FISA is on its face implausible. The rule of statutory construction for centuries is, the more specific statute overrides the more general one.

In an excerpt from Bamford's prepared statement
he said:
...I would like to discuss some of the events that lead to the enactment of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, how the act applies to the NSA, and the dangers in violating the law. These dangers were long foreseen by Senator Frank Church, the Idaho Democrat who led the investigation into the abuses of the intelligence agencies in 1975. Following his probe of the NSA, Senator Church came away shocked and warned of the dangers of what might be called techno-tyranny. The agency's technological capability, he said,  Church spoke those words more than three decades ago, when the NSA's domestic surveillance capability was limited to hardline telephones and an occasional telegram. The agency had no access to the mail. Today the NSA is the largest intelligence agency on earth, and by far the most dangerous if not subjected to strict laws and oversight. It has the ability to virtually get into someone’s mind. It can read a person's most private thoughts expressed in e-mail correspondence sent from their home computer, eavesdrop on their cell phone as they drive to work, read the messages from their Blackberry as they ride the elevator, and then listen in on their office telephone, and monitor their computer and fax machine as they conduct business...
In an excerpt of Turley's testimony
he said:
...Now, I want to be absolutely clear. What the President ordered in this case was a crime.
We can debate whether he had a good or bad motivation, but it was a crime.
Federal law makes it clear you cannot engage in this type of surveillance, in a domestic surveillance operation, without committing a crime and that you can go to jail for 5 years.
Now, we can debate the wisdom of that. We can debate why the President may have done it.
But, in my view, the President committed a crime, and we have to deal with that as citizens and, unfortunately, you have to deal with that as Members of Congress.
It gives me no pleasure to say that, but it also strikes me as an alarming circumstance when the President can go into a press conference and announce that he has violated a Federal statute 30 times and promises to continue to do so until someone stops him.
That's the most remarkable admission I've ever heard from a President of the United States.
Now, the Federal law is clear because of the exclusivity provision under Title III. Title III says quite clearly that all surveillance done domestically must be done pursuant to Title III or to FISA, and then FISA makes it a crime to engage in this type of surveillance without a court order.
Now, this is the most user-friendly law a President has ever been given. FISA virtually is devoid of a basis to turn down the President. That's why we've had over 13,000 FISA applications and only a handful of denials...

Mr. Bush says they only monitor calls to foreign countries, but THAT is ABSOLUTELY untrue.
He tells us that he spies only on known Al-Qaida contacts or affiliates, but I know for a fact that is NOT TRUE, because I was spied on in a house of worship IN THE UNITED STATES, and in private homes in Florida where I was meeting with other peaceful persons engaged in constitutionally-protected activity.
I HAVE EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE that the federal government listens to my phone calls to family members and friends about purely personal matters.
I have every reason to believe that the president's agents READ my e-mail, PHOTOGRAPH me as I exercise my Constitutional Rights, RECORD the license numbers of cars I ride in, and CREATE huge databases with information about me and my fellow activists, BECAUSE all of this specific activity is on record, from government files, as having been visited on American citizens, around the United States, by members of the Joint Terrorism Task Force, the FBI, the NSA and other agencies...

In an excerpt of Martin's prepared statement

The President claims he has authority as the Commander-in-Chief to conduct warrantless wiretaps of Americans. But when Congress enacted the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in 1978, it expressly rejected the President’s claim of inherent authority to conduct warrantless wiretaps. It then went further and made it a crime to conduct such wiretaps.
The President has acted contrary to the express will of the Congress. The Supreme Court has never approved a claim of presidential authority to authorize acts outlawed by the Congress.
When Congress authorized secret wiretaps for national security purposes in 1978, it intended to prevent any future President from carrying out warrantless eavesdropping on Americans...
On that day Conyers also sent a letter to 20 telecommunications companies "to inquire whether your company has allowed the federal government to eavesdrop on customer communications through your facilities or has turned over customer records when not compelled to do so by law."
On May 10, 2006, Maurice Hinchey (D-NY) received a letter from the Department of Justice advising him that their investigation of the program had to be terminated due to denial of security clearances.
Fifteen days after the Office of Professional Responsibility letter, Representative Hinchey (D-NY) on May 25, 2006 introduced H. Res. 845, a resolution "requesting the President and directing the Secretary of Defense and the Attorney General to transmit to the House of Representatives not later than 14 days after the date of the adoption of this resolution, documents relating to the termination of the Department of Justice's Office of Professional Responsibility's investigation of the involvement of Department of Justice personnel in the creation and administration of the National Security Agency's warrantless surveillance program, including documents relating to Office of Professional Responsibility's request for and denial of security clearances." Hinchey was able to get three co-sponsors for this resolution. They are: Representative John Lewis (D-GA); Representative Henry Waxman (D-CA); and Representative Lynn Woolsey (D-CA).
During the Judiciary Committee hearing | Wartime Executive Power and the NSA's Surveillance Authority open to the public on February 6, 2006 Attorney General Alberto Gonzales defended the program asserting that the "except as authorized by statute" provision of meant that, due to the passage of the Authorization for the Use of Military Force, FISA isn't the exclusive means by which domestic electronic surveillance can be done. Gonzales said: "Congress and the American people are interested in two fundamental questions: is this program necessary and is it lawful. The answer to both questions is yes." In the excerpt following, Gonzales., and is at its highest. He is acting "pursuant to an express or implied authorization of Congress," and the President’s authority "includes all that he possesses in his own right [under the Constitution] plus all that Congress can" confer on him.
Senator Specter (R-PA) suggested letting the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court decide the legality of the program:
SPECTER:aeda..
Senator Leahy (D-VT) asked Attorney General Gonzales about opening mail:aeda. That's what this program is all about.
LEAHY: You haven't answered my question.
Senator Kennedy (D-MA) asked if terror suspects could get off due to tainted evidence:
KENNEDY: ..aeda.
Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) talked about the role of Congress and intentions of their Authorization for the Use of Military Force passed in September 2001:
GRAHAM: .. interpret....
In closing, the Chair of the hearing, Arlen Specter, recommended letting the Judiciary branch decide the legality of the program, rather than the Executive branch, stating that "what is at stake is the equilibrium established by our constitutional system.":.
In an excerpt of Woolsey's prepared statement
he said:
...The FISA Court considered and deliberated about only 1,758 requests for warrants in all of 2004 (and asked that 94 be modified before they were granted). And for each FISA warrant application:
-- a warrant request form is filled out by the FBI;
-- the target (an individual) is identified;
-- facts are set out establishing that there is probable cause to believe that the individual is involved in terror or spying;
-- details of the facilities and communications to be monitored are supplied;
-- procedures are set forth to minimize the collection of information about people in the U.S.
-- a Field Office Supervisor then verifies and approves the request;
-- FBI Special Agents and Attorneys at Headquarters ensure that the form contains all required information and finish the form;
-- The Director of the Agency certifies that the information being sought is necessary to protect the U.S. against actual potential attacks, spying, or international terrorism and cannot be obtained by normal investigative techniques;
-- At the Justice Department, lawyers in the Office of Intelligence Policy and Review draft a formal application based on the request;
-- The Attorney General reviews and approves the application.
After the above steps are completed, the Attorney General may authorize an emergency order for a 72-hour period if he determines that there is a "factual basis" to believe that the order would be consistent with FISA, but if a FISA Court order cannot be obtained within that time the information obtained from the surveillance may not be used. Once the application is before the Court it must determine that there is probable cause to believe that the targeted individual is involved in terrorism or spying, that the information sought is necessary to protect the country against terrorism, and that the minimization procedures are appropriate.
Applying the understandably case-by-case deliberative tool of the FISA Court to the need very rapidly to map the electronic battlefield of the current war is even more of a misfit than applying the rules of sailboat racing to a race between aircraft traveling several times the speed of sound. In my view it is not that an amended FISA procedure is necessary, it is that the case-by-case deliberation for which courts are designed and well-suited is not the right tool for providing a check on the type of electronic surveillance that is the subject of these hearings. Neither the Attorney General nor the FISA Court can usefully deliberate and decide almost instantaneously whether there is probable cause to believe that an individual is an agent of a foreign power or terrorist organization if the government does not even know the name associated with a cell phone or email address. More basically, this issue of probable cause is a law enforcement question, not an intelligence question. We may learn at least as much of importance if the individual being called from an al Qaeda site overseas is a dupe or the subject of a false flag operation by terrorists and is not their agent at all. And if one tries to fit this battlefield electronic mapping operation into the FISA warrant process, then as Judge Posner has pointed out (WSJ Feb. 15, 2006) – e.g. if one lowers the warrant requirement to one of only "reasonable suspicion" or even whether an intercept "might yield useful information" -- then one rapidly approaches the point where the warrant process ceases to be a filter and judges have no basis for refusing to grant applications. It is not just that rapid mapping of the electronic battlefield doesn’t fit the FISA warrant process well, it does not fit it at all...
In an excerpt of Koh's prepared statement
he said:
...In my professional opinion, the ongoing NSA domestic surveillance program is blatantly illegal, whether or not –as its defenders claim--it is limited to international calls with one end in the United States.
None of the program's defenders – including those who appear today-- has identified any convincing legal justification for conducting such a sweeping program without the legally required checks of congressional authorization and oversight and judicial review. My government service makes me fully sensitive to the ongoing threat from Al Qaeda and the need for law enforcement officials to be able to gather vital information before another terrorist attack occurs. Of course, in time of war, our Constitution recognizes the President as Commander-in-Chief. But the same Constitution requires that the Commander-in-Chief obey the Fourth Amendment, so saying, the Fourth Amendment requires that any government surveillance be reasonable, supported except in emergency situations by warrants issued by courts, and based upon specific probable cause. The current NSA surveillance program, as I understand it, violates all three constitutional standards...
In an excerpt of Professor Gormley prepared statement
he said:
...I have absolutely no question about the good faith of our President and our Attorney General. These are unusual times in our nation's history. I agree that the President's power as commander-in-chief -- even on American soil -- is potentially heightened, at least for a period of time, given the attacks on the World Trade Center and the continued threat of attacks from a new brand of enemy.
Moreover, it is important to recognize that after September 11th, a fair case can be made that our nation is faced with a shifting paradigm, in which our own soil is potentially part of the field of battle. This, combined with new challenges posed by previously-unimagined forms of communications technology, may ratchet up presidential power (generally) on the homefront.
At the same time, the defense offered by the Bush Administration for its wiretap program is eerily similar to the losing argument advanced by President Harry Truman in 1952, when he seized the steel mills. Even aggregating all of the powers available to him under the Constitution, the Supreme Court concluded that the goal of "keeping the country from going to hell" -- even during time of war; was not sufficient to nullify the Constitution. Seizing private property on American soil is a power generally reserved to Congress pursuant to the 5th Amendment power involving eminent domain. To make matters worse, President Truman defied legislation there, amendments to the Taft-Hartley Act dealing with labor unrest that specifically withheld such power from the executive branch. As Justice Jackson declared in his now-famous concurrence in the Steel Seizure Case, presidential power was at its high point in the "theater of war," abroad. It was at its "lowest ebb" on American turf, especially when the president had acted without Constitutional or Congressional support. 343 U.S. at 635-38 (Jackson, J., concurring).
Applying these lessons to the Bush wiretap program, it is possible to draw useful conclusions. In a nut-shell, the Bush Administration program bumps up against the Constitution in a number of different ways, and fails to survive that collision. There are problems enough when the executive branch does an end-run around an act of Congress, by-passing a legislative scheme that has been put in place for precisely this type of domestic surveillance. But the problems only multiply tenfold where, as here, the chief executive's actions collide with the fundamental rights of citizens and residents under the Bill of Rights, specifically the 4th Amendment. In such a case, the president's power is at rock bottom. Indeed, it arguably falls into a category even lower than that occupied by President Truman in the Steel Seizure case. Taking property by eminent domain, if it is accomplished by the government improperly, can always be remedied after-the-fact by just compensation. The right of privacy protected by the 4th Amendment, however, can never be returned once violated. That is why individual rights and liberties are protected on a prospective basis, under our Constitution. Once lost, those rights are irretrievable.
There was no question that President Truman believed passionately that his actions were necessary to protect American soldiers' lives and to safeguard the nation. (It turned out, years later, that the threat posed by a steel strike was grossly overstated). Symposium at 676. There is likewise no doubt that President Bush believes, fervently, that the warrantless surveillance of certain communications by citizens or residents on American soil is necessary to carry out the administration's difficult war on terror.
Yet as Senator Specter aptly stated in the first round of this Committee's hearings, echoing the words of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in the Hamdi case, this does not provide a "blank check." Congress and the courts have a duty to correct the situation, if the executive branch commits an error in assessing its own powers. At least four problems are evident with respect to the current Bush administration secret surveillance program. In simplest form, they are as follows:
First, nothing in the text of the Constitution specifically gives the President the power to bypass the warrant requirement of the 4th Amendment, on the domestic front, even during times of emergency.
Second, the administration's program circumvents a specific act of Congress, which establishes the FISA court and sets forth detailed procedures for conducting surveillance of precisely this sort, involving citizens and residents of the United States. 50 U.S.C. Section 1801 et seq. (1978).
Third, that power is even further diminished because the Bush administration's program collides with rights of American citizens and residents under the Bill of Rights, to wit, those protected by the Fourth Amendment. This collision potentially puts the President's power at an even lower point on the continuum of Constitutional power than that of President Truman in the Steel Seizure case.
Fourth, if one adapts Justice Jackson's Steel Seizure test and applies it to Congress, one discovers that Congress is at its zenith in exercising powers in this matter.
Congress has the power to establish inferior courts and to define their jurisdiction, pursuant to Article I, Section 8, Clause 9 of the Constitution. Congress furthermore has the power to enact laws ensuring that the 4th Amendment and other provisions of the Constitution are observed; it has done so with detailed wiretap statutes since the 1960s. On top of this, Congress is given the exclusive power to legislate on domestic matters (Article I, Section 1) and to declare war (Article I, Section 8, clause 11). Thus, Congress is at a high point in terms of exercising its powers here. On the other hand, President Bush is arguably in the third and lowest category of Presidential power set forth by Justice Jackson in the Steel Seizure case, as discussed above. Unlike some struggles between two branches of government, this is not a close call. The true challenge for this Committee is to find an appropriate resolution to this quandary...
In an excerpt of Kmiec's prepared statement
he said:
...While signals intelligence has been a common feature of past war efforts, this exclusion is apparently insufficient to cover the present Terrorist Surveillance Program of the NSA. Assuming this to be true, it is nevertheless significant that Congress understood that the NSA surveillance that it had categorically excluded from FISA could include the monitoring of international communications into or out of the United States of U.S. citizens. The Senate Report, for example,’ understanding in the legislative history of FISA that such communications could be intercepted outside FISA procedures again suggests the prudent manner in which Congress sought to avoid executive-legislative clash.
Which brings us to the question of what, if anything, does FISA require during wartime? It is fair to observe that in all the recorded military engagements of our past, the military has engaged in searches and surveillance without a warrant. Neither Congress nor the President has required the armed forces to seek a battlefield warrant to conduct visual or electronic surveillance of enemy forces. Was it FISA's intent for military operations within the United States to operate under a different rule? There is no legislative history requiring that FISA be construed contrary to historical practice. The Civil War is, of course, the main historical battle fought on our soil and there is no history suggesting that any search or observation of confederate forces during the Civil War was subject to a warrant requirement. The expressed congressional intent was to "reconcile national intelligence and counterintelligence needs with constitutional principles in a way that is consistent with both national security and individual rights." S.Rep. No. 95-701, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 16 (1978). The courts have interpreted this language carefully so as not to defeat valid intelligence needs. Thus, Judge Wilkey in U.S. v. Belfield, 692 F.2d 141 (D.C. Cir 1982) rejected the claim that FISA, insofar as it does not require disclosure and an adversary hearing, violates the Fifth and Sixth amendments or was contrary to the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (OCCA) 18 U.S.C. § 2518(9) (1976) (providing the contents of an intercepted communication may not be used in any proceeding unless the aggrieved person is first furnished with a copy of the application and court order authorizing the interception). Applying the general disclosure obligation, Judge Wilkey reasoned, would have ignored that Congress recognized the need for the Executive to engage in and employ the fruits of clandestine surveillance without being constantly hamstrung by disclosure requirements.
It is thus no disrespect to Congress' ample authority in matters of foreign affairs to believe that FISA should not be readily interpreted to "hamstring" the Executive in its conduct of wartime intelligence. Were enemy al Qaeda forces to invade and operate on the territory of the United States, the Constitution could not reasonably be construed to require a search warrant for the military to conduct surveillance of the enemy, and the greatest hesitation should be exhibited before attributing to Congress the intent to encumber the military with a FISA warrant...

...My statutory and constitutional analysis of the NSA surveillance program can be summarized as follows: (1) NSA engaged in foreign intelligence "electronic surveillance" as defined by FISA ; (2) FISA’s "exclusivity provision" prohibits such surveillance except under the "procedures" in FISA; (3) the September 2001 Authorization to Use Military Force (AUMF), as interpreted by the Supreme Court in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, does not implicitly repeal the exclusivity provision or otherwise authorize the surveillance; and therefore (4) the NSA’s surveillance program raises the question whether the exclusivity provision is an unconstitutional infringement of the President’s constitutional power under Article II. The answer to that question (and to the related Fourth Amendment question) depends in large part on facts not yet available. I believe, however, that the constitutional analysis will turn in large part on two operational issues – the importance of the information sought (as compared to the scope of the surveillance), and the need to eschew the use of FISA in obtaining the information. With the relevant facts unavailable, I express no opinion on the constitutional issue.
As of this writing, the government’s best legal defense of the NSA program appears in a letter from DOJ to certain Members of Congress dated December 22, 2005, and a whitepaper released by DOJ on January 19, 2006. The letter and whitepaper can be summarized as follows: (1) the President has constitutional authority under Article II to "order warrantless foreign intelligence surveillance within the United States" of the type conducted by NSA; (2) that constitutional authority "is supplemented by statutory authority under the AUMF" as interpreted in Hamdi; (3) the NSA surveillance program accords with the exclusivity provision because FISA "permits an exception" to its own procedures where surveillance is "authorized by another statute, even if the other authorizing statute does not specifically amend" the exclusivity provision; and (4) any doubt on the previous question must be resolved in the government's favor to "avoid any potential conflict between FISA and the President’s Article II authority as Commander in Chief." Finally, the government asserts in its whitepaper, (5) if the exclusivity provision does forbid the NSA surveillance, then it was repealed by the AUMF or is unconstitutional. In the discussion that follows, I address each of these arguments. While I do not agree with the government, I appreciate the very high quality of its current legal analysis...
...As a member of the Gang of Eight, I have received periodic briefings on highly classified programs. However, with respect to the NSA program that you have disclosed, I have reviewed the law and now believe that the practice of briefing only certain Members of the intelligence committees violates the specific requirements of the National Security Act of 1947.
The National Security Act requires that "The President shall ensure that the congressional intelligence committees are kept fully and currently informed of the intelligence activities of the United States . . . ." 50 U.S.C. § 413(a)(1). The Act makes clear that the requirement to keep the committees informed may not be evaded on the grounds that "providing the information to the congressional intelligence committees would constitute the unauthorized disclosure of classified information." 50 U.S.C. § 413(e).
The Act provides for one exception to the President's duty to keep all committee Members fully and currently informed of intelligence activities. In the context of a covert action, the President may, if he concludes that "it is essential . . . to meet extraordinary circumstances affecting vital interests of the United States," limit notification to the Gang of Eight. 50 U.S.C. § 413b(c)(2). That procedure applies by the terms of the statute to covert actions, not intelligence collection activities.
For all intelligence activities that are not covert actions, the Executive Branch's duty is clear: the "heads of all . . . entities involved in intelligence activities shall . . . keep the congressional intelligence committees fully and currently informed of all intelligence activities." 50 U.S.C. § 413a(a)(1) (emphasis added).).
As a general matter, Gang of Eight briefings do not provide for effective oversight. Members of the Gang of Eight cannot take notes, seek the advice of their counsel, or even discuss the issues raised with their committee colleagues. It is precisely for this reason that the law requires briefings for the full committee. As you know, both congressional intelligence committees are select committees, formed of Members who hold the highest security clearances and have a proven ability to safeguard classified information. They were formed to be a select subset of the Congress, which could provide oversight on behalf of their colleagues who do not sit on the intelligence committees.
I urge you to reconsider your position. In my view, failure to provide briefings to the full congressional intelligence committees is a continuing violation of the National Security Act.
Representative Heather Wilson (R-NM), Chair of the House Technical and Tactical Intelligence Subcommittee of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, in a press statement she released dated February 8, 2006 said she "wrote to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales asking to be fully informed about the NSA program" adding that her "request covered all electronic surveillance conducted without a court order within the United States since September 11, 2001. I also asked to be fully informed on what are called 'minimization' procedures and mechanisms in place and reviews conducted to ensure full compliance with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and other laws protecting the privacy of U.S. persons." She added that she believes "the time has come to review and update the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act." In an excerpt from her statement, Wilson said:
...I had serious concerns and questions about this program when it was initially reported. Those concerns grew in recent days as the Attorney General answered questions and did not answer others in the Senate.
The House Intelligence Committee as a whole has to be briefed into this program and fully informed by the Administration on exactly what is being done. We must conduct a complete review of this program. There are serious questions that need answers, and we are starting to get those answers. That could not be done by the Chairman and the Ranking member alone, and the Administration's decision to do so is the right thing to do.
The FISA statute does allow the President and the Congressional leadership to agree on procedures that would limit information on some programs to a handful of members – the so-called Gang of Eight. These procedures are not written down and are really a matter of practice and negotiation between successive Presidents and Congresses. There are reasons to limit some information to an even smaller set of people than the intelligence committees.
At the same time, the Administration regularly and systematically briefs Intelligence Committee members about highly classified programs which, if compromised, could cause tremendous damage to national security.
The members of the Intelligence Committee are serious people committed to protecting this country and its secrets. Most of us have some background in national security matters. After 11 years in the Air Force, I served on the National Security Council Staff in the first Bush White House. I've had a security clearance of some form or another for all but about three years since I was 17 years old.
I have spent enough time in the world of intelligence to know that it is very common for published reports in this field to be inaccurate. That's not intentional; it's just the nature of covering secrets. The inaccuracies cannot be corrected by the people who run the programs.
Effective oversight has to start with the facts. The facts must come from the National Security Agency, the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence.
In the war on terrorism, I believe Congress and the President share the same goal: to keep Americans safe and free. All of us remember where we were on that cool September morning and all of us share the same resolve to make sure that we never endure a day like that again...
On February 8, 2006 Michael V. Hayden and Alberto R. Gonzales gave the committee a secret briefing. Jane Harman (D-Calif.), told reporters that "the ice is falling.
On February 16, 2006 the co-chairmen of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence said the committee will hold closed door investigations. Jamal Ware, a spokesman for Chairman Hoekstra, said the inquiry would not examine operational details, however anonymous congressional aides and representative Heather A. Wilson said it would. Rep. Jane Harman (D-Calif.) said she was told there was no broader program than the NSA warrantless surveillance by White House counsel Harriet Miers on March 1 and by Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales on March 2, 2006.
An excerpt of Feingold's proposed resolution follows:

Bush has, since the public disclosure of the National Security Agency surveillance program, falsely implied that the program was necessary because the executive branch did not have authority to wiretap suspected terrorists inside the United States, by making statements about the supposed need for the program, including--

(2) on January 31, 2006, asserting during the State of the Union that .'; and

...Despite the rhetoric of the last four months, FISA is not a comprehensive statute that requires the President to obtain a "warrant" to collect foreign intelligence. It is a narrow law that requires an "order" be obtained for "electronic surveillance" in only four circumstances:
(1) Where a United States person is the target of, rather than incidental to, the surveillance;
(2) Where the acquisition of the intelligence will be accomplished by devices located within the United States;
(3) Where the sender and all recipients of the relevant communication are present in the United States; or
(4) Where surveillance devices are used within the United States to collect communications other than wire or radio communications. 50 U.S.C. § 1801(f)(1-4).
That being the case, based upon how the President, Attorney General, and General Hayden (former head of NSA and now Deputy Director of National Intelligence), have described the NSA program, it is not at all clear than any of the intercepts would properly fall within FISA in the first instance. In that regard, the NSA program appears to have been:
(1) targeted at al Qaeda operatives and their associates – in other words, communications are intercepted and monitored based on an al Qaeda association; and
(2) directed only at international communications with an al Qaeda operative or associate on one end: As General Hayden made clear, "one end of any call targeted under this program is always outside the United States;" and
(3) the purpose is not to collect evidence for a criminal prosecution, but to identify and thwart additional attacks against the United States.
Whatever this program is, it is not the pervasive dragnet of American domestic communications about which so many of the Administration’s critics have fantasized. Moreover, unless some of these communications are intercepted in the United States, or the targeted al Qaeda operative happens also to be a "United States person," FISA does not apply by its own terms...

A natural resources inventory compiled in 1985 concentrated on the geology, vegetation and birds of this National Historic Site. The inventory noted that vegetation within the site is greatly influenced by the exposed, windy nature of the Port au Choix and Point Riche peninsulas. The Labrador Current often brings ice to this area from January or February to May. In the summer the area is subjected to major storms that leave the continent by way of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Because of these factors, Port au Choix is one of the windiest places in Canada, and the area tends to receive more rainfall in the summer months than in other times of the year.
Vegetation in exposed areas is stunted and shaped by the wind. Behind the beach areas there are limestone barrens of heath, occupying about one-third of this site. There are two distinct types of heath - Empetrum and Rock. The Empetrum Heath has a continuous or nearly continuous carpet of vegetation - almost lawn-like in appearance. There are forested areas inland on both peninsulas. Tree height, however, rarely exceeds four metres (13 feet). Soil conditions are suitable for trees, but the strong onshore winds limit growth. As a result, in exposed areas the tree growth consists of dense stands of stunted fir and spruce called tuckamore or Krummholz.
Species at Risk - Fernald's braya
The limestone or "Calcareous" barrens of Newfoundland's Northern Peninsula form a unique landscape type, and make up one-third of the land mass within the Port au Choix National Historic Site. In contrast to the acidic soil of most of Newfoundland, the calcareous barrens consist of basic rocks and soil underlain by limestone bedrock. The barrens are characterised by large expanses of bare gravel, resulting from wind erosion and frost action. Evident within the gravel are stone strips and rock boils created by the natural process of freezing and thawing.
The barrens support many species of plants that are at their most southern limit of distribution. These calcium-loving plants (calciphiles) have adapted to the basic soils, and a climate with arctic-like conditions. Many of the plants in this habitat are considered rare to Newfoundland and several are listed by the Committee on Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) as "threatened" or "endangered". Of the 271 vascular plants considered rare for the island of Newfoundland, 114 inhabit these barrens, and 29 of them are only found in this habitat. The Port au Choix site contributes significantly to the protection of this natural heritage by protecting 47 rare plants within its 8km square boundary.
The Dorset Trail leads hikers from the Visitor Centre to the archaeological site at Phillip's Garden. Visitors pass through a variety of habitats, including limestone barrens, and can observe many plant species. For the protection of these plants, we request that hikers stay on the marked trail.
Bird life is influenced greatly by the Town of Port au Choix. The fish plant has attracted a very large number of gulls and common terns. Concentrations of these aggressive birds keep away many other species. Most of the shoreline is too exposed to provide good feeding areas for shorebirds, and the simplicity of vegetation restricts the diversity of bird-life dependent on ground sites. As a result, it is believed unlikely that more than 20 to 25 species of birds actually breed within this site, although 49 species were recorded during four days of field observations in September 1984.
In addition to the flora and fauna at Port au Choix, the site has another significant natural resource: its geology. The limestone bedrock has played an important role in preserving artifacts. It has also preserved the geological record. Fossils in the bedrock along the shore between Point Riche and Port au Choix
have already attracted the attention of Park visitors.TUESDAY, Dec. 6 (HealthDay News) -- In patients admitted with ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (AMI) treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), left ventricular (LV) dyssynchrony is a strong predictor of long-term mortality and hospitalization for heart failure, over known clinical and echocardiographic risk factors, according to research published in the Dec. 15 issue of The American Journal of Cardiology.
M. Louisa Antoni, M.D., of the Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands, and colleagues prospectively evaluated data from 976 consecutive patients (mean age, 61 years; 77 percent men) admitted with ST-segment elevation AMI treated with primary PCI who underwent two-dimensional echocardiography with speckle-tracking imaging within 48 hours of admission to assess LV dyssynchrony. In this group of patients, mean LV dyssynchrony (or the time difference between the earliest and latest activated segments) within 48 hours of AMI was 61 ± 79 ms, with 14 percent of patients demonstrating significant LV dyssynchrony, defined as a ≥130-ms time difference.
According to the researchers, during the mean follow-up period of 40 ± 17 months, 8 percent (82/976) of patients reached the primary end point of all-cause mortality, and 4 percent (36/976) of patients were hospitalized for heart failure. In fact, for every 10-ms increase in LV dyssynchrony, the risk of all-cause mortality and hospitalization increased by 6 percent (adjusted hazard ratio per 10-ms increase, 1.06; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.05 to 1.08; P < 0.001).
"In this growing population of patients, LV dyssynchrony was an independent predictor of adverse outcomes and provided incremental prognostic value over known risk factors for the prediction of long-term outcomes. Therefore, LV dyssynchrony may be useful in daily clinical practice to improve risk stratification and therapeutic management of post-AMI patients," the authors write.
Several authors disclosed financial ties to the pharmaceutical and diagnostic imaging industries.

Copyright © 2015, Wolters Kluwer – Terms & Privacy – DisclaimerFREETOWN, Sierra Leone — A third doctor has died from Ebola in Sierra Leone, a government official said Wednesday, as a leading US health official warned that the outbreak sweeping West Africa would get worse.
The disease has already killed more than 1,400 people in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone, and Doctors Without Borders warned that the influx of patients in Liberia, in particular, is overwhelming their treatment centers there.
‘‘I wish I didn’t have to say this, but it is going to get worse before it gets better,’’ Dr. Tom Fried prepared statement that a new 120-bed treatment center in the country’s capital filled up almost immediately.
The growing number of patients means that the medical charity is not able to provide those patients with intravenous treatments, a primary way doctors keep alive people who are losing a great amount of fluid.
The group did not mention Frieden’s visit or recent visits by UN officials, but it said discussions now about international coordination are coming too late and there are countries that could make a dramatic difference if they provided more expertise and resources. It did not name the countries.
‘‘This is not only an Ebola outbreak — it is a humanitarian emergency, and it needs a full-scale humanitarian response,’’ Lindis Hurum, the Doctors Without Borders emergency coordinator’s death marks yet another setback for Sierra Leone, a country still recovering from years of civil war, where there are only two doctors per 100,000 people, according to the World Health Organization. By comparison, there are 245 doctors per 100,000 people in the United States.
Health workers have been especially vulnerable because of their.
‘‘The international surge of health workers is extremely important and if something happens, if health workers get infected and it scares off other international health workers from coming, we will be in dire straits,’’ said Christy Feig, director of WHO communications.

)As I've written before, Portland pediatric neurosurgeon Monica Wehby has benefited from a fair amount of national buzz about her GOP senate candidacy in Oregon.
But now her main primary challenger, Rep. Jason Conger of Bend, is finally getting some of his own national attention.
Townhall.com, a popular conservative site, posted an article Wednesday whose headline neatly encapsulated its theme:
Beltway GOP Supporting Pro-Choice Over Pro-Life Candidate in Oregon
The story was inspired by a post from Gayle Atteberry, executive director of Oregon Right to Life, on RedState, another national conservative site.
"It is simple," Atteberry wrote, "the Beltway GOP establishment does not believe that a conservative can win in Oregon. So they are trying to hoist a liberal Republican on Oregon conservatives."
This publicity is pretty minor compared to what Wehby has received. She's been profiled in The New York Times and the Boston Globe and had her bumper sticker ("Keep your doctor, change your senator) described as the best of the year so far by columnist George Will on Fox News, just to mention a few examples.
But from Conger's perspective, at least Townhall, RedState, and a few other blogs as well, are talking up the fact that Wehby isn't the only credible candidate in the race. That wasn't happening much before.

Republican U.S. Senate candidate Rand Paul of Kentucky raised $1.1 million in the three months overlapping his primary victory and the start of the fall campaign, marking his best fundraising performance yet.
The money taken up between April and June was slightly higher than the amount Paul collected in the third quarter of last year, when he edged past $1 million in contributions, the Paul campaign said Thursday. The tea party favorite exceeded $600,000 in contributions in each of the prior two quarters.
The recent quarter included a final push for cash before Kentucky's late May primary, when Paul easily beat Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson for the GOP nomination. It also gave an early glimpse of Paul's fundraising prowess ahead of the November vote.
Paul campaign official David Adams told The Associated Press that contributions to Paul, a Bowling Green eye doctor, poured in from "regular people who just want the government to balance the federal budget and follow the U.S. Constitution."
But the amount also included money raised from a high-profile fundraiser last week hosted by Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell, a fellow Kentuckian, at the National Republican Senatorial Committee in Washington. Tickets went for $1,000 per person, with sponsorships up to $5,000 per group.
Adams said he didn't know how much was raised at the Washington event.
Paul, a libertarian-leaning candidate who casts himself as a political outsider, backed off an earlier campaign pledge to avoid tying his fundraising to GOP lawmakers who voted for the 2008 bank bailout. Nine of 12 GOP senators listed on the Washington invitation voted for the $700 billion bank bailout.
University of Louisville political scientist Laurie Rhodebeck called Paul's fundraising total an "impressive figure" in what's shaping up as a big-spending Senate race between Paul and Democratic Attorney General Jack Conway.
Paul and Conway are competing for the seat of Republican Sen. Jim Bunning, who is retiring after two terms.
The quarter also marked a time of controversial statements Paul made about the Civil Rights Act and a defense of BP PLC after scathing government criticism of the oil giant's handling of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
Rhodebeck said Paul's fundraising performance shows his comments apparently didn't inflict long-term damage on his ability to raise campaign cash, noting his showing could give him more fundraising momentum.
"Money often begets more money," she said.
Paul, the son of former presidential candidate Ron Paul, borrowed a page from his father's political playbook by tapping the Internet for campaign cash.
Rand Paul banked $172,000 on Monday in a Web-based fundraiser that drew contributions from more than 2,000 people over a 24-hour period. The campaign said the average donation was less than $90.
Ron Paul, a Texas congressman, turned to the Internet to help finance his unsuccessful run for president in 2008.
Conway spokeswoman Allison Haley declined to comment on the amount the Democrat, a proven fundraiser himself, raised in the quarter.
Both candidates face a July 15 deadline to file campaign-finance reports for the quarter..Diane Werts writes about television for Newsday. Werts previously was the founding editor of Newsday's trend-spotting magazine TV

Beady Eye's Gem Archer: "Nobody's thinking of an Oasis reunion"
Beady Eye behind the gate: (from left to right) Andy Bell, Liam Gallagher, Chris Sharrock and Gem Archer. © Steve Gullick
When Oasis broke up acrimoniously in 2009, the smart money was on Noel Gallagher to release the solo album he allegedly had in his back pocket and show his frontman younger brother, Liam, who wore the pants in the family. After all, Noel wrote the bulk of Oasis' material, including their biggest hits, and he sang on a good share of them, too. What kind of idiot would bet against him?
While Noel has played a couple of solo shows since splitting Oasis, it's Liam who has fired the first real shot across the bow with the release of Different Gear, Still Speeding, the debut disc from Beady Eye, the band he formed with ex-Oasis members, guitarist Gem Archer, bassist Andy Bell (now switched back to guitar, his traditional role) and that group's touring drummer, Chris Sharrock. (Session players perform bass and keyboards on the album.)
Produced by renowned boardsman Steve Lillywhite, Different Gear, Still Speeding is the best Oasis record Oasis haven't made in over a decade. The lead-off single, Bring The Light, is a rollicking, retro-rock blast; elsewhere, on cuts such as The Roller and the aptly titled Beatles And Stones, the band recall (and brazenly name check) their '60s idols.
MusicRadar caught up with Gem Archer to talk about Beady Eye, what it was like recording with Lillywhite and how his guitar approach has changed since his Oasis days. We also posed that burning question on everybody's mind: So when are Noel and Liam going to patch things up?
The new album sounds fresh and full of vigor, like the first few Oasis records. I take it the band is enjoying themselves.
"Yeah, we are. It feels pretty special that everything has happened the way it has. We feel like a brand-new band, which is funny when you think about it, considering that we've all played together for a while and know one another so well. You'd think we might have fallen into a rut musically, but here we are with some crackin' new songs, a cool new attitude and outlook. Yeah, it's fun.
"Plus, the way we work is different, and I think the energy comes from that. We're all individuals. We write on our own and then we present the songs to each other. Then everybody gets involved and has their say. Songs change from the original way they were written. That's the thing with us: the blueprint of the song is there, but anything can happen. That's how it's working with us. I quite like it."
So even though Liam is the frontman for Beady Eye, he doesn't run the show the way that Noel ran Oasis?
"No, not at all. With Noel - and I'm not knockin' him, 'cause he's a great, great songwriter and artist - the songs were mainly his, and they were pretty much his vision. A riff here and there might get changed, but they were his tunes. Yeah, it's much more democratic in Beady Eye.
"It's funny how we started working, though: At first, I kind of thought our songs had a bit of a Roxy Music feel to them. Then I got a text from Liam, and he said that he wanted to go 'more Jerry Lee Lewis, more Eddie Cochran.' That really set the proper tone. At that point, we revved up the tunes and blasted through 'em. It's kind of like The Sex Pistols with piano."
To my ears, Liam's singing has more power than it has in years. Do you hear that?
"I do. I think it's because he's got room to breathe now. Another reason is more technical: On Oasis songs, he would come in and do his vocals at the end of the sessions. He would kind of follow Noel's guide vocals, and because of that, maybe he didn't feel he could put his own personality on the songs. In Beady Eye, Liam is singing right along with us while we play. He's totally involved in every aspect of the music."
Is your approach to guitar playing different in Beady Eye than it was in Oasis?
"In Oasis, if it was a straight-up Noel song, he'd play the guitars. Actually, I played a lot of bass on that stuff. I might stick in the odd guitar riff, but not that much. I think I have a much cleaner guitar sound on the Beady Eye record, but there's less guitar than on Oasis albums. I like the sound - single-coil pickups going through Fender amps. That's what we went for."
Recording with mega-producer Steve Lillywhite
How did Steve Lillywhite come into the picture as producer, and what was it like working with him?
"Steve was great. He came in rather quickly. Pretty much as soon as we formed, after Noel quit, Steve rang us up and said he wanted to throw his hat in the ring. We got six songs together and sat down with him and played them. He liked what we were doing, and we liked his suggestions. The man has done so many incredible records. He's totally got it, you know? You don't have to investigate him too much. His work definitely speaks for himself. What a track record. [laughs]
"The big thing was, Steve let us be us. He doesn't really change bands or make them be something they're not; he just betters what's already there. So we rehearsed everything else, demoed a bit but not much, and then we went about playing the songs in the studio. Steve captured our sound. Nothing was too fussed over.
"I like Steve's way of working: You go in the studio, you knock it out, and you don't lose the spirit. That's really important, I think. I felt like I was 16 again - that's how breezy the process was. And we worked fast, too. I think it was six weeks of recording, six weeks of mixing."
In Oasis, you alternated between playing Gibsons and Fenders. Any changes in what you use with Beady Eye?
"I played a lot of Fenders, but I played some Ricks as well. These songs have a lot of rhythm, so those guitars felt right for the material. It wasn't like I was trying to purposely get away from the 'Oasis sound'; it wasn't premeditated. These songs are light on their feet.
"Some tracks have only two guitars on them, not like that big wall of guitars we had in Oasis. We didn't fill in the sound when we didn't need to. It's like those old Stones records - just a couple of guitars in all the right places."
I'm curious: When Noel quit, were you tempted to go off with him?
Bell, Archer, Sharrock and Gallagher show off their not-quite beady eyes. © Steve Gullick
"No, I went with Beady Eye. It was an intuition. Gut instinct and nothing more. Besides, Noel is very self-sufficient. He knows what he wants to do, and I'm sure he'll do it. He's going to make a bang-up solo album. The guy's so talented. I know he'll do something amazing."
Have you spoken with Noel since the breakup?
"We've spoken, yeah, but not since Christmas. There's no reason why I haven't talked with him more recently - we're just so busy, that's all. But you know, there's no problems between us. The beef is between Noel and Liam, not with the rest of the band."
Oasis reunion - yes or no?
Already there's talk of the possibility of an Oasis reunion. Liam said in a recent interview that he didn't think it would happen, but if it ever did, it wouldn't be for the money - it would be for the fans.
"Yeah, well, nobody's thinking of an Oasis reunion right now. We're all focused 100 percent on Beady Eye. I'm sure Noel is focused on what he's doing as well.
"Of course, Oasis was a big part of our lives for a long time, and it was beautiful. What a great band we were. But it's done. Now that I say that, I have to add that old saying 'never say never.' Too many bands say they'll never do something, they'll never get back together, and then they do. So, you know how that goes. Liam and Noel gave Oasis everything. They gave it their hearts and souls. But hey, the music continues - that isn't going anywhere."
As far as you know, have Liam and Noel spoken at all?
"No, they haven't spoken. I hope somebody breaks the ice at some point, but that's… Who knows who will be first? I don't know. They're brothers, you know? They're blood. Blood's a big thing. When you're in a band with your brother, it's different from being in other bands. Nobody can figure it out but those two. It'd be nice if they did."Join Now

Nominating Constructive Critique WikiLeaks Unhinged Washington
By
Linda Lewis and Coleen Rowley
January 11, 2011
Editor’s Note: The WikiLeaks disclosures have prompted a new round of craziness within the U.S. government – from the Justice Department devising novel theories for prosecuting people (even non-Americans) who publish Washington’s secrets to new strategies for ferreting out disgruntled employees who might be inclined to leak.
In Washington’s Brave New World, pop-psychology concepts, including some from the father of the “learned helplessness” theory that inspired the Bush-Cheney “enhanced interrogations,” are being tried out for use against federal workers, as ex-government officials Linda Lewis and Coleen Rowley discuss in this guest essay:
As Homeland Security Director Janet Napolitano recently admitted, the notion of "fighting them over there so we don't have to fight them over here" is so totally passé.
Printer friendly
(She didn't explain why, if Bush's old rationale is no longer valid, we still keep the wars going sights on the "insider threat" lurking within Top Secret America itself.
Under the guise of sealing the government from more WikiLeaks, Office of Management and Budget Director Jacob J. Lew issued a memo on Jan. 3 to all government agencies providing pages of suggested security procedures and checklists.
He also recommended "all agencies institute an insider threat detection awareness education and training program" to "gauge trustworthiness" of their government employees. Some of OMB's suggestions:
• Are you practicing "security sentinel" or "co-pilot" policing practices?
• What metrics do you use to measure "trustworthiness" without alienating employees?
• Do you use psychiatrist and sociologist to measure relative happiness as a means to gauge trustworthiness and despondence and grumpiness as a means to gauge waning trustworthiness? Service  U.S. government.
What kind of government will we have when all this pixie dust has settled? Will we have a diverse and creative workforce, courageously challenging complacency and corruption? Or will we have a Stepford workforce where smiling obedience is the only skill that matters?
(Seligman's earlier theories about how easy it is to instill "learned helplessness" became the basis for the CIA’s “enhanced interrogation” techniques used on detainees in the “war on terror.” Now Seligman is peddling "learned optimism.")
Does OMB's Guidance Make Sense?
Donald Soeken, LCSW-C, Ph.D. retired 06 Captain, U.S. Public Health Service, and Director, Whistleblower Support Center and Archive, has challenged these methods., however. proper permission to release the information. If the information is released, the personnel office of the agency can then use the exam in any way that they are being told to use it.
The forced exam is often given to persons who are whistleblowers, have a personality clash with their manager, or anyone else that management determines is a problem.
Anyone required to take such an exam should refuse with their lawyer's intervention. If all attempts to stop the exam fail, then the employee should have his/her lawyer or a licensed psychotherapist present at the exam.
These exams are like the old Soviet style psychiatry and all past congressional hearings since 1978 have found them to be of little value and have indicated they should not be performed on government employees.
One psychologist who worked at the National Security Agency told me that the exams cannot determine who is a potential government spy. Other methods are more effective for that purpose whereas the forced psychiatrist fitness-for-duty exam is of no value in determining who might give information to a foreign government.
Such exams would be of no utility in determining who might go to the press to expose waste, fraud, or abuse of power. These exams are permanently harmful to the mental health of the individuals who take them.
Do Grumpy Workers about the new policy work.
So just examining these famous case histories – but of course limited to these four who were eventually exposed – D.C. alone could decimate the U.S. government.
Just looking at the smiling faces of the CIA-FBI spies, OMB would have a hard time seeing the grumpy, despondent traitor who lurked behind the facades?
Adhering to these pages of new paranoid-driven security procedures and instituting widespread monitoring of government employees, students and retirees, just because some Washington D.C. U.S. military has given Martin “Dr. Happy” U.S. population as a whole. 13 years for the U.S. Department of Agriculture as a planner and analyst specializing in weapons of mass destruction before retiring in 2005.,From the Meadow

JERSEY CITY, N.J. (AP) — The FBI says a Hudson County freeholder was not the target of an investigation or forced to testify at a computer hacking trial.
The FBI tells The Jersey Journal ( ) Freeholder Jose Munoz was a victim and had provided information voluntarily that led to the conviction of the son of West New York Mayor Feliz Roque.
Joseph Roque was sentenced to one year of probation and community service. His father was acquitted of conspiracy and gaining unauthorized access to computers after Munoz created a website calling for his recall.
Freeholder Bill O'Dea had asked the FBI to respond after other freeholders questioned whether Munoz had done something wrong.Ever...

Baked Flour Tortilla Chips, Crisp and Flaky
Remember those chips in the background of this post? We loved them so much, we thought we'd give them their very own shiny post. These chips are all about simplicity. Wedges of flour tortillas are coated in canola oil and sprinkled with salt, then tossed on a pan to get all crisped up in the oven. That is all it takes to get some crispy, flaky baked chips. It's a great, healthy alternative to fried tortilla chips, and we honestly think they taste better too, with the right tortillas. You just don't get that flakiness with deep frying. Oh, and a word to the wise... do not use gluten free spinach tortillas you find at Whole Foods just because they sound cool. They do not taste good. At all. Just use Mission flour tortillas...
Ingredients
4 flour tortillas (I like using Mission brand tortillas)
1 tablespoon canola oil
1 teaspoon kosher salt
Instructions
Heat oven to 350. Cut each tortilla into 8 wedges, like a pie. Place in large bowl. Drizzle with oil and salt. Using tongs, coat each wedge with the oil and salt. Place the wedges carefully on two baking sheets (you don't want them stacked on top of each other), and place them in the over for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy.
I like that these are baked instead of deep fried. Definitely healthier.
Oh I could so easily munch on these!
Ooooh, these are my fav thing to do with left over tortillas! (esp bc I can load them with salt... :) )
Ooooh need to try this!
Very crunchy!
I started making my own tortilla chips last year but i was deep frying. Baking is definitely healthier!!! Will do thuis from now on...
I love making homemade tortilla chips! They're so much tastier and I love how crispy they get.
These look irresistible!! And a perfect pairing with your strawberry and corn salsa! :)
These look fantastic. I adore baked tortilla chips!
Yum!! These would be perfect with the hummus I just bought...I mean "made." :P
haha trendy tortilla fail ;) I'm a good old fashioned flour tortilla girl too! These chips look fantastic, like a pita chip but not. Awesome!
would love to dip some in baba ganoush
These look so easy to make! I guess I never thought homemade chips would be that simple :)
Great! Perfect to go with my sweet potato hummus recipe :
I will share on my blog under the recipe for people to know where to find nice and crunchy chips to dip in it!
Haha. I would totally try the spinach tortillas too. These are gorgeous chips - I'm so happy they're baked.
they look crispy and delicious!I would love some with guacamole!
i actually did a search the other day for homemade tortilla chips. so great!
These look so good I could eat them, right now. I make these with low carb tortillas and they are great ... Happy Friday :-)
These look amazing! Yesterday I cooked some mexican food and still have some guacamole: perfect with your wonderful chips!
We love making our own homemade tortilla chips! They are so good!
I love Mission's flour tortillas, so I'll definitely give their corn ones a try!
Homemade chips are the best! They look yummy!
Homemade chips are the best!
These sound delicious. I like that they are baked.
I love making these as well - tasty and delicious!
Thanks for sharing this post and glad you made it to the post. I know that tortilla chips were made of leftover tortillas at restaurants and wondered if we can do it in the oven. We always have leftover tortillas that sometimes end up in the compost. I will give this a try for sure!
I always say I'm going to make my own, but for some reason I never do. They are so easy and they look delicious, I AM going to make them!
Ooo Im seriously making these tonight! I have those exact tortillas in my pantry already and some homemade hummus in the fridge (I've been obsessed with tortilla chips and hummus lately!). Looks awesome!
I make tortilla chips in the same way....baking them produces such good results and they keep well for a pretty long time as well!
These look absoloutely delicious! I have some in the oven, right now!- Getty Images
This Fixer watched the Chicago Bulls blow out the New York Knicks on Wednesday night, and saw that the Cleveland Cavaliers were only listed as 13.5-point favorites over the Knicks on Thursday night. So he wondered, why not take out a loan to make a bet? Surely the Knicks would be even less of a match for the Cavaliers and LeBron James, making his hometown return after four long years in the heat of South Beach.
Well, that didn’t happen, and now this Fixer is in perilous debt to a guy named Slim. The Cavaliers looked listless as they lost to the Knicks, not legendary, and hardly lived up to the hype generated by the return of James, the addition of sweet-shooting ball collector Kevin Love, the maturation of young superstar Kyrie Irving and the reignited relevance of a Cleveland team finally emerged from the wandering woods.

The Ballad of Joe Theismann (Saved By The Blog)Blue hydrangeas are a classic and popular wedding flower. These garden stems are perfect for a summer wedding, as they act as a gorgeous and natural accent, but don’t dominate the entire ceremony.
Assembling a blue hydrangea wedding is also incredibly easy. At the very least, you just need several hydrangea bushes, stem cutters, floral tape, large containers, and finishing ribbon for the bouquet wrap. If you want to create a more full and diverse look, you can also add in some assorted greenery or white/cream stems, such as a rose.
The visual below shows you just how easy it is to assemble your own blue hydrangea wedding bouquet.
I also fell in love with this wedding centerpiece pictured below. This is great for all you DIY brides who cannot get enough blue. The mason jars add a simple rustic touch and the blue hydrangeas definitely complete the look.
You can recreate this look by trimming off the stems from our blue hydrangea bush, and placing them in one of our blue mason jars. If you want to change it up a bit, scatter a couple mason jars around the event with white hydrangeas as well.
If you aren’t much for assembling your own wedding bouquet or wedding centerpiece, just use our premade blue hydrangea wedding bouquet for both.
Carry it alone, or pair it with one of our lovely containers for your wedding centerpieces.
The blue hydrangea wedding is one of the simplest looks to recreate. It is perfect for a summer wedding, and goes well with DIY brides who prefer a more natural, garden fresh look without much fuss.

On November 29, 2012, Albany Molecular Research, Inc. (the "Company") approved a restructuring plan related to its operations in Bothell, Washington.
As a result of shifting market preferences related to integrated drug discovery activities, the Company will further optimize its location footprint by closing its Bothell, WA site. The site's biology capabilities will transition to the Company's fully integrated discovery location in Singapore and certain analytical capabilities will consolidate into the Company's analytical quality group in Albany, N.Y.
In connection with the restructuring plan, the Company expects to cease all operations at its Bothell facility effective March 31, 2013. The Bothell facility currently has 24 employees.
As a result of the restructuring, the Company will be terminating the lease of its Bothell facility which will result in a reduction in annual operating expenses related to this facility. The Company expects that these cost reduction initiatives will result in annual savings of approximately $2.0 million which will begin to be recognized in the second quarter of 2013.
In connection with these actions, the Company expects to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $11 million which includes a $4.5 - $5.0 million non-cash fixed asset impairment. Cash charges will consist of $4.0 - $4.5 million for estimated lease obligations to be paid ratably over 24 months commencing in Q2 2013 and approximately $2.0 - $2.5 million for employee and other related costs to be paid during the first half of 2013. The Company expects the majority of these charges to be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012 and in the first quarter of 2013.
On November 30, 2012, the Company issued a press release announcing its restructuring plan. A copy of the press release is attached hereto and furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1.Fort Worth, Texas (PRWEB) February 26, 2014

It's always the way with technology that it starts out expensive then tumbles in price as more manufacturers enter the field. With smartwatches that fall in price has come pretty quickly as Chinese manufacturers have jumped on the bandwagon.
The last budget smartwatch we looked at proved pretty impressive for the price. The GV18 Aplus is cheaper still and yet packs in even more features. So, is it cheap and cheerful or cheap and nasty? Let's find out.
System76 Meerkat is a cute Intel Broadwell-powered Ubuntu Linux computer [Review]
Imagine if every time you wanted a Windows computer, you had to buy a Mac, format the hard drive and install Microsoft's operating system. That would suck, right? This is pretty much how it is for Linux users, sadly. If you are a user of a Linux distro such as Fedora or Ubuntu, for the most part -- unless you are a system-builder -- you have to buy a Windows machine, and install your preferred operating system.
What if you want to buy a computer with an operating system such as Ubuntu pre-installed? Enter System76. The company sells computers -- both desktops and laptops -- running the Linux-based Ubuntu operating system. Recently, the company began selling the Meerkat -- a mini computer based on Intel's NUC. I have been using the computer for a few weeks now, with both Ubuntu and Windows 10 and I am ready to share the experience with you..
EasyAcc DP100 Bluetooth 4.0 speaker [Review]
There are lots of Bluetooth speakers on the market, so which one you choose really comes down to the features you value most. Is sound quality your top priority or is portability and long battery life a bigger attraction?
The EasyAcc DP100 certainly qualifies on the portability front. It's a compact design, about the size of a Coke can, feels nicely weighty and has a rubber base so it won't slip around. The design is quite stylish in matt black with a shiny highlight around the top. There's an on/off switch and sockets for charging and aux-in at the back. Playback controls are operated by a grey, rubbery button on the top, this works well enough but doesn’t have a particularly nice feel.!

Samsung 850 EVO SATA SSD -- this is the drive you've been waiting for [Review]
The absolute best upgrade for any computer that's operating system is running from a hard disk drive, is a solid state drive. Why? The performance increase is significant, while SSD prices are decreasing. In other words, you can speed up your PC without hurting your wallet.
The problem, however, is deciding which SSD to buy. While affordability and speed are important qualities, I tend to put a premium on reliability. Of course I want the drive to be fast, but the contents of the drive -- important documents and family photos -- trump anything else. Luckily, Samung's offerings have proven to be both reliable and fast, while also being reasonably priced. Today, I am taking a look at the latest and greatest SATA variant; the 850 EVO.

Inateck BP2001 Bluetooth stereo speaker [Review]
With smartphones and tablets increasingly becoming the focus of our entertainment a decent portable speaker is becoming an essential accessory if you don’t want to be tied to headphones or want to share your music with others.
Inatek's latest offering has a pair of 5W speakers mounted in a stylish, compact (around 9.5 inches long by 2.5 inches high) black and silver enclosure. It has a nice weighty feel and there's a slot in the top into which you can sit a smartphone or tablet -- a pop-out strut at the back prevents the unit from becoming top heavy and tipping over as well as keeping a comfortable viewing angle -- so you can use it to watch videos. A built-in microphone means you can make hands-free calls too. However, it isn't an actual dock so it won't charge your phone or tablet.

ZTE Blade L2: An affordable 5 inch quad-core Android smartphone [Review]
Smartphones have become such an important part of our lives that it makes sense to get the best make and model you can. However, not everyone can afford an iPhone 6 or Samsung Galaxy S6.

More on the funeral further into the issue. Also: "They write from New York that a resolution has been taken to establish public companies of artizans who were to be endowed with certain privileges for the benefit of trade & increase of manufactures." also a report that: "The new settlement on the Ohio will be the best & only check we can have on the Spaniards on the Mississippi, and, if properly formed, be of great service to West Florida..." (see photos).
Elsewhere is a report from Paris noting: "Mr. Franklin, celebrated for the experiments & discoveries in electricity, which he made in America & carried to the utmost degree of perfection, was lately in this city when the learned & ingenious flocked to see & converse with him." Another item notes: "...a great number of Jews were embarking from different ports of Italy & the Levant with intention to settle in Corsica, where people of all nations are received with open arms provided they bring money or effects."
Elsewhere is: "...that there are three new governments to be established on the continent viz. Detroit, Ohio,and the Illinois; that the ministry stood firm but that our friend Mr. Grenville was very diligent in procuring all the interest possible against the colonies...".

AskDriving Through My Life With Raury’s “Indigo Child” (Album Review)
Now that I’m a month away from 26, I'm getting really worried. I just assumed something would happen and I would move away from home, but clearly that's not the case. I have already written ad nauseam about the fears, uncertainty and blind, winding path that is making music my life, and one of the biggest quandaries I'm faced with is still living five miles from where I grew up. Every day, I am faced with the same sights, streets, and traffic I’ve seen for over two decades. Everything and nothing has changed. The combo Pizza Hut/Taco Bell? Still there. The Tower Records? Long gone. The Best Buy is still there, but I haven't been there in ages and the CD section is a shell of its former self. Rockville Pike used to seem so big to me, but as the days turned to months and then to years, it’s become a cesspool in my eyes.
As sick of it as I am, I still enjoy driving around late at night. It gives me a unique perspective when the seemingly ceaseless spattering of traffic and congestion that is Rockville Pike is replaced with nothing but a few trucks, cars and blinking yellow traffic lights. So I still drive up and down the Pike late at night, especially when there is a new album out. There is something about listening to music in this setting that really makes me connect, and when I did it with Raury's new Indigo Child album, it made me look at the Pike, and the many stages of my musical life, in a much different light.
Music is more than just music. Music is a marker in time. I use songs and albums the way people use photos. I have memories and relationships with certain music based on who I was when it influenced me. For example, College Dropout represents the first few months after I got my driver’s license. While it is impossible to have that relationship with a project that has been out for mere days, Indigo Child did bring back some memories of albums that are personal classics. I am not comparing Indigo Child to these great albums - I tend to shy away from comparing artists or projects - but it means something when I listen to Indigo Child and hear shades of some great pieces of music from Rockville Pike voyages past.
For example, The Red Hot Chili Peppers’ Blood Sugar Sex Magik. I used to listen to "Power Of Equality" racing down the Pike and I'm pretty sure "Suck My Kiss" was playing when I literally these, heading ease. Maybe it's the simple, airy production, or maybe it's the way Raury effortlessly switches between soft crooning and a talk-rapped flow, but regardless, I was reminded of Channel Orange.
Even tracks that weren't as engaging and didn't evoke nostalgia had an impact on my drive. "Woodcrest Manor" is a little sluggish for my tastes, but thanks to Raury’s great songwriting, as I drove by the same bars, gyms and grocery stores I have for years, they appeared in a different light. As Raury crooned, "If this view becomes nothing new remember once it was beautiful," I thought about how exciting driving up the Pike used to be. I might be tired of it, but it’s still home.
My late night drive was not the life-changing, existential experience I might be making it sound like, although Raury's dreams, heart, and youthful exuberance do bring out my sentimental side. In fact this ride was pretty uneventful. The lyrics and themes that pervade Indigo Child may make me look at my hometown in a more nostalgic, fuzzy sense for a short hour, but even for just a standard drive, Raury's EP served as a welcome co-pilot. Efforts like "Cigarette Song," my favorite track off the project, makes the longest of red lights tolerable and something about "God's Whisper" is perfect for blasting with the windows down; especially when I’m on a road normally filled with soccer moms and delivery trucks. Sure these songs can evoke emotion, but they can also serve as nothing more than an enjoyable listen, which is just as important.
Not all of my ride was smooth sailing. For an album that’s a melting pot of styles, Indigo Child has an incredibly cohesive and fluid sound, but it could be even stronger had some of the skit-like voicemails been shortened, blended, or even eliminated. I know they are essential to understanding the album, but they also at times took me out of the environment and ambiance Raury spent so much effort creating. For example, "War Pt.1" comes out of nowhere and as it builds and builds I get more and more excited for what's next…but then, a voicemail. I was taken off the edge of my seat. Had it skipped right to "God's Whisper," that song could be even more powerful. The music here is great, I’d like to hear more of it. It’s a long drive.
As the album ended with a simply stunning, textured instrumental on the eight minute long (but worth every minute) "Seven Suns," I recapped the trip in my head. By the end of Indigo Child, and my late night cruise, I was thinking about how much has changed since I was buying CDs at Tower Records. A lot has changed, both in music and in my life, even in the short time since I was stuck in traffic after work, calming my soul with Channel Orange. Still, no matter how many youthful landmarks are turned into something new, one thing that remains constant is the excitement of hearing a refreshing new project. In that sense, Raury and Indigo Child already feel like an old, familiar friend.

Beginning with Toshiko, Kore-eda has created one of this (or any year's) most convincingly human screen characters, from her gentle, unaware nagging of daughter Chinami (You) to her palpable excitement at the arrival of son Ryo (Hiroshi Abe), from her good-humored, if evidently habitually recounted anecdotes of the Yokoyama's happy past - told in concert and competition with husband Kyohei (Yoshio Harada) - to insensitive digs at her widowed daughter-in-law Yukari (Yui Natsukawa), and her unwillingness to forgive an obese anniversary visitor, who comically is unable to stand after sitting on his leg for an extended duration. In fact, Dr. and Mrs. Yokoyama are in agreement that their guest's life has been a waste. Their is an edge to the film's humanism.
A similar pessimism manifests itself in the patriarch's disappointment that his son Ryo did not fulfill an earlier desire to follow his father into the medical profession. Reflecting Kore-eda's most conspicuous influence, Yasujiro Ozu, Chinami notes: "children don't necessarily grow up the way you want." Indeed, Ryo has not only failed to follow in his father's footsteps, but has recently lost his position as an art restorer. An active cell phone ringer, and his complicit wife, helps him to hide this fact, though Kore-eda's relatively tight static framing allows for his actress to showcase her character's extraordinarily subtle panic. As unemphatic as Still Walking's mise-en-scène typically is, the director's observational camera ideally suits the film's carefully shaded and gradated performances, which to a one bring Kore-eda's film to extraordinarily vivid life - from Toshiko and the squeaky voiced Chinami, to her tween daughter who preens, standing on her tiptoes and gesturing with her hand over her head, at the mention of her recent growth.
The film's greatest strength is this unshakable sense of a real family, so uncommon to the screen, which Kore-eda further populates by persons like Chinami's husband whose good nature is only matched by a complacency at no longer having to prove his worth to the family (or by Ryo's stepson, who true to preteen form, opts for a Coca-Cola/Ginger Ale mix at a self-service soda fountain; here the film's precise sense of detail is much more global than local). More critically, on the other hand, Kore-eda introduces a late temporal shift that alters the film's well-earned, very admirable smallness, as well as the narrative's carefully constructed impression of unfolding in the present; then again, this shift, more positively consider, re-focuses the narrative as universal rather than local, while highlighting its East Asian specificity - Ryo's fate, whatever his intentions, may not be dissimilar from that of his parents. Ultimately, the above quibble, if it has any merit finally, is a small one beside the picture's enormous - and enormously rare - sense of reality.
Yet, in breaking from an evident verisimilitude, Serra's selected landscapes - and in one spectacular set-up, an image of the swimming kings shot from below the water's surface - uniformly possess a preternatural quality. (The director, in a question-and-answer noted his desire to create icons through this imagery, to disassociate man from landscape; the exact opposite, thankfully, appears on screen.) Yet, neither the sense of a reality not present in the traditional narrative nor that of an experienced duration ever lags in Serra's poetic idiom: the three magi disappear over a desert horizon, before reappearing without any clear sense of direction - a sacred journey in all its banality; Mary and Joseph sit outside their stone house, seemingly without end, under the intense Mediterranean sun and after it has set in a rapidly darkening dusk - the downtime involved in raising the Messiah. Serra renews the time image, though again to a specifically haptic effect, in a work that makes the holy, human. like

The Israel Airports Authority is expected to allow wide-body aircraft to take off from Ben-Gurion International Airport between 11:30 P.M. and 1 A.M. in an effort to relax flight restrictions that kept such aircraft from taking a full load of cargo. The airports authority had limited nighttime flights due to noise concerns, but will now allow takeoffs toward the west, the opposite direction of the present flight path from the sole runway in operation while its second runway is being upgraded. (Zohar Blumenkrantz )
IBM is in talks to acquire Israeli data storage startup Storwize for $140 million. Storwize, which develops online data compression software that increases storage space for computer networks, has raised $40 million since it was founded in 2004. The deal was expected to close by the end of July, a source involved in the deal told TheMarker. Storwize officials could not be reached for comment. Investors in Storwize include Sequoia Capital, Bessemer Venture Partners, Tenaya Capital, Tamares Group and Tokyo Electron Device. (Guy Grimland )
Antitrust Commissioner Ronit Kan has approved the establishment of a public committee to monitor traffic to Israeli websites and release the data to the public. Advertisers have been seeking a nonpartisan ranking system similar to the Nielsen ratings for television. The Israel Association of Advertising Agencies says the committee will begin monitoring Internet traffic shortly. (Ayala Tsoref )
Turkey had been one of the destinations of choice for Israelis taking their private jets for a whirl as they headed off to a vacation resort, but those flights have pretty much ground to a halt since Israel's raid of the Gaza-bound flotilla earlier this month, which led to the deaths of nine Turkish protesters against the Gaza blockade and a distinct chill in Israel-Turkey relations. In addition, well-heeled Israelis like Ilan Ben-Dov, the owner of Partner Communications Company, and businessman Noam Lanir, have been keeping their yachts in Turkey, but many have pushed off, docking in Croatia instead. One businessman told TheMarker there were no Israeli yachts left in Turkish marinas. (TheMarker )
The Industry, Trade and Labor Ministry wants manufacturers to mark price-controlled food products with the maximum price, in an effort to keep shops from overcharging consumers. This means products such as basic breads, milk and eggs will have the maximum price marked on the package at the factory if the proposal is approved by a Knesset committee. (Rina Rozenberg )

For intriguing insights into the lives of the Victorians and Edwardians, open my family photo album by clicking the notice alongside.
The album flipbook includes an account of the wartime adventures of one of the first Red Cross nurses, my great-grandaunt Louisa.*
McLaughlin family secrets are revealed in our annotated family tree (view it in Internet Explorer to see hyperlinks).
It traces two lines of descent from England's King Edward I all the way down to cousin Guy Ritchie and his ex-wife Madonna.
I am an English retired octogenarian psychologist now living in Bel Air, California. I grew up in London's Royal Borough of Kensington and was educated at the Lycée Français de Londres until the war broke out when I was ten.
After that I went to Cheltenham College .
But my family could not afford to give me a higher education, so I became a journalist.
I was a Daily Mirror subeditor. In my last years with the newspaper (which had the world's largest daily paid circulation, 4,000,000 — until I left!) I worked weekends, then commuted 150 miles from London to Sheffield University. After obtaining a BA, I gained a PhD in experimental psychology from University College London while lecturing at the City University, London.
A year later I was appointed Associate Professor of Human Communication Theory at the University of Syracuse, and was a consultant to NASA.
Afterwards I became Associate Professor of Computer Applications at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education.
While in Toronto I went to prison — employed as a clinical psychologist, and became a Diplomate of the American Board of Medical Psychologists. This enabled me to go into private practice as a neuropsychologist and psychotherapist after I married in 1980 and moved to California.
My wonderful wife Liliane died in 2009: please read the obituary of this exceptional lady who earned President Clinton's praise.
Visitors to our home used to enjoy looking at our lovely antique secretaire. In 2006 we gave it to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art so that everybody could enjoy it. But now nobody can because LACMA keeps it locked in storage. However you can discover its many secret drawers.
I have crossed the Sahara and the Congo, trekked in the Himalayas and cruised in the Antarctic. Of the more than 100 countries in which I have traveled my favorites are Bali and Tibet.
I enjoy theater, television direct from the BBC, Benny Hill and similar broad comedy, Wagnerian opera, surrealist art, museums of all kinds, computers, reading, conversation, and gourmet food. I am stimulated by novel ideas, many gained in graduate seminars in the sciences and humanities at UCLA where I have twice been appointed as a Visiting Scholar.
I am a member of the Prometheus Hi-IQ Society. I live up to my family motto: I keep my promises.
I am the proud father of Alison Kay McLaughlin, MSc., Diplomate of the American Board of Toxicology. She is Head of Health Canada's Environmental Assessment Unit. Trained in marine biology, Alison used to do research for the Canadian Wildlife Service and the World Wildlife Fund.
Please listen to my professional voiceover
demo.
And here is my reading of John Donne's aubade The Sun Rising.
I have also made a couple of brief videos. The first illustrates Sonnet 116 by Shakespeare or, as I prefer to think, by my ancestor Lord de Vere. I recite the poem in the Received Pronunciation of today's Queen's English and in that of Queen Elizabeth I.
The other video illustrates Wedding by one of Britain's leading poets, Alice Oswald, the wife of my cousin Peter Oswald, who was for years the playwright in residence at London's Globe Theatre.

Araurcaria Industria e Editora Ltd., located in Lages, Santa Catarina, Brazil purchased one four-high tower with one auto-paster and an F122 6-web jaw folder. The M360 will replace a Solna D-30 and will print a 7,000 circulation daily (Correio Lageano) in addition to other semi-commercial print jobs in the Santa Catarina market., in order to print their own newspapers and other third-party publications in the State of Parana. These newspapers had been printed on sheetfed presses.
The M360 is a single-width, single circumference offset press with a rated speed of 36,000 copies per hour. The printing units include standard brush dampening, motorized registration controls, pneumatic impression, and lever-style inkers.
Located in Elizabethville, PA, Manugraph DGM, Inc. (MDGM) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Manugraph India Ltd (MIL).

MDGM now manufactures the new press drive system, the MDGM Digital Motion Control.Is there a return-on-investment (ROI) from automating enrollment and retention efforts?
Calculating ROI is a method of determining an investment's efficiency. ROI is calculated by dividing a program's net gain, or benefits, by total costs incurred. Determining both costs and benefits within healthcare is a complex undertaking, and calculations illustrating ROI of health IT within the realm of public insurance are rare.
Since the formation of the Children's Health Initiatives (CHI) by several counties in California, programs aimed at public insurance enrollment and retention have saved an estimated $6.7 million in hospital costs. These savings are presented and described in an article by Cousineau, et al. entitled, "The Impact of Healthy Kids on Access, Health Status, and Costs." While not providing a specific ROI analysis, the Center for Community Health Studies article "Children's Health Initiatives Have Helped Prevent Over 1,000 Unnecessary Child Hospitalizations Annually" illustrates California experiencing cost savings since implementing programs designed to further Medicaid and CHIP enrollment and retention. Florida has estimated savings of $83 million through its online application system for the ACCESS Florida program. Utah's new data brokering system (eFind), which helps eligibility workers automate searches for eligibility information, recouped its costs for building the system within the first year of operation. More information detailing the Utah and Florida health IT efforts as well as information on other technology solutions currently employed by the States can be found in The Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured report Harnessing Technology to Improve Medicaid and SCHIP Enrollment and Retention Practices (PDF - 604KB).

Using Digital Technology to Teach American History
Gary J. Kornblith and Carol Lasser
Contributing Editors, Textbooks and Teaching
Editors' Introduction
We have all heard the hype: the book is dead, long live the e-book;
the library is dead, long live the Internet; the lecture is dead,
long live "student-centered learning." Even skeptics among us acknowledge
that digital technology is changing how scholars communicate among
themselves and how teachers relate to their students. At a conference
on technology and the liberal arts held a couple of years ago, the
question was posed: What proportion of faculty at your institution
really uses educational technology on a regular basis? The reply:
Virtually all of them if one includes e-mail. And we should include
used e-mail on a regular basis. Today it is part of the daily lives
of nearly all faculty, regardless of discipline. Likewise, with
the advent of course-management packages such as Blackboard and
WebCT, a rapidly increasing number of colleagues are posting their
syllabi online and holding electronic discussions to supplement
in-class activities. In "smart" classrooms across our campuses,
faculty employ PowerPoint to try to engage young people raised on
MTV and video games. We may bemoan the contraction of our students'
attention spans and their naïve expectation that all questions
have "point and click" solutions, but we cannot ignore that today's
students are living in a culture that values instant access to packets
of data more than it does the leisurely contemplation of classic
texts. For reasons both good and bad, we must renegotiate the social
contract between students and teachers in the "information age."
The essays that we publish in this issue of the Journal of
American History address the question of how best to employ
digital technology in the service of teaching college-level American
history. In the opening essay, Michael
J. Guasco of Davidson College reviews America Unbound,
a fully electronic, interactive textbook published by iLrn,
which is available only online. Next, David
Jaffee of the City College of New York offers a kaleidoscopic
analysis of the electronic supplements produced by the publishers
of mainstream print textbooks. He places the emergence of these
products in historical context, and finding only a few of them "ready
for prime time," he explores the gap between the claims made on
behalf of e-supplements and what they actually deliver in practice.
Kriste Lindenmeyer
of the University of Maryland Baltimore County and Mark
Tebeau of Cleveland State University offer guidance
to professors who would rather pick and choose among the wide range
of resources on the World Wide Web than rely on a publisher's pre-defined
electronic package. Lindenmeyer explains how the careful and creative
use of electronic materials on women's experience allows her to
reframe her American history survey, moving gender issues to the
center of the course. Tebeau confronts directly the issue of what
difference technology makes to pedagogy. He argues that digitization
opens up unprecedented opportunities for active learning in the
classroom, which he encourages colleagues to embrace with enthusiasm.
On the basis of these thoughtful essays by experienced teacher-scholars,
the answer to the question of whether digital technology offers
more than bells and whistles appears to be: only if we make it so.

Cowboys tackle Free's performance comes under fireNovember 19, 2012 Updated: November 19, 2012 9:18pm

Jim Ansara did back when he started Shawmut Design &Construction, in Boston, in the early 1980s. His goal was to differentiate himself from bigger competitors that were pursuing the same subcontractors andvendors. So he figured that the best way to stand out would be to pay his bills earlier than his competitors.
Instead of paying suppliers when he got paid by the customer, as most contractors do, Ansara promised to pay within 30 days. Shawmut sometimes had totake out bank loans to make good on its commitment, but as far as Ansara is concerned, the benefits of doing business this way far outweighed the costs.
"It helps position us in the minds of the people we work with. Besides being fair to suppliers, it's been a very good business decision," he says. The policyhad an added benefit, too: subcontractors gave Shawmut more attractive pricing because they knew they'll be paid quickly.
Ansara's advice is echoed by Brian Shniderson, of Premiere Merchandising, in Inglewood, Calif. "We never put carrying the business on our suppliers," he says of the bootstrapping days at his promotional goods andservices business. "We put it on our clients. We'd tell them we're working our butts off, and we need to be paid within 10 days. We made sure the suppliersgot paid no matter what. That way, there's nothing they wouldn't do for us."THE first group to explore a section of a Herefordshire village says it is pleased with the findings.
Several members of Dinedor Heritage Group received permission from English Heritage to perform an archaeological dig at Garrison Meadow at the end of last month.
Completing the dig with the help of Christopher Atkinson, community archaeologist for Herefordshire Council, the team uncovered an old trackway dating back to the 1800s, as well as the remains of an even older medieval trackway.
Also uncovered was medieval pottery and the foundations of a building.
However, group spokesman Chris Over said it is what they didn’t find that was most telling.
He said: “The area is called Garrison Meadow, so we expected to find old artillery shells or the remains of a Civil War encampment, but we didn’t.
“This means our next task is to find out why it is called Garrison Meadow.”
The team were the first to dig at the site that was untouched by farming machinery.
Chris added: “Although we didn’t find too much, the dig answered a lot of questions about the site and it was very exciting to be able to dig on the previously undisturbed land.”

It was probably originally called Garys' Sons' Meadow, after they aquired it to build housing, which they fully expected to get planning permission for!
It never materialised, as they didn't want to foot the bill for building a new road as well.
The site remained empty for many years, and as time passed by, the words Garys Sons and Garrisons kind of merged!
Mystery solved Kids!!Hello list, I'm wondering what should happen when assigning a cString to another where both have pointers to the same buffer? As of version 1.3.36, we first free it and duplicate it afterwards. That surely isn't intended, but how to deal with this? 1) Leave them pointing to the same buffer after operator= 2) Don't free the buffer, but duplicate it (that happens in vdr<1.3.36) Do you see good arguments for 1)? I only have one for 2), as you (I) expect to receive a new copy of cString's buffer you assinged from. And this cString's destructor will take care about freeing memory of the original buffer.

Ondine Myth and Legends | Feedback
Ondine was a water nymph in German mythology. She was very
beautiful and (like all nymphs) immortal. One of the "only
threats" to a nymph's eternal happiness is if she falls
in love with a mortal and bears his child - she will lose
her "gift" of everlasting life.
Ondine fell in love with a dashing knight - Sir Lawrence
- and they were married. When they exchanged vows, Lawrence said,
"My every waking breath shall be my pledge of love and faithfulness
to you." A year after their marriage Ondine gave birth to Lawrence’s
son. From that moment on she began to age. As Ondine’s physical
attractiveness diminished, Lawrence lost interest in his wife.
One afternoon Ondine was walking near the stables when she heard
the familiar snoring of her husband. When she entered the stable,
however, she saw Lawrence lying in the arms of another woman. Ondine
pointed her finger at him, which he felt as a kick, waking up with
a start. Ondine uttered a curse: "You swore faithfulness to
me with every waking breath, and I accepted your oath. So be it.
As long as you are awake, you shall have your breath, but should
you ever fall asleep, then that breath will be taken from you and
you will die!" human
man. This aspect has led them to be a popular motif in romantic
and tragic literature.
In 18th century Scotland, Undines were also referred to as the
wraiths of water. Even then, they were not feared as other wraiths.
Ondine's curse is now a medical term applied to a rare syndrome
where the autonomic (involuntary) control of breathing is lost,
resulting in the need to initiate every breath consciously. Untreated,
patients with Ondine's curse supposedly will - like Ondine's unfaithful
spouse - die if they fall asleep.

STRATO CRUISER
concept for a lifestyle zeppelin
by tino schaedler and michael j brown
STRATO CRUISER
Concept:
Merging the soothing ride of an ocean cruise with Richard Branson’s futuristic visions of space travel, the Stratocruiser offers short, regenerative journeys for the cosmopolitan traveler. The project aims to bring lifestyle and health into travel routines, which have become increasingly compacted and frenzied. Like modern nomads we can again enjoy travel, arriving more refreshed than we left, thanks to incredible views of the worlds most exciting landscapes and cities.
Experience:
As a fictional partnership with the SupperClub, Stratocruiser adds a new experience to the chain’s clubs, restaurants, ‘On location’ and ‘Cruise’ boats. Guests depart for a full day of spa treatments—massage, personal trainers, yoga classes and beauty care are on offer. The Stratocruiser offers “medium-haul” transits between the Supperclub hubs: transatlantic, transpacific, trans-american or Europe-Middle East routes. With spa, library, and private mini-offices available, the contemporary traveler who seldom has time for a cruise can transform an otherwise exhausting and ordinary journeys into a positive experience.
As the zeppelin approaches its lookout destination at sunset, travelers then sit down to a healthy gourmet dinner overlooking glaciers, tropical jungles or Mayan ruins. New locations and star chefs are rotated weekly to ensure that no experience is the same.
As one would expect from the SupperClub, guest DJs inject a club flare after dinner with the option to party the night through or retire to ones private cabin to awake refreshed in the morning at ones origin.
Structure:. Private suites are sheltered away from public spaces on the ship’s belly, while an advanced propulsion system more than doubles the cruising speed of conventional blimps.

Are you considering taking the Eharmony Free Trial? This trial allows you to register with Eharmony at no cost, complete their questionnaire and view your matches. You don’t need to give any payment details to do this, but you won’t be able to contact anyone.
The main benefit of this is that you get to take a good look at the profiles of your potential dates and decide whether there are enough choices for you to justify paying a monthy fee with them.
Here’s what happened when I took the Eharmony free trial for myself!
The first part was pretty easy and took less then a minute. This involved entering my name, whether I was looking for a woman or a man, my postcode and my email address.
After this I was taken to the eHarmony questionnaire. This took me a total of 20 minutes to complete and asked questions about my appearance, religion, health, ethnicity, personality, like and dislikes, values, hobbies and more. You could easily spend longer doing this questionnaire, but it is actually better to be spontaneous, because the more you think about it, the less accurate your answers will probably be!
At the end I also had to state my habits for smoking & drinking and what I would be willing to accept in a partner. Here is an example of part of the questionnaire:
After all these probing questions I was able to select how far away i was willing to travel to date people and whether or not I would be willing to relocate.
Once I’d finished with the EHarmony questionnaire the site recommend that I upload a photo and add additional information to my profile. You don’t have to do this, but you’ll probably get a lot more interest from people if you have photos and a complete profile. If you are not really sure at this stage, just leave this out and you can always add it in later.
After all of this I was shown my potantial matches and could browse through their profiles to learn more about them. Unfortunately I was unable to view any photos as this is something that is only available to paying members, but I had a pretty good idea from looking at the profiles of whether I’d be interested in dating one of these people. Don’t be disheartened if you only have a few matches. I was only shown 12 matches initially, but received over 200 more over the next few weeks.
I was also pretty interested to read my personality report. This report is available as part of the E harmony free trial and is based on the questions you answered. It contains information about your agreeableness, openness, emotional stability, extraversion and conscientiousness. I was fairly surprised at how well this report described me!
Overall, if you are serious about finding that perfect match, it is worth taking half an hour of your time to take the Eharmony Free Trial and see what the system offers you. There is no obligation and you don’t have to spend any money unless you want to upgrade to a paid membership (which you can do at any time you like).

Imtiaz Ali may be only three films old but he is already a name to reckon with. The director of films like Socha Na Tha starring Ayesha Takia and Abhay Deol, and Jab We Met starring Kareena Kapoor and Shahid Kapur is now ready with his upcoming film Love Aaj Kal starring Saif Ali Khan and Deepika Padukone. He tells his fans more about the film in a chat last week. For those who missed the chat, here's what transpired.
Imtiaz Ali answers, Hello, this is Imtiaz checking in. Will answer questions now.
bienu asked, hi Imtiaz Are you concerned over the high expectations from Love Aj kal as Jab We Met was a surprise package.
Imtiaz Ali answers, Luckily there is so much work to be done in the making of a movie that there is no time to get nervous. I have been told that there are a lot of expectations from Love Aaj Kal, but I can't do anything about it. I can only try to make the movie as well as I can, and that's what I've tried to do. And I had fun.
PPS asked, HI... I JUST LOVED UR MOVIE JAB WE MET... IT WAS REALLY 2VERY GUD.... AND THE SONG "TWIST"IS REALLY COOL!!!!! ALL THE VERY BEST 4 UR FILM...
Imtiaz Ali answers, Hi. to you and to everyone who has talked about Jab We Met -- Thanks. I get a little embarrassed with praise. But thanks -- really.
aaaaaa asked, what was working with saif like
Imtiaz Ali answers, Saif is the most challenging actor I've worked with. His mind works very fast. He has a million ideas in his mind and to make sense to him, you've got to be at his speed. That was fun. But what was remarkable was his humility. He does not think he is a star or anything. He is one of the most humble people I've met. He is a cool guy.
KSMRAJU asked, some scenes in jab we met were just like it is happening in our families.
Imtiaz Ali answers, Since I grew up in a middle class family, I guess.
harita asked, Hi Imtiaz whats your qualification. I am just asking this becoz, the story of jab we met being not so new, still had a very pleasant falavor.Are you any masters in movie making?
Imtiaz Ali answers, Hey. I'm completely uneducated about cinema. Never went to film school. Also, never assisted a director. Just...
priya asked, hi imtiaz, r u there.
Imtiaz Ali answers, yes Oriya I'm here.
mediashri asked, Hi Imtiaz, loved ur Socha Na Tha and Jab We Met. I also liked ur acting in Black Friday. Would like to tell that both ur films had emotional content that was slice of life and struck a chord with the audience. Just want to ask you that would you consider making a film on inter-caste romance as that seems to be happening a lot amongst today's youth and people are caught between love and family. Just a suggestion..looking forward for Love Aaj Kal! The song "Yeh Dooriyan" is superb...hits the heart with its music and lyrics. Way to Go!
Imtiaz Ali answers, I feel the story finds you, rather than you finding it. Also Ye Dooriyan is my favourite track of Love Aaj Kal.

'Saif has a double role in Love Aaj Kal'
Imtiaz Ali answers, Nothing decided about the next movie.
anshul asked, does saif has a double role?
Imtiaz Ali answers, Yes.
priya asked, u look great with long hair and that white shirt i saw u in. i became a great fan of urs.
Imtiaz Ali answers, Cool.
Rajesh asked, imtiaz get your haircut done dude!!
Imtiaz Ali answers, I'm waiting for more people to tell me to get my hair cut. Than I will.
zzzzzz asked, Dear Imtiaz, plz let me know if you are planning to take a new comer girl in future for your movies if yes plz send me ur email id.
Imtiaz Ali answers, I'm not planning a movie with new actors at this point. All the best.
sneha asked, hi how are you my name is sneha sharma i want to act in films
Imtiaz Ali answers, All the best to you and to everyone here who aspires to be in movies. I also have a page on Facebook, by the way.
Prateek asked, Hi Imtiaz , am really an avid fan of your (vibrant style). Just wanted to ask that 3 word movie (e.g. Jab We Met , Love Aaj Kal) is some kind of a Lucky charm???
Imtiaz Ali answers, Just turned out this way. And I thought just because there are three names in Love Aaj Kal can not be the reason for not using it.
geet asked, ya thats wat i was thnks..coz their are no ansrs on left hand side.these rediff team are making us fool
Imtiaz Ali answers, Geet. Nice name.
raziahalim asked, why on earth did u disclose so much about the story of your movie LAK in an interview with etc?
Imtiaz Ali answers, Is this really Razia Apa?
aijaz asked, whats the story is all about
Imtiaz Ali answers, Jai and Meera are seeing each other in London in 2009. Veer Singh, played by Rishi Kapoor, sees them and finds the modern procedure of love relationships ridiculous. He narrates the love story of his youth in Kolkata and Delhi in the 1960s. We see this in flashback in which Saif plays the young Rishi Kapoor. Both stories run parallel in the film.

'Am not planning a sequel to Jab We Met just yet'
nickita asked, why did you choose saif and not any other hero?
Imtiaz Ali answers, I was looking for a modern, quick-thinking, bright, sharp London living actor.
Ejaz asked, Hi Sir, Whare r u leaved in Jasmhedpur.... In Dhatkidih???
Imtiaz Ali answers, Yes.
Veerapan asked, You're pretty known to make some offbeat romantic movies. Keep up the good work. Movies like Socha Na Tha and Jab We Met had a fresh flavour to them and great acting in those movies. Just a suggestion. Sometimes Directors get carried away with money and rope in bigger stars and more stars to make the project bigger to rope in a bigger audience. Please avoid that. Cause because of that the Director's creativity goes for a toss and all that they then think about is Money. I dont know whether you agree with my logic. But that's how I feel. Cheers to you !!
Imtiaz Ali answers, Thanks. Will keep that in mind. You try to get legal too, Veerappan.
Nikunj asked, Hi Imtiaz.. In your films your try to give Punjabi touch...in terms of culture, language, dialogues and songs...Do u think this idea has potential in long term?
Imtiaz Ali answers, I am attracted to the vibrance and spirit of Punjab so there is Punjab in my movies somehow. But might not be there in the future.
Mohit asked, Imtiaz- This is Mohit Misra. Good to hear about your incredible success.
Imtiaz Ali answers, Moti... Really... Hope you are rocking. Heard about your international marriage. See you soon.
seema asked, imtiaz u r so sweet that u said u will answer gals questions first, so these guys are jeleous.
Imtiaz Ali answers, Just that I like girls better, so...
saif asked, i wish LAK flops
Imtiaz Ali answers, I hope not.
Afzal asked, is it a traingular love story
Imtiaz Ali answers, No.
Kusuum asked, Luvd Jab We Met, are you really planning a sequel???
Imtiaz Ali answers, Not yet.
Image: A scene from Jab We Met
'Am not interested in acting'
LAAJOKAADADAJEE asked, LMTIAZ ANY HOT SCENE IN YOUR MOVIE ?
Imtiaz Ali answers, Unfortunately not.
vijay asked, Hi Imtiaz have you ever considered acting in movies?
Imtiaz Ali answers, Not interested in acting.
hareesh asked, common Imtiaz dont be like others - type fast and answer- u just need to answer on a single movie
Imtiaz Ali answers, Fast enough now?
iyerma asked, hi imitiaz... it was wonderful jab we met... good luck for LAK.. i have twin boys namely ayush and ashray..kindly give your blessings..
Imtiaz Ali answers, I'm not where you have to bless. But all the best wishes, all the love to Ayush and Ashray and to you.
jagdish asked, i'm waiting ur next movie....hope its better than JWM...
Imtiaz Ali answers, Hope so too.

Imtiaz Ali answers, I am very happy directing.
Imtiaz Ali says, Hey all. It was really nice chatting with you. I'm off now. Hope you like Love Aaj Kal. It is releasing on the July 31. Find a way of letting me know what you thought of the movie. Bye. Zindabad.

articleWoman fights back against purse thief
A woman in the Heights refused to be a crime victim.
Jeanie Cooper said her hands were full about 5:45 p.m. on Monday as she walked up to her front porch on 14th Street near Studewood. She said a man came up and tried to steal her new purse. She wasn't about to let anyone steal it.
"When he started pulling me, I feel back downstairs and I was laying right here," said Cooper. "The purse and the lunch kit were laying underneath me. He's like, maybe, 125 -- little guy. I weigh 200 pounds. He's trying to drag me down the thing."
She said he dragged her down the sidewalk. She said the man eventually gave up, jumped in a getaway car with another man and took off.
But she held on to her new purse.
"He never said a word. And finally gave up because leverage just wasn't on his side. He dragged me all the way from there over to here," Cooper said.
She warned others not to make the same mistakes she did.
"Pay attention to what's going on because you become so desensitized or used to your environment that I would have not have thought a thing about it if he was parked somewhere else on the street," Cooper said.
Houston police said the robbery division is investigating this as an attempted theft by force case.

Just two years removed from winning their second consecutive NCAA Division I national championship, the Jaguars are fighting to play in the NCAA Regionals. Using its final day of competition, Augusta State is playing host to a 36-hole event today at Forest Hills Golf Club.
The five-team field, which includes Georgia State, Savannah State, Bethune-Cookman and Gardner-Webb, tees off at 8:30 this morning off the No. 10 tee.
Augusta State is four wins under .500 – the prerequisite for making postseason play. If the Jaguars win their tournament, they will qualify for regionals on the number.
“The teams are on their way here,” Augusta State golf coach Kevin McPherson said Friday afternoon. “They obviously know we need some wins. We’re not pulling the wool over anyone’s eyes.”
Augusta State was able to play one final day of competition because of the first day of the Hootie at Bulls Bay Intercollegiate getting washed out. McPherson said it wasn’t easy finding other teams that had one remaining day left as well. The draw for those teams, he said, is an opportunity to play competitive golf.
“A lot of these teams that still have championships coming up, it gives them another day of competition,” McPherson said. “It’s not going to cost them anything. If I was in their same shoes, I would utilize the day as well.”
Augusta State is ranked No. 49 in Golfweek, easily high enough to qualify for the NCAA Regionals. Now, they just have to win.
McPherson will stick with the same lineup that placed second to Texas in the Jaguars’ home tournament earlier this month at Forest Hills. Senior Derek Chang led the way with his third-place showing at 5-under, while Robin Petterson finished fifth. Cody Shafer tied for 19th, while Alex Wennstam tied for 33rd and Maverick Antcliff tied for 45th.
“I’ve been reminding them of how they played in their last tournament,” McPherson said. “I’ve been keep them focused on playing another event.”St. Joseph's Catholic Church..

—Melissa Ludwig think that Wen's comments may be linked to the appearance of a story on Xinhua yesterday: . I discussed this in a post on "The 'Young Man'" ().
It proves that the censorship department is controlled by the Conservatives in the party while the Liberals in CCP (Wen included) has no saying on that matter?
So we now have the 'Good' commies and the 'Bad' commies - just like the Taliban. lol
This article has completely got things backwards.
1. It is the Western media who have virtually paid no attention to this interview.
2. The CNN interview is in fact widely discussed in China and available.
"Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao interview by CNN’s Fareed Zakaria ignored by English ‘China’ blogs"
In fact, the above post has the entire interview carried on tudou.com. The interview is everywhere in China.
Quite amazing how much the West is longing for a Orange or Velvet Revolution in China to serve its geopolitical agenda of slowing CHina from growing But to stop its day dream and make them p*ssed off, most of Chinese just prefer to have so-called Demoncrazy LATER.
我擦
hg, how do you know that increased freedoms wouldn't spur even greater growth in China, rather than less?
I'd like to read what Han Han has to say about the "forbidden" interview.
interview at tudou pauses every 3 seconds. other than that, it's great - so far
Does Wen speak any English? Do any of the Chinese leaders? Most are scientists and engineers rather than liberal arts professionals, but as educated leaders they might have learned it as a way of better understanding the West.
That said, I like the way he speaks Mandarin, slowly and clearly - what a laowai needs!
Wen: "We have no censorship in China,......, and this speech of mine will be censored in China."
Our dear leader is a very funny guy.
Wen, My surname is Wen too. I am proud of you. Plz push the reform ahead fearlessly. We will support u.
Wen and Hu may be the last generation of Chinese leaders from a non-establishment background (largely a consequence of the anti-establishment spirit of Mao's cultural revolution). Already, all those vying for the next round leadership posts are establishment princelings.
I am pessimistic about pol reforms promoted from the top. The grassroots have to ask for it. Sadly, bloodshed may be necessary.
mark, you know pretty much about china. o(∩_∩)o...
中国的腐败早已是根深蒂固了的，各矛盾日趋突出，温家宝的政治改革必然引发流血事件。By Mong Palatino
The Diplomat
January 22, 2014
Najib Razak’s gaffe involving the humble green veggie has become a rallying cry for the opposition.
Kangkung, or water spinach, has been trending in Malaysia since last week after Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak cited it as an example of a commodity that has become less expensive over the course of his administration.
Najib was responding to protests against rising prices caused by the government’s decision to cut subsidies. During the New Year celebration, thousands joined a street parade in Kuala Lumpur to denounce the increase in prices of basic goods and services such as petrol, sugar, and toll fees.
Najib complained that the government is often blamed for rising prices – but ignored when prices go down.
“When the prices come down, why are there no praises for the government? When it goes up, the government gets the blame. This is unfair because [such issues are determined by] the weather condition,” Najib said in Bahasa.
Then, he highlighted kangkung’s cheap price in the market: “I read in the newspaper that some prices have come down. Kangkung prices once went up and now it is down.”
This remark ignited an uproarious public reaction. It unleashed a kangkung meme which quickly went viral on social media. Najib’s enemies used it to criticize the government’s economic policies, in particular the slashing of subsidies for sensitive consumer goods. They painted Najib as a clueless leader and insensitive to the worsening situation of the poor.
In a subsequent speech, Najib was unapologetic for his kangkung remark. He clarified that he merely used the green vegetable as an example to explain the economic principle of supply and demand. He also added that kangkung and sotong (squid) are his favorite foods.
But Najib was reminded by critics that people are not complaining against price increases in all products but only those which are subject to government regulation or price controls such as petrol, sugar and toll rates. They added that no one is blaming Najib for the fluctuating price of kangkung, the humble vegetable of the masses.
It is also misleading to use kangkung as a price index of consumer products since households spend a paltry 2 percent of their monthly budget on buying vegetables.
Indeed, Najib could have used better examples to assure the public that food prices have remained stable. But the humorous reaction to his kangkung gaffe could be a reflection too of the rising public dissatisfaction with Najib and the ruling party, which has been in power since the late 1950s.
Perhaps ordinary Malaysians, burdened with economic difficulties such as high prices and depressed wages, were simply expressing their frustration through humor. Instead of being sympathetic, Najib appeared to be mocking the plight of his constituents when he delivered his now infamous kangkung remark.
Thanks to the kangkung-loving Najib, the opposition now has a symbol to rally more Malaysians against the government. If the Bersih (clean) election reform movement has the color yellow for its symbol, perhaps the Reduce Cost of Living Movement (Gerakan Turun Kos Sara Hidup) or Turun could further popularize the green leafy vegetable as a new protest icon. Kangkung is rich with meaning: it’s cool because it’s green; and it can represent all Malaysians because it grows nearly everywhere in the country.Lem Satterfield January 27, 2012 Cotto’s advisor, Gaby Penagaricano, could not immediatley be reached, although he has also acknowledged that Cotto has had talks with the Mayweather camp about a potential fight. A winner of three straight fights, all by knockout, since being stopped in the 12th round by Pacquiao in November of 2009, Cotto said that he would face Mayweather if the Pacquiao fight does not come to fruition. “I will not fight below 150 pounds. Mayweather Jr. said he has no problem going up to 154 to fight me. Pacquiao is the one who objected and wants me to once again come down to a weight between 145 and 147 pounds,” said Cotto, in an interview with Raul Alzaga of Primera Hora that was translated on BoxingScene.” Mayweather is slated to begin an 87-day jail sentence staring on June 1, and has targeted May 5 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas for his next bout. Arum and Koncz, meanwhile, have dismissed May 5 for Mayweather-Pacquiao, citing their camp’s desire to construct a 40,000-seat, temporary outdoor venue near the Las Vegas Strip in late May or early-June to maximize revenue.

Good pictures,Thanks,Stories too.
Wow, what a unique structure and history. Similar to the Genesee Theatre in Waukegan Illinois.
Surely the 4.2 mil asking price was for the entire Wilma building.
Good to see it’s still operating.
A 1925-ish 3/10 Robert Morton was moved from a theatre (Pantages?) in Spokane and installed in the Wilma well over 30 years ago. It is still in the Wilma..
For sale $4,250,000
Here is a photo from July 2006:
I was one of the few lucky people that enjoyed the honor of living in this Theatre, 3rd floor, apartment #306 or was it #300,,, in 1996. I was the Elevator Operator for the Theatre and the apartments above. It went through many changes of hands through the years and has a beautiful history. As one of the few owners was cleaning out the basement of this fine theatre he proceeded to through away many of its wonderful collections of art, furniture and chandeliers, I at the time did not have the room for this but made it possible and collected as much as I could, along with some of this stuff was an upright piano from the main theatre, a love seat from the original Chapel of the Doves hallway and stocks from another theatre in Idaho called, ah, oh,,, I cant remember, something like the Starlight Theatre, I have the name somewhere. Books, diaries, lamps, movie posters and various other trinkets.
I just found out that the Wilma was put up for sale in 2002. It is still for sale and the listing I found for it said the asking price was 4,250,000.00! Wow!

I am familiar with this theater from the mid-1980’s when I was attending U of M. It is housed in a large office building which is quite nice in and of itself, and overlooks the Clark Fork River and Higgins Street Bridge. The current wesite is, sounds like they are still active. There was a little chocolate/jewelry/flower shop on the main (street) level called “the Jewel Box.” there was a screen on the level below the bridge and a very small theatre called “Chapel of the Dove,” and people got married there!Choose your preferred language.

The following functions (or changes to existing functions) would help a lot in finishing the Simcraft parser. I'd prefer parse output to not refer to anything in Nemo.D directly. I apologize in advance if I missed any existing functions that already fit.
New(?) functions:
-.
The following behavioral changes to existing functions would be very helpful:
- GetSpell[Applied/Current]BonusDPS could factor in critical damage bonus (probably as per the above new function)
- GetSpell[Applied/Current]Bonus[Damage/DPS] could work for melee/ranged spells too. This would be amazing. I understand there are already functions to get at current/applied AP, but it would be great to get at the entire DPS calculation that magical spells get (taking into account melee/ranged haste etc.), as well as being able to treat all spells the same as an end user.
- It would be nice to confirm that the above DPS functions reflect changes from Mastery bonuses.

Closing ticket until we decide a good way to tackle the damage bonuses for all classes including gear.
@soulwhip: Go
Alright, that's fine; you can scrap it then and we'll implement crit dmg in rotations if needed
@nefigah: Go
So the function name can be GetSpellAppliedCritDamage?
Seems to make more sense and the matching simcraft property is crit_dmg, correct?
This function may belong in the rotations. It calculates using so many variables like the amplified buff and each spell may be different based upon the number of stacks of a buff or I see some that depend on the number of ticks remaining, tier sets are checked. I don't see a good way to make a generic GetSpellAppliedCritDamage. Correct me if I am wrong.
@soulwhip: Go
I thought "GetSpellCritChance" and "GetSpellAppliedCritPercent" return your percentage chance of critically hitting? I was talking about Crit damage/healing effect bonus, such as you get from a meta gem or certain classes have for certain spells (like Lightning Bolt for ele shaman)
That's why I was thinking it would have a spell param, because not all spells in a school might get the bonus
GetSpellCritChance takes spell school as parm.
@soulwhip: Go
Yes, I certainly wouldn't recommend making something like Nemo.GetWhetherOrNotToRefreshRip() :)
I included that as an example of some implementation details of Nemo.GetSpellAppliedBonusDPS() when the latter is handed a melee dot instead of a magic one (as opposed to just returning 0 like it does now)
Ah, I put that on there because it's one of the supported properties, as per the simcraft docs:
It's implemented as
so I put it on the list to make it look more "Nemo-like." But if it's not actually used don't worry about it
Hey Nef,
I have a few questions on GetSpellAppliedDuration
@nefigah: Go
I don't want to code specialized functions like this Druid DoT calculator into the Nemo criteria. Let me explain why.
It is too specialized, it even includes a Dream of Cenarius check. This kind of function can change on a weekly basis due to patches or spell buffs or nerfs. I usually throw these dynamic and over specialized functions in the rotation itself. I create a _Data action at the top of the rotation with _nemo_enable_lua and add it to the Nemo table to allow global access. I remember creating _nemo_run_once to aid in this function declaration.
You can look at the Unholy DK rotation has a class specific function like this embedded into the rotation called Nemo.SoulReaperWillExecute=function(healthpercent).
In general, if you are using spellIDs when creating nemo criteria functions, then the function probably belongs in the rotation instead of hard coded into the nemo framework. The goal is for the Nemo framework to survive an expansion, I'm trying to make rotations last a month :P

In general, graduate programs look at the following factors when making decisions between candidates:
• Undergraduate grade point average (GPA)
• Research experience
• Experience in the field (internships, practica, volunteer and work experience)
• Test scores on graduate entrance exams, e.g., GRE, LSAT, MCAT, etc.
• Extra- or Co-curricular experiences, e.g., study abroad, leadership in student organizations, athletics, etc.
• Letters of recommendation
• Appropriate coursework
Undergraduate grade point average: Programs in some areas of study, such as medical fields, are very competitive, while others are not as competitive. Obviously, making sure that your GPA is high enough to make you attractive to many programs is important. If you are experiencing difficulty in any course, make sure to talk with the professor and seek out resources such as tutoring or group study as early in the course as possible. (See the Academic Success page on our web site for more resources.)
Research Experience: Some graduate programs, especially Ph.D. programs, place considerable emphasis on research experience. GVSU offers many ways to become involved with research. Depending on the field you decide to pursue, volunteering to work with a faculty member on a research project, becoming involved in a 499 Independent Research course, presenting your research at regional or national professional conferences, and having research published in a peer-reviewed journal may all be possibilities. You can check on the department web site to find out the research interests of individual faculty members to see who you might want to work with. Student Research
Experience in the Field: Graduate programs in some areas such as Physical Therapy, Medicine and Social Work want to know that you understand what the field is really like, to see that you are interested enough in the field to dedicate time to that field, and to know that you can handle a schedule that includes job-shadowing, volunteering, internships or practica, as well as your academic studies.
Test Scores on Graduate Entrance Exams: Not all graduate programs require entrance examinations. Others place such significant value on entrance exams scores that they establish firm cut-off values and will not even look at your other application materials if the minimum score is not met. Also, to do well on some tests, students will need to invest time to prepare effectively.
Graduate and Professional School Exams
Getting Ready for the GRE
Extra - or Co-curricular Experiences: Well-rounded people who have knowledge of the world around them, an understanding of many different cultural perspectives, and have taken on leadership roles in organizations are prized by many types of graduate programs. Besides, becoming involved in on- and off-campus activities during college enriches your college experience and is a good thing to do whether or not you pursue a graduate degree. Letters of Recommendation: Every graduate program application requires letters of recommendation. You'll also need letters of recommendation if you decide to seek employment after completing your bachelor's degree. So, no matter what your future plans are, cultivating relationships with faculty members is beneficial. To write an effective recommendation, faculty members need to know you as a person, not just as a student. Take time to talk with your faculty advisor and your instructors outside of class. Share your interests and goals with them. Being able to share ideas with faculty can be one of the most rewarding and enlightening experiences during college, for both you and the faculty member.
Appropriate Coursework: There are two things to keep in mind about coursework when you want a graduate degree. One, some graduate programs require specific courses as prerequisites, or a certain amount of credit hours within an academic field. Two, even when specific courses are not required, graduate schools look for a pattern of taking meaningful and increasingly more challenging coursework. It can be a mistake to take "easy" or "fluff" courses during your senior year. Once you have decided on a field of study: A particular graduate field or program may not place the same emphasis on each of the above factors, or may not find all of these factors important. For example, Ph.D. programs in clinical psychology do not tend to value field experience as highly as masters of social work programs do. Because of this, it is crucial to work closely with a faculty member from your field of interest as soon as you have begun to consider graduate study.

FDA Asks Sanofi-Aventis for More Information on Insomnia Drug Eplivanserin
Thu, 09/17/2009 - 4:44am
NEW YORK (AP) — Sanofi-Aventis SA said Wednesday it received a letter from the Food and Drug Administration requesting more information about the company's chronic insomnia treatment Eplivanserin before it can be approved. Sanofi-Aventis said the FDA asked for further detail on the drug candidate's risk-benefit profile. The company said it will contact the FDA within the coming days to request a meeting to discuss what steps and data would be needed for approval.

Members of the pharmaceutical supply chain have two choices when it comes to complying with the long-deferred pedigree, or chain of custody, requirements taking effect on Dec. 1, 2006: manual or automated. Although manual data collection and maintenance of paper records for each container's travels from manufacturer to consumer may be feasible, an automated electronic method will provide more timely and accurate data in the long run with minimal expenditure of manpower.
E-pedigree
An e-pedigree system requires the integration of several technologies, item-level serialization, data capture at various points in the supply chain, and recordkeeping so recipients can trace the product's trip through the supply chain and confirm its authenticity.
Purdue Pharma, L.P. (Stamford, CT) quickly realized item-level tagging had track-and-trace benefits within its four walls when it started tagging containers of its "OxyContin" pain-killer to comply with requirements of Wal-Mart Stores (Bentonville, AR).
Purdue Pharma's system consists of ultrahigh-frequency (UHF) tags and readers, device management software, and data management software (Class 0 UHF tags and readers, Symbol Technologies, Holtsville, NY; device-management software, Northern Apex Software, Fort Wayne, IN; "Auto-ID" and "Event Manager" software from SAP AG, Walldorf, Germany). This system interacts with the company's enterprise resource-planning system ("R/3 ERP," SAP AG) and makes it possible to link each bottle of OxyContin to a specific case and pallet.

More than half of this projected demographic growth will be in Africa, which continues to add people even as population growth in the world at large slows down. Read more from GlobalPost: China's elderly population is confronting poverty “Although population growth has slowed for the world as a whole, this report reminds us that some developing countries, especially in Africa, are still growing rapidly,” said Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, Wu Hongbo, in the UN report.The "World Population Prospects: the 2012 Revision" notes that the population in the developed regions of the world should remain stable at around 1.3 billion until 2050 due to trends of low fertility, while the world's 49 least developed countries are projected to double in population size in their stead. Fertility rates in some areas, such as sub-Saharan Africa, had to be adjusted upwards by demographers."In some cases, the actual level of fertility appears to have risen in recent years; in other cases, the previous estimate was too low,” said Director of the Population Division in the UN’s Department of Economic and Social Affairs John Wilmoth, in the UN press release. India is expected to pass the Chinese population by around 2028 to become the planet's biggest country population-wise, while Nigeria is expected to edge out the US sometime prior to 2050. The European population is expected to decline by around 14 percent. The new figures don't mean that world population growth has started to speed up again. As countries industralize, they tend to undergo "demographic transition," wherein high death and birth rates are slowly replaced with low birth and death rates. It's a demographic shift often helped along by an increase in rights for women. Some experts suspect that the world population will plateau around 2060, and there's a possibility that — after a transitional period of a higher death than birth rate— world birth and death rates could actually even out, keeping the human population stable.Image Unavailable

It will also turn the fans on if it detect high freon pressure or a diconnected a/c pressure switch.
Here is the operational theroy of the system for you.
COOLING SYSTEM DESCRIPTION AND OPERATION Cooling Fan Control The engine cooling fan system consists of two electrical cooling fans and three fan relays. The relays are arranged in a series/parallel configuration that allows the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) to operate both fans together at low or high speeds. The cooling fans and fan relays receive battery positive voltage from the underhood junction block. The ground path is provided at G103.During low speed operation, the PCM supplies the ground path for the low speed fan relay through the low speed cooling fan relay control circuit. This energizes the cooling fan 1 relay coil, closes the relay contacts, and supplies battery positive voltage from the cool fan 1 fuse through the cooling fan motor supply voltage circuit to the left cooling fan. The ground path for the left cooling fan is through the cooling fan S/P relay and the right cooling fan. The result is a series circuit with both fans running at low speed.During high speed operation the PCM supplies the ground path for the cooling fan 1 relay through the low speed cooling fan relay control circuit. After a 3-second delay, the PCM supplies a ground path for the cooling fan 2 relay and the cooling fan S/P relay through the high speed cooling fan relay control circuit. This energizes the cooling fan S/P relay coil, closes the relay contacts, and provides a ground path for the left cooling fan. At the same time the cooling fan 2 relay coil is energized closing the relay contacts and provides battery positive voltage from the cool fan 2 fuse on the cooling fan motor supply voltage circuit to the right cooling fan. During high speed fan operation, both engine cooling fans have there own ground path. The result is a parallel circuit with both fans running at high speed.The PCM commands Low Speed Fans ON under the following conditions:
The PCM commands High Speed Fans on under the following conditions:
Looking at the diagram and reading the operational detail the only thnig I can see if the pcm is good is that realy #1 is stuck. This would give you continous fan operation any time there is voltage to the fans. Control is all ground side on this for the left fan and power side for the right fan, but it uses the right fan in the ground for the left fan for low speed operation of both fans.
Check at the relays to see if the ground is being commanded by the pcm, if not it has to be a relay.
The Modis should show fan command status in the pcm and it should be off.
Do you use I-atn?
The commanded on means that the PCM is for some reason keeping your fans on. I would look at the data stream and see if anything is in the parameters that are listed above to keep fans on.
If you have good accurate inputs and the fans should be off but the pcm is still commanding on then the "logic" says that you have bad pcm.
I am going to paste the replies to a question just like this one on I-ATN, but be sure to look at the last reply. I never did ask if you had any trouble codes, they will keep the fans in default.
This help request was closed with the following on Jan 15, 2004 7:53 AM:
First thanks to all of you that sent us an answer. A couple of you said GM is having trouble with ther computers controlling the fans in this year. We went through the systems and did not see any reason for the computer failing to control the fan operation. But sure enough the new computer had failed. We installed a second computer, flashed burned it and now the fans operate correctly again. We are a little concerned as this fixed this car once before. Only time will tell if it will last.

You can get a tech subscription to I-ATN for $10 a month. Considering the time you lost here it would probably be worth it even if the boss wouldn't pay for it.
A shop subscription cost $20 a month. We have both here and use it ALL the time. It has saved me tons of money.
Andrei so ?
BTW changing data path after the fact is a bad idea. We don't necessarily handle it)
Looks like simply implementing new API or extending old in some way is the way to go here.
Karan,
Any updates ?
do you need to discuss this with Dipti ?
Well here, I am not trying to point out a performance issue. I am trying to point out a functional bug.
I will take this offline with Alk.
Sure. I can create a separate ticket to test out raid 0 and see if it provides better performance.
And my performance recommendation would be:
instead of have disk spindle per index, just raid 0 all spindles you have. That should be as good as or even better than spindle per index.
I see no point at all having separate API for setting up just index path.
We do have API to setup separate index path.
The only thing we dont have is api to set up per-index path.
From capacity planning point of view,
if customer upgrade to 20 and later plan to create views,
by default, views would get created on the same partition as the database files.
There is no separate rest_api to setup path for just indexes.
We don't plan to have such API. You can manually replace files with symlinks. Another option is raid 0
yes for our testing we want to try and put each index on a seperate disk. not sure if there is an api that allows us to do so
I guess right now, we would need separate rest api to configure just indexes.
Not a bug, but a feature i guess.
Following seems to work fine.
curl -d "path=/data&index_path=/indexes"
In RN: This enables users to change the disk location of an index without destroying
persisted data. You can now set index_path and it will delete an existing index only
and create a new disk location for use.
Sibling Rivalry Gave Her Growing Pains, but Joanna Kerns Is in the Thicke of Things Now
Kerns got it, but not exactly the way she dreamed. Newfound success—her only previous role of note was on 1984's short-lived TV version of Four Seasons—has taken an unwanted personal toll. Kerns's nine-year marriage to Richard Kerns, a television commercial producer 21 years her senior, broke up last year, and the experience sent her into analysis. Like her character on Growing Pains, Kerns also is a working mother fighting guilt. "I feel I do miss a lot with Ashley [her 7-year-old daughter], but I also know that if I didn't work, we wouldn't have the life-style we have," she says. "More important, I wouldn't know who I am.".
Instead she became something of a queen of commercials, pitching cars, soap, food—"everything but feminine hygiene," she cracks. During production of a series of Dodge Aspen ads in 1974, she met Kerns, a former movie company executive. They married in 1976. Their age difference—and her recent success—contributed to the demise of the marriage, she believes. "A woman changes a lot between 23 and 33," she says. "His career is high-powered, and as I got more successful it was like two corporations under one roof. A lot of friction happens." They called off the merger but share custody of Ashley, who lives in her mom's 10-room cliffside home overlooking the San Fernando Valley.
It was after Four Seasons that Kerns's career went into full throttle. She clinched the part on Growing Pains, a Cosby clone, last year. "She is a jock and a party girl, but she has an edge to her," says Alan Thicke, 38. "Like June Cleaver on diet pills."
Kerns was, naturally, thrilled to pin down the part but was nervous about working with Thicke. "He always predicts doom," she says. "One week we were going to be opposite Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, and all week long Alan said, 'Oh my God, we're going up against Rudolph. We're going to die.' And we did get beaten by Rudolph." Doom is the last thing Kerns has on her mind. In fact, she is branching out. She joined a writer's group at UCLA and has turned out her first screenplay, Freestyle, now in the hands of an independent producer. It is the story of two sisters trying to make the Olympic swimming team. The younger sister wants to beat the older one so she can win her father's love. It is a story Kerns knows firsthand. And if it's anything like her own life, it will have a happy ending. Says Joanna of her dad: "He has always loved me. I just couldn't see it."

A search team of two traveled the route above Paradise to Panorama Point Tuesday afternoon to assess conditions in the area and look for signs of two overdue parties. Travel was extremely difficult with the team sinking two - three feet into the snow with each step. Visibility was limited, winds were gusting up to 100 mph, and their tracks filled in behind them as they negotiated the deep snow.. The team will be prepared to launch an extensive search once weather conditions improve. Plans include an aerial search by helicopter once flight conditions are year old female from Atlanta, Georgia. A second party of two climbers on a summit attempt via the Disappointment Cleaver route was due back Monday, January 16th. The names of the second party have not been released. Both parties are equipped for camping in winter weather. Due to weather conditions it is expected that they are waiting out the weather before attempting to descend to Paradise.
With the severe weather conditions over the weekend it is expected that the parties would be overdue. Visitors to the upper mountain are advised to stop moving, dig in and wait for better weather during severe weather and white out conditions. There is a winter storm warning in effect through tonight. The storm is predicted to bring 24 - 42" of new snow to Paradise. The road to Paradise will remain closed to the public at Longmire today.

Published: Apr 23, 2013Canadian scientists at the University of Guelph say they've found stem cells isolated from the skin of pig fetuses can produce egg-like cells.
Embryologists have long sought to understand when and where germ cells -- which give rise to sperm and eggs -- are formed. The stem cells in the early embryo give rise to all the different lineages of the fetus, including the germ-cell lineage. In mammals, germ cells become segregated from non-germ cells (called somatic cells) during embryonic development and migrate to the gonads, where they form sperm or eggs.
But in the recent research, Julang Li and colleagues have shown even post-embryonic somatic stem cells can also give rise to egg-like cells in vitro.
Although it remains unclear whether such eggs can be fertilized to form viable embryos, Li said the ability to generate egg-like cells from cells derived from the skin provides new possibilities for tissue therapy and reproductive engineering.

That was according to Alex Bryan and Clark Foerster, who are involved with the Third Ear Project and were giving a class to educators from all over Yakima County as part of the Sunnyside Summer Institute held all this week at Sierra Vista Middle School.
Bryan told the educators that his goal was to make them aware of the models known as intentional communication, emotional intelligence and dynamic governance. These models, he said, can help educators deal with so-called bullies.
He said bullying is an attempt to restore or compensate for a perceived imbalance or lack of love or respect from others or one's self. Instead of these bullies just being bad students and troublemakers, they act out as a strategy to obtain justice in their eyes or they are just mirroring punishment.
"Bullying is a huge issue," Bryan said. "What we look for is what supports it."
These missing pieces include the need for mutual respect, a lack of social or emotional intelligence, and a strategy to create optimal learning environments.
The foundational concept, he said, is that human needs and values drive all behavior, feelings and words.
"These needs or values are something we all hold in common," he said. "They drive every single action we take."
Feelings, he said, are a result of a person's needs or wishes either being met or not being met. He encouraged educators who deal with bullies to listen first to themselves and then to what the need the bully is trying to express.
For instance, Bryan did a role playing exercise with Anne Stoothoff, a teacher at Riverside Christian Elementary School in Yakima. The scenario was of a student who kept snickering and making jokes about what the teacher was saying.
Stoothoff played the disruptive student and Bryan played the teacher. He tried to get the student to express what need of his was not being met. Because there was a need, or needs, not being met, Bryan also tried to get to the bottom of the feelings the student was experiencing.
It is a slow process. It takes time for the student to open up, but Bryan encouraged the educators to attempt it. The goal, he said, is to try to find out how to make it better for the student, "since we both have to be here."
To help students find their needs and help identify their feelings, Bryan uses a deck of cards with key words of needs and feelings. Some needs are trust, support, safety, fun, love and growth. Feelings can run a long gambit from grateful, happy, strong and sure, to angry, sad, frustrated or confused.
Too many times, he said, teachers confuse needs with feelings or strategies.
"Have you ever said, 'I need you to sit down and shut up?'," he asked. "Those aren't needs."
He used the example of food, which is a need.
"I don't need McDonalds french fries," he said. "McDonalds fries is the strategy to fulfilling a need for food."
Instead of telling students sit down and shut up, he encouraged using the words for universal human needs, such as quiet. Telling a student the teacher needs quiet so they can teach the class is more understandable.
He also spoke out against punishment. He didn't advocate doing nothing, but he did say a student shouldn't be punished. If they are being disruptive, they should be told so. A teacher has needs, as well. If the student can't respect that, he suggested removing them from the class, but making it clear they are not being punished. The student obviously has needs that aren't being met, but the teacher and other students have needs, as well.
So all parties' needs can be met, having the disruptive student removed without being punished, can help achieve that.
"There is a place for all of our languages, but we get confused and think there's one way for everything," Foerster added.
The three-hour presentation put out a lot of information and both Foerster and Bryan said they didn't expect the educators to take it all in. Instead, they said if they can just shift their conscious and maybe be more aware, or use a different approach when dealing with these types of students, it would be a good first.AIFR - Alverno Inferno Free Radio

An officer was traveling south on Lee at about 9:20 a.m. He was responding to a call for assistance and was using his lights and siren, police spokesman Officer Javier Sambrano said.
The officer stopped at a red light at Lee and Pebble Hills and began to cross using his lights, siren and horn.
A car traveling east on Pebble Hills didn't stop, the officer tried to use an evasive maneuver to avoid the crash and ended up losing control and hitting a wall, Sambrano said. The car that didn't stop at the intersection ended up clipping the police car.
The officer was taken to a local hospital and was treated for minor injuries.
No other injuries were reported. The investigation continues.
Jund midrange deck I've been working on, getting pretty solid, with some tweaks to figure out once the meta settles. Let's take a look at the list.
***Mainboard***
Deathrite Shaman added to mainboard because of my dislike of pillar of flame mainboard.
Farseek: mana fixing, finds shocklands, etc.
Mizzium Mortars: I think bonfire doesn't have as much of an applicable use in this meta, and mizzium mortar takes both the role of single target removal or if i get the mana mass removal. Also does just enough damage to angel tokens.
Dreadbore: destroys it all, especially planeswalkers
Abrupt Decay: answer to enchantments like Detention Sphere and Oblivion Ring can also act as creature removal if need be.
Liliana of the Veil: trying this in my 3 cmc slot as a one of, seems to work well with the deck.
Rakdos Keyrune: ramps and becomes an aggressive dude. a 3/1 first striker is very relevant with thragusk in just about every deck.
Vampire Nighthawk: 2/3 deathtouch lifelink seems to be really good and deals with some pesky problems.
Underworld Connections: card draw is just great. not a lot of removal that deals with it besides Ghost Quarter, which doesn't see enough play to discredit the use of this.
Olivia Voldaren: she is so amazing. She can simply win a game all by herself. Controls the board, get's bigger, win-win.
Huntmaster of the Fells Flip: very versatile card, puts threats on the board, pings creatures and players.
Sever the Bloodline: good against zombies and tokens. Deck is particularly weak to an untimely Entreat the Angels. i need to have options to deal with that, and this does a good job.
Garruk Relentless Flip: I personally love garruk and I'm glad to finally find a home where he functions really well. If he flips and gets time to work with, he can really put a game away for you.
Disciple of Bolas: trying him as that spicy 1 of . I like what he does with thragtusk. You get 5 more life 5 cards and a beast token with a 2/1 leftover, not bad at all.
Thragtusk: just amazing value, and impossible to 2 for 1, especially with a lack of good counterspells lurking about the standard meta.
Zealous Conscripts: I like having one in the main and one in the side, with the one mainboard copy around to spice things up, and because it works well in pretty much every matchup.
Rakdos's Return: the discard alone has proved amazing in just about any matchup, the damage is nice, and can help you with that last push.
***Sideboard***
Appetite for Brains: good against the miracle decks. Gets their biggest problems (Jace, Tamiyo). also good in mirror and against reanimator
Deathrite Shaman: hoses reanimate strategies and works well against Miracle decks.
Duress: it's a little better than apettite, in the control matchup
rolling tremblor: small scale wiping, good for humans, tokens kind of strategies.
Slaughter Games: good against problem cards, and also against 4 of's like Geralf's Messenger.
Underworld Connections: bring in the extra for control mainly
Zealous Conscripts: Good against walkers and fatties.
Garruk, Primal Hunter: control decks have a tough time dealing with planeswalkers, also good in planeswalker matchup.
Staff of Nin: pretty much 0 artifact hate in the meta, draws cards, puts your opponent on a clock.
Updates
Open was not bad went 4-5 could have done better with less misplays, had a lot of fun. some comments on things i liked in the deck and things i disliked:
dislikes
Pillar of Flame: I really disliked this card and found it useless in over half of my matches, going to try main boarding the Deathrite Shamans and siding 2 pillars just in case, but even that may be unnecessary.
Rakdos Keyrune: Before the tourniment i cut one of the keyrunes bringing tem down to 2, I liked this change as I did not get to make too much use of them in my games.
Zealous Conscripts: (sideboard) just never found a reason to side it in.
Likes
Rolling Temblor: found this card my all star sideboard card, sided it in a lot for G/W aggro and geist decks. literallly won me some games that i would have lost otherwise.
Zealous Conscripts: (mainboard) The mainboard conscripts did a lot of work by ending games that would have gone on forever, like stealing a thragtusk and swinging for the win or a Sublime Archangel.
Underworld Connections: brought me out of a mull to 5 with 1 land by finding me a 4th land quick enough that i could get ahead. the card draw otherwise was pretty useful.
I'm working on making some changes based on these observations to help improve the deck, but so far it seems that pillar of flame is the main thing that is being replaced. instant speed removal also seems like it would help the deck, if there were any good instant speed removal in the format. hopefully gatecrash brings some of that.
Currently testing Abrupt Decay and Borderland Ranger.
At this point I'm unsure of whether or not I will play any creatures at the 3 drop slot.
Now I noticed some use of abrupt decay in the recent scg open so I wanted to test it out. I can see it's uses as an answer to Detention Sphere that is more easily mainboard-able than the Golgari Charm, since it can hit other relevant 3 cmc permanents and not just artifacts and x/1's (or regenerate, but that's not going to be too relevant against terminus). We'll see if it's worth while to pick em up or just go with the cheap simple option..Eight.

xThe City of Los Angeles has selected Carmanah’s EverGEN 1710 solar powered lights in an order of 140 systems to illuminate a new pathway on a public road in the San Fernando Valley. Improving safety and furthering the City’s commitment to sustainability and energy savings, the Carmanah EverGEN 1710 was down-selected for the project to light over 1km of new path along San Fernando Road in Los Angeles. Chosen by the City on the basis of form, function and a GPS and radio-enabled networking capability that can allow for remote system monitoring, activation and control, the EverGEN 1710 is an advanced outdoor lighting system for municipalities and organizations seeking sustainable lighting as well as installation cost savings. Once fully installed in early 2013, the City of LA will have employed almost 300 of Carmanah’s solar-powered 1710 lights which will illuminate 6km (4m) of commuting pathways.
In 2009, the City began employing Carmanah EverGEN systems for pathway applications following an experience with reoccurring copper theft along the LA City River from grid-powered wired lighting fixtures. The copper theft eventually left portions of the path dark and incurred costs to replace wiring as a result. In the move from grid-powered AC HID (high intensity discharge) fixtures, Officials at the City of Los Angeles have been working with Los Angeles lighting agents, David Silverman & Associates and their solar lighting manufacturing provider, Carmanah Technologies, to source a reliable and certified solution. The City selected a solution in the EverGEN 1710, which would allow the City to avoid high installation costs while eliminating the possibility of future copper theft as a result of zero wiring. Since 2009, the City has continued to invest in sustainable lighting solutions with this most recent project.

Platinum Investing
Pinnacle Digest writes: Platinum is expected to rise in value over the next year. Paul Ebeling expects it to rise significantly and to strongly outperform gold and silver in the next 12 months. Investing in platinum is not as easy as investing in gold as many of the same products do not exist.
What many people fail to realize is that platinum is extremely rare in the precious metal world. It is truly a rare precious metal. Global platinum production will total 6.1 million ounces this year. Not even 8% of what total gold production will equal this year.
Aside from its precious metal status in jewellery, platinum has robust and growing industrial demands. Platinum based catalytic converters are used in vehicles and in emerging countries such as China and India. Auto markets in these countries are continuing to expand rapidly which will put further pressure and demand on platinum.
Platinum has sold off in recent months and is now trading well below gold. Although Paul has not confirmed that the key reversal is in, he continues to be patient, knowing that an uptrend for platinum is around the corner.

How do you feel about platinum with Europe, being a huge buyer of platinum, but now is facing economic problems with the Greek debts and possibly other Eurozone countries to follow?18 September 1953, Louisville, Mississippi, USA. Jackson started at the age of 13 by accompanying his father and his uncle on the banjo in a bluegrass band. One of his compositions, Banjo Man, describes how he learnt Earl Scruggs licks by listening to his records. Jackson toured with Jim And Jesse and during that time made his first solo album, Bluegrass Festival. In 1972, he joined Glen Campbells band, and Campbell produced his Capitol Records album, Banjo Player. The interplay between Campbell and Jackson, particularly on Duelin Banjos, has been much admired, but staying with Campbell prevented him from developing his own musical personality. He has now branched out on his own and his fine musicianship can be heard on his album with John Starling, Spring Training, which won a Grammy award for Best Bluegrass Album.

- Pop acts come and pop acts go in town all the time, but what makes this visit by British super boy band One Direction different is that band member Niall Horan got the phone number of The Bert Show's Kristin Klingshirn ... and proceeded to text her later! Directioners everywhere explode with jealous rage and animated gifs.
- English tabloid press The Daily Mail also found the boys' trip to ATL to be worth documenting, particularly how "American" they look (except ... )
- Friend Cassie Young, who also works at The Bert Show, got a hug from Niall and a kiss on the cheek from Harry. When asked what that was like, she replied, "His lips were like angels singing soft lullabies right before midnight on Christmas." You heard it here first!

In Morristown, Moghul is a really fancy place -- I strongly recommend going there for lunch buffet, you really get your money's worth. Nice too for an elegant dinner but pricey.
Theres another one that we go to for dinner during the week, I think in Madison, but the name escapes me. Rachel?

Jason is referring to Begum Palace, in the Staples strip mall off Main Street, Madison, 973-660-9100. This place is family run, casual, friendly, and more reasonably priced than Moghul. They have a dinner buffet on Sunday and Wednesday nights, I think, which is usually excellent. But even if we're not in the mood for a buffet, I like to go there for dinner as the a la carte menu is great.
As Jason said, Moghul is a much fancier place. Perfect for a business dinner (or lunch if you don't mind buffet). Just like at a good chinese place (where it is good to see lots of Asians), it is nice to see the many Indians who frequent this restaurant.
Moghul tends to have one or two semi-chinese dishes on their lunch buffet (like lo mein and/or chinese soup), "to please children". If we ever do go there for dinner again, I'd like to try the tandori lobster. We ordered traditional dishes the one time we went for dinner, and I felt they were overpriced. As long as that is the case, I may as well try some of their innovations.
Moghul has a banquet room in the back (not just a private room - a party hall with all the trimmings) and caters lots of weddings in the area, including the Indian weddings at my parent's country club (Brooklake in Florham Park), which usually doesn't allow outside catering.
I'd also recommend Maharani in Parsippany on Route 46 West. This is a branch of the Maharani in Fort Lee, I prefer the Fort Lee restaurant, which has a much nicer atmosphere, but the food at the one is Parsippany is just as good.

It's funny that you ask about Indian (India) Food.
We often eat at the Thai restaurant on Rt. 10 in Randolph. Indian folks often out number occidentals like ourselves 3-1.
Perhaps the Thai curries appeal to their palate, or maybe it's the curry puffs?
Whatever the case may be, if you like curry, then thai curries are the way to go. I am only disapointed with the "India" foods at restaurants locally, too "americanized".
- re: Mr. W.

Yes, I agree about the rice, but all that aside, have you noticed on a weekend, or any night for that matter, the large groups of people with eastern appearances? They must eat here because they like it.
I have spoken to friends of mine from Sri Lanka, and they love the red curry. Thai spiced of course!
Others have mentioned Chand Palace in Parsippany and Moghul in Morristown. Both are quite good, but Moghul is held in higher esteem by my Indian friends. (It's where people go to celebrate.) Chand Palace has great dosas, among other things. I've heard that the owners of Moghul are planning to open a Moghul Express in Parsippany, which is very good news. The original, in Edison, is quite good and very popular; it's basically Indian and Indo-Chinese fast food.
There's another place in the area you visit -- the Clay Oven, on Route 46 East, at the intersection with Route 10 (was the Ledgewood Circle before they removed the circle). They were wonderful the first several times I went there -- I remember being knocked out by the gulab jamun on my first visit -- and they were very reasonable for lunch. They weren't so great the last time I was there a few months ago, but they might be worth a stop. Caveat: They've had fewer Indian diners than the others, but I think Morris County's Indian community is more focused on Parsippany than the west end of the county.“Details” – A Gallery of Images by Senka Music1 Share Tweet
Here is a gallery of film photographs taken by Senka Music, a Bosnia and Herzegovina based graphic design and photography student and Best Photo of Sarajevo awardee.
If you read our interview with Senka Music, you might be interested to see more of the photos from “Details,” one of her photographic projects.
Don’t expect to see scenic views or emotive portraits in this selection. Senka can definitely capture scenery and whip up emotions through her work, but “Details” covers a different subject: artistic chaos. Looking at the photos, you’ll feel as if the artists who used the materials hurriedly left the scene just seconds before you saw the photos. See for yourself.
“One project that I am very fond of is an excerpt from a student project ‘Life and Work at The Academy of Fine Arts in Sarajevo’. I finished the project, but the details I captured throughout the building itself attracted my attention later. After all the detail photos were collected, I had a new project simply titled ‘Details’ – something that shows the beauty of artistic chaos, in form of leftovers of other students work.”

The Java Verified Process was spearheaded by Sun Microsystems, Motorola, Nokia, Siemens and Sony Ericsson in an effort to facilitate creation and dissemination of J2ME applications and to spur the adoption of standards for J2ME development.
"This programme was set up to help developers have a single means of testing their Java content and ensuring compatibility across devices from Motorola, Nokia, Siemens and Sony Ericsson," said Craig Miller, group marketing manager, consumer and mobile solutions group at Sun.
There are about 250 million Java technology-enabled wireless devices from 31 manufacturers deployed in more than 75 carrier networks around the world, so this market presents a tremendous opportunity for J2ME developers, Miller said.
There are also about 10,000 J2ME applications worldwide, he added.
Once an application has been certified by the Java Verified Process it will receive the Java Powered Logo and each version of the application shipped will be signed digitally to guarantee the user it has not been tampered with.
Adam Zawel, an analyst at the Yankee Group, said there now can be numerous versions of the same J2ME application to accommodate the different ways suppliers have implemented Java.
"There needs to be a standard process though which application developers can certify their products and have the ability to write it once and publish it anywhere," he said, adding that this sort of simplification is necessary to get more developers writing, distributing and profiting from J2ME applications.
Zawel said the Java community could look to Qualcomm and what it has done with its Brew platform as a guide.
Brew is a development platform for mobile devices for Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) phones. Qualcomm has used its website to create a one-stop shop for Brew developers to get their applications tested, certified and distributed to any Brew carriers.
While the Java Verified Process provides a means for developers to get their applications tested, it does not provide a standard means for distribution.
However, Sun has announced it will aggregate a list of J2ME content from developers on its Java.com website and provide this list to operators.
This way they can, potentially, deliver these applications over their own networks, which will benefit the end user, because their operators will be able to offer them more products.
Testing for the Java Verified process has been outsourced to four different companies that each have offices around the world.
These include Babel Media, Cap Gemini Ernst & Young, the National Software Testing Labs and RELQ Software.
The cost to have an application verified will range between $200 and $400 depending on location.

GUYS FROM FORD SUMMER 2012 from 4×5 on Vimeo.Katrina WATTS, Plaintiff-Appellant, v. Raymond SECHLER, Defendant-Respondent.
Katrina Watts (“Plaintiff”) sued Raymond Sechler (“Defendant”) for damages, alleging that alfalfa hay she bought from Defendant poisoned her dairy cattle. Before trial, the court sustained Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's res ipsa loquitur count. The case went to trial on three other counts. At the close of Plaintiff's evidence, she opted to proceed on her “implied warranty of fitness for consumption” theory of recovery. Thereon, the trial court sustained Defendant's motion for directed verdict. This appeal followed.1
We affirm in part; we reverse and remand in part.
FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
In 1994, Plaintiff owned a dairy herd and decided to use alfalfa hay as part of her feeding program. To implement her decision, Plaintiff began buying “second cutting” alfalfa from Defendant.
During the 1996 hay season, Plaintiff bought both first and second cutting alfalfa from Defendant. As before, this hay was in “large round bale” form and all bales were “net wrapped.” Initially, Plaintiff fed the 1996 “first cutting” alfalfa to her cows without adverse effects. Once Plaintiff started feeding the “second cutting” of the 1996 hay crop, however, her cattle became very sick. Many animals died, milk production dropped, cows began to miscarry, and many would not breed back in the normal sequence of events.
Ultimately, Plaintiff came to believe that the hay purchased from Defendant caused the illness in her livestock. Dr. Gardner, a veterinarian hired by Plaintiff, tested the subject hay. The tests revealed the “second cut” hay contained aflatoxin. From this and other investigation, Dr. Gardner concluded that Plaintiff's dairy herd was poisoned by the hay Defendant sold to Plaintiff.
The third count of Plaintiff's petition was entitled “Breach of Implied Warranty.” In it, Plaintiff alleged that Defendant was a merchant engaged in the business of selling hay, he produced hay and sold it to Plaintiff knowing she would use it as feed for her dairy cattle, and she bought the hay in reliance upon Defendant's superior skill and judgment as a producer of hay.
In another count, Plaintiff sought recovery from Defendant on a res ipsa loquitur theory, i.e., that Defendant had managed and controlled the hay prior to its sale to Plaintiff, Defendant had superior knowledge about why the hay was toxic, and the herd illness would not ordinarily have occurred if Defendant had used ordinary care. As stated above, the court dismissed the res ipsa count at the request of Defendant before trial.
At the close of Plaintiff's case, Defendant moved for a directed verdict.2 In urging dismissal, Defendant suggested the Plaintiff's implied warranty count was a “common law” claim, specifically a claim for breach of an implied warranty of fitness for consumption by animals. Plaintiff's lawyer agreed with Defendant's characterization as he told the court that Plaintiff was primarily relying upon the common law as illustrated by Borman v. O'Donley, 364 S.W.2d 31 (Mo.App.1962). After reading the Borman case, the trial judge responded as follows:
“”
The judge's assertion about what Plaintiff had elected as her remedy was not challenged or questioned by Plaintiff. With the case in that posture, the trial judge found that “hay is a raw material ․ and no cause of action exists in ․ Missouri for a raw material.” He then directed a verdict against Plaintiff.
DISCUSSION AND DECISION
Point I: Directed Verdict On Implied Warranty Claim
Plaintiff's first point charges the trial judge erred by directing a verdict for Defendant on Plaintiff's “breach of implied warranty” count because her “at-trial” evidence “established a prima facie case for breach of implied warranty of merchantability” for the subject hay in that “Defendant ․ was a merchant and the hay that he sold to [Plaintiff] was not fit for ordinary purposes for which the hay would be used.”
Although Plaintiff's point relied on never mentions section 400.2-314, RSMo (2000), a Uniform Commercial Code (“U.C.C.”) provision, the first part of her argument beneath the point advances the notion that her “implied warranty” count was based on this U.C.C. provision.3 Still later in her briefing of Point I, Plaintiff broadens her claim of trial court error by contending she also made a submissible case for breach of an “implied warranty of fitness for consumption by animals,” a warranty derived from common law. See Midwest Game Co. v. M.F.A. Milling Co., 320 S.W.2d 547 (Mo.1959).
Defendant's initial response urges affirmance by pointing out that, until this appeal, Plaintiff never asserted a claim for breach of a U.C.C. implied warranty of merchantability, either by pleading, or during trial, or in post-trial motions. With that as his premise, Defendant insists that we cannot convict the trial court of error on an issue never put before it to decide, Barner v. The Mo. Gaming Co., 48 S.W.3d 46-50[15] (Mo.App.2001); that Plaintiff is bound by the position she took in the trial court, namely, she was proceeding on the common law claim, and we can only review the case upon that theory. See Reese v. Ryan's Family Steakhouses, Inc., 19 S.W.3d 749, 752 [9] (Mo.App.2000).
Arguably, Plaintiff's petition pleaded the elements of a U.C.C. implied warranty of merchantability claim, albeit, without citing the applicable statute or pleading notice. However, that is not the theory Plaintiff told the trial judge and defense counsel she was pursuing. In answer to Defendant's motion for directed verdict at the close of Plaintiff's case, Plaintiff argued she had made a case of “implied warranty of fitness for consumption by animals.” The judge then reviewed the case cited by Plaintiff and, having done so, declared what he understood to be Plaintiff's position, namely, that she was submitting her case on the common law theory of recovery and not on U.C.C. principles of implied warranty of merchantability. Thereon, Plaintiff stood silent and thus confirmed what she had said earlier; she opted to submit her case on the common law theory. Plaintiff's position on this remained unchanged during post-trial filings and arguments to the trial judge.
In sum, Defendant's complaint is valid. Plaintiff is asking this court to reverse on a theory never presented to the trial court. This we will not do. Appellate courts have repeatedly held that a party cannot present his or her cause of action on one theory in the trial court and, if unsuccessful there, argue a different theory in an appellate court. Sinclair Refining Co. v. Wyatt, 149 S.W.2d 353, 354[1] (Mo.1941); Vintila v. Drassen, 52 S.W.3d 28, 38[11] (Mo.App.2001). Review on appeal is limited to issues and theories heard by the trial judge. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Esswein, 43 S.W.3d 833, 839[7] (Mo.App.2000). Having taken the position at trial that her cause of action was grounded on common law principles, Plaintiff is barred from arguing a different theory on appeal to convict the trial court of error. Barner, S.W.3d at 50 [14,15].
Plaintiff's second claim under Point I is that reversal is mandated because Plaintiff made a submissible case on her common law implied warranty claim of fitness for consumption. In response, Defendant correctly points out that this argument is not properly briefed. This is so because it is an argument that does not follow the order of “Points Relied On” and is one not included in the “Points Relied On.” This is a violation of Rule 84.04(e)and would justify this court's refusal to review such argument.4 See Rule 84.13.
Even so, we exercise our discretion to proceed with the appeal on its merits. We do so because we have been able to determine the facts of the case and the issues to be decided from the briefs and transcript. Norman v. Ballentine, 627 S.W.2d 83, 85 (Mo.App.1981). Moreover, Defendant's lawyers have been able to perform their briefing obligations and have responded to Plaintiff's argument that she made a submissible case on her common law implied warranty claim. See Twelve Oaks Motor Inn, Inc. v. Strahan, 110 S.W.3d 404, 407 n. 3 (Mo.App.2003); Daniel v. Indiana Mills & Mfg., Inc., 103 S.W.3d 302, 312 (Mo.App.2003); Keeney v. Mo. Highway and Transp. Comm'n, 70 S.W.3d 597, 598 n. 1 (Mo.App.2002).
The dispute in this prong of Point I centers on two phrases, namely “raw state” food and “processed and packaged” food. These phrases appeared in cases that found an implied warranty of fitness for consumption accompanied the sale of animal feed. See Midwest, 320 S.W.2d 547; Albers Milling Co. v. Carney, 341 S.W.2d 117 (Mo.1960); Borman, 364 S.W.2d 31. Midwest was the first case to extend the implied warranty of fitness for consumption to animal feed when there was no privity between the damaged consumer and the feed manufacturer. The Midwest plaintiff sought damages from a manufacturer of fish food after the manufacturer's pre-packaged and processed fish food killed some of plaintiff's fish. In part, the plaintiff alleged that a common law implied warranty of fitness entitled it to recover. It did so without alleging privity of contract between the defendant manufacturer and the plaintiff. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Missouri first recounted that when food is sold for immediate human consumption, there is an implied warranty that the food is fit for human consumption; that “a buyer of packaged food products may recover from the manufacturer upon an implied warranty of fitness even though there is no express privity of contract between the manufacturer and buyer.” Id. at 550[4]. The Midwest court noted that some states had refused to extend the implied warranty of fitness to the sale of food for animals, but held the better view was that the same warranty of fitness for consumption attaches “in cases like the instant one where the [animal] food is not in its raw state but has been processed and packaged by the manufacturer.” Id. at 550[6] (emphasis supplied).
Although the trial judge here did not specifically mention Midwest when he directed a verdict against Plaintiff, it is clear that the italicized language from Midwest formed the basis for his ruling. Consequently, the dispositive issue on appeal is the relevance and applicability of those phrases to this case, if any. This follows because Defendant argues the trial court correctly ruled there can be no implied warranty here because, as a matter of law, baled alfalfa hay is “raw” food for animals. Contrarily, Plaintiff argues “that the trial court erred ․ because granting the motion was contrary to the evidence of the case as well as the applicable law.”
To understand Midwest and its progeny, we look first at common law implied warranties generally and how they unfolded in Missouri. Historically, implied warranties were said to arise by operation of law under the facts and circumstances of a particular case in accordance with the presumed intention of the parties. See Worley v. Procter & Gamble Mfg. Co., 241 Mo.App. 1114, 253 S.W.2d 532, 536-37 (1952); Belt Seed Co. v. Mitchelhill Seed Co., 236 Mo.App. 142, 153 S.W.2d 106, 112-13 (1941); 77 C.J.S. Sales, § 314 at 1155-56 (1952).
When implied warranty theory was first advanced as a remedy, the courts approved its use only when there was a sale or other contractual relationship between the two parties to the dispute. Kellogg Bridge Co. v. Hamilton, 110 U.S. 108, 112-16, 3 S.Ct. 537, 540-43, 28 L.Ed. 86 (1884); Worley, 253 S.W.2d at 536-37; Madouros v. Kansas City Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 230 Mo.App. 275, 90 S.W.2d 445, 448-50 (1936). Thus, a person not a party to the contract could not sue on an implied warranty theory; privity of contract was a prerequisite to implying a warranty of fitness. Degouveia v. H.D. Lee Mercantile Co., 231 Mo.App. 447, 100 S.W.2d 336, 337[2] (1936); Madouros, 90 S.W.2d at 448. Stated otherwise, implied warranties were only recognized in cases involving direct sales, i.e., sales between two consumers, or between consumers and retailers, or between retailers and retailers, or between retailers and manufacturers. See, e.g., Barton v. Dowis, 315 Mo. 226, 285 S.W. 988 (1926) (hogs); Ashford v. Schoop, 81 Mo.App. 539 (1899) (apples); Lee v. J.B. Sickles Saddlery Co., 38 Mo.App. 201 (1889) (straw); Whitaker v. McCormick, 6 Mo.App. 114 (1878) (corn).
Significantly, where privity existed, early cases found implied warranties accompanied direct sales of products without regard to whether the commodity or article sold was “raw” or “processed.” See, e.g., Fantroy v. Schirmer, 296 S.W. 235 (Mo.App.1927) (product sold as buttermilk was simply a mixture of skim milk and whole milk); Texas Fruit Co. v. Lane, 101 Mo.App. 712, 74 S.W. 400 (1903) (apples). In such cases, the courts focused upon the nature of the implied warranty. Illustrative of this is Sickles, 38 Mo.App. 201.
In Sickles, a farmer sold straw to a manufacturer for use in making horse collars. A dispute arose over payment, with the manufacturer claiming the straw had excessive weed content and did not comport with the implied warranty of fitness that accompanied the sale thereof. On appeal, the common law implied warranty rule was stated generally as follows:
“In all executory contracts for the sale of any commodity, when no opportunity for inspection is offered, there is always an implied warranty that the article sold will be of merchantable quality and condition; and if the article is purchased for a particular purpose, and this was known to the vendor, at the time of making the contract, then the law will annex to every such contract of sale, the implied condition that the article shall be reasonably fit for the purpose for which it was bought․”
Id. at 205. Nothing in this general statement of the law excluded the possibility of an implied warranty attaching to the sale of “non-processed” or “raw” agricultural products.
By 1927, there was a “well-established” rule “that accompanying all sales by a retail dealer of articles of food for immediate use there is an implied warranty that the same is fit for human consumption.” Fantroy, 296 S.W. at 237. The stated reasons for the rule were numerous, but foremost among them was the promotion of protecting human life. See Fantroy, 296 S.W. at 237-38 and cases therein cited. See also Degouveia, 100 S.W.2d at 338-39; Klein v. Duchess Sandwich Co., 14 Cal.2d 272, 93 P.2d 799, 801-05 (1939). However, neither these cases, nor any other Missouri case found by this court, have restricted the breadth of the common law implied warranty of fitness for human consumption to “processed” foods, or excluded foods in their “raw” state from such warranty, when there was a direct sale of the food item, i.e., when privity existed.
As the common law of implied warranty of fitness for consumption evolved, the privity rule was not followed blindly and without exception. Westerhold v. Carroll, 419 S.W.2d 73, 77 (Mo.1967). To the contrary, “when the application of the rule would produce a result contrary to the requirements of essential justice and sound public policy, it [was] whittled away by exceptions.” Id. It was an exception to the privity rule that gave rise to the distinction (alluded to in Midwest, 320 S.W.2d at 550) between “processed and packaged food” and food in its “raw” state. See Madouros, 230 Mo.App. 275, 90 S.W.2d 445.
In Madouros, the plaintiff bought a bottle of Coca-Cola from a retail dealer. The retailer had bought the subject product from the manufacturer. The bottle contained a dead mouse, and the plaintiff became violently ill upon drinking from the bottle. He sued the manufacturer directly, prevailed, and was awarded damages. On appeal it was held that the manufacturer could be liable to the plaintiff under an implied warranty theory despite the lack of privity. Id. at 448-50. The court reasoned that society was changing, including the way food was prepared, bought and sold; that the manufacturer was now preparing food, packaging it, and marketing the product to the ultimate consumer; that in such situations, retail dealers were merely intermediaries handling the articles to be sold to the consumer and had no opportunity to inspect the food or drink as it was typically sealed or packaged; and the manufacturer was the party who should bear the burden when processed and packaged foods were not wholesome and caused injury and damage to a consumer. Id. The Madouros court concluded that:
“Under modern conditions, when products of food or drink have been prepared under the exclusive supervision of the manufacturer and the consumer must take them as they are supplied, the representations constitute an implied contract, or implied warranty, to the unknown and helpless consumer that the article is good and wholesome and fit for use. If privity of contract is required, then under the situation and circumstances of modern merchandise in such matters, privity of contract exists in the consciousness and understanding of all right-thinking persons.”
Id. at 450.
From the foregoing we discern that the common law implied warranty of fitness of food for consumption in Missouri includes these principles: First, a party damaged because processed and packaged food was unwholesome can recover damages from the manufacturer without showing privity; a direct sale is not a prerequisite to the existence of a common law implied warranty of fitness for consumption of processed and packaged food. Second, if privity exists, the common law implied warranty of fitness for consumption accompanies the sale of food, even food in its “raw state.”
With these principles in mind and considering the fact that the Midwest court used the “processed and packaged” versus “raw state” language when it extended the common law implied warranty of fitness for consumption to animal feed, we conclude that Midwest stands for two propositions: First, a common law implied warranty of fitness for consumption extends to animal food, whether raw or processed and packaged, when, as here, there is a direct sale of the food product, i.e., where privity exists.5 Second, a manufacturer of animal feed may only be liable to a party not in privity with the manufacturer based on common law implied warranty of fitness for consumption theory when the feed is processed and packaged, and the buyer purchases it in the original package.6
If any confirmation is needed for the first of these proportions (which is dispositive of this case), we find it in case law used by the Midwest court to extend the common law implied warranty to sales of animal feed. 320 S.W.2d at 550. Both cases that Midwest found controlling, Larson v. Farmers' Warehouse Co., 161 Wash. 640, 297 P. 753 (1931), and Judd v. H.S. Coe & Co., 117 Conn. 510, 169 A. 270 (1933), involved direct sales, that is, privity existed. More than that, the Larson case dealt with a direct sale of baled alfalfa hay from a vendor to a vendee, exactly the facts of this case. The Larson court found the vendor liable for damages to vendee's cattle on the basis that vendor had impliedly warranted that the baled hay “was not only of the kind and quality ordered, but was, as a lot, generally free from deleterious substances, poisonous to stock.” Id. at 756. In turn, the Larson court relied on Gussner v. Miller, 44 N.D. 587, 176 N.W. 359, 362 (1920), another case that found an implied warranty of fitness arose from the direct sale of alfalfa hay.7
In sum, we hold that Plaintiff presented evidence from which a jury could find that a common law implied warranty of fitness for consumption accompanied the sale of this alfalfa hay by Defendant to Plaintiff. This follows because this was a direct sale by the producer to the consumer; privity existed. Consequently, whether the alfalfa hay sold here should have been classified as an agricultural product in its “raw state” or “processed and packaged” was irrelevant. The raw/processed distinction (if still viable) only attends when privity does not exist between the damaged consumer and the manufacturer. Because privity existed here, the trial court erred in directing a verdict for Defendant at the close of Plaintiff's case by concluding that alfalfa hay was an agricultural product in its “raw state,” and as a consequence, the common law implied warranty was not available as a remedy.8 Point I is granted.
Point II: Dismissal Of Plaintiff's Res Ipsa Loquitur Count
In her second point relied on, Plaintiff asserts that if this court treats all alleged facts in the res ipsa loquitur count as true and construes all allegations favorable to Plaintiff as required under our standard of review, then it becomes clear that the pleadings invoke principles of substantive res ipsa loquitur law upon which relief can be granted; accordingly, she insists that reversal is mandated. See generally, Pavia v. Childs, 951 S.W.2d 700, 701 (Mo.App.1997); Workman v. Vader, 854 S.W.2d 560, 562 (Mo.App.1993).
Plaintiff's res ipsa loquitur pleading alleges, inter alia, that certain hay Plaintiff bought from Defendant “contained aflatoxin or other materials which are substances toxic to dairy animals[;]” that “as a direct result of the dairy herd eating the [D]efendant's hay, the cattle became sick, aborted calves, failed to rebreed, decreased milk production, and in some instances died [;]” and the “herd-wide illness” thus described “would not ordinarily happen if [D]efendant had used due care.” Plaintiff insists that this, together with other allegations, was a sufficient fact pleading to invoke the res ipsa doctrine; consequently, she urges reversal.
We start by noting:
“[R]es.”
Hasemeier v. Smith, 361 S.W.2d 697, 700[4] (Mo.banc 1962).
Because Plaintiff's Count IV was dismissed before trial, we do not concern ourselves with what the evidence might show. The only issue is the sufficiency of Plaintiff's petition. Ordinarily, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur has no application to the pleadings. Carter v. Skelly Oil Co., 363 Mo. 570, 252 S.W.2d 306, 309[4] (1952). This follows because it is an inference aiding in the proof. Id.
On the other hand, attempted invocation of the res ipsa loquitur doctrine does not relieve a party of pleading general negligence, that is, pleading “the injury and such attendant circumstances as will support an inference of negligence which the jury must find.” Glossip v. Kelly, 228 Mo.App. 392, 67 S.W.2d 513, 514[2] (1934). The question of whether the facts alleged in a petition are sufficient to invoke the res ipsa doctrine is a question of law. Gateway Chemical Co. v. Groves, 338 S.W.2d 83, 87[5] (Mo.1960). This is explained more fully in Epps v. Ragsdale, 429 S.W.2d 798 (Mo.App.1968), as follows:
“[W]hether injuries like plaintiff's ordinarily happen when due care is used ․ is a question of law since it is a judicial function to determine whether a set of circumstances does, as a matter of law, permit a certain inference. The question is answered when the court can take judicial notice, based on common knowledge and experience, that such an injury probably would not have occurred but for negligence in some form.”
Id. at 800[3,4] (citations omitted) (emphasis supplied).
This court is not persuaded that it is a matter of common knowledge or experience that the development of aflatoxin in alfalfa hay probably bespeaks negligence in some form. Stated otherwise, Plaintiff's allegations do not supply the absent but essential prerequisite to the application of the res ipsa doctrine, namely that laymen would know, based on their common knowledge or experience, that alfalfa hay will not contain aflatoxin or other toxic substances, unless the person producing and selling the hay was negligent in some way. See Hasemeier, 361 S.W.2d at 701.
The trial court was entitled to look at the wisdom it had gained from common experience in deciding, whether as a matter of law, it should allow Plaintiff to submit her case on a theory of res ipsa loquitur. Redfield v. Beverly Health and Rehab. Inc., 42 S.W.3d 703, 715[37] (Mo.App.2001). No error was committed when the court found that Plaintiff's petition, as structured, did not invoke the application of the res ipsa loquitur doctrine to the stated occurrence. See Hasemeier, 361 S.W.2d at 701. Sustension of the Defendant' motion to dismiss was proper.9 Point II is denied.
The judgment of the trial court is reversed to the extent that it directed a verdict against Plaintiff on her claim of breach of a common law implied warranty of fitness of food for consumption by animals and the case is remanded. In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed.
FOOTNOTES
1. An earlier appeal was dismissed. Watts v. Sechler, 114 S.W.3d 425 (Mo.App.2003). Dismissal was mandated because “a final appealable judgment [did] not exist.” Id. at 427. The deficiency in the judgment no longer attends.
2. As arguments were made on Defendant's motion to dismiss at the close of Plaintiff's evidence, Plaintiff told the court she was abandoning her breach of express warranty count and negligence count.
3. As provided in section 400.2-314(1), “a warranty that the goods shall be merchantable is implied in a contract for their sale if the seller is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind.”
4. In part, Rule 84.04(e) requires the argument section of a brief to “substantially follow the order of the ‘Points Relied On’ ” and “be limited to those errors included in the ‘Points Relied On.’ ”
5. In so stating, we acknowledge that privity existed in Borman, yet the Borman court made an extended analysis of whether corn silage was “raw state” feed, or “processed” feed, and the case turned on the court's conclusion that the corn silage qualified as a “processed” product. 364 S.W.2d at 36. This court believes, however, that the “raw state” versus “processed” analysis in Borman was unnecessary.
6. We do not ignore Albers, 341 S.W.2d 117. There, privity of contract existed, yet that court used the “processed and packaged” language in the opinion. Arguably, that could be read as some indication that the “processed and packaging” requirement must be met even if there was privity. Such argument is answered, however, by the following in Albers: “In some respects the instant case is more favorable to a holding of implied warranty than [was] Midwest because here (although the feed was actually sold by Moreland) there was privity of contract between plaintiff and defendants.” 341 S.W.2d at 120. We believe this sentence supports our interpretation of Midwest.
7. Any doubt about the continued existence of a cause of action based on the common law implied warranty of fitness for consumption in an animal food case is removed by reading MAI 25.02 (2002), and the Committee Comment (1996 Revision) thereto. Significantly, this instruction does not require a jury to find that the feed was “processed and packaged.” In our view, that would be required (if at all) when the evidence showed an absence of privity. See also Sanders v. Hartville Milling Co., 14 S.W.3d 188, 214 (Mo.App.2000) (case approving MAI 25.02 against claim that it gave jury roving commission because it did not specifically refer to aflatoxin, which had allegedly caused the damage to a farmer's dairy herd).
8. Even if a common law warranty of fitness for consumption accompanies a sale of animal feed (including a direct sale) only if the feed is packaged and processed (as the trial court found), the fact that the Midwest court relied on Larson (which involved the sale of baled alfalfa hay) strongly suggests that baled alfalfa hay should be viewed as “processed and packaged” as contemplated by the Midwest court.
9. The record shows Plaintiff could not have submitted on a res ipsa loquitur theory even if the trial judge had not dismissed that count before trial. This is true because Plaintiff's expert testified unequivocally that aflatoxin can ordinarily occur in hay without regard to any person's negligence. Such testimony confirmed this was not a res ipsa loquitur case. See Spears v. Capital Region Med. Ctr., 86 S.W.3d 58, 61 [7] (Mo.App.2002).

sort yourself out, before i do it for you.
Well sixth form just says you got 5 c's at GCSE (which are piss easy) so that doesn't say your going anywhere and as for a teacher, youd be out of the job within the week due to threatening behaviour
Beautiful? No. Clever? Possibly, you seem to be able to argue at a year 10 level. Very talented? You look like you cant even walk straight, how can you be talented... Yeah im boring, oddly enough my hair is meant to look how it is, its my personal preference, and as for getting laid, i only fuck people when im in a relationship with them, and as you can see im single, see, im the kinda guy you obviously havent ever met, one that has respect for girls and doesnt want to bend them over the nearest table then ditch them as im sure has happened to you many times... although they always remember to leave the money right? Those "little" girls are my mates, im bound to defend them against some skett that thinks shes gods gift, i would do it in person but i aint there. UGLY MUFF DIVING RAT
Who have i said was ugly? i know im not the best looking of blokes but i can admit to not being attractive
Well in the video you're wearing your own clothes in school premices... With what Amithy has told me that means your either sixth form or a teacher, either way you're above sixteen thus leaving you as a young adult not a minor. Dick. Trashy? Sorry who acted trashy as you so politely put it? Cause to be honest i think you might just be extreamly insecure about yourself which is why you reacted so badly to their joke, i think maybe it made you paranoid that you aren't all that, or maybe it was a confidence boost? Or it might just have made you realise that you are not the queen bee at your school, you are just a normal girl, you're probably not going anywhere in life and that nobody (even people younger than you that should respect you) actually gives a fuck who you think you are, to them you're just a joke. By continuing to argue over Bebo you're proving them right by the way
She was having a laugh!!! would you turn around and have a go at a toddler if they did the same? Didn't think so, so what makes it ok to have a go at a 14 year old? I'm not a prick... I'm a cunt
If you were a major... you fucking dick, i meant shes under age thus making her a minor.... knob
'Lil Fish' isn't trying to be a hardcore gangsta from the bronx when shes blatently a white scene kid that wouldn't want to "pop a cap" in someones ass. I'll let her do what she wants to be honest, she's old enough to handle herself. And yeah i'm 18, well done you can perform grade 1 maths, im getting involved cause i heard you got in a 14 year olds face aswell, what the fuck were you trying to do? SHES A FUCKING KID!!!!!!!!! you know that could be counted as threatening behaviour on a minor right?
Do us a favour sweetcheeks, tell your mate Harrold (mmm real gangsta name "bludd"
that he needs to get a life.... seriously............ someone tell that wigga hes white?!
No fucking shit you do, you deng ass bitch. Leave off of Amithy and her mates or you'll be getting some London sluts coming to shank you, you get where I'm going with this?No eBook available

Women make up a majority of college students, but at the top of the academic ladder, the percentage of women wanes: only 26 percent of college presidents are female. Why is this?.
Today, them result in major change. Harvard University is sponsoring.
When do you know that you have arrived, as an academic field of study? Has queer studies arrived?
Women." my last post, I explained my love for the new anthology Presumed Incompetent: The Intersections of Race and Class for Women in Academia. Using personal narratives, empirical studies, and scholarly essays, over 40 different authors discuss the challenges faced by academic women of color in higher education. I emailed with Seattle University School of Law Professor Carmen G. Gonzalez about what it's like to put together such a meaty and long-overdue book.
How did the idea for this book come about?
CARMEN G. GONZALEZ: As women of color who have managed to survive and thrive in academia despite formidable obstacles, we (the co-editors of Presumed Incompetent) felt a need and a responsibility to create a public dialogue about the subtle and not-so-subtle forms of workplace bias women of color experience.
Despite decades of struggle to achieve workplace equity in academia, both women of color and white women face daunting obstacles. For example, a recent study found that female faculty in the United States on average earn 6.9 percent less than men in similar academic positions.

June 27!Exxon pays $1.6 billion for Bakken assets
Exxon Mobil is making a $1.6 billion investment in the Bakken oil fields of North Dakota and Montana.
Exxon Mobil is making a $1.6 billion investment in the Bakken oil fields of North Dakota and Montana.
The corporation is buying 196,000 acres of shale assets in the two states, capable of producing more than 15,000 barrels of oil and other hydrocarbons per day in the second half of 2012, according to a news release from the company.
The agreement increases ExxonMobil's holdings in the Bakken region by about 50 percent to nearly 600,000 acres.
Exxon Mobil and its subsidiary, XTO Energy, is making the purchase from Denbury Onshore, LLC, a subsidiary of Denbury Resources Inc. The sale includes all of Denbury's assets in the Bakken region.
Denbury will receive $1.6 billion in cash and acquire ExxonMobil's interests in two oil fields in Wyoming and Texas.
Exxon Mobil Corp. is the world's largest publicly traded international oil and gas company.With national signing day tomorrow, Trojans across the nation nervously await the results. Will USC rejoice in a class of 2013 stacked with 4- and 5-star recruits? Or will the Trojans find themselves disappointed and with spots to fill in their class?
Y’all, this is so much like sorority rush it isn’t even funny. Right now USC—under sanctions and with the PR-challenged Lane Kiffin as coach—plays the part of the sorority hobbled by a bad reputation. Sure, they may be the prettiest girls on campus, but they’ve got a PR problem and a hard time getting new members.
Doomsday tweeters are all over Twitter projecting doom and gloom for the Trojans. Kiffin apologists are fighting back, squawking about his past recruiting victories and reassuring everyone that ol’Kiffy will come through for USC once again.
We don’t have long to wait now. Trojans fans’ jangled nerves frankly can’t take too much more. Right now, it doesn’t look good for the Trojans.
There has already been some bad news today. Three players have decommitted from the Trojans on signing day eve. Torrodney Prevot, a 4-star DE who committed to USC last summer, is expected to sign with Texas A&M (via Reign of Troy).
At one point USC had a bevy of defensive linemen committed to the Trojans. Five highly ranked players would have shored up new defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast’s system and given the Trojans a bit of depth. Only Kenny Bigelow remains of the original five commits.
Cornerback Jalen Ramsey is a 5-star athlete who committed to USC last summer. He is expected to sign with Florida State. This is a significant loss for the Trojans, even with Su’a Cravens and Leon McQuay III a part of USC’s class of 2013.
Jason Hatcher, a 4-star DE, has flip-flopped his commitment to USC several times in the past few months, but even just a few days ago, he seemed to send signals indicating he was ready to commit to USC once and for all. Hatcher’s mother even told USCFootball.com (via Steve Jones of The Courier-Journal), "We’ve told people he is waiting until signing day, but he is sticking with USC."
ESPN reported today that Hatcher has elected to sign with the Kentucky Wildcats instead (via Dave Hooker/ESPN).
This many decommits this close to signing day is, overall, a bad sign for the Trojans. Sure, the class—though small in size—is loaded with talent. But with Prevot, Ramsey and Hatcher joining previous decommits, it is hard for USC Nation not to panic.
Eddie Vanderdoes and Kylie Fitts remain in play, and they are set to decide between USC, UCLA and Notre Dame.
Follow Bleacher Report on Wednesday for signing day news as it happens.

With new technical regulations taking away aerodynamic “blown diffusers,” Adrian Newey’s Red Bull boys struggled for pace and could manage only 5th and 6th on the grid. Meanwhile, Roman Grosejan in the Lotus nipped Michael Schumacher’s quick Mercedes W03 for third.
“I’ve never known F1 to be as open as this,” Button said. “Never. The last five or six years I’ve raced, you would have the McLarens or the Ferraris or, one year, the Brawn, then the Red Bull in 2010 and 2011, but no, I’ve never known it like it is this time.”
This article titled “Lewis Hamilton beats Jenson Button to pole at Australian Grand Prix” was written by Paul Weaver in Melbourne, for guardian.co.uk on Saturday 17th March 2012 04.21 America/New_York
McLaren produced their first one-two lockout since the European Grand Prix of 2009 with Lewis Hamilton winning his 20th pole, just 0.152 seconds ahead of his team-mate Jenson Button in Melbourne.
“It’s an incredible feeling to be back here [on pole] and to get off to such a good start,” Hamilton said. “I think this is mine and Jenson’s first one-two – I believe at least – in qualifying, so it’s fantastic to start the season this way.”
After all the smoke and mirrors of testing and practice, perhaps even more surprising than McLaren’s success was a second row made up of Lotus’ Romain Grosjean and Mercedes’ Michael Schumacher in fourth. Grosjean’s performance was even more remarkable as his more fancied team-mate, the former world champion Kimi Raikkonen, failed to make it to Q2 after running wide at T12.
Whether this all spells the end of Red Bull’s hegemony remains to be seen but they looked off the pace, with Sebastian Vettel, the champion for the past two years, back in sixth, one place behind Mark Webber.
“We would have loved to have been closer to the front, but in Q3 I wasn’t happy with my lap,” Vettel said. “I made a mistake at the beginning and lost some time, so that was down to me. We are not starting at the front, but we are not starting at the back either, so it’s far from disastrous.”
There was no doubting the biggest disappointment of the day. Neither Ferrari driver, Fernando Alonso nor Felipe Massa, reached the top-10 shootout. They both struggled for grip, with Alonso spinning off on T1 and finishing 12th while Massa was 16th.
“What is obvious is that we’re not quick enough, not competitive enough to fight for the top places at the moment, which is something we knew after winter testing,” Alonso admitted. “We have to be more united than ever. We worked 24 hours a day before this race, now we have to work 25. It’s the only way to improve the car and win races soon. This is now the target.
Already sensing the likely backlash in Italy, the team principal, Stefano Domenicali, said: “I understand at the moment our fans are disappointed. But I would urge them to be cautious before making any definitive judgement, as if everything was already over.
“The season is going to be very long, as tomorrow’s race will be long and hard. Given our grid positions the realistic aim is for us to get both cars into the points. As usual, we will do our utmost.”
In a very encouraging start for Williams, Pastor Maldonado finished eighth, ahead of Force India’s Nico Hulkenberg and local boy Daniel Ricciardo in his Toro Rosso.
At the back of the grid it looked a little like 2011, with Caterham once again looking the strongest of the bottom three. They finished ahead of Marussia but the HRTs failed to make the 107% cut-off time and will not compete on Sunday.
But it was the McLaren team that was the toast of Melbourne in qualifying. And Hamilton’s broad smile was in such contrast to his expression much of the time last year, his most difficult in Formula One.
Button, who won here in 2009 and 2010, said: “We knew we had to have a good winter, which is something we haven’t had for a couple of years. The team have done a very good job. But I was surprised by the gap back to the Red Bulls and the other cars.”

Oh, wait, wasn't it a holiday today? Shoot, I missed work!
A holiday for the algos and robots?
Yes
They all made their year. Off early this year to the Hamptons!
Qingming Festival: official chinese bank holiday.
Blythe was out today. Had to run down to DC, Daley needed a Lewinsky.
The question is - will silver hit $39 overnight, or will we have to wait until Wednesday?
The real question is when do we awaken to $100+ Silver one morning.
then i will need a parrot on my shoulder to "do the talking."
Thats pro. Im getting an Afghan Reesus Monkey to handle my day to day operations/familial interactions @ 100$
It smells to me like tonight...everything's in a line for a nice pop.
Turd's observation is that the cartel often waits until after Mondays in order to avoid it being obvious. It's called Happy Monday! I would expect a fierce attack tonight or tomorrow. If buyers step in, they will likely trace a new line in the sand higher up.
That's not until next Tuesday so they can crush it before the big options expiration at the end of the week.
Does that Cum with a happy ending?
Already hit it for me. I sold a bit so I could have some work done on my fence (in preparation for goats--coming soon to a tmosley near you), and got $39/oz for generic rounds).
Well, that's quite good really, considering goats supposedly scare trolls away!
They also climb dams -
And steal jobs -...
Ever see the movie, Men Who Stare at Goats?
No wonder the parasites have been all over AVL like flies on Timmah: nothing else to pump.
It's so far beyond rediculous ..I don't even have the words for it .What the fuck is going on ? The Benank has really fucked everything up
+1. The pooch is screwed.
Congrats to all of you who have National Semiconductor Corp (NSM). Texas Instruments Inc is buying chipmaker National Semiconductor Corp for roughly $6.5 billion in cash, the companies announced on Monday. Stock is up 72% AH. Very bullish for tomorrow and shows you risk appetite is opening up...
it shows that companies would rather drastically overpay for revenue then for trying to grow organically (because they are unable to).
And pro-forma accounting hides a lot of ills.
Serious Leo??? Is that really your takeaway or did you forget your <sarc on / off> button?
He was being serious sad to say. Which is why I don't read anything he writes about on ZH anymore. He is a cheerleader, instead of telling the facts of truth. Nothing wrong with making money, but don't lie to people....trying to do it. You make yourself as low as the scum in the Treserve and in the White House.
Agreed - we are what we do.
did it.
Another example we need an ignore button.
Yes risk appetite always opens up when you're playing with other people's money...yes so bullish *rolls eyes*
In other words, you and Robo are so full of it. This is so similar to the dot com days when bankrupt companies were buying each other out in hopes to preserve their shareholders' (read: VCs) capital.
At least Robo objectively presents technicals. Yes, he seems to present positive set-ups disproportunately, but the market has been disproportunately to the upside. My observations tell me he is a proficient trader.
Deleted
Well.. it's one thing if he objectively presents technicals. Unfortunately, he tries to make his posts look like he's an oracle but in reality he comes across as an arrogant monday morning QB with pics of hot chix..
You only see him around when the market is up.. otherwise, he's never around when things are down - which is why he gets junked a lot nowadays. A long while ago, he used to actually be fun to read when he wasn't so objective (read: not a bulltard)..
He's whiffed badly on PMs consistently.. There are a lot of people who doubt how good Robo is given his history of being more Monday Morning QB than oracle.. Especially when his explanations on why the market is up doesn't match what is really going on.
For the record, I didn't junk your opinion, but I strongly suggest that Robo is as objective as the Wall Street Journal's reporting on the Fed.
I suspect monday morning quarter back syndrome. Also Robo said in previous posts that he bought the recent precious metals dip, but hasn't said much since. The person who is always making the right trade at the right time is probably bullshitting.
TI way over paid for Burr-Brown in 2000, which ended up being the book-end of the Tech bubble. They are repeating history.
I also think their two fabs in N. Japan will be down longer than a July restart.
"they" have "fabs in japan"? who r "they" again?
Definitely starting to see some "end of bubble" type behavior. That's what excess liquidity will do.
Hope they can close this deal before July.
Perhaps the thought of four more years of "The One" is sinking in? Look at how well the first two years have gone.
Low volume on comments also, both here and the WSJ.
It is a bottom in pessimism. The paranoid anti-stock anti-usa crowd is losing hope. It may be time to short the market now! Buy on pessimism highs and lots of bragging by the zero hedge crowd, sell when comment volume is low and the pessimists are losing hope!
I guess I'm still of the completely unvalidated view that the Fed will never sell it's T's, its MBS's, and won't ever sell it's equity holdings (whether they be held by BlackRock or whoever). I have this funny feeling Fed is printing money from nothing, buying "stuff", and never putting said "stuff" back on the market. Results in less "stuff" for sale, Fed never has to write down assets (they're held to maturity...infinity?), and subsequently just creates more free money with which to buy more "stuff". What could be more inflationary and supportive of asset prices?
I have a strange feeling that the outstanding float of assets (even T's) may be getting lower on a daily POMO basis.
And I really curious about all the continued fake T's getting confiscated to the tune of a trillion plus. If these are what is "caught", means there are likely far more out there likewise hoovering up assets and increasing money supply???
Don't worry, the bankers only accept those funny bonds at a 10-15% discount - so inflation is already priced in.
Being able to print money and buy assets is good business -- even if half of them are bad.
dup
Don't forget gouging customers with service fees. There's more than one way to get blood from a stone!
Only thing I have left in any of the markets is a nice round lot of SPY puts for September. Other than that, cashed out all FOREX, Treasury Direct account, and its all going to add to my silver pile.
ok mark this down boys. A man willing to pull out the crystal ball and predict the future and willing to have a totally undiversified account.
I don't think he is going to make much money between now and October though. come back and let us know
If the SPY and NYA clear the old highs with participation from the bank stocks and chip stocks, there will be an outright buying panic because too many guys are sitting on the sidelines, too scared to buy.
EEM and IWM have already punched through, and those sectors are by far riskier.
And speaking of risky sectors, when is the GDX going to take off? They were stomping all over TRE, AEM, etc. today.
Poor General Jim should have left his gold mines untouched in the ground, started up a Priceline copycat, and named his company "Travelzoo" instead....
Heh, he'd be rolling in the dough right now, and the CIGA's would be ebullient if they bought TZOO instead of TRE.
LOL....
i smell gloating... or is it a pink bra gone bad? wink wink lol.
Robo here has the attention span of an amoeba, and I think I am being generous.
Also, he can't post a chart of gold or silver today, because they are UP.
he says he is in gold and silver too. I get a little suspicious because he is always in the things going up and never has bought an investment that wasn't wildly successful. A bit suspicious, but he is fun to have around because it makes some people so mad. I enjoy harrassing the caged monkeys too, Robo. They are so easy to get riled up! but lots of people have figured out the game now. You only have a few dupes who still play.
Now Hammy is really going strong. Apparently there is a new crowd who doesn't realize he is a parody of Harry and they get riled up and junk him. That is truly funny!
Robo,
much as I loathe your rationale, I believe you are correct and against all rational and sane expectations, the market is setting up to blast off.
This may be the last ditch attepmt to draw investors back, create leverage and credit reliance again. Looks like they want, are hoping for one more bubble. The bubble of all bubbles? Just all seems so pointless and terribly destructive...but I'm sure you will make out very nicely, sorry for the dig - just hard to seperate the playa from the game.
The market is looking for bagholders. Robo will be one of them. I would advise against joining him.
Im just looking at PCLN. At this point i can honestly ask, Volume.. Who gives a flying fuck? Just buy and leave the technical bullshit to the machines. I do own Bidu though and thats not doing too shabby either. Volume is another 90's term that Art Cashin usedto bitch and whine about way back when there were actual trading posts and Market makers.
Still not not listening to your mentor Quint to watch the SMH...but let me guess you are "long and strong" anyway with 20% of your capital invested...one of these days if we are lucky Robo will go the way of Wanger.
LOL
Well...you have to admit he has become a pariah to some degree merely by being a contrarian and failing to follow the party line at zero hedge.
Although he is kinda rubbing it in a bit much. Humility may be useful.
It may be fun to bait the rabble but at some point robo's luck will change. If he comes back in June or July and says he got out of stocks right before the top then we will know for sure he is just bullshiting. No one can time everything perfectly and that is the first clue of a scammer, the guy who always make the right moves.
There are some true morons on the SPY board on Yahoo. LOL
Post on there about CNBC bringing on Leroy Jenkins in a few minutes. Some idiot says who? Nice one Tyler on Twitter!!!!!!!!!!!!! ROFLMAO
Leroy KNOWS how to wipe a raid!
where is Robo, I need to see some BOOBIES
.edit
Tonite oil will hit new highes and tomorrow ES will hit old highs to celebrate. What goes up must go up!
apparently that includes "boobies."
My only short position got its shares called back today... Not sure what to make of this, maybe a top is in or really close.
specificity please kitty. what's good for the goosing is good for a gander.
Illusion has made an appointment with reality . I wish I knew the date and the time .
So they don't do QE3 right away, they let the stock market and commodities crash, then they propose QE3 to save the day. However, the don't start it until everyone has seen their net worth go to zero and the public is begging for the Fed to save the day. I don't see how else they play their cards because either way they are trapped.
Yes... The Fed cannot do a bald-faced QE with oil this strong....
Maybe the game is to let the stock market run to the moon, in which case, many/most funds will be forced to sell at least some of their equity positions in order to rebalance.

Imagine this. The greatest asset of an ecosystem or a country is the quality of its inhabitants. High quality inhabitants leads to high GDP growth and progress (industrial revolution, the car, the telephone, the Internet ect.). The relatively homogeneous baby boomers (white Europeans) were of relatively high quality but this group fell short of the magically 2.1 children to sustain itself. To halt the decline high quality Asians were brought in but this group itself is falling far short of the magically number 2.1 to sustain itself (South Korea, Japan, China all are far below 2). This source will run dry at some point.
According to PISA, these two groups (Whites and Asians) have the highest IQs of all populations.
At the other hand the countries with the lowest PISA-IQs (from Mexico to Brazil and from Africa to the Middle East) are the fastest growing populations worldwide. Do you get the point?
To sustain the populations (and the economic system) of the US and Europe the politicians and their masters will inevitably resort to the more stupid populations on earth. This will lead to an irreversible decline in the gene pool and the overall IQ of the US and Europe because the more stupid populations with their high birthrates will dwarf the Whites and Asians at some point (already underway).
This "socio-economic super trend" will culminate in a degeneration of the population and the overall economy (climax). The best example is the rapidly growing group of Mestizos (Latinos) who are famously dull (PISA-IQ 70 and sinking). A microcosm of this can be observed in Texas where they will outnumber the whites in a few decades. They invest little in education and their income is far lower than that of Whites and Asians. This means they consume less, save less and will use crime to get more money.
This "socio-economic super trend" (or the trend of all trends) is the doom of doom and strikes terror into the elites head (Hello David). It can only be stopped when immigration is halted which is nearly impossible and is against the Neo-Liberalism mantra (Globalisation).
The world is heading toward an epic socio-economic disaster more destructive and powerful than every monetary system and they know it. This is the way how civilizations fall. The Germans of 1933 understood that the so-called democracy and Neo-Liberalism conspiracy can only lead to the fall of the US and Europe which is now underway. The Germans were your only salvation but you have conspired against them (Hello England, France, the US, Russia and House of Rothschild YOU ALL WILL FALL). Can you beat the trend of all trends?
Wow, that's some pretty impressive flamebait. Especially considering your german username.
Perhaps he is channeling the ghost of Franz Von Papen?
Oh that one was good! lololol
My German blood says GFY.
Germany's boned too.
YOu could have left fascism out of it and still had a legitimate point. Even if HItler and the rest understood how advanced populations tend to fail to reproduce and are overtaken by less advanced populations, it doesn't mean their solution was the right thing.
The best solution to the demographic dilemma that there is an inverse relationship (in the modern socialist world) between IQ and fertility is just not to do anything that worsens the trend. The lowest IQ caucasians on welfare have the most kids too. They end up in prison about as often as the low IQ black kids on welfare. They are all drags on civilization and a net negative regardless of skin color.
Yes the stupidest and least fit have the most kids now. Hopefully we will stop emigration before it is too late. But we also have a problem with our own stupid low class population of caucasians overbreeding, and that is just as serious and also just as likely to result in loss of vitality and regression of our civilization. Net takers can never be a positive for a civilization or a race when they overpopulate. The majority of kids in most states are born to singles mothers and/or on medicaid. People with good private insurance are a minority in the maternity wards.
Junk him if you want, but we have to address this somehow. IQ is at least partially if not strongly inherited. Up until the modern welfare state the lowest IQ people did not reproduce excessively. With the modern welfare state we are now subsidizing the ultimate destruction of our civilization.
sad but true.
so we should have compulsory sterilization then?
Get out while you still can... uh, the game is rigged.
The con game permeates so deeply now...markets, RE, CRE, education, media, travel, etc.??? Really hard to get out of the game; every which way you turn the game forces your participation either through taxation, inflation, etc.
For the Canadians out there.......
It's pretty funny- at the counter they've got a diagram with charts showing commodity cycles plus a note about unusual weather patterns to explain why their prices are going up!
At the grocery store, similar notes in the produce sections explaining that strange seasonal weather is why all the prices are going up. A head of cabbage (!!) now costs $3+, bag of carrots $2.50+, bell peppers $4.00+/lb. I think I'll be starting a garden this summer...
Ben,
You are in a room. There are two doors to exit from. To your left, that door leads to 72 of the most beautiful virgin (women) in the universe. HOWEVER, once you go through that door you will immediately be castrated, your limbs chopped off and you will be stoned to death by those women until you are bloody stump. As your perceive your last glimmers of life you will taste your castrated member (balls first) stuffed into your mouth.
Door #2 you ask? Hillary Clinton's bedroom.
These are the choices you have left yourself.
Time to mount the hill. May not be much of a view from on top but should be good exercise.
Choose Hillary, and lie back and think of England
What's an "algo?"
algorithm; program trading. but fundamentally a good question. i'd like to know what's in that black box.
Hey, if volume doubles tomorrow based on the semiconductor merger frenzy...
Does that mean TZOO is up another 9% again?
Does that mean BIDU goes to $150?
Just askin'.....
LOL....
Do you ever feel like you are talking about something and almost no one in the audience gets it???
It is a pickers market, fast in, take the money and run... or identify sectors that have fundamentals on their side and ride out any vol....I prefer the latter...
five percent of investors will have returns greater than 95 percent of other investors by random chance. a certain number of them by random chance will repeat that feat, and a certain number of those who repeated it will go on to repeat several more iterations, just by random chance. We have what? one or two investors who have a thirty year track record better than their risk adjusted benchmark?
Alpha is a myth, but people are fooled by randomness. When you have a hypothesis and you make money on it you start thinking your hypothesis was the reason, rather than a more complicated complex system interaction and coincidence as the cause of your success.
The blind hog always thinks he decided ahead of time to search in a certain place when he finds the acorn. He attributes finding the acorn to specific actions he took, rather than random chance.
There is much truth to what you say...but, real alpha does exist, real alpha means that you change you thesis when the data tells you too...
At the risk of blowing my own horn, I would put my 21 year record, given the investment possibilites I was afforded, against almost anyone...it was not like I could buy CDS against CDOs...
of course there is no way to prove our beliefs. We both have a faith based religion.

Hey everyone,
I realize roti and pita are two very different things but I perfer both over regular sliced sandwhich bread. For pita I am specifically refering to the larger Turkey/Arab style and not the smaller and more doughy greek style.
I am looking for someplace that sells freshly made Roti/Pita bread (just the bread, no fillings) for take home near or in downtown TO. I find it the Roti/Pita in my local grocery store (Metro etc.) to be pretty lacking. The whole-wheat pitas are always too old and dry out quickly and the Roti just doesnt taste the same as the ones you get in a good Indian restaurant or even from Ghandi's.
Any suggestions would be appreciated.
For pita (thinner kind), I like the ones at Big Carrot. I think they're Egyptian (?) and they come in 4 packs or packs of 2 and they're usually in the baskets at hip level in the front of the bread section. They don't dry out super fast like other brands and they have a good nutritional profile.
Not quite downtown, but Alima's in Brampton () fits the bill as they sell all types of Roti "skins" - they even sell them in freezer packs. They are also freakin' big as they should be to make a proper Trinidadian style Roti. We drive from downtown to Brampton to buy a dozen or two then freeze them. They keep for months and even then they are a tastier than the grocery store ones.

One could make a case that, ever since the Haitian Revolution, there has existed a great divide between the masses of peasants, workers and the poor and the privileged economic elite that controls the vast majority of the land, wealth and resources of Haiti. This is largely true as well of the "political class" who have been sponsored or accommodated by the elite to run the affairs of state (often at the behest of external forces). For the political class the reins of government have provided access to resources and the opportunity to leverage their limited power to escape the fate of the masses of Haitian people who have perpetually lived in misery. This is not to say that there have been no enlightened leaders among the elite or the political class, but, by and large, the upper crust of Haitian society, with its appendages, has been self-interested, self-serving and self-aggrandizing to the detriment of the Haitian masses and ultimately the nation as a whole.
It is among the Haitian masses, those who have borne the brunt of the struggle for independence with their sacrifice and blood, that one finds an incredible energy, resiliency and will to fight for a better future. We witnessed this resiliency in the tent communities in the aftermath of the earthquake, where the people organized committees to govern themselves with virtually no help from the government or international agencies. It has been the masses, along with reform-minded and radical intellectuals and disaffected individuals from the political class who have consistently resisted dictatorship and authoritarianism in the quest for genuine self-determination, political and economic democracy. And at every turn the interests and aspirations of the masses have been deterred by the elite and political class (again, often at the behest of external forces).
If indeed a new Haiti is to ultimately rise from the ashes of the January 12, 2010 earthquake, this internal contradiction must be overcome. The class divide must be bridged and the enormous energy of the Haitian masses must become the central focal point for the creation of a just, humane and prosperous society. As has been the case in the past, the masses will continue to harbor legitimate suspicions of the intentions of the economic elite and a mistrust of a political class who have all too often failed to engage workers, peasants and the poor in the process of building a better nation. In fact, while the international community has often failed to do right by Haiti, it is also the case that the economic elite and political class have been characterized by incompetence, corruption and a callous disregard for the Haitian masses. While external factors are certainly a principal reason for Haiti's underdevelopment, it is also true that the lack of physical and social infrastructure to serve the interests of the nation is a function of cronyism, mismanagement and ineptitude within the elite and the political class. For example, I can find no plausible reason why Haiti's roads are chronically in a state of disrepair.Page 1 of 3

2011 FJ Crusier Summit
Have some teaser shots until I get permission to use some with the lic plate or until I figure out how to block them but figure I'll post them when I have time to write up a report.....I will say on the last day of wheeling I did Imogene and Ophir I was told I was 4 inches from the side of the bad side of the shelf road and I don't think I could have put my middle finger in between the back of my rig and the fool that continued down after one of the better spots to pass some one. I really thought I was as close or closer and was thinking I was going to have a red strip on my back corner panel. Other than that it was a blast!
Ive tried 5 times with 5 to 1 pictures and each time the manage attachments keeps giving me a white screen:( so I guess no pics tonight

Joe Bacal stopped by the TLCA booth!!
Got to speak with him and get to know him a bit, super nice guy. He also participated in my Recovery Scenario presentation with a recovery of his during the Baja 500..
This pic was just sent to me by Jerry Davis "MTBCoach" in mud and the blue room. Jerry and I met on the Rubicon, as we were part of the first and only all FJ Cruiser run at the Rubithon 2008 and Jerry is a buddy of "rutbeer".
Needless to say, I was really excited to meet Joe and hear his great stories about the Baja races.

The room was extremely clean. My wife always brings her cleaning supplies in order to redo the cleaning process. This is one of the few occasions where she sprayed the beds. That's impressive!
Nice hotel
The hotel's front desk staff was less than accommodating because we purchased our room through a third party. They made us feel like outsiders. I would only recommend this hotel because the other hotels in the area are so atrocious.
The Troy University Campus is beautiful. Also Montgomery, AL has some nice historical attractions
Fantastic Accomadations for Troy graduate and family
The staff were very polite and efficient. The room was amazing!!! The mattress on the bed was Awesome!!!! I wouldn't mind having one of those at home.
This was a pleasurable stay at this hotel.
great location near Troy Stadium
Right on 231 and near many restaurants. 1 mile from Troy University. Very clean and large,bright rooms. Attractive lobby area. Very friendly and helpful staff. TV's at each booth in the bar area. The best lodging I've had since coming to Troy.
Would not recommend
Disappointed
Nice hotel reservation extras were not known and ignored
Will definitely recommend.
We really enjoyed our stay and will definitely recommend to anyone we know. Our room was very clean, quiet and had all the conveniences we were looking for. We could not have asked for more.
Great Hotel!
Best hotel in Troy! The lobby and outdoor area with firepit have a very welcoming, comfortable feel. The room was also very comfortable and clean. Shower had great waterZostrix High Potency Foot Pain Relief

Tendulkar, a self-confessed Federer fan, met the winner of 16 Grand Slams at the All England Club after the world number three beat David Nalbandian to advance to the fourth round of Wimbledon.
Tendulkar chatted for an hour with the Swiss and posed with him for the shutterbugs.
"Spent an hour with Roger Federer chatting on the balcony of Wimbledon Royal box. What a humble guy! And by the way he knows a lot about cricket!!" Tendulkar later tweeted.

NEW YORK MILLS -- The Norman County East Eagles completed a doubleheader sweep of the New York Mills Eagles as both the boys and girls teams matched up Saturday.. Charlie Peeters scored eight.
A dozen Norman County East shooters got on the score sheet, led by Devin Anderson's 13 points.
Norman County East got up big leading 37-15 at halftime.
In the opener earlier in the day, the host Eagles lost to the Norman County East girls team (17-6) 60-22.
The loss was the second in two days for the NY Mills' girls. Friday, Menahga handed the Eagles their seventh consecutive loss 79-32.
The loss concludes Park Region Conference play for the Eagles. The girls team finished 2-10 in the PRC and are 2-20 overall. They will host Waubun and travel to Ashby to conclude regular season play.
The boys team will host Rothsay and Menahga this week, before winding their regular season down on the road at Underwood and Parkers Prairie.There’s an interesting discussion going on in the comments on this post of Jennie’s about whether there’s a need for a ‘radical liberal’ group of some description. This reminded me of this post I wrote last year on the same issue, even if I got myself a bit trapped in semantics about left, right and centre.
So, given that five or six people in a comment thread think it’s a good idea – hey, the SDP started with less than that – I think it’s time to take a step forward from ‘that’d be a good idea’ and actually do something about organising a radical grouping. Actually, it’s more than five or six, as I’ve seen similar ideas discussed elsewhere and get support from different people. There is, I believe, support out there for a radical liberal organisation of some sort, but the question is what sort of form should it take?
My thought is that I think a radical liberal grouping would benefit from taking a different approach to organising itself. In my view it would be best organised as a network or a forum where like-minded people can come together and discuss, argue and plan things together but without the necessity for having to convince the entire organisation of something before any action gets taken. One of the issues with trying to create an organisation that’s truly radical is going to be that not everyone is going to agree with everything that’s discussed and suggested, and it seems to me that the best way to deal with that is to embrace it and make it a feature. Indeed, you could argue that if everyone agrees with something, it’s not really that radical…
Rather than creating some new faction with a shopping list of policy proposals that everyone has to sign up to, my idea would to be to come up with a relatively short statement of radical liberal principles, and people who agreed with those could become part of the grouping. I’d expect that list to be centred around issues of freedom, civil liberties and libertarianism, anti-authoritarianism etc with dashes of decentralisation, internationalism and other issues. Once that’s done, then we can look at how we go on to build a network of the people who agree with it, and what shape that network could take.
So I guess it’s time to throw it open to the crowd – how does that sound for steps forward? What’s your vision of radical liberal principles?Last week, Waka Flocka Flame unexpectedly dropped his new mixtape DuFlocka Rant 2 while Jae Millz unleashed his latest Dead Presidents 2. With J.

VIDEO: Are Memories Reliable?
.
The condition may affect as many as 1 in 50, said Dartmouth professor Brad Duchaine, who has studied the condition extensively. The causes are complex, but scientists say they are getting closer to pinpointing the roots.
“If you think about an analogy to an electrical circuit, there are different nodes of the circuit, and face recognition requires a number of different regions that work in concert to yield accurate face recognition,” Behrmann said. “There’s some problem in the circuitry, and we have some hypotheses on the table.”
They’ve already discovered, for instance, that people don't fully develop facial recognition abilities until the teenage years.
NEWS: Your Brain Is Your Password
And those who never fully develop the ability often don’t realize what’s wrong.
“A lot of people know something’s wrong; some are able to put a finger on it, but others don’t know and they often attribute it to not trying hard enough, or some think, ‘Maybe I’m not interested in people,’ and many feel guilty about it until they learn it’s an actual problem,” Duchaine said.
Like many similar conditions (scientists suspect prosopagnosia falls into in the same general category as dyslexia), face blindness can be experienced in a wide range of degrees. Some also experience problems reading facial expressions.
"And at the opposite end of the continuum, there are super recognizers, people with out of this world facial recognition who have to hold themselves back" on saying hello to everyone they recognize, because people think they're being stalked, Duchaine said.
Duchaine has helped create a website with some basic facial recognition tests for people curious about their own ability. No word on whether Brad Pitt has taken it.

“Instead, I had to tell them that they’re made in China,” said Newman.
The same goes for the majority of police, firefighter and municipal badges, something he hopes his company can change.
Newman, 58, along with founder and CEO Ozzie Silna have launched a strong “Buy America” push into the private, commercial sector. The huge pool of patch wearers includes professional athletic teams, car manufacturers, youth organizations, political campaigns, NASA and motorcycle clubs
It’s not as though business is unraveling. For the past six decades, Action Embroidery has sewn up a lucrative niche manufacturing emblems for the military, including flags, coats of arms, agency seals and badges.
“We want people to understand that manufacturing done in the United States isn’t that much more expensive than manufacturing overseas — maybe 20-cents more a patch,” Newman said. “Plus, ‘made in America’ benefits our economy, brings in tax revenues and puts people to work.”
Today the corporation produces nearly 80 percent of the U.S. armed forces’ official insignias —.
“Action does excellent work,” said Tom Casciaro, chief of the technical and production division of the Institute of Heraldry in Virginia. “We do the design work here, but we have to use private industry to develop the artwork into an item. Action has a lot of expertise and is very accommodating in making adjustments to an insignia.”
Among its latest projects, Action Embroidery will be producing a patch for a National Guard support group and developing a patch for the U.S. Army marksmanship unit, an elite team headquartered in Kansas.
“During the last 20 years, developing new items for the military has been part of the business,” Silna said. “We’ve kept growing because we’ve become more efficient, turning out 300 to 500 patches at a time, 20,000 to 30,000 a day.” To stay cutting edge and ahead of competitors, Action keeps $5 million worth of fabric in stock.
Action, “dirt poor,”’s little business, then known as Art Embroidery.
While his parents were visiting Latvia and Israel, 23-year-old Ozzie Silna, captivated by a customer’s Army patch, saw an opportunity with Uncle Sam. He called some military brass and won a bid for a huge order that forever changed the direction and fortunes of the tiny family embroidery business.
When his parents returned months later, “my father was shocked,” Ozzie Silna remembers. During their vacation, the canny entrepreneur had swelled receipts from $1,100 to more than $600,000. “My father said he’d give me a $50 a week raise,” he said with a chuckle.
Within two years, Art Embroidery expanded to five factories and 60 employees. In 1986, Silna relocated corporate headquarters to its current Ontario site, changed the name to Action Embroidery and hired Ira Newman in 1991.
The Bronx-born Newman, who wrote the computer software for the multimillion dollar machinery, said, “I’ve learned so much from Ozzie, who thinks out of box.”
The pair likes to quiz each other. “Ira, what the hell is this?” Silna asked, pulling one of scores of patches from his desk drawer.
“The U.S. Air Force Academy,” Newman replied, without batting an eye.

Brendon McCullum has a lot of tattoos. What's up with that? asked Nash P from South Africa
How many tattoos does a man need to sport before you can call him a man? One of the great questions of our age, to rank alongside "How many seas must a white dove sail before she can rest her head in the sand?" (Which conveniently overlooks the point that such a dove would in all likelihood be a bloody ostrich and not a dove, in fact, but that's another matter. Who would expect any good out of a folk singer Bob Willis was named after, anyway?)
If you're a cricketer, you need more tattoos than the average sportsman because you need to overcompensate to quell people's suspicions that cricket isn't all that cool. Our Baz has taken this task seriously. As seriously as he takes his gum-chewing on the field - in which effort he comes second only to the great Vivian Richards in the all-time rankings.
It helps that he's from New Zealand, whose cricket team have a bit of a bad-boy thing going, with their black uniforms, stubbly sullenness, excessive drinking (well, one of them anyway), and tradition of vicious dibbly-dobbly bowling.
Baz isn't from the weedy David Beckham school, and so wouldn't dream of inking a loved one's name on in a foreign language. And really, what's the point of having tattoos all over you if they're going to say the name of some girl in Sanskrit or "Mom 4 Ever"? Tattoos are for jackboot-wearing tough guys, not weedy mama's boys.
Baz, knowing full well that mathematicians get the girls, has roman numbers inscribed on his arms. (This also serves as a tribute to the noble civilisation that gave birth to cricket by creating the vital concept of the centurion before the game itself existed.) Rumour has it these are his cap numbers, but really, who other than your class six teacher really knows what CXXVI XLII CCXXIV really stands for? Could be Aramaic for "I used to have tattoos in English but got bored", for all you know. Or cryptic strategy notes John Buchanan had inked on to him during the IPL. Or shopping list reminders: "Mustn't forget the dye this time. Roots looking awful."

Irresponsible us. Bit like failing to find fault with the alignment of the hood ornament on a car that has plummeted down a cliff, burst into flames and then been trampled by a herd of wild elephants, wot wot.

© ESPN Sports Media Ltd.In Game 3 of their first-round playoff series against the Houston Rockets, the Oklahoma City Thunder were without Russell Westbrook for the first time since coming to OKC.
Though Westbrook is often scrutinized for ball hogging or spotlight stealing, he's without a doubt the second-best player on the Oklahoma City roster and an incredibly crucial part of the Thunder's success. Without him, the Thunder are faced with the difficult task of making adjustments to accommodate his absence.
There were questions even before Westbrook suffered a torn meniscus about how good Oklahoma City's chances were at repeating as Western Conference champions. Now with their star point guard out for the remainder of their playoff run, the Thunder have an even larger mountain to climb en route to the NBA Finals.
Like any other team facing unforeseen adversity, OKC must band together and make the necessary adjustments to ensure their survival in the grueling postseason.
In particular, there's an adjustment that's very necessary for the Thunder to make—and that change involves more team-oriented basketball and better ball movement.
This idea may seem a bit illogical with an incendiary scorer like Kevin Durant on the team. However, the Thunder must cut down on the isolation-type plays made for Durant in order to maximize their offensive effectiveness and efficiency.
With a healthy Westbrook and Durant, OKC has two very capable scorers on the court who can create their own offense with a variety of jump shooting and attacking the rim. When one seems to struggle a bit, the other is there to catch him and could shoulder a lot of the offensive burden to prevent dry spells for the Thunder.
This two-superstar system has worked well for the Thunder and is often misunderstood as one player shunning out touches from the other. On the contrary, I liken it to more of Durant and Westbrook understanding each other's games and rhythm of play, which allows them to help each other out when the other is on a cold streak.
However, Westbrook will not be playing anymore this postseason, so that leaves Durant without a reliable second option on offense to lean on. Sure, guys like Kevin Martin or Serge Ibaka could put up some points, but neither of them could create instant offense as well as Westbrook.
This is where the adjustment of ball movement comes in. Durant proved in the first half of Game 3 against the Houston Rockets that he could light up the scoreboard sans Westbrook. Things were going well for KD in the first two quarters, where he dropped 27 points and the Thunder led by 17 at the break.
Once the second half came around, though, Durant's shots stopped dropping and OKC's offense slowed down accordingly. KD was sort of forcing some shots and his struggle opened the door for a Houston comeback. The Rockets gladly walked through that open door and ended up almost stealing a game, but Durant's fortunate roll on a three-pointer in the last minute set the Thunder up for the win.
Luck was on Oklahoma City's side that night, but that game was a much-needed wake-up call for the Thunder as to what changes need to be made to prevent losing leads against better teams down the stretch of the playoffs.
Durant carried the Thunder in the first half, but when he wasn't carrying them in the second half, they found themselves parched for offense. A poor 14-point performance in the third quarter demonstrated that they needed more team-oriented basketball.
There are other scoring options on the team who can make open shots when given the chance. However, these players are a bit more deficient with creating offense off the dribble, so moving the ball to give them the easiest possible look at a shot is important.
Look, for example, at this sequence from early in the season against the Raptors.
Hasheem Thabeet found an easy dunk at the hoop as a result of great passing from (former) guard Eric Maynor and a smart play by Nick Collison to draw the defenders in and allow Thabeet a clean look at the rim.
These three players in this sequence are obviously far from star players, but they executed well and moved the ball to get a high-percentage shot. This is what the Thunder need to incorporate more of into their style of play in order to keep their offense functioning.
Sure, Durant could tear it up single-handedly, but that can only go so far, as we saw against Houston. This type of play makes all five guys on the court for OKC threats to score. Durant has greatly improved his passing and facilitation this season, so to see him play a point-forward type of role during the rest of the playoffs is something head coach Scott Brooks has already started to work into the games.
Moving the ball means that opponents will have to stay on their toes defensively, constantly rotating and helping instead of focusing and double-teaming a guy like Durant, who they would usually and correctly assume to be the man taking the shot.
In this clip, we see more examples of good passing and creating easy shots against a quality defensive team in the Spurs.
Durant said it best in that video and was absolutely right about having to trust his teammates to make the shot. That trust and willingness to defer to the open man is what could really help the Thunder, who are facing an unprecedented stretch without their floor leader and second-leading scorer.
Kevin Martin is one of the best spot-up shooter options that Oklahoma City has, and even defensive-minded Thabo Sefolosha has really improved his shot to become a secondary spot-up option. Frequent passes and forcing defensive movement can pull the opponents off of these guys and give them enough room to bury their shots.
As you can see, a lot of these shots by Martin came from good ball movement and kick-outs. KD can draw an insane amount of attention when holding the basketball, so him having the offensive awareness and passing ability to get the ball to teammates like Martin on the perimeter could provide a large boost for OKC's scoring.
Overall, the Thunder need to really just get acclimated to life without Westbrook right now and make the necessary changes little by little. They shouldn't go out there and overthink every possession; there are going to be times where Durant is feeling it and needs the ball in isolation.
However, it would be far more beneficial in the larger perspective for Oklahoma City to increase its passes per possession to provide a fail-safe for KD when he struggles to create offense.Thomas named 2009 Ebonite of the Year

The Lazarus Effect
Living With HIVby Liz HighleymanThe fact that HIV-positive people can live long, healthy lives comes as a surprise to many, including Hector Melia, a 49-year-old native of the Bronx, New York. “I found out that I had HIV in 1991 when I had a really bad infection in my foot,” he said. “My doctors didn’t think I would live for very long, and I didn’t think to question their logic. But I’m still here, almost 20 years later.” Melia, however, will be the first to admit that his long-term survival hasn’t always been easy. “I’ve been on [HIV] medications for 15 years,” he says. “It was hard, getting used to the pills and the side effects, but I’m really good about taking them.” In fact, he credits his good adherence for his excellent lab results: an undetectable viral load and 410 CD4s at last count. His healthy numbers keep Melia at a low risk for typical AIDS-related problems, such as opportunistic infections (OIs) and wasting syndrome. But he, like many people living with HIV, must consider other challenges when it comes to long-term living with the virus—and its treatment. For example, long-term antiretroviral (ARV) treatment requires long-term planning, not only with medical issues, but also with services and support you might need to ensure that nothing gets in the way of your health care. What’s more, people with HIV may be at an increased risk for age-related health problems, such as cardiovascular disease, and need to take steps to prevent and treat them. This POZ Focus explores some tips and tricks to surviving and thriving with HIV. “Every morning, I look in the mirror and tell myself, ‘I can do this,’” Melia says. “I’ve been blessed with many more years than anybody thought was possible”—and he fully expects to enjoy many more.For Melissa Whiting, teaching is about challenging students, encouraging them to take risks and preparing them for their post-academic lives.
Whiting, 57, professor of English and rhetoric at the University of Arkansas at Fort Smith, has taught at UAFS since 2004, but began her teaching career in 1978 at Sperry High School in Sperry, Okla. She also has taught at the University of Oklahoma and the University of Southern Mississippi. She has bachelor’s and master’s degrees from the University of Tulsa, and has a doctorate in English education from the University of Oklahoma.
She has been published in numerous journals, written chapters in textbooks and even helped develop some of the Common Core education standards used in Arkansas and Oklahoma.
Good assignments don’t just hit one Common Core, they hit many, Whiting says.
“I teach for life, not just for kids going to college,” Whiting said. “(Common Core) scares a lot of teachers, but I think it challenges them to quit thinking that reading and writing comes from English teachers — it’s not the English teacher’s duty; it’s every teacher’s responsibility to make sure our students are literate. I think this pushes math, science and history teachers that they teach literacy skills as well, like a lab report or a word problem. It’s bigger than just English. It’s about teaching about life. That’s what I find the best about it.”
Whiting has taken that philosophy to co-author a textbook for high school English classes that has become the second-best-selling book in its field.
She co-wrote “Language and Composition: The Art of Voice” with the late Gilbert H. Muller, professor emeritus of English at the LaGuardia campus of the City University of New York.
The book, published by McGraw-Hill, caters to Advanced Placement English Language and Composition students in grades 9-12 and engages them in writing through a varied anthology of essays that include print, audio, visual and interactive media, Whiting said.
Advanced Placement is a program in the United States and Canada offering college-level curriculum and examinations to high school students.
The textbook was released for school review in February 2013. Whiting said it plays to the Common Core standards, which is why many teachers are receptive to it.
McGraw-Hill approached Whiting in May 2012, wanting her to rewrite and add to the existing textbook. She helped add new essays to the book and worked on rewriting it for the last six months of 2012.
Essays collected in the textbook range from classical works by Frederick Douglass to contemporaries such as Sherman Alexie.
David Anderson, English department chairman at Hinsdale South High School in Illinois, said he enjoyed the selection of essays.
“I like the focus on more modern topics like technology and helicopter parenting,” Anderson stated in a news release. “I could see myself cannibalizing some of these selections for close reading analysis.”
Ashley Gerhardson, instructional facilitator for English and social studies at Darby Junior High School and former student of Whiting’s, says although the textbook is not in use at Darby, she tries to incorporate elements of it into the classrooms.
“I think the main thing I’ve taken away from it is the methodology, not specific methods she’s used, but her tools she uses to challenge students,” Gerhardson said. “Specifically by looking at interactive and visual texts, I try to incorporate a lot of those things at Darby to help our students be better learners. The key thing from her book is getting them involved in their learning.”
Whiting said the book has been a monumental success.
“Here I was, sitting down in Fort Smith, Ark., and McGraw-Hill calls and asks me write this monumental book,” Whiting said. “It hit me pretty hard, because they’re very renowned, and I thought, ‘You’ve got to be kidding me.’ It’s unbelievably rewarding and amazing it’s been well received.”
She says the methodology in the textbook is more than just text, but about testing your limits.
“I try to explain that to my own students, to write from your gut,” Whiting said. “I give people more points for being brave than trying to write something that didn’t take a risk.”
Whiting’s influence goes beyond that of the classroom and her published works, as she has become influential in her students’ lives.
“Her main influence on me was that it’s not just about the content you teach, it’s about maintaining a rapport with your students,” Gerhardson said. “She taught me the importance of building and sustaining relationships after you finish your teaching is the most important thing you can do as a teacher.”
Gerhardson, a 2007 UAFS graduate, said she took Whiting’s courses for three years and has kept in touch with her, considering her a mentor and a friend.
“I lost my mother 3½ years ago, and she called me as soon as she heard,” Gerhardson said. “She’s not one of those professors you’re scared to approach. When I need to talk to someone, she’s that person. She’s passionate about not only the subject, but the students needs.”
Joe Hardin, dean of the College of Languages and Communication at UAFS, said he considers Whiting an asset to the university.
“We are very proud of her, and we encourage our staff to continue to learn and develop. This is very much a part of what we do here,” Hardin said of Whiting.
Whiting says she is getting ready to start another book and has plans to retire “who knows when” to her second home in Grand Lake, Okla.
She and her husband, Jim Zacame, have two daughters, Molly, who works in insurance and lives in New York City, and Megan, an attorney in Birmingham, Ala.In working on my spare-time app BostonBusMap, I’ve repeatedly run into problems where I need to cut down on memory usage or running time. It’s not difficult to hit memory limitations on Android, especially on earlier devices which may allow only 16MB per app. Garbage collection can cause noticeable hiccups (especially before Android 2.3), which is one reason why memory usage can impact an app’s sluggishness. Here’s a list of things I did to make my app more responsive:
- First, read the Android performance guidelines. It’s also worth rereading this page from time to time because newer Android versions have more advanced capabilities that may influence the optimizations you make.
- One other important thing that bears repeating from that page is, don’t optimize unless you can show that there’s a bottleneck, because optimizing is a lot of work and can make code less maintainable
- Memory allocations are expensive. Be lazy in allocating objects if they are only used in edge cases
- Use DDMS. This is available within Eclipse and as a standalone tool:
- Profile against smaller amounts of data at first, to make the experience less painful and time consuming for you. Debugging will slow your app down in general
- Click on the green cylindrical icon to the left (called “Update Heap”) to turn on heap tracking for a thread. This will update whenever a garbage collection occurs (you can also force garbage collections) Month of May, 2015

Lee-Lo, 27, was employed off the Hurricanes' reserve bench through the first half of the season before impressing when starting in their last six games of the campaign.
Crusaders coach Todd Blackadder said those performances convinced him to pursue the hard-running back.
The Crusaders are also negotiating with another Hurricanes back, All Blacks wing Julian Savea.

Has she been to the dentist yet? I would bring it up. It might be caused by stress (is she learning to potty train, or did something else change in her life?). It might be nothing. But if it is happening more than you realize, it can affect her teeth and jaw. I would make a dentist appt.
My 4 year old seems to have a teeth grinding problem. She told me her teeth hurt when she chews. I took her to the dentist and they told me it was probably from grinding but that there wasn't anything they could do. Normally they'd put a mouth guard on, but she's too little. They conferred with a pediatric dentist who agreed nothing could be done at this point. I never catch her grinding, but you can see the little chips out of her teeth. She said she knows she's doing it so I told her not to, and we've left it at that for now. Good luck! If your dentist tells you anything different, please let me know!

What's on your mind?
Let's face it: it's a long journey to get to Alaska and it's expensive. For your precious few days up here, whether a few days or a few weeks, your time is precious. Here are several tips that can help you spend more time getting to see and experience Alaska and less time in the airport, at WalMart, or doing mundane things that keep you from seeing what you came to see!
1. Be well rested before you get to Alaska. You may go to the beach or to a cabin a couple hours from your house for getaway weekends to catch up on good sleep. But do you really want to come all this way to be rundown and fatigued? Naturally, this is your vacation from the stresses of life, but you set yourself up to not enjoy your time here if you do things like take red-eye overnight flights to Alaska or set up nearly-impossible flight routes with too-short layovers. If I had a dollar for everyone who inadvertently spent the first night of their grand voyage at the Salt Lake airport or at O'Hare because something happened with their connecting flight(s)...I'm a big proponent of going as direct as possible at a decent time of day. It really is worth the extra dollars. See the Fly Smart post in this blog for more info.
Use the clock to tell you when to sleep. It's sunny all summer, night and day. At some point you will fall over from exhaustion if you think you can keep going til "dark." Jet lag can be terrible and really mess up your body. This is not a good place to try to stay on your home time zone. First off, there's nothing to do at 3 a.m. if you're from the East Coast or Midwest and wide-awake at that hour, and secondly, you'll be missing the most beautiful time of day if you're headed to bed at 7 p.m.
To get onto Alaska Time, make yourself go to bed at the time you turn in at home, and make yourself stay in bed until at least 6 in the morning to help your body reset, since the triggers from light outside will not be a good indicator. Between the light and the excitement of being in such an extraordinary place, it can be hard, but it'll really catch up with you after a few days. Trust me, you'll hate to have to miss ATV'ing or flightseeing because you were too fatigued. I see that mostly in my teen guests. Mom and Dad may turn in at a decent hour, but it feels fun to stay up til 2 a.m. for Missy Teenager who is not as disciplined, and she pays for it later by missing out on a fun adventure.
2. Don't bring clothes for every possible contingency. This may fly in the face of your instincts or common sense. Yes, it does rain here. Yes, it can snow even in the summer. Yes, it's probably cooler than what you're used to at home. But (this is for you, Gusinskys!), a whole suitcase of shoes?? What's the worst that's going to happen if you get chilly on a hike? We have heat here. Do you really want to MANAGE all that STUFF, dragging it around behind you all the way through Alaska? Then you need the extra big Suburban which costs an arm and a leg at the rental desk and at the pump. And you've gotta haul those bags in and out of every place you stay. And you've gotta repack and sort and organize...One trend I've seen over my 10 seasons owning my B&B is that people are bringing more and more with them. Now, many people eschew the 50 pound weight limit on their suitcases and pay the extra charge for these MONSTER huge bags that are basically red or black nylon rolling steamer trunks with a pull-up handle. How many couples do I hear bickering about who's going to bring in the bags or haul them back out and did they get everything? See the How to Dress in Alaska and the Pack Smart posts in this blog for more info.
In terms of getting in and out of the airport efficiently, not everyone can do this, but consider bringing a handbag or tote and one suitcase which fits in the overhead compartment. Shaving off 45 minutes standing at Baggage Claim at 1 a.m. or any time makes a persuasive argument for keeping your baggage with you. See other goods reasons like Lost Luggage in the Pack Smart post in this blog.
3. Stay longer in one place and avoid the time wasted re-packing, hauling bags, searching out your next lodging, and trying to hit certain check-in times. Using one spot as a base-camp can shave hours off of a day. See the Unpack Once post in this blog for more info.
4. Food: In my humble opinion, food is not the main attraction in Alaska. The big "wow" is the glorious splendor of nature with soaring mountains, gorgeous rivers and forests, and don't forget the wildlife. While there are restaurants that are gastronomical marvels using the freshest Alaska seafood and local specialties, it's likely that during a lot of your vacation days, it'll get towards lunch time and the only choice nearby may be a greasy spoon. I'm a fan of hitting the grocery store. Our food prices are higher here, and frankly I feel a lot of our restaurant prices are just not worth the cost. At many of our local cafes, diners, and restaurants, a plate lunch of a hamburger with cheese and a big mound of fries typically runs $13 or more. Dinner entrees for something like pasta or a chicken dish can easily be $18, with dinners like salmon or nice beef ranging from $22-27 for the basics. That adds up fast. One thing in your favor is that portion sizes are generally large, so it's often possible to split an entree. For sure, take a couple evenings to go out and have a satisfying, special dinner. But on the days you're running around sightseeing and just want to feed your hunger at the end of the day, you might consider getting a rotisserie chicken and bagged salads or something along that order at the grocery store. Our cottages and apartments all have kitchens. Most guests comment that the hearty continental breakfasts I make each morning carried them either to or through lunch and that it was economical for them to just grab something quick while they were out on the go, sightseeing or adventuring. One caveat: don't forget to eat dinner during "dinner-time." Our long summer days can fool you: the sun is still up, shining, at 7-8-9-10 p.m. and many visitors loose track of time. Most restaurants here pretty much are closing up for the night by 8-9 p.m. or so. It can be harder to find a real meal at 10 p.m., besides that long days can tire you out (See #1 above). Gotta pace yourself and fuel yourself well for your Alaska adventure!
Regarding types of food available here, we are not a tropical paradise, and most fruits and vegetables were freighted up here. While salads don't universally consist of iceburg lettuce any more, green stuff may be more scarce than you're used to. Finding good peaches or things you may be used to can be dicey. Alaskans eat diets heavy on potatoes (which we grow here) and meat (much of which grows here, commonly moose, caribou and salmon) because it's what there is a lot of here. You don't have to worry about the provenance of the red meat on your plate, since we can't serve wild game to guests (since it's not USDA-slaughtered). If you're wondering how most families up here can afford the price of food, it's because many live subsistence lifestyles to some degree, hunting and fishing or gathering berries and growing gardens.
If you're vegetarian or vegan, you are going to have slim pickings at restaurants outside of Anchorage and other larger towns. These places will offer some degree of "ethnic food" which can be helpful. Many vegetarian guests exclaim with delight when they find something for dinner that is not a baked potato or plain pasta. At a lot of restaurants, they want to make sure a vegetable is good and dead before they serve it, so don't be alarmed to see boiled-to-death broccoli or green beans. In our area, Vagabond Blues cafe and Turkey Red restaurant in Palmer do a nice job of offering vegetables, grains and protein alternatives.
5. Choice of rental car: Rental cars are spendy here and the taxes added on at the airport are killer, 28%. You can save a bundle by not renting at the airport, by taking a taxi to pick up your car at a different location. This may seem out of character with my lectures about spending your time efficiently in Alaska, but I'm talking as much as $100+ saved on a weekly or longer rental.
I'm a cheapskate. I usually get the beep-beep economy car when I go Outside, but I pack light and don't usually spend a lot of time in that car. It's almost a given that you will spend a lot of time in your car up here because the distances in Alaska are far. I actually recommend that you think about how many 5-6 hour drives you'll have in your trip when you think about how big of a car to get. NOT bringing huge amounts of luggage can make your time in that car more comfortable, too. Yes, you all can do it, to have the back of the vehicle filled, then each have a carry-on bag on your laps while you motor to the next destination, but, really? Several days of multiple-hour drives like that?
6: Gas: buy it when you're leaving a metropolitan area. Don't buy it on the far end of a loop-drive if you can help it. The further you get from the core area of Anchorage and the Mat-Su Valley, the more expensive it gets. Sometimes by as much as $2/gallon when you're "out there," so it adds up. If you can, schedule your fill-ups to hit while you're still in a bigger town. I doubly emphasize that if part of your trip takes you through Canada. Ouch! Even if you're not handy with the math converting gallons to liters, just know, it costs more in Canada.
7. Souvenirs: I can't tell you how many of my guests ask where to buy "cheap gifts." WalMart actually has the widest array, and the Fred Meyer and Carrs grocery stores are good, too. Be clear though that these are "cheap." They are almost all mass-made in China. They're a good source for printed mugs, sweatshirts, and postcards. Visitors can sometimes have sticker shock after looking at carvings or locally made artisan pieces. My grandmother was on the hunt for a couple of years for an "inexpensive totem pole." That doesn't exist, if you don't want the plastic nine inch tall one that WalMart carries. Anything made by human hands here in Alaska doesn't come cheap because the cost of living here is much higher, particularly if it is something created by a villager living way-out.
8. Activities/tours/tickets: Plan ahead as much as possible. Even if that means arriving at our B&B and sitting down for part of a morning to sketch out what you'd like to do here, that time is well-spent. It's not advisable to just show up at a place and expect to get a tour right at that moment, with a few exceptions (day-cruises in Seward being one of the easy ones to walk onto because there are many going each day). Very few things in Alaska are 24-hour, so please be courteous about not calling for reservations or to schedule an activity outside of 8 a.m.-8 p.m., generally--at most small Mom and Pop businesses, they do not have overnight "desks" to answer your calls. "Mom and Pop" are ready to have some dinner and call it a day by late evening!. We are happy to help you lay out attractions, activities, and routes that match your interests, so just ask! We can also help you reach the tour and activity operators to make your plans. In general, plan your activities as early in your stay as possible so in case of weather, you can still reschedule it for a later day or time.Search

There was a time when mindless entertainers summed up Bollywood offerings. Today, however, the scenario is different. While no-brainers continue to have their own space in the industry, there are many others films today that have actors pushing the envelope.
Sanjay Dutt in 'Agneepath'
Experimentation is no longer a dirty word and so committed are actors that they don’t hesitate to go bald for a role. Audiences too are getting more receptive of such roles.
Arjun Rampal in 'Ra.One'
The latest instance is that of Shahid Kapur who has gone bald for his role in Vishal Bharadwaj’s film, Haider. Not surprisingly, his bald look went on to become a subject of curiosity.
hitlist speaks to seven sultry actresses to get their take on the hottest bald pates in the industry and why they are lapping up the bald look…
Actor whose bald look she loves the most: Shahid Kapoor
Neha Dhupia
Lowdown: The actress says, “Shahid Kapoor is looking extremely good in the promos of Haider. The bald look doesn’t suit everyone but Shahid’s look in the film is absolutely striking.”
Actor whose bald look they love the most: Saalman Khan
Mugdha Godse
Lowdown: Godse says that she loves Salman’s look the most. “He is incredibly goodlooking, so he can carry off anything. Even a near bald look is something that suits him just fine. Nothing can take away from his looks; he can flaunt any hairdo/ look,” she says.
Daisy Shah
Lowdown: The actress recently debuted in Bollywood opposite Salman Khan, so it should be no surprise that she prefers Salman’s near bald look over everyone else’s. She votes for the actor’s look in Tere Naam (2003). “All actors looked good in their bald avatars; they looked fierce and they did justice to their roles. My personal favourite is Salman Khan in Tere Naam. At the end of the day, it’s about experimenting with your roles and reinventing yourself in the process,” she says.
Actor whose bald look they love the most: Aamir Khan
Malaika Arora Khan
Lowdown: The leggy actress picks Aamir’s bald look over others’. “His bald look in Ghajini is the best til date. He looked super cool in the film; I’d say he looked beautiful in it,” she says.
Prachi Desai
Lowdown: For me it has to be Aamir Khan. He makes every character so believable. His role in Ghajini stayed with me long after the film was out of theatres. He pulls off the most unconventional and unexpected roles with such poise.
Richa Chaddha
Lowdown: The Gangs of Wasseypur actress believes that Aamir’s look in Ghajini (2008) is one of the best bald looks in Bollywood. “Aamir looked spectacular in the film and his toned body added to his overall look. Aamir’s bald pate was a trendsetter as I saw many people follow suit by shaving off their hair during the time of his film’s release,” says the actress.
Dipannita Sharma
Lowdown: Sharma feels that no one has done justice to the bald look the way Aamir did in Ghajini. “Change of look is actually part of a deeper need to get into a particular character and only a perfectionist like Aamir can pull off such a role with élan,” she says.
>> Shahid Kapoor has gone bald in Haider.
>> Aamir Khan sported the look in Ghajini. His near bald look became a rage soon after.
>> Arjun Rampal’s shaved his hair for his role as a baddie in Ra.One (2011).
>> Sanjay Dutt reprised Danny Denzogpa’s role of Kancha Cheena in the remake of Agneepath (2012). His bald look made him look every bit menacing.
>> Salman Khan’s crew cut in Tere Naam was technically not a bald look; it was a near bald look that caught everyone’s attention.We:,…

Lucille Ball dies. Comedian Lucille Ball dies at age 78. During her career, she and husband Desi Arnaz transformed TV, creating the first long running hit sitcom.
Ball starred as a ditzy wife in My Favorite Husband from 1948 to 1951. CBS decided to launch the popular series on the relatively new medium of TV. Lucy insisted Desi be cast as her husband in the TV version, though the network executives said no one would believe the couple were married. Desi and Lucy performed before live audiences and filmed a pilot, convincing network executives that audiences responded well to their act, and CBS cast Desi for the show.
I Love Lucy became one of the most popular TV sitcoms in history, ranking in the top three shows for six years and turning the couple's production company, Desilu, into a multimillion-dollar business. Ball became president of the company in 1960, after she and Desi divorced. She also starred in several other "Lucy" shows, including The Lucy Show, which debuted in 1962 and ran for six seasons, and Here's Lucy, in which she starred with her two children until the show was cancelled in 1974. A later show, Life with Lucy, featuring Lucy as a grandmother, was cancelled after only eight episodes. Ball worked little in the last years of her life. She died of congestive heart failure following open-heart surgery earlier in the month.

By 3:45, a crowd of more than 300 people had appeared at the Los Angeles County Courthouse, most protesting the verdicts passed down a half an hour earlier and many miles away. Between 5 and 6 p.m., a group of two dozen officers, commanded by LAPD Lt. Michael Moulin, confronted a growing African-American crowd at the intersection of Florence and Normandie in South Central Los Angeles. Outnumbered, these officers retreated. A new group of protesters appeared at Parker Center, the LAPD's headquarters, by about 6:30 p.m., and 15 minutes later, the crowd at Florence and Normandie had started looting, attacking vehicles and people, mainly whites.

In The Puppy Episode of the ABC sitcom Ellen, the character of Ellen Morgan (played by Ellen DeGeneres) announces that she is gay. The widely publicized episode featured cameos by Oprah Winfrey, k.d. lang, Demi Moore, Billy Bob Thornton, and Dwight Yoakam. An estimated 42 million viewers watched the special hour-long program.
Ellen DeGeneres herself had come out earlier that year on The Oprah Winfrey Show and in TIME. Ellen is often credited to be the first primetime sitcom to feature a gay leading character but there was a sitcom titled Love, Sidney (1981 until 1983) staring Tony Randall. The first openly gay regular character on a sitcom was Soap's (1977) Jodie Dallas, played by Billy Crystal.
In the spring of 1994, Ellen DeGeneres was cast in a series called These Friends of Mine, but in the fall of 1994, she took center stage and the program was retiled Ellen. The program finished in the top 20 shows for the 1994-1995 season.
The outing ignited a storm of controversy, prompting ABC to place a parental advisory at the beginning of each episode.
Despite her success, and the enormous audience drawn by the coming-out episode, ABC cancelled the series at the end of the 1998 season. Although the network pointed to dwindling ratings, Ellen DeGeneres contended that the network buckled under pressure from conservative groups and stopped promoting the show after the controversial episode.
To quote the Bicentennial Minute, "And that's the way it was".

Yahoo Search Marketing recently made what seems to be a drastic change to their Terms of Service. These new terms were sent out to all advertisers via email. Continued use of YSM services after June 13, 2008 constitutes acceptance of these new modified terms.
So What Actually Changed?
The new changes to the Yahoo Search Marketing TOS, listed ¾ of the way down the new TOS, seems to allow Yahoo to make any "Optimization" changes to your account without prior approval. According to a Yahoo Service Rep, this is supposed to help smaller advertisers who want to spend $100 a day, but are only able to spend $20 a day. To me it seems like Yahoo is saying, we know your business better than you, so if we feel the need to change adverts or add/delete key phrases we are going to do so. This new TOS change also seems to be targeted at the small advertisers as all those "not bound by an Insertion Order" meaning corporations and large companies with big budgets will not be affected. Below is the actual paragraph in question from the new."
What do I do
To keep an eye on any unwanted activity I suggest exporting your entire campaign, key phrases, adverts, landing pages, etc. into a spreadsheet and periodically checking for changes that could have been made by Yahoo. If you have any daily budget parameters that you are not currently meeting, I suggest you lower them unless you want Yahoo to spend the rest.
You are able to email or call Yahoo to opt out of any unwanted changes. Tell them you want to "Opt Out" of the new "Optimization" changes in the TOS. I called Yahoo Support (1-866-924-6676) and was able to opt out of all "non-insertion" accounts within 15 minutes by supplying the username and password for all E-Power Marketing managed accounts. However conflicting stories from WebmasterWorld.com forum members leads me to believe that email/phone call or not, if Yahoo wants to make the changes they just might.
This may not seem like a big deal to some… and the intent may be inherently good, but for those advertisers that are affected and don't even know it, Yahoo may be crossing the line. Good intentions or not.
What happened to transparency? Why bury these changes in an unbelievable long TOS email?

PREFA Acquires Food for HIV-Positive People in Uganda
The Ugandan nongovernmental organization PREFA, which works to protect and prevent families against HIV, has created food security and nutrition programs for HIV-positive people in Masindi, Bulisa and Kayunga districts, The New Vision reports. “Often neglected, food security and nutrition are critical for individuals, households and communities affected by HIV,” said David Serukka, MD, the executive director of PREFA. “Lack of food security and poor nutrition may hasten progression to AIDS-related illnesses and undermine adherence and response to antiretroviral [ARV] therapy.” According to the article, the organization secured $6 million to fight malnutrition among HIV-affected families. Proper nutrition can manage symptoms of conditions associated with HIV, such as diarrhea, weight loss, sore mouth and throat, nausea and vomiting.Adequate dietary intake and absorption are necessary to achieve the full benefits of ARV therapy, and evidence suggests that patients who begin therapy with insufficient nutrition have lower survival rates.

RagavanSuperior, WI (NNCNOW.com) --Forestry officials in Superior are teaming up with the city council to deal with a destructive forest pest, the Emerald Ash Borer.
Douglas County is under a strict quarantine that restricts transportation of ash products to uninfected areas.
City Forester Mary Morgan is suggesting several response scenarios and policy actions to deal with the infestation.
Morgan asked the city council to waive the pesticide ordinance that would allow them to inject unhealthy ash with a pesticide to kill the bug.
Officials also want to provide people with a way to properly dispose of infected trees.
"We also want to establish a marshaling area as a depository for private trees. We have established one ourselves for the boulevard trees but we have a lot of ash in yards that may also fail as well," said Morgan.
She also requested the city approve operationally that all public ash trees will be chipped on site and transported to a marshaling area for disposal by the city.
The city has approximately 3,000 ash trees on public land and about 14,000 on private lands.
No action was taken at the meeting on Tuesday, but the issue will be discussed at the next committee of the whole meeting.

The Earthworm Jim 3D wiki last edited by ReverendHunt on 01/07/14 11:05AM View full history OverviewEarthworm Jim 3D was the latest game in the series to appear on consoles. It is the third game in the series and was created by Interplay, and was more aimed toward the television series rather than the previous games in the series. Earthworm Jim 3D was released in 1999 for the Nintendo 64 and PC, also a PlayStaion version was announced, but got cancelled.GameplayEarthworm Jim blasting an enemy.Earthworm Jim 3D is played similar to other 3D platformer games in that time, such as Super Mario 64 and Donkey Kong 64.The player will control Earthworm Jim and kill enemies while containing many platforming elements. You play through different levels, and unlock more locations by collecting Golden Udders, while new levels in each locatain can be obtained by collecting Jim's Marbles. Like in previous Earthworm Jim games, Your primary weapon will be your blaster gun.PlotEarthworm Jim is struck by a cow flying through the air, and is then induced in a coma. Jim awakes in his mind and becomes crazy. Jim's previous enemies are also in his mind, and if not defeated, Jim will be stuck in his coma forever. He has unleashed his super ego to stop the madness happening in his mind. Jim must collect all of the Golden Udders to restore his sanity. As you travel around his own mind, Jim has four area to explore in order to restore his health (and more importantly, his sanity). The four areas Jim must explore is also where he must collect his marbles, which, not only determines how smart Jim really is, but can unlock future levels by collecting a certain amount of marbles. With this in mind, Jim must travel deeper into his mind to get rid of his enemies. The first area Jim explores is his Memory, along with his old foe, Psycrow. Inside Jim relives his early childhood of a war and other manly things a worm must remember. Collecting all the Golden Udders in this area allows Jim to travel into another part of his just after he defeats Psycrow in a good, old fashioned Pig Surfing contest. Jim must collect 100 marbles before Psycrow in order to win (and all the boss battles are this way as well so it's good to practice now while you get the chance). A big catch is that you have to watch your health at the same time so it's best not to get hit with anything and hope that you can collect everything before Psycrow does. The second area Jim must explore is his Happiness. In here, nothing but food and anything Jim really loves the most is in this part of his brain. However, another foe is around here as well and that would be Fatty Roswell, an alien with an obvious problem of eating way too much, with a goal to make Jim's mind the perfect place to dine forever. A tough boss to crack as he has the ability to teleport around the area, making it hard to collect all the marbles to win. Jim swallows his pride and sticks his chest out, the next area he must face is his Fear. Everything that he fears the most can be found in this area and adds even more rooms then the previous area, just to see Jim wet himself. In here, he must face ghost chickens and dancing zombies in order to restore his sanity.

Hearing examiner reverses decision on Montessori school
The Kitsap County Hearing Examiner last week reversed an earlier decision and granted the Montessori Farmhouse School in South Kitsap a conditional-use permit.
At the last Kitsap County Board of Commissioners’ meeting, the commissioners voted to have Hearing Examiner Ted Hunter reconsider his February decision that denied school owner and operator Annette Weaver a permit to run a full-day program at her six-acre site on the 13500 block of Bethel-Burley Road.
“Based upon new information submitted at the closed record appeal, the Hearing Examiner reverses his initial decision of denial and on remand approves the revised Condition Use Permit request with condition to mitigate noise, traffic, and environmental impacts,” states the decision released Aug. 8.
Weaver said she was “grateful for the outcome,” but that there was still “some considerations that need to be worked out,” referring to the hours that the school can operate.
According to the hearing examiner, he reversed his decision based on “new information submitted at the closed record appeal,” which Weaver said was the fact that she agreed to reduce the number of students from 40 to 34, and to operate the school from 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. instead of from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m.
However, Weaver said while she did agree to reduce the number of students, she wants to offer “before-school” activities from 7 a.m. to 8:30 a.m., and “after-school” activities from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.
She said offering those extended times was important for families with working parents, particularly those who commute to Seattle and might have to find alternative child-care if they could not drop off their children earlier and pick them up later.
Weaver said she would be filing with the county regarding the hours of operation, and that even if all goes well, it likely would be nine months from now before everything was completed and her school was operating as she hoped.
“It is really frustrating, but I am grateful for the decision, and grateful for my supporters and my attorneys,” she said.
Currently, Weaver runs a “small, half-day” program with 16 children that she says the county allowed her to operate while she completed the permit process, as long as she didn’t actively market her school or expand to full-day classes.
To qualify for the conditional use permit, Weaver says she and her husband Terry “upgraded habitat and that it would be dangerous having so many cars pulling in and out of the school’s location.
Hunter denied the permit, and Weaver hired attorneys Ron Templeton and Bill Broughton to file an appeal, who called the hearing examiner’s decision “erroneous and capricious.”

He was able to lower his ERA to 2.84 and he received his fifth win of the season for his effort. He also hit his first home run of the season in third inning off Clayton Kershaw.
Bumgarner has not given up more than three runs in six-consecutive starts. His next expected start is scheduled for Tuesday at Milwaukee.
Bumgarner allowed two runs on eight hits over seven innings of work. He did not walk a batter and struck out four. Bumgarner allowed solo home runs to Zack Cozart in the first inning and Billy Hamilton in the fifth. He lowered his ERA to 3.20.
Bumgarner has pitched at least seven innings in three of his last four starts. His next expected start is set for Thursday against the Dodgers.
The good news for
The bad news is that he is now 3-2.
The defeat came courtesy of a terrible fourth inning in which Bumgarner yielded all three of his runs on a Marcell Ozuna homer and doubles by Jeff Baker and Adeiny Hechavarria. He pitched shutout ball in his other four innings, but it took him a whopping 99 pitches to get through it.
Bumgarner, who raised his ERA to 3.30 in his worst outing since April 16, is set to make his next start Friday against host Cincinnati.
This is the first time all season that Bumgarner has gone through his time in a game without allowing an earned run. The superb outing drops his ERA to 3.03 of the season. He's now 3-1 for the season.
Bumgarner only allowed two hits against the Padres and had a no-hitter through six innings. He struck out six batters and walked one.
Bumgarner's next start is projected for Saturday against the Marlins.
Bumgarner (2-1) went eight innings strong, holding Los Angeles to one run on five hits and one walk while striking out nine in a 2-1 victory. Howie Kendrick scored Los Angeles' only run of the night on a fielder's choice in the fourth inning.
Bumgarner won his first decision since Opening Day. Over his last two meetings against the Dodgers' ace, Bumgarner has allowed only three earned runs over 14 1/3 innings. He owns a 3.73 ERA, a 1.21 WHIP and 26:5 K:BB ratio in 31 1/3 innings. He'll look for win No. 3 Monday at home vs. San Diego.

With many TV channels typically left vacant, white-space communications technology aims to utilize the available bandwidth. At the same time, it allows underused frequencies within other ultra-high-frequency (UHF) licensed and unlicensed bands to be used for wireless communication. Known misleadingly as Super WiFi, white-space communications is rapidly gaining ground in Europe (see sidebar). Efforts are building from sources ranging from industry-standards groups to firms and research centers.
In the UK, for example, the Weightless open-standards group is aiming to kick off the “Internet of Things” via the use of white-space communications. The group plans to deliver its first complete specification this quarter. Meanwhile, mobile wireless-data service provider Neul has issued version 0.9 of the Weightless Specification. The company also has deployed a city-wide, fully functional wireless network in white space in its home city of Cambridge, England. In nearby France, communications research center CEA-Leti has been granted a government license to experiment with television white-space equipment in the field.
Neul’s Cambridge network builds upon the completion of the first phase of the Cambridge White Space Consortium’s wireless network. This network uses Neul’s equipment and cloud interface together with the Weightless communications standard. In doing so, it proves that its white-space network co-exists with televisions and wireless microphones without causing interference or disruption.
Of course, city space does create a challenging propagation environment. There is more than 120-dB link loss through buildings, foliage, walls, furniture, and human beings. Neul believes that its network opens up several possibilities for the Smart City of the future. It could enable intelligent transport and traffic management, city lighting, and other municipal services.
Cognitive Radios
CEA-Leti has developed opportunistic radio technologies (or cognitive radio) since 2005. In fact, the French government decided to issue a license to the research center because of the wireless cognitive-radio systems that were developed by Leti’s Communication and Security Department (STCS). Cognitive radios are able to both allocate and exploit spectral resources. In doing so, they optimize the capacity and capability of wireless-communications networks. Dynamic spectrum management is not currently permitted in France, however. Because it is perceived as an efficient means to de-saturate the crowded radio spectrum, many industry experts expect permission for such management to be given.
It’s a different matter in the US, where unlicensed opportunistic spectrum usage has been authorized in the free channels of the television spectrum or television white space. Studies have been evaluating whether a similar paradigm could be applied in Europe—for instance, in the framework of the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations. The technology developed by Leti can be applied in both Europe and the US. The STCS’s cognitive-radio research focuses on two fundamental issues related to dynamic spectrum access: free-channel detection and flexible, high-spectrum-efficiency communication systems with low power leakage in the adjacent channels (known as adjacent-channel leakage ratio).
The licensing of spectrum space is always a key issue in wireless communication. Here in the UK, however, national communications regulator Ofcom has said that it would not seek to license access to the spectrum relative to white-space communications. Ofcom expects the first examples of white-space technology to come online this year.
What’s Not In A Name?
The name “Super WiFi” is misleading because white-space communications is not based on WiFi technology. Instead of using the 2.4-GHz frequency, white-space communications employ the lower-frequency white spaces between television channel frequencies. These allow signals to travel further and penetrate walls better than technologies based on the higher frequencies.
The term “white spaces” refers to the frequencies allocated to a broadcasting service. This allocation process creates a bandplan that assigns white space.
However, these white spaces usually exist naturally between used channels. In addition to these, there is also unused radio spectrum that has either never been used or has become free. The switch from analog to digital TV is a case in point, as it made available large areas between about 50 and 700 MHz.Our annual Achievement Awards banquet honors high acheiving minority minority alumnus doing great things in God's Kingdom.

I love this one - it is outside the box but looks great
Good morning Sue,
What a perfect card today as I am in Ireland, love this idea and funny I was just thinking I should use my Celtic dies. Happy Memorial weekend, xxx
Morning Sue, if I am honest, I am not 100% sure about this one, think it could be the shades of green I don't like. Great use of that small die though and if it was in a different colour I m sure it would look better to me. Love Jean xxx
Morning sue you were right this one is really outside the box. And i love it I agree it would make a great mans card. I will now look at all the smaller die now and try to use them like you have done. Take care Sue xxx

Unusual,in a good way, I like it. Mabex
Hi Sue, love this. I would never have thought of doing this. Thanks! X
Hi Sue, love this. I would never have thought of doing this. Thanks! X
This looks great. Love the way you have done the wreath and using different shades gives it so much more texture.
Hugs,

Good morning Sue,
Definitely outside the box, a fantastic way to use up those little Dies.
Thank you for the inspiration.
Happy Memorial weekend
Patricia xxxx
Hi Sue, great looking card love the colours.
GM Sue - different and quite contemporary I am thinking - a question for you or other Wilsonettes please- when you watermark stamp with perfect medium, do you need to heat set it or dry it naturally - if the latter, how long for? I have not tried this technique yet but want to! Thanks
Clare W
Lovely! - in different colours, it would suit almost every occasion.
Great use of the small die Sue and i would imagine you could use up all your small bits of card we crafters don't like to throw away just in case!Change the sentiment and it could be used for anyone,take care,x.
Morning Sue, great for the men like you said but thought of a Christmas Wreath also. Great out the box the card and for using bits go card too. Love it.
Happy Memorial Weekend.
Love June

Hello Sue
Lovely card beautiful shades of green and although I do not have this die I can think of others to use in a similar way. A lot of cutting out even though you can cut two or three at a time but the embossing I find has to be done separately to get the definition but the effect is great! Love it!
Well we are having great weather here in Kent this Bank Holiday weekend which is strange but I will not complain.
Congrats to the winners enjoy your prizes!

What a great idea for the smaller dies Sue, looks fabulous!
Hugs Hayley x
Great card Sue.
Great man's card never no what to do with little dies.
Jane xx
A great male card here Sue, and great colors on it too, and the dies from this set has a great shape and is also great to use for corners on male cards I think. This one is cool, great work as usual.
Big CONGRATS to all the winners too this week. Have a great day everyone and lots of fun.
Good morning Sue and everyone.
Clever use of the die. I would prefer a different colour but this would be a great St Patricks card or for someone of Irish descent in the green.
Congratulations to the winners. X
I like this ,its a bit different ,very nice
Crafty hugs Rachel x
Another great card Sue
Hi. For my ten penneth, I either heat emboss with clear powder or ink over the top but Perfect Medium is only ink, just a clear one, so it will dry if just stamped and left.
Hope that helps.
Hi Sue
Lovely card really like the shades of green made into the wreath and mounted on the white card. For a female you could add tiny flowers and leaves.
Congrats to all the lucky winners.
Enjoy the sun everyone.
Hugs Annx without an "e"
Hmmmmmm, jury's out on this one. Don't know why I stay cold about it but I just do.
I'll have to have a rummage of what I've got a far as dies are concerned, then try the idea in (a) different colour(s) - I applaud the thinking outside the box and agree, these pesky men are so difficult to make cards for!
Hugs, Rose
Hi Sue,
A great card love the way you have used these small dies, haven't got this die but I have others I could use, will give this a go, thanks for the inspiration.
Have a good day.

Good morning Sue this card is fab I love the way you have used the smaller die and made a focal point. I don't have this die but I think the design could easily be adapted to ones I do have. Thanks for sharing. Love Jackie
Good Morning Sue. What a lovely idea, would never have thought of it.
Love Val in Spain xxx
Hi Sue
Certainly different for you. But its very interesting to see the dies used in this way. I like it

Great idea but not my colour scheme, this one
Morning Sue on this bright and sunny morning here in the UK
Love this card can be made in so many colours for many different occasions.

Good morning Sue,
This has to be the best! Green is my all time favourite colour.just love this card, I shall have to have a go later today.
Gail Cx
Definitely an Irish feeling to this card Sue, love the simplicity and clear cut lines, colours not bad too.x
Yes this is a brilliant design for a fella's card, and quite a bit different too. Not all men like the usual, beer, bikes, and cars on cards. X x
Hi Sue
I really like this card and the colour combo. It could be used for so many different occasions. What a brill way to use up all those bits in my ever growing stash of "can't throw it, it might come in useful box " that I never seem to use, lol. Happy bank hols to everyone and congrats to the winners.
Love Jan x x
Morning Sue, my first thought was a Christmas wreath, it is just perfect for that, or as you say a men's card. I wish I could think outside the box and come up with something as good as this, my outside the box should definitely stay inside the box and be buried!!!
Love Rosemarie xx
Good morning Sue
When I first saw the card I thought you had done lace, then realised It wasn't. What a great idea to use the smaller dies. I love the colours you've used and agree that it would make an ideal male card with a different sentiment.
Clare W in answer to your question I have left it to dry and also heat set it. How long you leave it depends on how juicy your ink pad is. Test both ways on a spare piece of card then you will get a better idea hope this helps.
Hugs x
Heather T
What a freat idea to use the dies like this. I love it
morning Sue
Agree what a great guy card and would suit many colour combinations.
I love today's colours and the celtic corners look wonderful - when I saw this set I could not see myself using it - although I do like celtic symbols and art deco - and so have not done anything re buying. Now it is on my list!! Will have to do a search through my dies to see what I have which might be used in a similar way.
Congrats to all winners and my fingers and toes are still crossed just like everyones I suspect.
Janet x
Hi Sue, what a great idea for the smaller dies. love the green and white colours. Congrats winners. Bx
Morning Sue, What a brilliant idea for using the small dies from the set, and you could also embellish more by adding the small flowers from the cherry blossom die set too. It is lovely.
Congratulations to the winners.
Lots of love from Patricia xx
GM Sue - me again - thanks to Heather T for her advice - will try both ways - many thanks
Clare W
Morning Sue, a very simple card for you today. However, good use of the smaller dies in this set. Hope you are having a good weekend. Kind regards Joanne K x
Hi Sue. Wow, that is different, but do you know what, I like it. SueL
Lovely idea on using the small dies As someone else has already said It would make a lovely Christmas wreath
Gorgeous card Sue, great idea for a way to use a smaller die. Hope you are having a great weekend! Maddy x
Great card today Sue, and as you said quite simple by your standards but still looks effective. I also agree with some of the other comments that it could be used for a christmas (dare I say it)wreath with the addition of some poinsettias or a floral wreath using the cherry blossoms or any little flowers.
Love and hugs

What a clever use of the small die. I don't know how you do it. I really like this card and as I have the dies, one that I will try. Thanks Sue for your continued inspiration - don't know what I'd do without you!
Hi Sue
This one is certainly outside the box today. Don't think it's my cup of tea though. It might look better with lighter colours perhaps. Have a great weekend.
hi Sue,
Easy you say but very striking for all that, thank you
love from Jackie D
Hi Sue, Not a green lover generally and don't think this card is for me. Hugs, Carol S.xx
What a fab way of showing us how to use some of those little dies that you sometime look at and think I will never use that xx like you say brilliant for a male card too xx GailT xx
Hi Sue. This is a really lovely card today !! Green is my favourite colour and I just love the two contrasting shades of green that you have used. The Celtic dies are really lovely dies.

Dear Sue
Sorry I've not been posting comments I've had problems with my Internet and not been able to get on to add any.
What a great card you've made for today just love the wreath made from the small Celtic die. Thanks for the inspiration you do using the smaller dies. It would be a great card for men and also Christmas cards (I know its a bit early to mention it!).
I couldn't really see the stamp to die for you embossed but I'm sure it looks great in real life. Love those stamps.
Thank you for your inspiration and hard crafting.
The sun is shining where I am and it's really warm. So warm that its definitely ice cream weather I've decided!
Hope it's nice where you are.

Great idea. I remember this one from the shows. The colour is so appropriate too. Hope you're enjoying yourself over the Pond!!
What a great idea for the smaller accent dies in our collection! I immediately thought of those awkward male cards we have to make and would replace the four pearls with brads. Thank you for all the wonderful ideas Sue. x
Love the background but I must be honest I am not so sure about the wreath, but then again each to their own as they say, its still a great card, tfs and giving great inspiration x
Hi Sue, a lovely card. You have such wonderful ideas on using the dies in different ways.
I think with the addition of a couple of poinsettias, it would make a lovely Christmas card

Hi Sue,
Lovely way to use the smaller dies that I always struggle with what to do with them. I am however in complete agreement with Rosemarie about my out of the box being buried - usually put to rest in the bin.
Have a great day everyone.
Beverley W
Very interesting use of this die. Like the colours and another that can be used for anyone depending on the colours used. Unlucky again in the draw keep hopeing. Kathy xxxx
Hi Sue
What a good way of using those small dies, especially this one. The colour combo has a really clean and fresh look, it's lovely. A lot of work went into just the wreath on this card, unless you have several of the die used you would have put it through the machine 36 times, You must have muscles like Popeye's right arm. ( I hope you know who popeye is, I'm really not being offensive ) :-)
Congratulations to the winners.
Kind regards

Different but still great! I have several corner dies that this would work with and it makes a great male card depending on colour choice. May be interesting to see it in ultra feminine colours to see what a difference it would make.

Brilliant idea
Hi Sue, this is so clever when you think outside the box. I like it. Like you say, ideal for a mans card, maybe done in other colours or even cream and gold or white and silver? What ever the choice, the idea is much appreciated. Those little dies are brain taxing at times! Everybody has different tastes and we'd be a bit boring if we were all the same! We're like snowflakes, all unique! Hope you are well Sue and having a great time still. We've just enjoyed a bit of sun today..... while it lasts....! Congratulations to the winners! Enjoy your prizes! Wonderful! xx Love Karen xx

Interested in playing?9/17/13 Triton School Superintendent Donna Burroughs announced the Puff Mobiles project for 3rd grade students in Mrs. Strycker’s Science class. This project is an opportunity for children to think out of the box and use their minds in a scientific way and produce a, Puff Mobile made out of straws, paper, life savers for wheels and other items found around their home. The children created a moveable car that could be modified in design to make it go faster and to enhance its mobility. On Friday, September 13th teams were allowed to present their Puff Mobiles as well as race them across the gym floor. The Puff Mobiles were powered by having students blowing air behind their mobile unit in order to cross the finish line.
After all teams participated in the race, four teams advanced to the final round. The number one team was able to physically get their car across the finish line first but unfortunately had to be disqualified due to not following the constraints of the design criteria. The 2nd place team was named overall winner in the first round for their design competition as well as the time winner. Teammates were Trace, Alex and Barre.
The 3rd grade class plans to hold another race on Thursday, September 19th.
Superintendent Burroughs said, “Just remember, everyone can think a little deeper and be more creative.”

Adam L. Treasure was issued a citation for operating a snowmobile under the influence of alcohol after being flown to Advocate Condell Medical Center in Libertyville with injuries that were not life threatening.
Treasure was found injured by another snowmobiler, lying on the ground near a trail located in the 6800 block of McCullom Lake Road at around 2:15 a.m. Wednesday, according to a news release. The passerby then transported Treasure by snowmobile to Wonder Lake Fire Station No. 1 for help.
Flight for Life later flew Treasure to the Libertyville hospital.
Treasure was heading east on a trail in that area when for unknown reasons he left the trail and was ejected from his snowmobile, police said.

ADVERTISEMENTThis is a bit long. It's another of my HistoNet replies that says, "You must know what you're using, because if you don't you might end up in the brown & sticky." What is Penfix? If it's different from formaldehyde it will probably have different effects on the structure of cells and other parts of the tissue, and on the results obtained with different staining methods. It is important to know what you are working with, and how it works. Formaldehyde has many faults and is rarely used correctly (especially in busy pathology labs), but its actions are pretty well understood, and its shortcomings should be easily recognized by the person examining the stained slides. The same is true of the ingredients of other fixatives that have been around for many years. I'm not claiming that all older fixatives are good; many of them are much worse than formalin. My point is that it's essential to know what the fixative does to the tissue. No other part of the processing procedure has a greater effect on the fine structure or on staining properties with dyes, antibodies etc. Does the label on the Penfix bottle tell you what's in it, and how much of each ingredient? If it does, you're paying for someone else to mix it instead of making your own - nothing wrong with that if you've got the money. If the ingredients are a trade secret can you ever justify using it? No good journal would accept a paper when the results had been influenced by some mixture whose composition was unknown to the authors. And imagine the pathologist, being sued for a wrong diagnosis, explaining to the judge that "No, your honour, I don't know whether I'd have got it right after formalin or Bouin. We were trying this new stuff that the sales rep said was better ..." There is an intermediate condition, where a fixative mixture is semi-secret, with the active ingredients revealed and their mode(s) of action explained by the manufacturer, but without enough information about concentrations or minor components to allow a lab worker to make the stuff from scratch. Anatech's "Prefer" is an example of this type. The rationale and principal ingredient are adequately explained but the MSDS sheet makes it quite clear that the detailed composition is an undisclosed trade secret. Some "proprietary" zinc-formaldehyde mixtures may also come in this category but in this case there is no shortage of published mixtures, including one from 1895 that's only 2 or 3 years younger than the first use of formaldehyde in microtechnique. Please not that this is not an attack on Penfix, which I hadn't heard of before the recent exchange of HistoNet emails. It may well be an excellent product, and if its manufacturers monitor this newsgroup they will surely send us an account of what their product is. I hope they'll also send something to a peer-reviewed journal. Proper publication could only help their cause and increase their sales. John A.

A Washington Standoff and a London Scandal Lead the News
The continuing drama over the debt standoff in Washington last week drove coverage of the economy to its second highest mark in 2011, eclipsing covering of the presidential campaign. Press attention to the scandal surrounding Ruper Murdoch’s media empire doubled in the past week.
Debt Limit Fight Tops News Interest, Coverage
An overwhelming majority of Americans agree that the debate over the nation’s debt limit is important to people like themselves (90%), while nearly seven-in-ten (68%) say it is interesting.
Assessing a New Landscape in Journalism
Institutions and funders have been moving to fill the gap being left by shrinking newsrooms by backing non-profit news sites. Roughly half of these sites produce news that is clearly ideological in nature.
Public Split Evenly on Urgency of Debt Limit Deadline
Most Republicans say that it will not be a major problem if the debt ceiling is not raised by Aug. 2, while the balance of opinion is the reverse among Democrats.We are no longer talking in hypothetical terms. The Connectional Table voted to recommend the following items (click here to see the full PowerPoint report):
- Redirect Use of Apportionments - The General Conference shall authorize the Board of Directors of the United Methodist Center for Connectional Mission and Ministry to determine during the 2013-2016 quadrennium the most effective ways to fulfill the mission of the UMC including programs and spending at all levels of the church. The Board shall evaluate spending across the seven general church funds to assess work in order to identify significant opportunities for improved effectiveness and for achieving efficiencies and economies. Following this assessment and evaluation, the Board of Directors shall recommend for joint approval by the Advisory Board and the Council of Bishops a plan for reallocation of funding goals for each of the seven general church funds and for redirecting spending plans for a sum up to $60 million in the 2013- 2016 quadrennium for purposes related to the overall work of the UMC and the adaptive challenge. The first $5 million shall be allocated to young people’s lay leadership development, administered through the Division on Ministry with Young People or its successor body. The second $5 million shall be allocated to Central Conference theological education, administered through the General Board of Higher Education and Ministry's Global Theological Education Fund or its successor body.
- Guaranteed Appointment of Clergy - Make necessary changes in policy and practice to allow for a just, reasonable, and compassionate process that provides for the transition of low performing clergy from the itinerancy. The Ministry Study Commission will be bringing legislation to this effect, which the Connectional Table affirmed.
- General Agency Realignment - Realign most general agency functions with an emphasis on blending key competencies. Ten of the agencies would be consolidated as the Center for Connectional Mission and Ministry governed by a Board of Directors comprised of 15 people and elected by an Advisory Board (the name of the Advisory Board is not yet determined). The Advisory Board shall be composed of 45 people who represent the diversity and inclusiveness of the UMC. The Center for Connectional Mission & Ministry will be led by an Executive General Secretary elected by the Board of Directors.
- United Methodist Publishing House (UMPH) and the General Board of Pensions and Health Benefits (GBOPHB) - Formation of a special study task group with expertise specifically related to the publishing and/or pension investment and health care industries appointed jointly by the Board of Directors and the Council of Bishops. Their assignment is to review the organizational structures and business models with the Boards of UMPH and GBOPHB to determine the optimal structures that will allow each to best serve the church and their respective missions while remaining viable and self-funding.
- Denomination-Wide Financial Analysis - Designate a General Conference task force to focus on total spending across the whole of the United Methodist Church and begin with careful examination and comparison of annual conference fundraising and spending; analyzing allocations and areas of expense at all levels of the church, looking for best practices and potential for combining activity to reduce costs and giving high visibility to best practices.
These recommendations are meant to help us fulfill our mission to make disciples of Jesus Christ for the transformation of the world. They are not meant to throw the denomination into chaos, but to help us understand how we make changes to be more effective in ministry. I've read blogs and comments posted online that challenge every part of this plan from evaluating clergy performance and clergy compensation, to questioning how a board of directors could be diverse enough to represent the entire denomination. I've also seen questions about evaluating bishops and guaranteed appointments. I've heard the challenge of showing the theological underpinnings to these recommendations. I would like to thank each person who is making the effort to raise these important questions. While the Connectional Table, in collaboration with the Council of Bishops, has set the process in motion, it will take all of us in faithful conversation to discern where the Spirit of God is leading us.
The next steps for many of these recommendations will be legislative proposals for the 2012 General Conference to consider. Yet the signs of movement toward the adaptive challenge, “To redirect the flow of attention, energy, and resources to an intense concentration on fostering and sustaining an increase in the number of vital congregations effective in making disciples of Jesus Christ for the transformation of the world,” are many. There is indeed a fresh wind of the Spirit blowing across our church, generating changed hearts and minds.
As I have written in the past, these are on-going conversations and the Connectional Table welcomes your input and dialogue as we move through these uncharted waters.
Good post. Here you shared nice information. This will help me in future.
Appointment Setting
It would help if there were true intent of the governing council to have a vital congregation and to respect their opinions. As a resigned member of an SPRC which is mistrusted almost throughout the ministry and for just cause. Pastors choose Chair persons that will fall in line and do their bidding. Then the wonder why the congregation doesn't trust them! Pastors with the full support of the District Superintendent keep members in the fold with characteristics unbecoming a normal person much less a man of the cloth. When a point of order about hiring and employee problems it is the old hope it will go away and refusing to look into the real problem. My experience when a problem is brought up it to sugar coat and make sure all feel comfortable, and when someone objects "Well he certainly is wrong". People are in charge of the Methodist church that have never in their life signed a paycheck, never employed people, and are basically above all this menial work. And when you continue to ask questions you are subjected to yelling and insults that I found totally unbelievable and unacceptable for today's Christians. Not to even take on the new problems we are facing. We have a declining membership, over 15%; and we wonder why. Obviously the mirror is an image we don't want to take into consideration. Our minister has a record of a loss in membership of actual members of over 500; as we have on the rolls over 1000 and we have actual attendees of around 300 give or take. It is a sad sad world when the Methodist hierarchy and other appointed officials treat their congregation as if they are uninformed. They might try remembering that the funds they receive are from people that have hired and managed successful businesses and understand that if they ran their businesses as the ill equipped Pastors they would be bankrupt. I mean Pastors should be considered Spiritual leaders as they are not qualified to be Business leaders.
Even with all that it is hard for me to conceive anyone thinking they can force a congregation into the fold. Most I think would gladly follow someone qualified on their godly journey. Not those that cannot take criticism or handle people the way they would like to be taken.

This ain’t Jacksonville, Ange. Trust me. Welcome to a hyper-scrutiny you’ve never seen before. A world of memes and themes and perceptions that I can tell you’ve not come to realize. I hope you’re ready for the hate and the jokes and the scrutiny and the mean-spirited viciousness that come with the territory. Keep in mind as well that the public has the attention span of a gnat. It shifts attention instantaneously. On a dime. While Zimmerman’s initial “obvious” criminal exposure and culpability was the talk of the virtual town, that may not be the case now.
Fame. I want to live forever. In her pathetic introduction to the world, Corey introduced herself to the point of exhaustion. Even Jon Stewart’s 600 writers picked up on it. It was “Look at me, world. Ange has got the floor and is ready for her closeup, Mr. DeMille.” She hit Zimm with second degree murder. Wow. Are you sure about that, Ange? Second degree murder?! Even Trayvon’s mother called it accident, though that was immediately corrected via Twitter as a “mischaracterization” of the events by her legal eagle, the equally clueless Ben Crump, who sure as hell is no Ben Matlock. (I know, the latter’s not real. Check.)
Look at me, I’m in tatters. And in the mean time, our country along with the childlike imps that inhabit the TV world will continue to reduce this case to race. Anything but its juridical truth.

Recently a fellow beauty blogger friend of mine who participates in link roundups – like I do – was hit with a manual Google Penalty for ‘incoming unnatural links.’ When she asked what the cause was, Google told her one of her link roundups. As you can imagine, this caused quite a flurry of discussion among us bloggers. What do you do? Are Link Roundups Obsolete? Should you stop participating?
My recommendation on what you should do is still participate if you enjoy them. However, you should set the links to no-follow so that there is no risk of incurring a Google Penalty. I use a WordPress Plugin called Yoast, which allows me to easily set all links in a post to no-follow. I went and manually edited any post that I thought could be potentially problematic on my blog because of this.
How to Manually Set a Link to No-Follow
To set that manually, all you need to do is add <a rel=”nofollow” href=”URL”>Name of Link</a>
But what about groups that create original content and share each other’s links? Are those likely to incur a Google Penalty?
While they’re not likely to incur a penalty, it’s still better to play it safe rather than be sorry.
If you participate in a group that is like my Makeup Wars or Beauty Top Tens, use something like InLinkz to add your links. I absolutely love doing Makeup Wars and Beauty Top Tens. Everyone creates a post based on a theme and then using InLinks we all link to each others’ posts. I use the WordPress InLinkz plugin, which makes it easy to add the code to my site. There’s also code for Blogger and other non-Wordpress sites. InLinkz automatically makes links no-follow. It also allows you to upload an image – such as your logo or one from the post – as a thumbnail. It’s easy to use and it looks good on your blog.
No, I don’t think Link Roundups are obsolete, but I think that everyone needs to be mindful of Google’s stance on linking to each other. Even though you may think it is a natural link, it may come across as unnatural to Google. Because of that, it’s probably better to use no-follow with your links.
Do you participate in any link roundups? How do you handle this issue?

Got news? Email us at newsdesk@drownedinsound.comFONTANA - Some doctors testified Jon Christopher Blaylock believes he's a member of Dutch royalty and that prison guards are out to kill him.
Others said he's an inmate who has learned to manipulate the system, faking medical issues and causing court delays.
Jurors decided Wednesday the latter explanation was closer to the truth.
Blaylock was deemed mentally competent Wednesday and criminal proceedings were reinstated against him. He will stand trial for the Jan. 10, 2005 murder of Manuel Gonzalez, a correctional officer at California Institution for Men in Chino.
The trial resumes Jan. 11.
"Even on his best days, he can't get off his delusions about correctional officers," said Mario Martinez, one of Blaylock's two attorneys.
Gonzalez, 44, of Whittier had allowed Blaylock out of his cell in an attempt to quell racial tensions inside the prison just before he was stabbed.
Blaylock is charged with fatally stabbing Gonzalez four times. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.
The case has faced numerous delays through the years, in part because prosecutors improperly obtained Blaylock's confidential psychological records. Much of the San Bernardino County District Attorney's Office was recused from the case as a result.
Despite a ruling by Superior Court Judge Ingrid Uhler in 2007 that there was enough evidence to hold Blaylock over for trial, proceedings didn't begin until October.
And in order for Blaylock to be found mentally competent enough to stand trial, jurors had to decide whether Blaylock understands the proceedings, can assist his defense attorneys in the case and grasps the consequences of the charges, among other issues.
Martinez described Blaylock as a man whose delusions about correctional officers would hinder his ability to help in his own defense.
"You're talking about someone who for the last 26 years has spent less than a year outside of prison," he said.
Martinez acknowledged that Blaylock's mental issues - which include delusional disorder and anti-social personality disorder - wax and wane, giving him periods of lucidity. He also said that medications have helped his conditions.
"But it doesn't cure the delusions. They're still there," Martinez said.
Deputy District Attorney Carolyn Youngberg argued that Blaylock was competent enough to stand trial because he understands the charges he's facing, he knows the attorneys on both sides, and is aware that he could receive the death penalty.
Youngberg said the doctors hired by the defense provided testimony that backs up arguments made by Blaylock's attorneys - but that came with a high price tag.
One doctor, Youngberg said, earned more than $12,000 for his testimony, and the doctor only spent 45 minutes with the defendant.
"Be critical of expert testimony," she said.
Blaylock has not testified in his defense.
Youngberg said he provided statements made by Blaylock to doctors that show he's able to make rational statements.
While describing his reaction to several medications, Blaylock said, "I don't have anger flashes. I don't have depression or anxieties. I have good judgment and reasoning skills."
She says that Blaylock is able to have a normal conversation when he wants to.
"He has shown that when he doesn't get his way, he will manipulate people and the system," she said.

Degree of difficulty is the name of the game in diving, however, and the harder the dive is that you learn and attempt in competition, the greater the reward is if you succeed.

Check out Smart & Final. The one near me has several (really large) bottles of shave ice syrups.
Don't know where you are, but if you have a Mitsuwa or a Marukai near you they will carry Japanese shave ice syrups. 99 Ranch might have them, but I've never thought to look in the Chinese focused markets for this sort of thing.
I prefer the flavors found at Marukai which includes the Malolo brand. Malolo has been around since time began in Hawaii and replicates probably the most authentic shave ice flavors around. BTW, the terminology used in Hawaii is called "shave ice" not "shaved ice" otherwise it's called a snow cone.
More expensive flavored syrups in 750ml bottles are Torrani (about $4/bottle at Smart & Final and Cost Plus), Monin (about $8-10/bottle, at Surfas), and Sonoma (REALLY expensive, also at Surfas). These aren't what you'll find in New Orleans or Hawaii (although they do use Monin syrups at the shave ice stand on the beach at the Four Seasons Maui!), and theyprobably aren't cost-effective if you're trying to run a snowball stand, but for our home use we keep a bunch of different flavors around and enjoy mixing them up.
Korean grocery stores carry them too, so if you're near K-town, check it out. If on westside, there is a small (but great) Japanese grocery store called Nijiya (Sawtelle at Olympic) which carries it too. "Japanese" syrup flavors are usually melon, strawberry, maybe lemon. You can buy the powdered green tea and make a green tea one too. Yum. I think they're a lot cheaper than the Torani ones, but the Torani syrups have tons of flavors and are fairly ubiquitous (World Market, etc.).We created Pandora to put the Music Genome Project directly in your hands

I may have moved from Colorado, but I left my heart with the Humane Society of Moffat County.
As such, I was privileged to design its calendar for 2008 along with the assistance of Carol Scott and Jennifer Martinson's with the pictures. Without their commitment, this project would not have been possible.
The HSMC spends thousands of dollars each year on the abused and abandoned cats and dogs of Moffat County with spaying and neutering, vaccinations, and testing so that they can be transported to no-kill shelters rather than face euthanization. The calendar sale is a major fundraiser for the organization.
Now it is your turn to do your part.
First, spay and neuter the animals in your household. Second, buy calendars for yourself and as presents for your relatives and friends, near and far. Third, contact your city councilmen and county commissioners that Craig and Moffat County needs to have its own shelter.
If that were to happen, people who discover they cannot care for pets would be able to relinquish them to the shelter rather than to abandon them and hope for the best. At the present time the city rents space from a local veterinary hospital and will only pay for 8 to 10 days of care.
That is not a lot of time to find a new home. Kelly Hepworth ends up paying a lot out of his own pocket to assist the HSMC in transporting the animals out of the county. Fourth, volunteer. They are in dire need of transfer drivers.
So do your part.
Be a responsible pet owner by spaying and neutering. Support your local humane society by purchasing calendars and/or donating. Donations are tax deductible and may be sent to HSMC, POB 1587, Craig, CO 81626.

Woman's Body Found in Franklin County ReservoirMULKEYTOWN, Ill. (AP) - Franklin County officials say the body of a 35-year-old woman has been pulled from the New Christopher Reservoir.
The (Carbondale) Southern Illinoisan reports that Coroner Marty Leffler identified the woman as Amanda Louise Harvill. He says Harvill's body was visible near her 1999 Dodge pickup truck, which was partly submerged near the reservoir's boat ramp.
A passerby saw the truck and called police around 8:25 a.m. Sunday. Authorities say the truck's driver's side door was open.

Woollard, John and Selby, Cynthia (2012) TDA TiLT research grants 2010-11. Research into ICT to support computing in education: 10 projects – the online surveys. Southampton, GB, Training and Development Agency (Submitted)
Download
Description/Abstract
This TDA funded report describes the challenges and affordances of introducing computing into the initial teacher training of ICT teachers. It reflects upon the experiences of 10 recipients of the Technology in Teaching and Learning (TiLT) research grants. The data is collected through online surveys at the start and near the completion of the activities. Five projects are identified that reflect 5 different models of approach to integrating computing activities into initial teacher training in ICT – these are reported separately. They enable institutions to consider the model of approach most appropriate for their context.
Key themes emerging from the survey analysis are:
• Programming is perceived to be a key element of computing provision.
• Practical computing actives can be embedded in classroom experiences.
• Without a defined Computing Curriculum, training providers are not confident of exactly what subject knowledge should be presented.
• A narrow focus on individual skills, such as programming or manipulation of databases, may result in the neglect of broader computing concepts, such as abstraction, decomposition, or generalisation.
• For those trainees with applicable degree or industry knowledge, there should be differentiation in delivery and material.
• Trainees reveal concerns about their lack of specific computing subject knowledge when beginning the initial teacher training and question their ability to master programming to a Key Stage 3 level.

'Catholic Advocate' shares thoughts on issues facing Catholic voters
CHARLOTTE — This is a presidential election year, and the race leading up to the November vote promises to be contentious. Issues of life, religious liberty and the possible redefinition of marriage are on the table on both the state and national level.
Pictured: Bishop Peter J. Jugis visited Feb. 10 with Dr. Deal Hudson (left) and Matt Smith of Catholic Advocate. The lay Catholic lobbying organization, based in Washington, D.C., encourages Catholics to get active in the political process and to support elected officials and policies that are in line with Church teaching. (SueAnn Howell, Catholic News Herald)
Dr. Deal Hudson, chairman of Catholic Advocate, a political activist organization based in Washington, D.C., is working to awaken Catholics and people of good will to rise above the rhetoric and educate themselves about the issues and the candidates, and compare what is promised to traditional American values and, for Catholics especially, what our faith teaches so that we can vote accordingly.
On a recent trip to Charlotte Feb. 10, Hudson met with Bishop Peter J. Jugis to discuss the work of Catholic Advocate in this election year. Hudson, a Catholic convert, professor, author and political activist, also shared his thoughts with the Catholic News Herald in an exclusive interview. Excerpts from that interview follow:
CNH: What is "Catholic Advocate?"
Hudson: Catholic Advocate is an organization that Matt Smith and I founded to encourage more Catholics to be politically involved as Catholics, to be involved in what we call a 'faithful way.' We have a very simple approach. The Church very clearly teaches that there is a hierarchy of issues in politics, beginning with life and marriage, and that we should make our political judgments in accord with that hierarchy. This involves not just judgment of specific candidates but legislation, which all of course builds culture. We would like to build a culture of life.
We get reports about Catholic voters doing this and doing that and sometimes it's discouraging that Catholic voters will support things that are opposed to Church teaching, or that specific members of Congress who are Catholic will oppose things – and there are lots of reasons for this. But one of the main reasons is that the Catholic laity don't demand that their representatives who call themselves Catholic represent what the Church teaches.
I've always said that our work at Catholic Advocate will be done when 100 percent of the Catholic members of the United States Congress have a pro-life voting record and consistently defend marriage as between a man and a woman.
CNH: What are the key issues facing Catholic voters?
Hudson: Once you get off the list of settled issues which are things like life, marriage, euthanasia and fetal stem-cell research, you start making prudential judgments. People don't always understand the simple distinction between what a settled issue is and what a prudential issue is. We sometimes call a settled issue a "non-negotiable," but that doesn't have any resonance in the Catholic tradition. But "settled" does.
One reason people don't have that distinction is because it's not talked about enough. The word prudential itself, from the Latin "prudentia," is kind of a fancy word. It's a virtue, one of the four natural virtues. It means the ability to apply a first principal to a specific situation. For example, the Church teaches us to care for others, to love the stranger. So you take immigration and the issue of the undocumented immigrant. Well, the prudential challenge is to translate what loving others, caring for the stranger means when you pass laws and create programs.
Most issues in politics are prudential. Most issues in politics we're not obliged to follow one specific solution or another. All the issues about the budget and foreign policy, etc. you have to have a sense of what your first principals are and what is the best solution on the table...
One of the challenges we face is being truly non-partisan, being Catholic first...
Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could get to the point in politics in America where both parties were strongly pro-life and strongly pro-marriage and we were arguing about other things? Where we could focus on what is the best kind of approach to the budget, to reduce the deficit...we could talk about all these prudential matters in a more profound way because we're not expending energy fighting these basic moral battles over protection of life and protection of marriage.
CNH: How is Catholic Advocate making a difference in the political process?
Hudson: Catholic Advocate is an independent c3, c4 and political action committee (PAC). It's typical of a Washington political organization to have all three. We have an arm that is educational (c3), and arm that is c4 which is the biggest part which means we can support specific issues and specific candidates, and we have a PAC that allows us to give money to specific candidates.
It's unusual to do this under the name Catholic, but if you read through the Catechism and encyclicals on the obligations of Catholics to be involved in politics, there is no limit, we are encouraged to be fully engaged to have all the expertise and to educate our children to be involved in politics.
My first choice in life is not to be involved in politics. My first choice in life is ideas, beauty...I became a Catholic because of the beauty of the Church...I'd much rather watch classic films or listen to classical music than to talk to people about politics. But God opened doors for me unexpectedly and I was asked to do a job and I'm doing it...I really like defending America and the role of the Catholic Church in America and trying to rebuild our culture toward something healthier for our children.

On 9 July, the day South Sudan
declared independence, Nilepet and Glencore sealed a
joint-venture agreement establishing Petronile International.
At the time, Glencore and South Sudans energy ministry
said the venture would market a portion of South Sudans
375,000 barrels a day of crude output.
Today, however, South Sudans
director-general of petroleum, Arkangelo Okwang Oler a
signatory to the joint-venture agreement told reporters:
We have not mandated Glencore to market our oil. They
[Glencore] are not mandated to sell the crude of the
south.
The dispute appears to centre on the
sale of volumes of royalty oil, rather than the equity
production Nilepet holds through its stakes in consortia
producing from South Sudans fields. The exact volume of
oil under dispute could not be ascertained. But South
Sudans total daily production is worth around $40 million
a day to the new nation with Brent crude trading in the
region of $110 a barrel.
Okwang was not immediately available
for comment. But a spokesman from the South Sudan Ministry of
Mines and Energy said: This deal doesn't allow Glencore
to market the governments entitlement oil; the company
may deal only with NilePets entitlements.
He did not give further
clarification. No one at Nilepet was available for comment.
Glencore, however, claims the
joint-venture agreement covers both royalty and equity
production. The trader, which listed in London through an $11
billion initial public offering in May, said the joint-venture
terms make it clear that Petronile International is
responsible for marketing the states and Nilepets
crude oil.
Lual Deng, a southerner who was,
until independence, Sudans oil minister, said he
understood oil marketing was the responsibility of the South
Sudanese oil ministry. By signing the joint-venture agreement,
he said, Nilepet may have exceeded its authority.
But, added Glencore: The
[joint-venture] agreement was signed in Juba by the managing
director of Nilepet [Mangok Kali Mangok] and Arkangelo Okwang
from the energy ministry.

- re: Chemicalkinetics
- re: JavaBean
:) I always like my petty. I just didn't get a huge boost from using a petty vs a paring, but that may has to do with the fact that I don't use my paring knife all that often to begin with. Recently, I was using my petty to peel and to cut up my rather large Korean pears. It was nice that I can both peel and partition the pears. Previously, I would peel with a paring knife, and then cut it up with a Chef's knife or a Chinese cleaver. A paring knife is a bit too small for cutting it up.

Thanks Chem! The 'shaped blank' pic shows the curve of the blade (not a lot of curve, but not straight like a nakiri). No, I'm using two different grinders, & I could really use a third! :-D But really, I think a metal-cutting bandsaw is going to be needed.

Thanks JavaBean! It's been a longer process getting to this point than I expected. (What's this "work/life balance" thing I keep hearing about?)
A few years ago I bought a small grinder & have been doing knife repairs & modifications with it. It's great for that, but it's really too small to do complete shaping from raw steel stock. This bigger grinder was made from plans I bought. I had to purchase all of the steel & hardware bits & cut/drill/tap everything myself. Of course, not everything fit together the way it was supposed to, & I ended up redesigning some of the parts & layout myself. I also had to learn more about the electrical side of things when I burned out a switch due to inadequately wiring the motor. I'm happy to share any info on the eqpt, just ask!
Yes, this first piece was solely to understand what I was up against for grinding & shaping, as well as a first-time handle attachment. The steel was junk & not worth the time to heat treat. (It would only take a surface harden anyway.)
I don't have the necessary eqpt to properly control heat treating, so that's the one process I'll have someone else do.
- re: Eiron
I'm kind of close to completing a major thinning project, but I spent over three hours total, spread over several weekends using just stones. It took way longer than I had planned, and wouldn't want to do again unpowered. I'm thinking some sort of adjustable speed belt sander, or wet grinder to handle the initial coarse work would have made things much easier.
For future references, what did yours cost (ballpark)? How hard was it to DIY, did it need any welding?
- re: JavaBean
Wow, that sounds like a lot of work to do on stones! (I know CBAD has done similar projects on stones.) I'm not sure you'd need anything with variable speeds to do what you want. Most of the wet grinders I've seen look too small (to me) to do thinning on. I'd want something with the stone positioned horizontally, to give me a surface like flat stones, so that I didn't introduce a hollow grind into the knife. Maybe something like these:-......
Otherwise, I think a simple 1"x??" belt machine would be enough. If you're only going to use it occasionally, then Hobo Freight's 1"x30" model is the best deal: $50 normal price, $40 on sale, & $32 after their 20%-off coupons.
Fun 1x30 link here:
If you think you'll want to use it often, then I'd suggest going with a 1"x42" model instead. The motors are better, the belts last longer, & you have a wider selection of grits & finishing belts. The best deal I found was Viel Tool's DIY kit for $90, but that assumes you already have a motor to use with it:...
If not, I'd recommend Kalamazoo's 1SM model:...
This is what I bought. It's got a much better motor (for the same price) than what I would've put on the Viel, & it came ready to run. However, the Viel has more sharpening accessories made for it, so that may be more important to you.
My 2x72 DIY grinder cost me about $600 total (giving me the slack belt, platen, & tool rest attachments), & I can expand the system with other attachments for relatively little money. Oh, & it took me over a year to build. :-) (In all fairness, the plans say you can do this in a weekend. I think that's possible, as long as you have everything you need to cut/drill/tap/grind/deburr/clean all of the steel, & all of the electrical components to wire everything together, & an entire uninterrupted weekend to work with. I didn't...)
But, this DIY model replaces a $2,000-$2,500 "Knife Maker's Grinder" from Beaumont Metal Works. There's no welding required, & you can get away cheaper than what I did if you're willing to make your own drive/tracking/idler wheels. Or if you make fewer attachments.
Nothing was very difficult about it, but if you've only got an hour here or there it can be a frustrating project. Also, since I don't have a workshop, I had to use some space at a friend's house. That meant setting everything up every time I went over, & then cleaning up & putting everything away every time I was done. That added lots of extra hours compared to having your own place to work & being able to simply leave everything & pick back up where you left off.
The way I figger it, when I finally get my first 'real' knife made, it will have only cost me about $1,200 & 2 yrs of 'free' project/hobby hours.
:-D
Eiron - she's looking very promising. I've always been impressed with your woodwork. Any knife in particular giving you your inspiration for the profile, shape, grind, etc, you're aiming for? Is the grind assymetrical?
Reading this makes me happy.
Also, since I haven't been posting, I just wanted to say hi to all my old knife mafia friends and let you guys know I'm alive and well.
- re: cowboyardee
- re: cowboyardee
Hey CBAD, thanks! This first practice knife wasn't anything more than just "How am I gonna do this?" As for the future, I've been keeping a mental list of things I want in a knife, but I have limited hands-on experience with very many 'ultimate' examples. The past several years of sharpening & repairing have given me a close look at what makes different knives 'work' for different applications, so that helps me determine what I do & don't want.
Shape: I'll probably end up with one of everything! :-D But seriously, I have a 'generic' shape for several styles & I'll probably modify each one to my tastes.
Profile: I'll shoot for a slight convex profile from spine to edge for easier food release.
Grind: Either scandi or convex, I haven't decided. (Any votes?) And most likely symmetrical.
Woodwork: Thanks again! So far, everyone who's handled the practice knife has said, "That feels really good!" And that's been very encouraging to me, since I've always complained about knife handles.
How's the baby? And everyone else?

- re: taos
But is "nothing" really " nothing or is it something"?
Are you implying that Eiron has finally achieved the enlightenment of Taoism (given your name) or Zen?
 predates the Buddhist Shunyata philosophy of "form is emptiness, emptiness is form" by half a millennium."...AnimeSuki Forums

She gave that chance up even when the Terminal was available as an external force to assist her. Now, we learned from the side stories that certain ORB families do maintain, in addition to their existing political influences, private armies! This includes Yuna. The way Cagali was handling the situation was obviously not beneficial to ORB in any way.
Its obvious that at a time of war, a country is strongest when united. But for ORB? That simply wasn't the case. When you have internal factions that disagree with each other and on the brink of a civil war, we have a probelm.
It's not that simple. They rebuilt Orb. It must have cost a lot, and Cagalli probably spent quite a lot of her political credit demanding the necessary sacrifices. That's what forced her into an alliance with the Seiran.
As for using Terminal - a decidedly Plant affiliated organisation - to bolster her power... What would you think of a ruler using a foreign army to enforce her authority? There's a recipe for revolt if I ever saw one. Besides, Terminal's built for spying and small actions. Not occupation. And even without going that far, just using Lacus as a political advisor... there would be delicate balances involved.?
Personally, I'd have chosen Plant. Maybe Cagalli would have, too. But she was seemingly outvoted (how much power did the Seirans have anyway?). What was she to do?
Quote:
Well, I did say "She knew about it, but only after Andy reported it to her."
Perhaps I should also add that Andy also 'suggested' to her certain 'projects' we witnessed in GSD. Andy's involvement shouldn't be surprising. I am simply pointing out to the fact that it was not solely Lacus who was behind everything. I'd argue that the actual overseer of the 'Terminal' build up was actually Andy, not Lacus.
Lastly, Andy gave her the keys, but its up to her to hide it. So if Andy didn't know where the keys were, well, he wasn't supposed to.

IMO, she knew before they did anything. She approved of it..

And its not just the Seirans, there were other families too. Why the Feddies, I have no idea, although Yuna was probably a Blue-Cosmos sympathizer.

It might just as easily spurred an invasion without getting them an alliance. For example, the EA might have seen it as a challenge, while Plant saw it as a strictly EA-Orb affair, and a danger to their avowed peace seeking approach.

Uh. Saying "if one of you annoys me I'll get with the other one" isn't the same as offering an unconditional alliance..
Quote:

Yes, that's what I'm wondering - how many of those families were controlled by the Seirans? They must have been the leader of some big faction, which is why Cagalli was in bed with them.
Quote:

Probably. He must also have estimated they had the greater chances of coming out on top, which should have been a dead give away the EA was going to lose badly...

"Final say" far outweighs "suggestion". Maybe Andy suggested it and maybe he didn't. Maybe he took care of the details and maybe he didn't. It doesn't matter one bit. Neither did her "reluctance". She chose. That's what matters.

Nonetheless, she missed the chance, and allow everything to disperse over time.
Yes, I do admit I may sound like I am trying to promote a dictator out of her, because what I am offering is a strong-arms tactic. But IMO, its a possible solution. What she did at the end of SEED hardly solved any existing problems of ORB.

Uhh, I was referring to Yuna's alliance with the Feddies. He done it without a second thought. I said:
"Surely, both PLANT and EA weren't pushing their options with ORB, but if ORB offered their allegiance without being asked for it, who wouldn't want it?"
In other words, if ORB offered their allegiance to either side, why would PLANT or the Feddies reject the offer?

Yet, what ORB forgot to do, besides holding on against overwhelming odds in the last war, was to proclaim to EA the possibilities of an ORB-PLANT alliance. Instead, they chose complete neutrality.
Although I also have to admit, allying with PLANT might not have been in ORB's best interest in the long-run.

Her leadership nonewithstanding. I was not talking about Lacus' status as a 'leader'. I simply pointed out the possibilities that it was Andy who was better suited to orchestrate everything Terminal had in GSD. Lacus might have given OKs, but I was making a case against Eidolon Sniper, who argued that 'Lacus built everything', because without Andy, Lacus would probably have nothing.

What I understand about being the black sheep of the family is, Cagalli is none whatsoever like her father in ideals and have rather weird ideals of her own which is a complete 360 degree turnaround like her father's own ideals. The fact that she upheld her father's ideals at the end...
Quote:
I have been digging through sources lately, checking Japanese blogs here and what not. Then I came across an interesting theory... and I kept on wondering why I did not think of it earlier.
Fingers are pointing to Andy as the culprit behild rebuilding the Freedom. And why not? The Freedom was hidden in his house, he had the skills and Lacus' finances to rebuild the Freedom, not to mention he knew how to best maintain the machine. GSD never once suggested that it was Lacus who rebuild the Freedom. The keys were given to her due to the very obvious fact that she was the closest the Kira. Otherwise, why keep a hangerbay and the Freedom itself in Andy's house?
I was under the impression that it was not Andy's house but the orphanage where the Freedom was kept. And besides, why would even Andy think of rebuilding Freedom? As far as he was concerned that chapter in Jachin Due was through and he was living his own life peacefully in Orb.
Quote:
A. Oh yes, she was. She had been planning that for a while, but she had to make sure if Kira was the right choice.
Like how? Just by meeting him for like a couple of days?
Things could still get horribly wrong.
Quote:
B. She never said the Destiny Plan was evil when she first encountered the infamous 'note'. She simply stated something along the lines of "we must investigate this case further". Obviously, you either missed that part or deliberately chose to overlook it. However, as I have said many, many times before, it does help tremendously when Dully himself actually broadcasted that whole plan on public television.
It's just too convenient that Dullindal broadcasted the entire thing on TV now, isn't it?
If Dullindal didn't do anything like that, then her purpose of going against the new ZAFT regime would be naught and her "careful" planning could actually fall to pieces. Now, if the Destiny Plan was like introduced even way before that notebook appeared, let's say, she found that notebook before the Destroy incident, and then said that she would investigate it further, she could've probably had avoided that Impulse Freedom ep and concentrated her artillery on Dullindal himself. But the problem was the Destiny Plan was like introduced VERY late into the show already (like a couple of eps left before the grand finale) and so her stating of the VERY obvious (investigating this further) suddenly became salvaged by the fact that Dullindal hastily introduced the said plan to the world, when the audience also knew that the notebook about the Destiny Plan was like introduced that late also. I don't find anything really wrong with the Destiny Plan per se (though I still don't like the idea of set genes for proper jobs placement), but because it was introduced as the evil takeover plan of the evil madman so hastily, Lacus' assumption that it is evil already gave much oomph to her earlier doubts regarding her supposed "investigation of this case further" (call it divine intuition...) so her assumption just because of a little notebook that Dullindal is evil still stands. And it also seems that you have either overlooked the same episode wherein Andy just said that the assassins were "Coordinators" and the ASHs were "top quality MS" of ZAFT, still in development or what have you, and they suddenly have doubts that Dullindal wasn't someone to be trusted, solidified further when they saw Meer bouncing her way across the TV screen. He wasn't exactly using Lacus' image to brainwash the world to his bidding back then; it was a time when people in the PLANTs were in terrible confusion and they needed someone like Lacus who should tell them what to do, not feel afraid, etc. His intentions were probably noble because he just wanted to lift the Coordinators' spirits up with the help of Meer. Meer, as Lacus, wasn't also espousing real violence against people who do make their own lives miserable; instead she was just telling them to be steadfast in their hopes that this war would end and that she also advocates peace through the use of force (ZAFT), something which was very much like what Lacus did in the last Jachin Due war. But because of the (hasty) introduction of the Destiny Plan, Dullindal's motives in using Lacus' image became absolute evil, as Meer told the people that she does stand by Dullindal, etc., etc and so therefore Dullindal is also evil to the core.
So Lacus becomes right for stating the obvious right before the bombshell drops in on the entire CE. It was because of the supporting facts that could point that Dullindal is actually evil always happens right after she has doubts/or has misgivings; so it could be said that she is not saying straight out that Dullindal is evil, rather, she only has doubts that Dullindal is evil. But...her assumptions always turn out right, most conveniently, and it was done in such an "enlightening" manner that everybody in the CE revere her as their supreme omniscient GODDESS who could do no wrong, cannot be wrong, and is always right.
Quote:
And Lacus herself often admitted that she often took risks, dangerous ones.
Please do enlighten me.

I do.
And I don't. So that's settled.

Then what is? I watch Gundam not only for its mechnical wonders, but also its characters. Imo, the greatest Gundam stories knew how to combine character development, its machines and use war as a backdrop. And I see their combination as a couple has one of the highest synchronization values in anime.
I also watch anime shows because of its characters, but not really how boy A is going to get Girl B, etc., etc. I enjoy my shows by watching how they actually develop within the series and how they interact with the other characters in it, not just because they fell in love and have to be absolutely married by the time the last ending credits of that series roll by. Maybe it's because of this why I get infuriated sometimes by the adulation some fans express for their canon couples, maybe because like you they also enjoy whether or not the love team of the canon couple would survive the odds, instead of them watching and understanding what the story is actually about. Some fans do watch and understand the story, some fans just watch the couples, some fans watch the technology involved...I am not saying that you do not understand and appreciate the story as much as you appreciate the Kira Lacus tandem, I am merely saying that you do want this couple to end up together, like the entire story of how the circumstances made them closer to each other, and how these circumstances affect them and their interaction with the environment, plus a couple of awesome mechs thrown in.
But I do not seriously think that Kira and Lacus is the best couple of the CE. My hat is off to Cagalli and Athrun, somewhat, after my all time favorite Kira and Fllay. And that is saying much, since I do not like canon couples that well; I'm more agreeable to otherwise unconventional ones (like Athrun and Meyrin, Athrun and Meer, Kira and Cagalli [too bad they're siblings], and maybe fanfic in a sense Shinn and Fllay [in my opinion, their otherwise strong characters = relationship and it could get very very interesting much more so than what Kira and Lacus exhibit]). If you think they make the CE tick, then fine with me.
Quote:
And that hinders the progress of the story in what way? The story is over before the epilogue, and I simply wanted it to end on a good note.
But some fans don't really translate good note = their ending up together or whatever. Sometimes the adulations of the fans of this couple just tends to get too much in the spotlight rather than what the story or what the plot is all about; like screw the entire story and make them have babies by the next series kind of adulation, which is a bit alarming for me. Or saying that such and such was a very bad character and we have to see him or her out of the CE by next series, so on and so forth, either deliberately choosing to be blind to some of his or her good characteristics and instead choose to see the bad things that he or she does to the main characters, etc., etc. Ever wonder why a certain character's thread become flame wars? Sometimes the tension mostly comes from these kinds of fans, and so the topic becomes muddled up with fiery declarations and so mods need to shut them down as well. If you think that a good note = Kira and Lacus marrying each other, then fine with me. I am just merely expressing my own opinions on why I don't think so, as much as you are expressing your own opinions why you think so.
Quote:
You just confirmed what I said earlier. Once again, she failed to examine her options but chose the dumbest, most straight forward and most predictable course of the action. She did not once consult this with the third power, that meaning Terminal. She never once consulted this with Athrun, Kira or Lacus. She chose to be alone on that one, and almost committed political suicide along the way.
Cagalli simply wanted to do things her own, without trying to rely on anybody that much; she wants to be a great leader whom Orb will really respect for what she stands for and for what she really is. Too bad that Morosawa decided to make her character "bite the dust" so early in the series...and absolutely became the leader that she was at the end. For that, my hat is off to Cagalli.
Quote:
And what makes you think by marrying Yuna, she could have soldify her power? She already lost her power even as a fiance to Yuna.
Maybe she was choosing the lesser of the 2 evils? Orb and all that it stands for was literally at stake here, and she was powerless to do anything about it, so she decides to marry Yuna. For all the "leader" Yuna was he'd probably let Cagalli rule as a Seiran in order to make the Seirans' stand on Orb very well known, or what have you (bad), or let her keep Athha name and rule over Orb, with the Seirans very much in power having her at their beck and call (worse). But stiill, she would be able to protect the interests of Orb, notwithstanding the humiliation she would probably get if the EAF does decide to rule Orb and use Orb power in order to control the world (worst). Now who says Cagalli wouldn't become that powerful?
Cagalli is powerful in a sense that using Seiran power, she could still oversee Orb as its head representative (for all we know, if emirs marry in Orb and they marry the head representative, the spouses would have to take their spouses' last names or what have you), so if going by this case, Yuna will become an Athha and so maintain her power over Orb because she is the head representative and the Athha Yuna married.
Quote:
Yes, and because of her insistance on clinging to her father's ideals when she hardly exerted that much her influence herself that made her an utterly failed politician! And that is why she got shoved around by the likes of Yuna, all because she did not sieze power when she could! She already failed as a politician the day she chose to share power!
Sometimes sacrifices have to be made in order to protect her father's ideals,a nd that these sacrifices would teach her to become the best politician she could be in the coming years.
Quote:
That is why I compared ORB to the Holy Roman Empire, as the latter was reigned by multiple powerful families, and its emperor was nothing more than a voted representative.
But he still maintained his power over them by which he could use his now newfound power to turn against them (by rallying other people to his side and they could be foes of the family who voted him in the first place), use his rule to make them look really bad or what have you, etc., etc. That is why Cagalli with Seiran power could still be dangerous.
Quote:
Yet, no fair trial was given. No arrests made. Lacus' father wasn't running away, and was executed in his own home. I don't know about you, but I am not about to sit on my ass waiting for guns to be pointed at me.
And yes, no fair trial was also made when Shinn's family dies...
Seriously though, Zala had to do something because his ambitions were in great danger, so he had to off Clyne because of the mere fact that Clyne was going against his wishes and that he as the new Supreme Chairman was entitled to receive. He could have executed Clyne for his ideals that were clearly "treacherous" and "going against" the ZAFT that he, as the new chairman in power, wanted to be, and so brand Clyne as a traitor to ZAFT ideals as much as he could brand Lacus as a traitor to those very same ideals and it is just too convenient that she managed to hand over ZAFT's top secret weapon to a complete stranger and hijacked a pink flagship by means of her subordinate.
We're talking politics here. In true bloody politics fashion, nothing is really fair; you just have to survive.
Quote:
And yes, Zala did attempt to kill Lacus many times. He declared that intent rather clearly to Athrun.
Because of the "threat" she poses to ZAFT. And yes, because she was a traitor for turning over the weapon of her own country to a complete stranger.
Quote:
I do not believe that imprisonment was what Zala was considering...
In order to appease the people by justifying what he did was right, he would probably do it.
Quote:
She did just that, and guess what happened? PLANT-wide search, with order to "kill on spot".
Yep, she could hand Justice to another unwitting man on the street if ever.
Quote:
Oh did she just instantly became heir apprent? I don't think so. After the death of her father forced much of her father's former allies to disperse. No, she did not become heir apparent in an instant, she went and re-established the link her father had. She went and re-collect allies, new & old. And I need not mention the kind of situation she was going through at the time.
If she wasn't the heir apparent, those people whom you say she really went out to gather wouldn't even lift a finger to help her in her cause. So what if you're Lacus Clyne? You're NOT Siegel Clyne. Get over it. That would what they would probably say to her.
Quote:
Exhausting your options is not the same as 'making bad decisions all the way'. Cagali made a lot of bad decisions even while there were alternatives, while Lacus had few options to work with in the first place.
Frankly speaking, I believe Cagalli more so than I believe Lacus. She had to find her way among all those bad decisisons she made, and that it actually made her stronger as a character. With Lacus, there's hardly an effort to actually grow in depth as a character, as all her choices are sound and wise and right.
Quote:
Obviously because Athrun lost his Justice, and now 'suitless' while Kira destroyed his Freedom. What other options are there besides replacing them both in order to prepare for the upcoming war? Clearly speeches and dimplomacy at that point wasn't proving to be very effective.
Of course. They were the persons who made it that way in the FIRST place...
Quote:
Moreover, as I have stated earlier, it could have been Andy or even Murrue's idea for building replacement suits. Nowhere in Destiny suggested that it was Lacus' idea for building those suits. Thus explaining her reluctance when Kira asked her for the keys and later, the new Strike Freedom.
What would give Andy enough reason to rebuild Freedom? Only Lacus "foresight" could clearly provide an easy answer to this...
Quote:
We assumed it to be so because we associate the Eternal usually with Lacus. Yet, Andy had just as much influence over the Eternal and its crew as Lacus. After all, it was his ship.
No. What Lacus says is final. You could see how Andy was also looking up to Lacus in regarding decisions...
Quote:
Gee, and I wonder who that would be.
SIEG HEINE~~~!!!
Quote:
Special edition and manga state otherwise...
Well, it's just a "reworked" GSD, to the fans' preference.
And I believe Deacon Blues mentioned that it wasn't clearly stated in the Astray manga as well...>.<;; let me check his post again...
Quote:
And for all the fuss you are making about how Lacus instantly potined out the 'evils behind the destiny plan', Dully surely made it quite obvious when he broadcasted it on TV.
Lacus was just determining the obvious...
Quote:
I have no idea what you are asking here.
Andy <<<< Lacus.
Quote:
And both took different choices in approaching them. Cagali made her choice to share power (which almost led to her political suicide), while Lacus remained a less-influential third-power, but had political independence and freedom.
Less influential? Do not make me laugh.
Quote:
She does that alright, except serving on PLANT would have tilted the existing status quo, don't you think?
Why woud Lacus do that???
Quote:
And you know she did all that with what serving as evidence? Right, you don't have any.
Who the heck would have the capacity to do all those things? And who would have enough reason to do so?
Why could Lacus order custom MS for her knights and her personal forces? Why could Lacus "know" about Mendel and the little notebook (presuming that Lacus was already investigating Dullindal and must have heard about the Destiny Plan beforehand...Da Costa was very much surprised and seemed as if whatever he knew before was now solidified by the notebook)? And why else would she keep Eternal in hiding so that her new custom MS are ready to go once the war calls for the swords of peace again?

For all we know, it could have been Andy who was behind the whole thing. After all, he led a ZAFT occupation force on Earth for years. He controlled a completely operational military forward base, completely with factories, hangers, land-cruisers, not to mention a whole lot of mobile suits. Hell, it finally makes sense now, because Andy would have had the experience and knowledge for providing all the logistical coordination required for the Eternal and co. He was their best choice, a decorated war hero, and one of the most seasoned veterans in the CE universe.
So what? He wanted to live peacefully after the war, as much as everyone else did. But the problem with this point you're saying is that he hasn't been to PLANT as much as Lacus did in order to coordinate with Terminal, Factory because he knew he was quite wanted there. They may have operatives who send them messages every now and then, and most likely they report it all to Lacus, because Lacus has the means in order to bring Terminal and Factory to fruition, as much as she has the final say in what they do. Terminal was created after the last Jachin Due war and since Lacus knew of Terminal (and she was not surprised that there even WAS Terminal), she may have created it herself in order to monitor the goings on at the PLANTs. Since she also knew the technology goings on in the PLANTs via Terminal, she uses her money in order to create Factory and make up back up suits in case one of her swords falter in their divine deed. She doesn't need Andy because she has her connections with Terminal and that the Factory is peopled by CF members and are top engineers and what have you. She must have rebuilt Freedom because she knew the PLANTS and EA are still unstable (because of Terminal), and that she has the keys because she knew it would be her final say if they should go to war or not; if she hands it to Kira, he would only be more troubled. Andy may have been part of Terminal as well since he knew about the ASHs.
Quote:
Just because Lacus was Terminal's symbolic leader does not mean she had the capacity to do all that. She knew about it, but only after Andy reported it to her.
Symbolic leader?
Lacus is ITS LEADER. It was neve symbolic, because they do all report to her what they find out, and that she does have the means and the capacity to carry out such orders, and that what she says is always final.
Quote:
It was made more clear in GSD, when Lacus aboard the Eternal. While she was acting as an Admiral, it was Andy who handled all of the vessel's coordination.
I thought Admiral is the highest naval rank...?
Quote:
And Morosawa once mentioned that Athrun was her favorite character...
Poor Athrun.

.NEW YORK (MarketWatch) — U.S. stock futures rose on Tuesday, as worries about political unrest in the Middle East eased, while data from China also commanded attention and markets awaited comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke.
Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJH11 climbed 32 points to 12,246, while those for the Standard & Poor’s 500 index SPH11 added 4.70 points to 1,330.80.
Futures for the Nasdaq 100 index NDH11 gained 9.50 points to 2,360.25.
Obama, Ban Ki-moon discuss Libya
President Obama met with United Nations General Secretary Ban Ki-moon at the White House to discuss how to end the bloodshed in Libya.
Wall Street ended February on a higher note Monday, helped by upbeat personal-income data and deal activity.
The Dow Industrials DJIA, +0.00% rose 2.8% in February, the third straight monthly gain for the blue-chip barometer. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.23% and Nasdaq 100 COMP, +0.38% indexes also ended higher on Monday and for all of February.
“We are starting to see less sensitivity to ongoing geopolitical risks associated with North Africa and the Middle East, and this, in conjunction with the desire to continue to buy U.S. equities on any form of a dip, has helped to fuel the latest risk buying,” said Joel Kruger, strategist at Forex Capital Markets, in emailed comments.

Global economic data were also commanding attention on Tuesday, starting with Chinese manufacturing activity, which showed a softening in February, according to two surveys. See China factory activity losing momentum
“Additionally and ironically, the latest, softer PMI data out of China has also helped risk appetite, with some interpreting the weaker data as a potential [sign] that the People’s Bank of China will be less aggressive with their monetary tightening,” said Kruger.
At 10 a.m. Eastern time, U.S. ISM manufacturing data for February are scheduled for release, as well as construction spending for January. Auto sales data for February are due as well.
Economists polled by MarketWatch are forecasting an ISM reading of 61% compared to 60.8% in January.
“Indeed, after yesterday’s strong Chicago (PMI) number, our economists have upped their forecast to 62, which would be the strongest reading since December 1983,” said Jim Reid, strategist with Deutsche Bank, in a note to investors. If the ISM manufacturing figure comes in that high, that would coincide with an S&P 500 level of around 1,400, he said.
“The current gap between 1,327 and 1,400 likely reflects the risk that the ISM may be near its peak in this cycle and also that the recent oil spike will mean lower readings in the months ahead,” he said.
Also at 10 a.m. Eastern time, top U.S. central banker Bernanke will deliver the Fed’s semiannual monetary policy report to Congress.
April crude-oil futures CLJ11 rose 80 cents to $97.77 a barrel in electronic trading on Globex. Crude prices have stabilized somewhat after Saudi Arabia pledged to make up for any shortfall in Libyan production.
Stocks in focus for Tuesday include Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.02% which is expected to unveil its latest iPad device on Wednesday in San Francisco, according to a Wall Street Journal report.
Shares of Sonus Networks Inc. SONS, -0.51% jumped 26% in premarket trading after the company released a strong yearly revenue forecast late Monday.
Shares of AutoZone Inc. AZO, +0.60% edged up in the premarket after the company reported second-quarter earnings per share of $3.34 and said same-store sales rose 7.1%. Quarterly revenue rose 10.3% to $1.7 billion.
Shares of General Mills Inc. GIS, -0.26% could also be in focus after a media report said the company is among those leading the bidding for a half-interest in yoghurt maker Yoplait. Nestle SA NSRGY, +0.17% (NESN) was also named as a leading company in the process, according to a Bloomberg News report that cited persons familiar with the process.
Shares of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +0.26% could come in for investor scrutiny as well, after the Dow component estimated in a regulatory filing late Monday that legal losses could total up to $4.5 billion more than current reserves.
In Europe, markets ceded earlier gains to trade essentially flat, while Asian markets had finished generally higher overnight.
Among other commodities, gold for April delivery GCJ11 rose $10 to $1,419.90 an ounce.Orioles go with 13-man staff, for now
Orioles go with 13-man staff
"I talked to [Orioles president of baseball operations] Andy [MacPhail] today, [and] we'll stay with the 13-man pitching staff," Trembley said. "I don't have a timetable on that, as far as how long that's going to be, but right now we have 13 men."
Trembley liked how he was able to match left-hander Jamie Walker and right-hander Chad Bradford up against a lefty and righty, respectively, in Monday's 4-3 win over the Blue Jays.
He feels the 13-man staff, which is a bit uncommon, helps him do that. In addition, Trembley said there's no question he can now put Walker and Bradford in situational roles in the crucial seventh inning.
"If we get those three outs in the seventh, then it allows us to mix and match with Bradford and Walker in the eighth," Trembley said. "It seemed to be a whole lot more comfortable situation to have Walker and Bradford in situational roles."
Trembley also said that he's expecting Orioles starters to pitch seven innings on a regular basis now. It didn't work out that way in Tuesday's game with the Blue Jays, as Steve Trachsel lasted just 2 1/3 innings, but Trembley said the starters will help decide the fate of the 13-man staff.
"Your starting pitching will dictate whether or not it becomes a plus or a minus," Trembley said. "I'd really like to be in a situation where some of those guys in the 'pen don't get as much work. That would really be telling me that the starting pitching is going farther in the game and deeper."
At the very worst, the 13-man staff gives the Orioles an extra arm, something they could use while their young pitchers find their way.
Although Trembley said he knows the consequences are losing one player on the bench, he's willing to give it time to see how things work with 13 pitchers.
"I think you have to play for a while and see where you're at," Trembley said. "I like what the 13-man pitching staff gives us right now, especially in the bullpen, and there's a sense of competition going on down there."

Now Commenting On:Can gonorrhea be cured? of course, if you do not let it become severe gonorrhea. This disease can be cured if treated early. Gonorrhea becomes very difficult to cure if complications have developed. That is why many people say that gonorrhea cannot be cured, the disease has caused a lot of complications.
It's important for you to know the symptoms of gonorrhea. By knowing the early symptoms of gonorrhea in women, you should immediately get a test for gonorrhea. Someone who has a positive test gonorrhea. Or newborns whose mothers had gonorrhea, your doctor will prescribe an antibiotic, be sure to take your antibiotics exactly as directed. If you miss a dose or do not take the full course of medication, gonorrhea infection cannot be cured.
How to cure gonorrhea
Currently, doctors have been equipped with the right treatment to help you through the obstacles created by gonorrhea. That's right, there are many ways to treat and of course prevention is the key to helping people avoid the disease. There is no easier way to protect themselves instead of using a condom.
Cure and treatment for gonorrhea contains a simple process, involving both single-dose administration of antibiotics or antibiotics. When you have gonorrhea also make sure you are tested for chlamydia, as some people who have gonorrhea also have chlamydia. Your doctor will recommend treatment for gonorrhea also include antibiotics effective in treating chlamydia. This is done so that the infection does not develop into severe complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), because (PID) is a serious complication of gonorrhea can lead to infertility, chronic pelvic pain, and ectopic pregnancy.
Healing from the disease (gonorrhea)
Antibiotics such as cefixime and ciprofloxacin are recommended by experts to cure gonorrhea. From the doctor's advice, refrain from sexual activity is recommended. Pain relievers that can be bought without a prescription can be used to ease the discomfort.
As we discussed above, gonorrhea infections were treated and cured with a single dose of antibiotics. Most of them showed a discharge from the urethra or vagina in one or two days. Bleeding between periods usually increases before the onset of the next period. Pain in the lower abdomen, testis or epididymis start improving quickly but can take up to two weeks to go.
Prevention from gonorrhea
Early testing followed by appropriate treatment can save you from this dreaded disease. The test can be done at genitourinary medicine (GUM) or sexual health clinic. Ask your partner to be tested also for gonorrhea infection. Find out if your partner has been tested for gonorrhea infection. If not, ask if she would be willing to undergo the test. This is the most effective way to prevent gonorrhea. By maintaining a single sexual partner. Self-discipline is preferred. Having many sexual partners can give you a higher chance to be infected by gonorrhea or other sexually transmitted diseases.
Gonorrhea as we have seen can lead to serious health problems and even cause death so make sure you consult with your doctor and get help as soon as possible.

A collision bulkhead forward in the bow section. This compartment is used as a anchor rope storage compartment. If the boat is engaged in a head-on collision and the collision bulkhead doesn't fail your still afloat! A bulkhead forward of the main engine and bulkhead aft of the main make up for the engine compartment. Stuffing boxes for shafts through hull fittings below the water line are contained here. Hopefully, if they leak or the fiberglass boat hull gets breached below the water line, the water will be contained in the engine room. The bulkhead act's as a sound barrier and heat barrier and fire barrier as well.
Aft to the stern, another bulkhead makes up the Lazarette were the rudders are. Dropping a rudder offshore is a traumatic experience even for a well seasoned old salt! Bottom line survivability, matey. Pay action to your fiberglass boat bulkhead!
Boat Bulkheads are constantly under attack. As the fiberglass boat hull runs through a sea, flexing and vibration occur stressing the bulkhead. Moisture in the bilge add to the problem. Heat from main engines, generators and vibration add to the stress. Bulkheads are structural members of the fiberglass boat hull adding the transverse strength to the boat hull and reduces flexing.
Prior to the late ninety's most fiberglass boat builders used marine plywood for bulkheads. Laminated to the fiberglass boat hull with polyester resin and fiberglass mat and fiberglass woven roving 24 oz. This process is known as taping-in or tabbing. Done correctly, the eight to twelve inch strips of fiberglass mat and fiberglass woven roving are wetted out with polyester resin laminated to the fiberglass boat hull and to the marine plywood bulkhead, making a strong connection. Over time and use it's not uncommon to find the fiberglass de-laminate away from the plywood bulkhead or the plywood degrading. A close inspection will tell the tale. The 1977 thirty five foot solid fiberglass Bruno/Stillman Sport Fishermen came to Captain Levi for bulkhead replacement in two thousand and three. Twenty Five years of time and offshore waters broke two of her bulkheads lose. The integrity of the marine plywood was gone.

But in this first update i will talk about HKDL future and thanks to a great video of michael20183 you will even see how the works are going on on the three awaited attractions.
But before i tell you the latest news, here are some pictures shot inside the "Magic Continues Preview Gallery". Note that it's pretty dark in there and not so easy to shoot good pictures without a tripod, but i did my best... The first picture above show the Opera House building in which are The Art of Animation and the Preview Gallery. Below, the model of the three new areas, which was shown previously at the former D23 Expo.
The two next pictures show renderings for the Grizzly Mountain coaster in Grizzly Gulch, but on the second picture, the last rendering on the bottom right was not shown at D23 (if i'm right).
Another picture showing interesting renderings for Grizzly Gulch.
One of the other new areas will be Mystic Point but the first to open will be Toy Story Land, and the next two pictures show the model of TSL and renderings. These are interesting as they show decor elements that were not in the first Toy Story Land which opened at the WDS last year. Which mean that, although the three main rides will be identical, not everything will be the same between the HKDL version and the WDS one.
In Fantasyland, near Adventureland entrance, HKDL guests can't miss this Toy Story Land announcement located where will be the future access to Toy Story Land.
So, "the toys are coming" for sure but when exactly will be Toy Story Land opening, you ask? Well, from what i've been told Toy Story Land is almost ready to open, the testing of rides are now in progress and hopefully TSL will be on schedule. Apparently HKDL wants to join Christmas event with the grand opening of Toy Story Land, making the "toys" the christmas gift to HKDL. A bit like what they did with the celebration of HKDL 5th anniversary and Chinese New Year events together early this year.
The "Sparkling Christmas" will kick off on November 17 and the official opening of TSL might be at that time although i won't be surprised if there was some soft openings before that date. Talking about Christmas, as the floats of Disney on Parade are retired a new not-full-length Christmas parade will be performed on Main Street this year.
Grizzly Gulch will be the next to open next year (with Mystic Point opening in 2013), and the news i have is that the opening date would be in the first half of 2012. More details about this soon.
Other news about HKDL with the upcoming Halloween season, always one of the best Halloween theming in a Disney Park. This year, in "Haunted Halloween", HKDL will have a new host, or we might call him "intruder": the dark knight Headless Horseman. A new haunted house featuring the Headless Horseman will replace Demon Jungle in Adventureland. The backstory of this new haunted maze is about an entrepreneur and his world-travelling circus who came to a village of Adventurers. To boost the attendance, the entrepreneur claims he found the head of the world famous Headless horseman, causing the revenge of the real dark knight. The story takes place in a circus, so guests will go through the backstage like dressing room, the stage and of course, the forest. This haunted maze will also pay tribute to Haunted Mansion's Madame Leota with projecting heads inside crystal balls. The Headless Horseman and his horse will also join the Pre-Parade of Glow in HKDL Halloween Parade this year. Finally, the Haunted Hotel and Space Mountain "Ghost Galaxy" will also stay in the new Halloween season. Haunted Halloween should begin September 15 but it may be postpone a week depending because of the works on the new haunted house. The last news i had seems to confirm that Haunted Halloween will begin on September 22.
And now, here is the promised video showing the works on the three new areas, filmed by michael20183 who is always doing a great job! Many thanks to him!
See you soon for a new HKDL pictorial update!

The Halloween there is probably the best in any Disney theme park, they should do the same in Paris and in the USA.
Nice to hear that they are bringing the Headless Horseman, as The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad is one of my favorites Disney animation films.
great update of hk disneyland it going to become better and better every year after the expansions i hope it will get better in the future with more rides. I am so excited about grizzy grutch and mystic manor they both look like e tickets areas even toy story land is not horrible we just need more d tickets attraction around the park but i love this little park and hope it can get better and better!! :)
I will book my trip once Mystic Manor opens.
Hmmm, I was a little excited and unnerved at the prospect of a new HKDL Christmas parade. The usual one is not terribly good. So I welcome a new Christmas parade. However, will this come at the cost of the brilliant, Flights of Fantasy? Hopefully, I'll get to see both this year.Pronunciation: /ˈdeTHwäCH/

= trendingIf anyone has earned the right to perform its latest album almost in full on tour, it's surely Sonic Youth, the singular NYC quartet who remain as adventurous and challenging now, nearly 30 years since their first recordings, as they were at any other time in their career.
That sort of sustained vision should be rewarded with experiences like Friday night's striking show at the Fox Theater in Pomona, for which the main set featured all but one track (“Thunderclap for Bobby Pyn”) from the band's highly touted 15th album The Eternal (No. 10 on Rolling Stone's best-of-2009 list) plus two noisy nuggets from its formative days.
It helps, too, that SY continues to inspire legions of awed devotees who don't mind waiting four months for the group to arrive, as this gig, previously planned for September, had to be pushed back when guitarist Lee Ranaldo injured his wrist. The last of the five (including additional bassist Mark Ibold of Pavement) to step on stage here, he gave a subtle I'm-good salute to this crowd, which was almost small enough to stuff into the Glass House just down the street and around the corner. I suspect the turnout will be greater for tonight's replay at the Wiltern.
And I do mean replay: Unlike most any other headlining tours Sonic Youth has undertaken in the past two decades, this one, like its predecessor, is somewhat by the book.
Last time, at the Greek Theatre in July 2007, they played their 1988 masterpiece Daydream Nation in its entirety (plus some Rather Ripped remnants) and gave one of the mightiest SY performances I've ever seen. Relearning that album rubbed off on their next studio foray, leading to more concise compositions overall (though “Antenna” and “Massage the History” are still epic explorations), a few of which even occasionally and cheekily resort to trad-rock moves: sexy T. Rex-y riffage, the stomp-pause-stomp sort of finish of most classic-rock behemoths. Which I guess is one reason why so many writers and fans are convinced that The Eternal is so accessible.
There's no such thing as an accessible Sonic Youth record, just as it's also true that there is no such as a bad one. They are a noisy, dark, erotic, aggressive, playful and completely idiosyncratic creation like nothing else. Sure, some of their albums (Sister, EVOL, A Thousand Leaves, for me Murray Street) are better than others (not everyone loves Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star as much as I do, but then I think Goo and Dirty are solid and culturally crucial but also overrated at this point).
Once their unpredictable sound bowls you over –- once you develop an appreciation for not only skyscraping Thurston Moore's melancholy Lou Reed-ish manner but also Kim Gordon's more caustc and atonal approach and Ranaldo's balancing-act contributions, while Steve Shelley pounds away instinctively and sympathetically on drums -– well, then virtually everything they do will attract at minimum your sheer fascination. They get in your head, and then they don't leave.
The Eternal, dedicated to late Stooges shredder Ron Asheton, is certainly an album worth hearing completely; place it toward the middle of the more-great stack. But it's hardly accessible. Put it on for even informed indie and/or alternative rock fans and it'll leave half of 'em squirming impatiently by Track 4 or 5. Why I think so many critics are quick to call it accessible is that it's a return to what they know and crave –- Sonic Youth's firebrand first heyday, from its essential works for SST Records in the '80s through to Goo and Dirty, after which point Alternative Nation quickly lost interest (and then SY got interesting again).
Frankly, I consider SY's most potentially accessible phase to be the contemplative one it only started coming out of with Rather Ripped in 2006. Any of the four albums just before it –- A Thousands Leaves (1998), NYC Ghosts & Flowers (2000), the moving Murray Street (2002) and the hazy Sonic Nurse (2004) –- is one I might select to introduce a neophyte to the group, as they represent Sonic Youth at their most Neil Young & Crazy Horse mellowed, no less fuzzed-up or off-kilter but oceanic about it now, not tumultuous.
To hear how much The Eternal evokes the band's early days –- and have you noticed that it's the first time Sonic-Youth is hyphenated on the cover since Confusion Is Sex, its first full-length, in 1983? -– play it alongside Sister or EVOL or Daydream, and note that they don't seem to be headed toward a resurgence of the palatable polish of “Dirty Boots” and “Kool Thing” and “Sugar Kane.” They seem to be reconnecting with a particular power they harnessed and mood they mastered back in '86-'88.
Note, too, how every set list since before they got derailed in September and after they have returned with the new year has fit a pattern: beyond The Eternal, almost all other choices have been from EVOL/Sister/Daydream. “Teen Age Riot,” Daydream's most famous song, has been left in the bullpen, but some nights you'll hear “Silver Rocket” or “Hey Joni.” Friday night we got “Tom Violence” (EVOL's kickoff) four cuts in, then “White Cross” (from Sister) four after that, both exceptionally rich with detail.
And the encore has been fixed on first “The Sprawl” then “'Crosss the Breeze,” both from Daydream … and then comes a wild card. In the case of Pomona: “Expressway to Yr. Skull,” the first time I've heard them stretch out on that EVOL piece in years (if I ever have, come to think of it), its haunting atmosphere culminating in several minutes of backs-to-the-crowd feedback squalls.
Utterly beautiful –- for those of who find such things meditatively rapturous, that is. As for anyone who arrived expecting a career overview … and I'll admit that though I'll digest anything they wish to serve up, I too came hoping for a more varied and surprising mix … well, if anyone has earned the right to ignore such audience desires and simply do as they please, it's surely Sonic Youth.

According to North Shore Community College, up to 80 percent of what you learn in the classroom is a result of listening. In addition to helping you take good notes, being an effective listener in college helps you form a better understanding of the informatin taught and enhances your communication skills.
Focus
To listen effectively, you have to focus your attention on the task. Because a classroom can have several distractions, from students arriving late to the sound of clicking laptop keys, you have to prepare yourself to listen. Sit close to the front of the classroom so you can hear the teacher and see the board well. If necessary, avoid seats near a window or close to your friends so your attention doesn’t get diverted. Leave your cell phone and other distracting items in your book bag.
Let Go of Biases and Assumptions
It’s normal to have opinions and judgments. To be an effective listener, you must have an open mind because biases and assumptions can block your ability to listen well, according to the U.S. Air Force’s Air University. An example of bias may be to have the belief that people who speak with an accent are uneducated. Or, you may assume that anything that has to do with molecular biology is boring or too hard to understand. To be a good listener, you don’t necessarily have to change your mind about your opinions. You just can’t let your opinions become a barrier to obtaining information.
Recognize Cues
When you attend lectures, most professors provide clues about the information that they think is the most important. You may hear a cue in the form of a statement such as, “The three most important … ” or “Can someone tell me what … ?” A professor may also provide a cue by pausing between points so you have enough time to write notes. The cues that teachers use vary by person, so it’s important to pay attention to each individual style of communication.
Enhance Your Understanding
It is your responsibility to understand the material presented. Air University says the most effective listeners in college are those who share the learning experience and responsibility with a professor. To this end, if you don’t understand a concept presented, ask clarifying questions. Don’t be afraid to ask a professor to repeat herself or provide further explanation, even if you need to take the time to do this outside of the classroom.

“We had a temporary issue that began yesterday with a server that generated DRM code for some apps being downloaded,” Apple said in a statement. “The issue has been rectified and we don’t expect it to occur again."
Apple said that those who downloaded an affected app can re-download it from the App Store. It also stated the bug affected few users.
That's not the story others have. The error in Apple's code affected more than 100 iOS and Mac apps, according to MacStories -- and that Apple removed negative reviews about the app crashes. So we believe this affected many more people than Apple is acknowledging, and likely many of them didn't know it was an error on Apple's part. They likely just were angry at the app developer and wrote a negative review.

By Anna Lothson
The developer of the future 20-story Lake and Forest high-rise continues to hear positive feedback from the financial community, according to Oak Park's Business Services Manager Loretta Daly, who relayed the information to the village board at its Feb. 19 meeting. She provided a brief update as requested by the board. Sertus Principal Michael Glazier, the lead developer, is responsible for keeping the village in the loop as the project progresses.
The long-delayed project has its share of skeptics about whether the project will ever be built, but Glazier has stuck by his claims that the group is moving forward.
Over the next few months, either on a monthly or bi-monthly basis, Sertus will come back to the board with status reports. The project plans are currently in review for permits.
A final list of materials to be used on the building's exterior was presented to the village recently. The group will be sticking to its initial project plans of having synthetic stucco because of the material's energy efficiency. Other options, including metal, have also been reviewed. Sertus will be seeking LEED Silver (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) for the building.
Trustee Ray Johnson asked again about the project's finances, and Daly said that report won't be ready until the permit process is over.
"Pieces are falling in place to secure the financing, but it has just not occurred yet at this point," Daly said.
The village also sent out a request for proposals for a line of credit, which will eventually be used to fund the village's portion of the reconstructed Holley Court Garage. The request was sent to nine institutions, Daly said, and four have responded.
It was determined in December that the board should finance its portion of the public parking garage through a bank letter of credit during construction. That will be followed be a General Obligation bond upon completion. The garage will not be built, however, until Sertus' financing is secure.: August 29th, 2013 9:36 PM
Sertus is Dead! It is now a Goltz! Goltz is a developer who bought, stole, or found on the rights to the Lake and Forest space in the street. Sertus faces a $4.9 million foreclosure lawsuit from Pittsburgh-based PNC Bank N.A. The development venture failed to pay off a $4.5 million mortgage when it came due in March 2012, according to a complaint filed in July in U.S. District Court in Chicago. There is little known so far about Goltz though a check of his website found that he is a vice president at Chody Real Estate. Chody's specialty is Commercial Acquisitions and Retail Development. According to the photos on the Chody website () Chody specializes in strip malls. OP was hoping for a twenty story apartment house. The transfer of the development property from Sertus to Goltz/Chody requires village board.

Does the WJ simply print the same article every 3 months ... same progress report (no progress), same vague financing (no financing), etc. Here's the thing ... RDA says the Sertus permit is null and void if const. hasn't started by Sept. 1, 2013 (already extended from Feb. 15). BTW ... while waiting for financing, Sertus took the time to change the exterior wall material on the west fa%uFFFDade, the one leading into the FLW Historic District, from architectural concrete to synthetic stucco (EIFS).Full Facial Rejuvenation

Good Points
They appear friendly in the store and willing to help when you go in to buy the camera.
General Comments
I was unhappy with the camera I bought and they were very unhelpful, they told me the camera was fine and assumed it was me who could not use it which is not true. I told them I thought the picture quality was bad and took the camera back to them with all original parts and the only reason they could find not to exchange was that I had torn the plastic bag the camera was packed in. Ridiculous!!

GAO examined user feedback when reviewing NASA's Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS), the first agency-wide online procurement information site in the federal government. A poll of online comments revealed that 87 percent of NAIS users found the site beneficial.
NAIS includes:
- an online procurement reference library;
- an electronic posting system that allows staff to post notices and solicitations directly on the Internet;
- an e-mail notification service that automatically informs vendors when new procurement information is posted to the site.
Information on the NAIS site can be downloaded or synopses can be reviewed online. Users can search for contracts on the site by state, congressional district, business type and type of product or service.
According to NASA, the agency's online systems saves nearly $2.3 million per year in staffing and administrative costs. It costs NASA $100,000 annually to run the site.
A multi-agency electronic posting system may be developed based on NASA's model, the report said. Such a system is currently being tested by NASA, GSA and other agencies.
Government Executive recognized NAIS with one of 19 Government Technology Leadership Awards.Kevin L. Ray, 37, of 28 Country Meadows Way in Cartersville allegedly.

The Dos and Do-Not-Dos of Day-Drinking
Obviously today's big news in police oversight has been Mayor Sam Adams and Chief Mike Reese announcement that "draft" discipline recommendations have been issued in the fatal shooting of Aaron Campbell earlier this year. (With the Portland Police Association strongly trying to imply—wonder how they'd know such a thing?—that Officer Ron Frashour would be fired for firing the kill shot.)
But there was something else tucked into Reese's statement this morning. An actual finding, in the case of Officer Chris Humphrey, who fired a beanbag shotgun, at close range, into a 12-year-old girl's legs last fall. Says the chief:
"It is my proposed finding that this action was consistent with the policies and guidelines of the Portland Police Bureau. The next step is the IPR process, in which the complainant has the opportunity to appeal this finding."
Humphreys was initially suspended after the beanbag shooting, only to be reinstated amid heavy pressure, and a march, from the police union. (Where else have you read Humphreys' name? He was involved in the death of James Chasse, too.)
The beanbag shooting was seen by many in the community as the final outrage after a tragic series of high-profile police shootings. Stay tuned for reaction and updates.Sounds good! tightby CVA - Deathtalk

At the very least, some of their belongings certainly seem to be, that is if the oddly conspicuous moving truck spotted at their home yesterday is any indication.
But could this really be the end of Ashton and Demi? What gives?
MORE: Ashton and Demi show off their wedding bling
Here's what we know: neither Kutcher's nor Moore's rep has been particularly chatty with the media since the allegations of Ashton's cheating became headline news, and unsurprisingly, neither side felt like offering up an explanation of why a moving van was spotted leaving their home yesterday afternoon, or what, exactly, it was carrying (ditto, quite wisely, the moving van company).
It's worth bearing in mind, though, that despite the vehicle's curious presence at la Casa de Kutcher, it was just yesterday that sources close to the twosome told E! News that the couple of six years—who made quite the show of brandishing their wedding rings in public this week—is not currently considering divorce or a formal split of any kind.
And while a day can make quite a difference, it doesn't appear that the couple has suddenly strayed from their united way of thinking. So for now, the moving van mystery will remain just that.
MORE: Were Ashton and Demi destined for trouble?
Of course, while the couple is keeping ultra low-profiles, that's going to be changing—whether they like it or not—very soon.
E! News has learned that Moore is still honoring all the promotional commitments she made prior to the you-know-what hitting the fan, and in fact is even on track to participate in the junket for her new film, Margin Call, in New York on Monday. She's also planning on attending the New York premiere of the film next week, though it's probably a safe bet that her duties will extend only to posing and that she won't be bothering with the media interviews.
Which, really, is fair enough.
As for Ashton, he too has proven himself dependable through the drama, and hasn't missed a beat (or a day), turning up as usual on the set of Two and a Half Men.
So whatever else you call these two, consummate pros should top the list.
UPDATE: A source confirms to E! News that the moving van spotted near their home was not actually at their home and that the photo was misidentified by the agency that sold the pic.

PHOTOS: Demi Moore & Ashton Kutcher: Romance RecapPhotographer David Emitt Adams‘ series Conversations with History captures images and time. Adams collected discarded cans from throughout the Arizona desert. The cans, eroded and reddish-brown, are as much as forty years old. Using wet-plate collodion, a 19th century photographic process, Adams develops the desert scenes directly onto the cans found there. The timelessness of the deserts emerges through the images on the can, the decades of corrosion on it, and the antiquated photographic technique.HHI - Robert Irvine's EAT
If you're in the HHI area a must-stop is Robert Irvine's EAT restaurant. Its located in the Village of Wexford Shopping Plaza on 278. My husband and I ate there two nights in a row - we sampled 12 items, both tapas and an entree - all were exceptional.
Top 2 favorites were she crab bisque (a special) - best of the island
Salt-crusted ahi tuna - thin slices of tuna stacked in a line on top of a semi-sweet coconut/orange glaze which offset the salt of the tuna.
Others sampled were coconut shrimp, tempura calamari steak with 2 great aioli sauces and fried green tomatoes.
The entree was the grilled snapper served over a red pepper coulis and the most amazing grits.
Tapas were in the $7-$12 range, entrees $22 and up.
Service was excellent - manager (Nate) couldn't have been nicer - he stopped by our table several times over our two visits.
Robert Irvine (he's the food network chef on the show Dinner Impossible) also stopped by and chatted with us on both nights.
Atmosphere was very stylish with comfortable seating and upscale decor.
Interesting - I had followed his St. Pete fiasco.

Empower Network is a new system that is used to train average people and website owners to build and monetize blogs online. The Marketer’s Black Book website put together a series of bonuses worth $4,294 to be paired as a free gift for those that purchase the Empower Network through the Marketer’s Black Book website. Because the size of the free bonuses is so large, uproar has taken place online according to Marketer’s Black Book. Part of the reason for the uproar is that most free bonus content is usually private label rights products that are already widely shared online. A direct link to the bonuses is available here.
The Confessions of a $15 Million Dollar Traffic Man is one item that has been placed into the bonus offer that is distributed. This traffic creation system is one that has been developed by one of the co-founders of Marketer’s Black Book and is not available separately or elsewhere on the Internet. The exact traffic blueprint that was used to generate this large sales amount is now being taught to those that purchase the Empower Network membership through the MBB website.
“I generated over $15 million in sales without ever building my own website or writing a single line of programming code,” said Brian Hanson inside of his $15 Million Dollar Traffic Man training. “Just this information alone is worth the price of the bonuses we give away as a whole,” Hanson said.
The growth of the Amazon Kindle system has made it easier than ever for authors and non-authors to publish books quickly. The sales success of the Kindle Fire and other e-book reader systems is part of the proof that traditional book sales are sliding compared with e-book downloads. Amazon confirmed this data in December of 2011 and the December 2012 sales could out perform estimates.
A second bonus included in the Empower Network Bonuses by Marketer’s Black Book is the autopilot book creation system. This method teaches how to write a book, publish it and collect the sales income in just 24 hours or less.
Anyone that is searching for methods that have been proven to build online traffic that converts into sales could benefit from reviewing the $4,294 in free bonuses now offered on the Marketer’s Black Book website. A simple proof of purchase of the Empower Network is the only requirement to access the thousands of dollars in Empower Network bonuses.
About Marketer’s Black Book
Internet marketing training and business training are just two of the freebies that are taught at the Marketer’s Black Book website daily. Thousands of website owners and business owners visit this website daily to learn the latest strategies used to generate web user traffic that can convert into online sales. The experts behind the MBB website are successful entrepreneurs offline and online and now teach their successful strategies around the U.S. As frequent business and seminar speakers, the Marketer’s Black Book team remains in demand for their knowledge of online business and sales growth.Kicking off this article I would like to discuss what is wrong with the WWE, starting with the RAW Guest Host's.
RAW Guest Host's:
Batista was the first RAW Guest Host and it made sense. Then you saw Bob Barker, Ozzy, Shaquille O'Neal, Seth Green and ZZ Top and many others. The thing that bothers me is that Batista is the only active WWE Superstar to be named as a RAW Guest Host. The WWE should start using more of its active Superstars as Guest Host's so they can be implemented into the storyline for building up there PPV's.
Storyline:
1. Sheamus winning the WWE Championship within 5 months of his debut is completely without logic. First of all the man needs a tan, and secondly, he needs to pay his dues in the business before being propelled to the top of the company.
2. Bret Hart vs Vince McMahon (No Holds Barred) at WrestleMania is something many of us have wanted to feast our eyes on for a long time. Bret Hart is in no condition to compete. Due to his stroke several years ago he can not be dropped on his head, or back. WWE had to work out a deal with Bret Hart's insurance company before making it official. Bret Hart confirmed this during a interview recently. Do not expect an awesome match to take place because it will likely be a quick match, with very little excitement.
3. Undertaker vs Shawn Michaels at WrestleMania (Streak vs Career) is a bad idea. Last years WrestleMania match with the two competitors was a classic match and should never be duplicated.
The PG Rating:
Among the many problems in the WWE right now, one big problem surfaces among many long time wrestling fans. That problem is the PG rating. Many fans are unhappy with the PG rating and feel it diminishes the quality of the show and they feel strongly that the WWE needs to back to the PG14 rating.
Wrestling fans want to be entertained and so do I.We love getting to document the moments in people’s lives and for Jo + Steve, we got to see their new house together — fresh with unpacked boxes, 60’s inspired carpet from the 80’s, and ‘the pink bathroom’.

This collection seeks to address this question.
Comparative work in postcolonial studies often turns on the mode by which subaltern peoples were governed in the high colonial past. Framed in this way, ground for comparison has tended to concern the way the colonized suffered governmental classification, subjection, and regulation by the colonial state. David Scott’s seminal essay on this topic, grounded in colonial Ceylon, opened the way to much investigation. Similarly, Ann Laura Stoler’s work has incisively examined the relation between apparatuses of colonial governmentality in the former Dutch East Indies and French Indochina. There is much to be gained from this approach and, as the work of scholars like Patrick Wolfe have shown, analysis of colonial governmentality reveals how epistemologies of anthropology and colonial administration moved across colonial spaces. This collection aims to connect such analysis with the present, exploring the way revenants (in Derrida’s sense, particularly in Spectres of Marx) of such governmentality return and remain in apparently (post)colonial times.
How, for instance, do projects of national reconciliation account for, critique, and (at times) cover over the colonial traumas they seek to memorialize? How do postcolonies produce public spheres that challenge the memory of such colonial trauma? What are the lacunas and blindspots? How do postcolonial literatures challenge existing models of cultural memory? How are such challenges similarly refracted in festivals, public events, and other such performances? While the collection seeks to account for the historic legacy of colonial governmentality, it is the legacy that the collection most emphasizes---the mode of memorialization that persist at the end of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first; nonetheless, historical analyses of particular paradigms of colonial governmentality will be considered. Several publishers have expressed interest in the collection and, with your contribution, the project promises to be a strong contribution to the field.
Example topics that essays in the collection might explore include:
---postcolonial societies and cultural memory
---cultural memory within diasporic movements
---the governmentality of affect
---the relation between neoliberalism and postcoloniality
---the postcolony and necropolitics
---anticolonial and decolonizing movements and collective memory
---the mediation of cultural memory
---the politics of reconciliation
---indigenous responses to national projects of cultural memory
---literature and the public sphere in the postcolony
---film and the public sphere in the postcolony
The collection encourages comparative work, but could also include studies engaged in sustained analysis of single colonial and postcolonial texts, sites, and spaces. Similarly, literary, ethnographic, historical, and cultural analysis are all within the purview of the collection. Essays are to be between 6500 and 8500 words in length.
Please submit 500 word abstracts (including proposed essay title) and curriculum vitae to Michael R. Griffiths (mg3349@columbia.edu) by Octboer 15, 2012.
If full essays are completed and available, these may be sent along with the 500 word abstract.Tuxedo All Purpose Bowl by Lenox

“We had a wonderful time at Kep Malibu. We were given a wonderful apartment which felt straight out of a palace-so lovely. It is set in a most beautiful lush garden and the pool is great. yes, it is a bit far, but then Kep is like that anyway. There is always a tuk tuk on offer, so it is no problem. We loved it.”
“Very nice view. Big pool. Friendly staff.”
“Sea 20 meters from room which was very comfortable with fantastic view, fast wifi. Really tasty breakfast. All the staff were very friendly and helpfull with requests. Would certainly stay again if in kep”
“Happy hut and lulu team was great”
“Close to the beach in Kep. Crab market a 20 minute walk or $2-3 dollar tuk tuk ride. Booked for 3 nights and ended up staying for 5. Staff are fantastic and the retaurant is great too. Small clean pool area with sun loungers. Saturday and Sunday evenings are good as have a street food event and BBQ in the evening. Very good.”
“Everything is good in the hotel. The food, staff, atmosphere are excellent. We've met a lot of nice people in the hotel. Will come back again.”
“Super location close to the sea....a few minutes' walk from the crab market....only a 20 min. walk from National Park entrance with its great peaceful forest hikes.....balcony for sea views and smokes...huge room-very comfortable .”
“Architecture, very nice comfortable room, very comfortable bed, most creature comforts taken care of, mosquito net (essential!), yummy breakfast, great location 5 minutes' walk to crab market and right next to the Sailing Club where you can watch the sunset with a delicious cocktail.”
“We love this place! It's convenient and walkable to the crab market. The pool is clean and lovely. We adore the staff - always with a smile. The rooms are large and clean- very comfortable. The bar is well stocked and the breakfast is very good. The best part of Mea Lea Resort is the amazing view of the ocean and the grounds have every tropical plant and is expertly maintained. This is a real resort for a low price. We're going back in two months.”
“Beautiful place. Fantastic food. Very friendly attentive hosts. Good location. Very restful I can't wait to go back. An undiscovered Shangrila.”
“The tree top bungalows was a place you could just hang I out for the day and just enjoy the surrounds. There is no atm at kepand they only accept cash so take this into consideration. You can easily ride a bike into town and the crab market near by has excellent food etc. All the wood furniture and banglows are made on the premises and the service is excellent. It just has a peaceful feeling. Check out th $5 us a night bungalow. Clean and toilet shower just steps away.”
“The lovely people who run this place are so helpful and go above and beyond to make sure that your stay is perfect, our bed was made with fresh towels every day. Breakfast was lovely, some of the best fruit I have had for a while. The bungalow we stayed in was very clean, comfortable and charming!! Close walk to the crab market! Beautiful gardens, so peaceful!”
“My friend Janet and I enjoyed every moment in this paradise. We had the best meal ever by the beach, the rooms were fabulous, The staff were so helpful, and the people that were staying at the samanea at the same time as Janet and I were so friendly. Thank you for looking after Janet and I. We had one of the best times and the best food I have tasted.”
“We stayed here sadly only for one night we wished we could have stayed longer. We had two "huts" one for my husband and myself the other for our two sons. The accommodation and setting was just beautiful and the staff could not have been more helpful and friendly. I would definitely recommend anyone to stay here wish we had spent our extra night here rather in Kampot before going into Vietnam.”
“Staff was amazing, helped us plan our transport, gave us directions. etc. This was cleanest place we have stayed in in Cambodia! Pool area was great!”
“the rooms were clean and spacious, the pool areas were quite luxurious, Kep is a really interesting area and the hotel assisted with arranging reasonably priced day trips”
“this hotel is beautiful. The rooms are all tucked away in little private sanctuaries, the pools georgeus and there is no better place to watch the sunset in Cambodia.”
“Lovely stay. Best hotel I stayed in during trip to Cambodia”
“Ester, the owner, was really lovely. She was so eager to help me out, which is always particularly nice as a solo traveler. She recommended some good places to eat and showed me how to navigate around the city. The rooms were spacious and very clean with a comfortable bed. The park is right behind the hotel and is really easy to access. Stay here! You don't be.See all Cork hostels

Looking for a good place for Ethiopian food in LA to take my friend who will be experiencing it for the first time. The only Ethiopian restaurant I have been to is Nyala. I enjoyed the food but I felt that the portions were quite small and we ended up spending almost 100 per couple with drinks. I' m look for good quality, decent portions, and a place that won't dry up my wallet.

if you can do this as a weekday lunch meal, AND if you are open to eating ethiopian vegan food, then get the lunch special at rahel. the special is a combination plate of several of their dishes, and when you finish the plate, if you are still hungry, they will serve you more food for no addtional money.
the lunch special is about $8/pp as i recall. fantastic deal.
irrc, rahel only has a beer and wine license.
