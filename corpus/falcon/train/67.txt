Beady Posted September 6 Report Share Posted September 6 I noticed a couple of people seem to have pulled their deposit so wondered what the reasons were (assuming not personal / changes of circumstance etc). I am beginning to question my deposit. Not about the car itself, more about being an early adopter (i bought a Launch edition Evora, one of the first 50ish so I have experience). I was reading an old 2020 Evo copy in the barbers yesterday. The car data/review summary part at the back, basically summarised the Evora (400/410/430) as great cars 'but' the engine and gearbox were dated in this sector. I would love a manual but in truth, the V6 engine was old when it was launched in the Evora and that was 12 years ago, so I just don't get spending £70/80k+ on a brand new car with a dinosaur engine (sorry folks, just my opinion) So the AMG is where its at; trouble is that has been detuned for launch and will almost certainly get power increases along the way, possibly quite soon. The Evora S came along within 12 months of Launch and the Evora did get a bit of bad press about being underpowered I recall. My concern is that when it gets to the journos, the reviews will be summarised as: Great car, but a bit underpowered. V6 manual is past its sell by date and the AMG is underpowered so wait for the S version. The comparisons will be clear - outgoing cars (all of them) are faster 0-60 that the brand new car. The early Evoras also had quite a lot of build quality issues. Everything sorted under warranty so no real drama but the current Emira launch, roadshow in Sept, Journos in the new year, deliveries may be Spring, all seems very reminiscent of Evora Launch So i am really think to leave the deposit sat there (or take it back if i have to) and wait for the S to arrive. in a year or so. Interested to hear any other thoughts of self doubt 2 Quote construction and property consultants : My company Link to comment Share on other sites More sharing options...

In what may be the “most expensive divorce in history,” Dmitry Rybolovlev will be ordered to pay his ex-wife $4.5 billion. Known as the “fertilizer king” for heading a $34 billion fertilizer company, the Russian oligarch was quite open with his philandering for years, even with his wife, Elena. She appeared to hit her limit and launched a financially messy divorce battle against him a few years ago, including having his assets frozen in 2013. Because many billionaires do not publicize their divorce settlements, it cannot be determined if Rybolovlev’s is officially the most expensive in history. However, as a point of comparison, Rupert Murdoch’s cost him $1.7 billion—pocket change compared to this tainted love.AppleInsider is supported by its audience and may earn commission as an Amazon Associate and affiliate partner on qualifying purchases.

Images of an “Apple Watch Pro” logo surfaced online Monday, suggesting Apple at one time mulled an alternative branding for its top-tier wearable.
Discovered by YouTube channel Apple Demo in the system files of an early Apple Watch display unit, the “Apple Watch Pro” logo appears beside PNG files for released models including Apple Watch Sport and Apple Watch Edition.
Not much is known about the single logo file, though it appears that Apple was experimenting with assigning “Pro” branding to a version of its first-generation Watch. The “Apple Watch Pro” PNG found in the demo unit was supposedly created in February 2015, two months before Apple Watch debuted in April of that year.
Along with the aluminum Apple Watch Sport, the first version of Apple’s wearable came in stainless steel Apple Watch and gold Apple Watch Edition trims. The Sport mark was dropped with the introduction of Apple Watch Series 2, likely to avoid confusion with the then-new Apple Watch Nike+ model.
No longer on exhibit at Apple Stores, the original Apple Watch demonstration display pedestal contained an Apple Watch connected to an iPad mini via Lightning-based connector that attached to Watch’s data port. At the time, try-on units ran a looping software demo, while functional devices embedded in a wedge-shaped stand allowed for a more interactive experience.
Apple Demo is relatively new to the Apple leaks game, but the channel has obtained access to at least two Apple Watch prototype units.
Considering that the moniker dates back to 2015, it is unlikely that Apple will release an “Apple Watch Pro” in the near future. In the intervening years, the company has assigned the “Pro” designation to a number of products including iPad, iPhone, iMac and, most recently, the M1 Pro chip used in the new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro.
Apple is reportedly developing a ruggedized Apple Watch model that could debut in 2022, though branding plans remain unknown.Internet Explorer Channel NetworkKIND WORDS
that people say
AMAZING photography….I cant express how happy and pleased i am with my wedding pictures. Everyone who has seen the pictures have been impressed with them. Claire was very friendly, accommodating, patient and focused on capturing every moment from our special day. I would HIGHLY recommend her to anyone. Thanks again Claire.
Thank you Claire for our stunning wedding photos! We know the Caves was not the easiest place to take photos but you would never have guessed from the quality that you have produced! You made everyone feel at ease and you captured our special day perfectly! The presentation of our Cd was amazing – a lovely touch! Thanks you again, we would recommend you to anyone!
Claire, they are amazing! The colours are fantastic and Josh is really cute! As soon as we saw them we wanted to share the link with our friends and family but had to stop ourselves so that they remain a surprise for Christmas presents! Looking forward to seeing more and to being able to being able to share the link to your blog on Christmas for all to see! Thanks again.
Claire, you are wonderful, they are amazing and are just what we wanted and more. You have really captured the atmosphere and joy. Thank you so very very much. I don’t know what else to say except that your talent is evident in every one of these and we couldn’t have chosen a better photographer for our day. Brilliant!
Thank you for the fantastic photos! We had such a brilliant day but it just flew by so it’s great to have memories captured in such amazing photos. You did great job despite the weather not being on our side, in fact the outdoor photos are some of my favourite! We’ve had so many compliments about our photos from friends and family. We really enjoyed having you with us for the day. Thanks again Claire!
Claire was really friendly and she put us all at ease. She made the photo shoot really fun and we soon got into the swing of it. I was delighted with the photos but it was difficult deciding which ones to use as I loved them all. My family and I now have them displayed on the wall and my friends have all commented on how beautiful the kids look in them. I would recommend Claire to anyone looking for professional photographs.I will be using her again.
Even though our little girl had been ill during the week of our shoot and was a tricky subject, Claire was able to capture some really great shots both indoors and out. Neither my husband nor I are particularly comfortable posing for pictures but Claire put us at ease immediately. We ended up buying the cd as we couldnt choose between all the great shots!
Thank you first of all for being brilliant on our wedding day and being everything we wanted! Every time I look back at the pictures I get transported back there and relive the day all over again. Everyone mentioned what a lovely person you were, but they also forgot about you being there which I think is great.
The most amazing photographer, I would highly recommend her!! The way she captured the story of my wedding through her beautiful photos was outstanding. From start to finish she was highly professional, putting everyone at eased giving the best tips to get beautiful and fun photos. I loved all my photos and Claire’s on hand to help me put the album together, thank you so much Claire and I look forward to booking you for some family photos.Property Attributes

What Are the Types of Fast Degrees That Pay Well?
Four of the most popular high-paying degrees for 2021 include fast degrees in communications, business administration, information technology, and marketing. Each offers multiple career paths into positions that pay well over the median earnings of $41,53510 and can be completed quickly via online programs from accredited schools. Let’s look at each of these programs in more detail.
Associate Degree in Communications
The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) predicts a 14% growth in media and communications jobs over the next 10 years and lists a median annual salary of $61,310 per year for positions such as announcer, interpreter, translator, or technical writer.
An associate degree in communications typically takes two years and trains students to communicate effectively in different media and within broad contexts, offering the ideal entry into these types of positions. Students learn how to:
- Communicate through words, images, and other media
- Create everything from training documents and marketing videos to social media messages and business reports
Accelerated Bachelor’s Degree in Business Administration
The BLS forecasts growth in business and finance occupations of 8% by 2030 and reports a median annual wage of up to $72,250 per year1.
A bachelor’s degree in business administration equips students to work in these fields by:
- Preparing students to manage the nuts and bolts of an organization, from human resources and accounting to supply chain management and leadership
- Typically allowing students to focus on a specific aspect of business, such as marketing, accounting, or operations management
- Providing the practical skills organizations look for when hiring new talent
Students can pursue accelerated programs in business administration from several accredited institutions, which can be completed in as little as two years.
Associate Degree in Information Technology
With a degree to prove IT skills, a career in computer and information technology can prove lucrative, thanks in part to the shift to remote work caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. From computer network architects to information security analysts, software developers, and computer and information research scientists, graduates with an IT degree can expect careers paying upward of $100,000 per year, with some careers paying as much as $126,830 per year2.
An associate degree in information technology (IT) typically takes two years and supports a career path in these fields by:
- Providing an overview of the many different aspects of information technology
- Teaching the technical skills and applied knowledge needed to move quickly into a professional role
Students typically choose to focus on specific areas of expertise, such as general IT support, software development, or networking.
Accelerated Bachelor’s Degree in Marketing
According to the BLS, a degree in advertising, promotions, and marketing can lead to a median annual salary of $141,4903.
A degree in marketing trains students in the skills needed to effectively develop brands and promote products and services. Students can choose to specialize in a number of different areas of expertise with concentrations including:
- Online marketing
- Consumer behavior
- Decision science
- Market analytics
Accelerated programs are available from several accredited schools and can be completed in as little as two years.
How Can I Use a Fast Degree?
What makes a fast degree so valuable is the fact that each offers multiple options for moving directly from your degree to high-paying work. If you want to get hired quickly in a skilled position, you need valuable skills that employers are willing to pay a premium for.
While a professional career in something like medicine or law requires years of advanced study, students wanting to move into skills-based careers in industries like IT, healthcare, human resources, or digital marketing can get started on a high-paying career path much faster. A certificate, associate degree, or accelerated degree is usually enough to show employers that you have the specialized skills to get started in a skilled career.
Graduates with the job-specific and industry-specific skills these degrees specialize in can also enjoy increasing opportunities for freelance work. In fact, Statista data suggests that 57.3 million4 professionals in the U.S. workforce opt to freelance, and in 2020, 65% of them5 earned more as freelancers than when working for an employer.
Fast Degree Program Courses
Typically, a traditional undergraduate degree program takes four years to complete. Job applicants with a bachelor’s degree often command a higher salary than applicants with no degree, as employers associate this type of qualification with a well-rounded general education and well-developed soft skills.
However, employers today also recognize there are alternative ways for students to demonstrate such expertise and skill, and this includes fast degrees that allow students to develop specialized technical skills and areas of expertise. These fast degree pathways include certificates, associate degrees, and accelerated degrees.
Certificates
Certificate programs are short, postsecondary academic qualifications that focus on fast, basic career training. They can take anything from a few months to three years to complete. Students can earn certificates at the undergraduate or graduate level.
Associate Degrees
An associate degree is an undergraduate-level program that aims to provide students with the basic technical and transferable skills as well as theoretical knowledge needed for employment (or additional degrees) in a specific field. Students can transition easily from an associate degree to a bachelor’s degree or move directly into a high-paying career.
Accelerated Degrees
An accelerated degree program compresses a typical four-year bachelor’s degree into a shorter space of time by offering shorter classes with greater flexibility to suit students’ needs and schedules. For example, students can cover the same material that would take 16 weeks in a traditional bachelor’s program in as little as five weeks.
Fast Degree Concentrations
Fast degrees offer multiple concentrations, each of which is geared towards helping students quickly develop the expertise needed for fast entry into a high-paying position.
Associate Degree in Communications: Concentrations and Careers
Typical concentrations for an associate degree in communications include digital media, public relations, political communication, and radio/TV/broadcasting. Each offers high-paying options even for entry-level positions, such as:
- Broadcast technician: $40,570 per year6
- Sound engineering technician: $54,740 per year6
- Social media specialist: $56,770 per year6
Students studying for an associate degree in communications typically need to complete a final capstone project or dissertation.
Accelerated Bachelor’s Degree in Business Administration: Concentrations and Careers
For an accelerated bachelor’s degree in business administration, degree concentrations can include human resources, healthcare management, accounting, data science, and organizational leadership. Some typical entry-level salaries careers using these concentrations include:
- Budget Analyst: $78,970 per year1
- Compensation, Benefits, and Job Analysis Specialist: $67,190 per year1
- Human Resources Specialist: $63,490 per year1
For degree completion, students can expect to complete internships, work placements, or industry projects.
Associate Degree in Information Technology: Concentrations and Careers
An associate degree in IT offers many degree concentration options, with some of the most exciting, including game development, information security, and web and applications development. Some of the entry-level options possible for graduates in these concentrations include:
- Computer Support Specialist: $55,550 per year7
- Computer Network Support Specialist: $62,340 per year 7
- Web Developer: $67,990 per year 7
No previous technical experience is needed to enroll in most programs, although strong science and math performance in high school is essential, and additional experience will help your chances of acceptance in more competitive schools. Most programs require students to complete a skills-based capstone project to pass.
Accelerated Bachelor’s Degree in Marketing: Concentrations and Careers
For a bachelor’s degree in marketing, students can choose from concentrations including online marketing, consumer behavior, decision science, and market analytics. Entry-level positions for this degree include:
- Advertising, Promotions, and Marketing Managers: $141,490 per year3
- Market Research Analysts: $65,810 per year8
- Marketing Manager: $154,470 per year9
Many of these programs involve work experience and industry placement opportunities, and these are great for giving you a head start on your career path. Some also enable students to gain professional accreditations from organizations like the Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM) and the Communication Advertising and Marketing Foundation (CAM). Most marketing degrees require either a capstone project or paper as a pass requirement.
How Long Does It Take to Earn Different Types of Fast Degrees?
Students can complete most certificate programs and accelerated degrees in less than a year, and associate degrees is two years on a full-time schedule. For part-time students, all three fast degree types will take longer to complete.
After completing a fast degree, students can increase their salary expectations even higher by completing further degrees. Students can typically complete a master’s degree in an additional two years and a doctoral degree in an additional 2-5 years. Fast degrees offer a quicker route into these advanced qualifications than the typical four-year bachelor’s program.

1964. The Super Giant supermarket in Rockville, Maryland. Color transparency by John Dominis, Life magazine photo archive. View full size.
I spent many weekends at this gigantic store on Rockville Pike. I think I even bought a prom dress here....is that possible? I very clearly remember going up to the glassed in observation balcony on the second floor, which gave an overall view of the store (as this photo shows). That way I could scan the aisles in order to see where my Dad was at any given moment. I love this photo, and HEY isn't that a time-traveling Blake Shelton a little left of the center wearing a white short-sleeved shirt??
The old registers were so noisy. No screens to check what was going on, just quick eye movement to try and keep track. Ahh...back in the day when every item had a price on it.
The hype of Super Giant was enough to entice these Northern Virginians into crossing The Potomac River into Maryland. The commute is commonplace today but not so much in 1964. We had not seen anything like it. Racks & racks of mass produced clothing and groceries, too! Grandmother bought the same suit in 3 different sizes. She and my mother got their money's worth. I was 13. It never left my closet.
My mom worked at Chestnut Lodge and would often stop by the Super Giant on Rockville Pike on her way home to shop for groceries -- and clothes for me! I was much too young to be brand- or fashion-conscious and I remember loving the little cotton A-line dresses that Mom would bring home. We lived in the District and a big thrill for me would be to drive up to Rockville with my parents on the weekends and shop at the Super Giant and Korvettes!
The third Super Giant is in White Oak. They took the "Super" off ages ago, but it is all still there. Mostly we went to the one in Laurel, which still retains its huge circa-1960 sign in the parking lot. Around 1980 it ate the old Kresge store next door, but by that time the department store features of the biggest stores were mostly gone. It's kind of funny -- the mall they built just south of the shopping center almost killed the latter, but now the shopping center is very busy and the mall may well be torn down.
When I was a kid (1950s) I used to go with my father to the grocery (Kroger's) on Saturday morning. I always helped bag the groceries, especially if they were short handed, and he would always remind me of his bagging rule: "Don't even think about putting the meat next to the soap or even in the same bag."
In the 50s as I remember it the majority of the cashiers were women and that was their only job at the store.
I notice that even as early as the 60s they had the security screens next to the cash register to keep unwanted fingers out of the till form the adjacent aisle.
I also remember making the family excursion to the Top Value redemption store to select the "FREE" gift that the household needed when we had sufficient stamp books filled.
Regrettably, the baggers are out of view to the right. My greatest nostalgia for supermarkets past concerns the bag boys, practitioners of a high art. They took pride in how compactly they could pack your groceries with attention to putting the fragile items on top -- not to mention that they all tried to outdo each other in speed.
I work for a division of Kroger called King Soopers in Colorado. My store, which opened in February 1960, has a lot in common with this one. They have tried to modernize it but you can still see the old store showing through in places. Great photo.
I enjoyed coming back to this photo for new comments -- I had one before, but long before the new post.
I live not far from Troy, Ohio, where the local newspaper just had an article about the bar code scanner. The very first item scanned -- anywhere -- was at the Marsh Supermarket in Troy, in 1974. Troy is less then 30 miles north of Dayton, where NCR developed the scanner. The Marsh store is still there, but NCR is leaving.
Oh do I remember that! My family lived in Rockville until 1965, and my mother usually took me along. After moving, we'd go to the Rockville Super Giant only if we needed to stop at the department store side.
The beige boxes that you see at Checkouts 6 and 7 were the Top Value Stamp dispensers. (The man in the T-shirt is signing a check on top of one.) They automatically spit out the right amount of those yellow stamps. We bought quite a few things with Top Value Stamps, including a well-built Westinghouse room dehumidifier.
The Giant Food at Friendship Heights had a conveyor belt but this store did not. This one had so much land, there was a huge sidewalk area out front where you could bring your carts -- but not to the car. Instead there were pairs of plastic cards, one with a hook for the cart, one with a hole. They had a three digit number, and the note "NO TIPPING". Took me a while to understand that wasn't about tipping over the carts. When you pulled up, an employee (probably young) put the bags in your car for you.
Speaking of brand names, I can see the stacks of Mueller's spaghetti in Aisle 6. It's the brand we ate then. (Now I know Farina flour has no business in pasta!)
The meat department is along the wall at the left. Deli and seafood were at the far back corner. There were a pair of "Pick a Pickle" barrels in front of the deli counter. One Dill, one Half-Sour. Good pickles, and great fish. The fish department has always been a source of pride for Giant. Of course this was back when a flounder was over a foot long, not these six-inch midgets we get today. All the fish were whole on ice, only gutted, and they scraped the scales, and cut or filleted the fish to your order.
The produce department starts behind the Brach's counter, and extends out the photo to the left. There were one or two manned scales there, where they would weigh your brown paper bag of produce, mark the price with a grease pencil, and staple it shut. If it was something tender like cherries, they would put "XX" on it, so that it would be correctly bagged. So the checkers only needed to know the prices of "piece" produce.
There was a "post mix" soda machine at the end of Aisle 12, 13, or 14, which would mix syrup and soda water into a cup. I'd often get a Coke. Probably 5 cents. I remember getting Mercury dimes as change from that machine -- this photo is from the last year of silver dimes and quarters. (Serious inflation was kicking in to pay for the Vietnam War.)
Cigarettes? Where were they? I should know, my mom smoked then. They were only in cartons, they were so dirt-cheap that nobody bought them by the pack, except in vending machines. They certainly didn't need to be kept "out of the reach of children" then. They were in a six-foot set of shelves somewhere.
I suppose I had no taste in clothing at the time, as most of my clothes came from there. Well, let's be honest -- they were much nicer and more stylish than clothes at Sears. (Oh, those horrible Sears Toughskin jeans with the rubber inside the knees!)
The department store side, which started to the right of the checkouts, was easily twice the size of what you see here. It had a lot of selection, and lots of good specialty counters. There was a photo counter at the front of the store (pretty much under the photographer, who was up in the balcony where the restrooms were). They sold things at fair prices, and gave good and honest sales help. There was a hobby counter in the far back right corner.
Speaking of the restrooms, they had seats that automatically flipped up into the back of the toilet, with UV lights to "sanitize" them. Spooky.
The current Giant Food store at that site, which my friends call the "Gucci Giant," is on the former department store side. When they first shut down the three Super Giant department stores, they left the grocery store were it was. I think about the time that White Flint Mall started "upscaling" Rockville Pike, they built a much fancier store on the old department store side.
Compared to now, Rockville Pike was very working class, very blue collar. Congressional Plaza (on the site of the former Congressional Airport) had a JC Penney as the anchor, and a Giant Food. Near the Super Giant was an EJ Korvettes, now the site of G Street Decorator Fabrics. A little off Rockville Pike was GEM -- Government Employees Membership. These were the days when "Fair Trade" pricing (price fixing) was still legal, and enforceable everywhere but the District of Columbia. But GEM, being a "membership" store, could discount, so that's where you bought Fair Trade products like Farberware at a discount. Of course, GEM had to compete with discount stores in the District, which Congress had conveniently exempted from the Fair Trade Act, so they could shop cheaply.
I grew up in Rockville, MD and was in this store many times. It was a full "one stop" department store with a grocery store attached. I loved going there with my mother because while she was grocery shopping I could make my way to the toy department. Kid nirvana!
This store was huge and it was quite unique in the same model as today's Walmart with groceries, clothing, etc. It is odd that the concept did not survive in that era considering the success of Walmart today. Personally, as a kid, I didn't like it when my mom got clothes for me from there. They were the off-brands.
I also remember the GEM membership store which was in the current Mid-Pike Plaza on the opposing SW corner, which was a precursor to Price Club except that it didn't have groceries.
Great picture & website. I remember them bagging your groceries, putting them in fiberglass tubs, and giving you a placard with a 3 digit number on it. The tub would go on a conveyor belt to the outside of the store, you'd drive up, and they'd take your placard and load your groceries. Wonder if there are any pictures of those...
This reminds me of Andreas Gursky's photo "99 Cent" -- it could almost have been taken in the same place.
The Super Giant was in the shopping center that now has a Sports Authority, Old Navy and a much smaller Giant.
Super Giant was similar to what you would find at WalMart now -- part department store, part grocery store.
I grew up in Rockville and we used to shop there all the time, until they closed that is. Guess the world wasn't ready for that combination.
I could be in that picture, but I'd be too young to walk.
Because people are much bigger these days, everything else is too! I remember shopping with my mom and for the big holidays and having to use more than one cart.
And look. No great big fat people. Sure, there a couple of middle-agers spreading out here & there, but you know the ones I mean.
>> the columns of keys were dedicated to 10's, 1's, 10 cents, 1 cent.
And a really good clerk would be pressing at least two keys at a time, which modern keypads can't do.
What could lure me from my busy, lurk-only status? Only this amazing photo!
Wow. Just wow. And not a cell phone in sight...
Say goodbye to this timeless shot and hello to the warehouse stylings of the local Costco. Grocery stores have been jazzing up their interiors hoping to attract and keep customers. It's not working. When I go to one, they are far less busy than even in the recent past. They have cut the payrolls down significantly here in San Diego due to losing profit to the warehouses.
Consequently, the help is far less competent, far younger, far less helpful, and far below the wage scales of the wonderful veterans they cannot really replace.
We need some grocery stores for certain smallish items that the warehouse giants will never carry. But they will dwindle down to a very precious few, and do it soon. Of course, this grandiose Super Giant displaced their mom-and-pop competitors. Same tune, different singers.
In Knoxville we had groceries called White Stores that looked like most any other grocery of the late 70's, early 80's: Dimly lit with greenish fluorescent tubes, bare-bones interior decoration, and indeed a Brach's candy bin.
My mom used Green Stamps for years. It took eons to fill a book. At the White Stores you could "buy" various pieces of merchandise. She got a floor lamp one year and a set of Corning Ware the next.
It seems like over the last 5-10 years, they've made grocery stores all upscale looking. Almost makes you feel like you're getting ripped off.
This is such an amazing photo -- I love it!
As someone who was still 12 years away from being born when this photo was taken, I'm not familiar with the old customs. What kind of items would have been wrapped up in brown paper like the woman in line at register 7 has? It looks like a big box, so that ruled out meats or feminine products in my mind ...any ideas?
[It's probably her laundry. - Dave]
As those cash registers (most likely) didn't display the change due, the cashiers actually had to know how to make change.
[Cash registers waaay back in 1964 (and before) did indeed show change due. And sometimes were even connected to a change-maker that spit your coins into a little tray. - Dave]
See the short story by John Updike for the perfect literary pairing to this photo. Well, in my opinion anyways; it's the first thing that came to mind upon seeing it.
My great-grandma lived in Rockville at that time and I remember those elephants!! What a floodgate of memories just opened up! Thanks again, Dave!
[Now we know why memory and elephants go together. - Dave]
This is what grocery stores looked like when I was a wee lass in the '70's. This could have been our local A&P, except the freezer cases would have been brown instead of white.
And I bet if you checked the ingredients on the packages those thin people are buying, you wouldn't see corn syrup as a top-ten ingredient of non-dessert items.
My mother kept note of her grocery bills for 40 years -- and in 1962 complained that it cost $12 a week to feed a family of four. Considering that my dad's salary was $75 a week, that was indeed a lot of money. We used to save Green Stamps, Plaid Stamps, and cigar bands for giveaways in the store.
[That's a good point. I had to chuckle when I noticed that the most these registers could ring up is $99.99. - Dave]
We don't check every price - just the sale prices which are listed in the weekly ad, available at the front of the store. Sometimes the ad price doesn't get properly entered into the computer, so I pay attention, especially if it's a significant savings.
When I was a kid back in the late sixties, there were stamp dispenser next to each cash register, with a dial a lot like a telephone dial that would spew stamps as the cashier turned it. I'm surprised they don't have a similar thing in this store.
[The grocery store we went to had an electric thingy that spit them out. Which looked a lot like the brown boxes shown in the photo. - Dave]
I worked in a store just like this while in high school in the early '70s. The main difference I've noticed is that Sunday is a major shopping day now. Our store was open on Sunday, because the crosstown rival was open. We (and they) didn't do enough business to pay for the lights being on. Two people ran the store on Sundays - a checker and a stocker/bagboy. And we didn't have much to do. All we ever saw was people picking up a single item or picnic supplies. How times have changed.
Now we check the receipt for mistakes made in shelf pricing. Did I get charged the sale price or not?
[So after your groceries are rung up, you go back down the aisles checking the receipt against the shelf prices? Or you make note of the shelf prices while you're shopping? That's what I call diligent. - Dave]
My supermarket experience goes back about 10 years before this one . . . but what a photo!
We had women cashiers, and man, were they fast. I was a stock clerk and bagger, and had to move fast to get the groceries in those brown paper bags (no plastic). I also had to wear a white shirt and bow tie. Naturally, we took the groceries to the car for customers and put them in the car or trunk, wherever asked. That was known as customer service.
We, too, gave S & H green stamps, although Top Value stamps were available a number of places.
The shot of the boy near the candy display reminds me of a time back in the very early 1960s where I did help myself to a piece or two. I looked up, saw an employee looking at me and boy, I was scared to death he would tell my parents.
Also, with the evolution in scanning and so forth, it brought to an end, more or less, of checking the receipt tape against the stamped prices for mistakes the checker made.
My father was a lifelong grocery man, making a cycle from clerk to manager to owner and finally back to clerking in the 1950s until he retired in 1966. He took pride in doing his job well, whatever it was. Each night, sitting in his green leather chair, he'd read our two newspapers, one local and one city, end to end. One night I noticed that he'd paused for quite some time at the full-page weekly ad for the market he worked at and I asked him why. He was memorizing the prices of the specials starting the next day.
This is just like the Super Giant on South Glebe Road in Arlington, close by where my family was living in 1964. It's where my mother shopped and I loved to accompany her and browse around. You could buy anything from a live lobster to a coat, and just like the Rockville store, it was 20 minutes from downtown Washington.
While I miss the concept of Blue Stamps or trading stamps, I get points from my store and they send me a check each quarter to use in the store.
I have one premium my parents redeemed from a trading stamp program - a really hideous waterfront print which they had in their home until they divorced. I claimed it from my father and it's hung in the laundry room of every house I've ever lived in since I moved on my own.
I remember the old way grocery stores were laid out, and I was always fascinated by the registers.
Link: Whatever Happened to Green Stamps?
[Down where I come from we had S&H Green Stamps -- Sperry and Hutchinson. And "redemption centers" chock-full of cheesy merchandise. Or you could get cash. When I was in college I chose cash. My fingers would be all green (and minty) from sticking wet stamps in the redemption books. - Dave]
Thats a highly posed photo. Everyone in the photo would have had to sign a model release for this to be published in Life. It is "possible" that the people where chosen for their looks.
[I've worked in publishing for over 20 years. You wouldn't need a release for any picture taken in a public place, and certainly not for a crowd or group shot. Actually you don't need releases at all. Some publishers may have looked at them as insurance against lawsuits for invasion of privacy. Probably most didn't bother. As for "posed," I doubt it. - Dave]
You know what would be right next to the electric doors (and that big rubber mat you had to step on to make them open) -- a row of gumball machines! Whatever happened to those? I loved just looking at them. Those glass globes, all those colorful gumballs. Sigh.
I add my request for more photos like this of just ordinary life from the '50s & '60s. Sure brings back memories of simpler and I think happier times. When I was a kid I used to imagine how marvelous life would be fifty years hence in the 21st century. Well I'm there now -- and I'd like to go back to the 1950s please.
[And you can, thanks to the magic of the Inter-nets! I wonder when we'll have those TVs you can hang on the wall like a painting. And Picture-Phones. Can't wait. - Dave]
My mother collected those, they were also used at Kroger's in the Middle South. What surprises me is that there are no cigarette racks at the checkouts. When I was a kid, every grocery store had the cigarette packs in racks right at the checkouts, with a sign screaming "Buy A Pack Today!" Maybe it was a Maryland thing. I also remember drugstores and groceries where cigarettes were sold only in the pharmacies. Go figure.
I, too, worked in a grocery store in the late-70s when I was in high school. As earlier commented, apparently not a whole lot changed from when this picture was taken to then (well, except the hairstyles and clothes -- which changed a *lot*).
I remember the registers well -- the columns of keys were dedicated to 10's, 1's, 10 cents, 1 cent. The large palm-contoured key to the right would "enter" in the decimal digits. Lots of noise and moving parts. A good cashier could move the goods along the conveyor belt as quickly as the scanners of today. The rapid spinning of numbers on the register display was mesmerizing. The one big holdup was the dreaded "price check" if a stocker had to be summoned -- but more often the checker already had the price memorized (good thing too, since price label "swapping" was a problem).
I stocked shelves using the incredibly complicated but efficient label gun used to print and affix the prices to the products. As a stocker you had a large holster that held this amazing device.
The more I think about it, things have not changed that much.
We still have lines, conveyor belts, "separators," shopping carts, impulse displays, checkers, baggers, stockers, butchers, and produce guys (the latter two being union jobs).
At least until the self checkout and then later RFID based systems (you just walk out of the store with the goods and the store will automatically figure this out and bill your card).
The 25,000-square-foot Super Giant that's the subject of this post opened November 12, 1962, at 12051 Rockville Pike at Randolph Road, anchoring a 205,000-square-foot discount shopping center with 3,000-car parking lot (and a "Jolly Trolley" to get you from car to store). Today it's a "lifestyle center" called Montrose Crossing.
Below: A long time ago, in a shopping center far, far away ...
My partner and I -- en route to Bob's Noodle House -- have wondered about the origins of a now-empty grocery store in Rockville, near "downtown." Perhaps this Super Giant? Certainly of this era.
You can just make it out in the middle of this view -- between the bus shelter and the tree -- through the parking lots.
[The Super Giant was at 12051 Rockville Pike and Randolph Road, where Montrose Crossing is today. See the next comment up. - Dave]
Even though it's far "younger" that most of the great photos that Shorpy features, it's one of the most fascinating you've ever put up here. I can't take my eyes off it.
This could be one of the few larger group Shorpy pictures where most of the folks are still alive. The cute girl in the cart would be my sister's age; the adults are mostly in the mid-late 20s to early 40s range, giving them ages from the high 60s to the mid 80s. The older kids would still only be in their fifties. Anyone from Rockville know these folks?
The Life cereal box behind the Rice Chex is virtually unchanged!
They go back to at least the 40's -- I remember them well. It was metal and specially notched for each of the stores which accepted them and where you had a charge account. Current plastic models, good for almost anything, are great but far less secure.
Sure were a lot of Caucasians back in 1964.
Are them Credit Card Imprinters on the registers? I didn't think grocery stores took credit cards until the late 80's.
[The imprinters would be for charge cards, which for gas stations, grocery stores and other retailers go back at least to the 1950s and the era of the Charga-Plate. Charge accounts go back even farther, to the early days of retailing. Below: Artwork from a 1966 newspaper ad. What goes back to the late 80s is using bank-issued credit cards as an everyday substitute for cash, as opposed to merchant charge accounts, which generally had to be paid in full at the end of the month. - Dave]
Didn't that fellow come from the Island of Misfit Toys? Nice to see him or her gainfully employed.
Look at the two ladies above checkout #7 and #8. They could be twins .. at least sisters. I love this photo ... there is so much to see! Funny how the Clorox label has not changed. That's good branding!

5 Suppliers on RangeMe Find Success at Kroger’s Go Fresh & Local Supplier Accelerator
Kroger’s search for fresh, local, and diverse suppliers just wrapped — and we have insights and advice from the product suppliers who won.This month saw many accomplishments, such as the approval of our Comprehensive Plan amendment. We were able to add conservation language to our T1 (over 10 acres) and our T2 (over 5 acres) that will allow houses to be clustered on smaller lots to prevent harm to conservation areas. The changes will not increase the number of homes that are allowed in these two areas.
If you have 10 acres and you are in T2, you will only be allowed to build 2 houses; however, you can locate the homes together on 2 acres to preserve the remaining 8 acres. We amended the Comp Plan to bring in the T3A area along the railroad track. This area starts on Crawford Road and continues to Frenchtown. We will have hike and bike trail provisions and a limit of 1 house per acre as recommended and 1.25 houses per acre described as suitable.
By making these changes, we have lowered the density in Argyle substantially. We began this process with three question and answer meetings to allow all citizens to ask questions and supply ideas. The feedback was very positive and the changes made to the comp plan were made after receiving input and hours of workshops to complete the changes. These changes came about as a result of many hours of hard work by the Argyle Town Staff, our Council and our Town Consultant, Trent Petty.
I would like to congratulate our newest staff member, Matt Jones, for accepting the position of Town Planner. Matt brings a high degree of excellence to our staff and I encourage you to stop by to meet him. I also want to congratulate Deborah Cottle and the Keep Argyle Beautiful Board for being awarded a $110,000 grant. Please let this great board know how proud we are.
Several council members and I went to Austin on Denton County Days to let our elected officials know what our needs and concerns are. The weather prevented many officials from making the trip, but we had the opportunity to get to know our town neighbors and were able to form a coalition between the towns to have a louder voice when going to the State Capital for requests.
We are working on our Second Annual Easter Egg Hunt that will take place on April 4th, following the Lions Club pancake breakfast with the Easter Bunny. We will have food trucks, live music and lots of Easter eggs. Only by our churches, school and town working together could we make this community event happen.
Our next order of business is implementing our Formed Based Zoning for commercial property. We have had several meetings collecting citizen input and are very close to having this two-year project completed.
Please like us on Facebook, or sign up for emails to keep informed of upcoming events. If you prefer to be contacted another way, call Kristi Gilbert at Town Hall, 940-464-7273. She will arrange for an alternate way to get information to you. We will continue to find ways to communicate and make sure that everyone stays informed. I thank Hunter Hardy and his task group for helping keep everyone updated on important dates and information.
I am thrilled to have the honor of serving Argyle along with Councilwoman Kay Teer and Councilman Jay Haynes for the next two years. We have a new staff that understands that maintaining our town charm and the importance of citizen input is our highest priority. The council has another year to stay on track and to keep the momentum going to see great things happen for our town.Dhongana Kodukkaa Video Song | Paramapadham Vilayattu

Sustainability Begins at Home
Last year, at a quarterly RTNF meeting, we updated our mission statement to include the goal of "eliminating the unsustainable use of fossil fuels" in three ways:
fostering the research and development of alternative energy sources
supporting environmental issue comprehension efforts
supporting energy use behavioral modification programs.
To attend that meeting, at which we resolved to tackle the world’s fossil fuel problems, our board members travelled a combined 7,200 miles. Between planes and automobiles, our attendance at that meeting burned roughly 100 gallons of fossil fuel, releasing approximately 1 ton of CO2 into the atmosphere.
We had decided to be part of the solution, but our mere attendance at that meeting meant that we were part of the problem.
“You must be the change you want to see in the world.”
- Mahatma Gandhi
This year, for our first quarterly meeting, everyone who does not live near the RTNF office stayed home. By attending the meeting remotely, using telephones and screen-sharing, we allowed almost 100 gallons of fuel to stay in the ground, and prevented the release of nearly 1 ton of CO2.
“A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."
- Lao Tzu
That ton of CO2 we saved represents only about 0.008% of the carbon emissions released in the world every second. So this was just one tiny step in a very long journey—a journey that may best be achieved, ironically, by not going anywhere. Sustainability begins at home.WEEKLY SCHEDULE

Osmangazi Elektrik Dağıtım Anonim Şirketi (OEDAŞ), which provides electricity distribution services in Afyonkarahisar, Bilecik, Eskişehir, Kütahya and Uşak provinces, has added a new one to its social responsibility projects. Within the scope of OEDAŞ Can Dostlar Project, with the cooperation of Animal Rights Federation (HAYTAP) and Tepebaşı Municipality, Treatment Rooms will provide solutions to stray animals who have health problems or will be cared for. The opening of the Treatment Room took place with the participation of Tepebaşı Mayor Ahmet Ataç, OEDAŞ Director Muzaffer Yalçın and OEDAŞ Distribution Services Manager Ahmet Tahir Ergenç.
Speaking at the opening, OEDAŞ Director Muzaffer Yalçın said, “In addition to providing electricity distribution services, which is our main business, we strive to respond to the needs of the society and the world, of which we are a stakeholder. With this perspective, we are taking our food and container distribution project, which we started in 2021 for our animal friends living on the street, one step further. Although it is not a problem for our animal friends living in our homes, the treatment and care of stray animals is an important problem and we thought that we should make a move as an institution. For this reason, thanks to the Treatment Room, which we opened with the contributions of HAYTAP and Tepebaşı Municipality, routine care and treatment of our animal friends will be possible. While thanking HAYTAP and Tepebaşı Municipality for their contributions to our project, I would like to give good news that we will add new projects to our animal friends in the coming period.

If you are fortunate to live in an area where you can have a finished basement you have probably dreamed of making the basement into your own retreat. Unlike the main level of your home plan where you need to be practical and have things like a kitchen, dining room, mud room, bedrooms and living spaces the finished basement plan can be whatever you can dream of. We have designed thousands of finished basement remodel plans and have thought of some really cool ideas for homeowners. How about a finished basement with a gun range, yes we have done that. We have had customers that wanted to showcase there cars behind there couch separated by wall to ceiling of glass, pretty cool idea if your show car is a 67 Shelby Mustang within arms reach of your frosty beverage. We designed a glass enclosure under a fireplace that housed a fat boy Harley Davidson, just because we can. Note that took some engineering. One of the most unique ideas we have designed would be an indoor/ outdoor pool with a grotto.
What do you think of when designing a finished basement plan? Homeowners all over the country have different ideas and we have compiled a list of the top 5 finished basement ideas that homeowners are wanting in their finished basement.
1. Wet Bar
Seems common that you would want a wet bar in the basement right? The wet bars have evolved from what I had in my parents home. Today's wet bars can be designed in many different configurations. Some homeowners want to have a wet bar just for snacks and sodas for the kids. Maybe a small under counter refrigerator, sink and a microwave for popcorn would suffice for a family wet bar with adequate seating around the bar.
Another design is the party wet bar. This design has an oversized refrigerator, sink, raised bar seating on all sides, television behind the bar and the built-in kegerator. Also, we like to add a wine cellar with an iron gate. Lighting on a party bar is crucial as well, typically under counter lighting is popular as well as a lit up bar sign. Don't forget to add a little extra space for bar games such as darts!
Last would be the game day wet bar. You will need plenty of seating, a lot of tv's, space for the game day dishes and crock pots and of course the oversized refrigerator. This bar design is the most common and one of our favorites. It can be designed with passion and love for your favorite team. Maybe you're a baseball fan and want authentic Wrigley field seats next to the bar, or original torn down bricks from Fenway Park as the base of the island. Maybe your wet bar is next to a pool table. Leave space on the built-in shelves for sports memorabilia and memories.
2. Fitness Room
When designing a house plan many homeowners' first request is a home gym. That is a place where they can go burn off the calories from the pizza they had from lunch. Not all fitness rooms are designed the same because today there are so many ways that people exercise. Home plans of the past designers would add a square room and call it an exercise room, today we like to put some thought into the area. We like to design yoga studios with an inside/ outside access and a lot of natural light. Lighting is key to a good yoga studio. As well as a good flooring for the yoga mats.
If your fitness is cycling do you spin alone or with a group? We have designed spin rooms with access from outside so your buddies can bring over their bikes and spin without having to carry the bikes through the home. Soundproofing the walls is also a good idea for spin rooms, not only because the bikes tend to get loud but many spinners crank up the music to help push through the inclines.
Maybe lifting is your exercise, this design requires a good amount of space and a solid concrete floor. When designing a fitness room for lifting you want to set up the area in stations. Many people start off with the dumbbell rack so having a wall with mirrors is a good start. Also adding a rubber floor on top of the concrete will help for the dropping of weights. Wall mounted or ceiling mounted fans is a plus to keep you cool. And like the Spin room, add soundproofing if you do not use headphones because no one works out without music!
3. Home Theater
When designing a home theater in your finished basement you have 2 ways doing it. The conventional way of designing a home theater room is to take the finished basements family room and add the oversized TV screen or projection screen to the room with a sound system. Many prefer this method because the room can be used as two spaces. Add some thought into space when you design it, maybe a ceiling detail will help define the space. Make sure you have blackout shades on the windows for watching movies during the day, a comfy couch and recliner is a must as well. The sound system does not need to be located in the room, only the speakers do. Today's components allow you to Bluetooth into different areas such as a storage room for the not so attractive components. Another popular idea is to add a raised snack ledge behind the couch for extra seating and eating. The sound in this type of space is not perfectly ideal, but with the technology of today, it's pretty good in an open space.
Another home theater design is the enclosed theater room. This space is designed with one purpose in mind and that is the home theater experience. A rectangular room with elevated seating and an oversized projection wall. Soundproofing the walls and ceiling will not only help with the above floors but it will entrap the sound. Rows of theater recliners and no windows will give the space a true theater feel. Add wall sconces and your favorite movie posters to make it your own.
4. Sports Court
Where do you go when it's cold and snowing outside, the sports court. Another great idea to add to your home design. This feature needs to be talked about during the design of your house plan because it will take up some space and require some engineering. We have designed sports courts on the basement level, below the basement level, below the garage floor and even below a driveway. How do you design below a garage floor or a driveway you ask hollow core forms. This product is an engineered concrete floor system that has oversized spans and allows us to create some pretty cool spaces. Sports courts are a great idea for many reasons. They allow for activity all season long regardless of the weather. It will keep your kids and their friends entertained for hours upon hours. And they are simply just impressive. What kind of activity can we do in a sports court? We have designed them for basketball, volleyball, hockey, baseball batting cages, skateboarding, and just an indoor playground.
When designing your sports court think about what you will be using it for. It is nice to have storage access for balls, nets, etc. Also, a bathroom nearby is a must. Some designs have windows that look in from above so you can see the athletes while you're prepping for dinner. If you are worried about the sound of a ball bouncing on the court try carpeting the floor with a thin commercial grade carpet. The ball will still bounce and the sound is a gone.
5. Golf Room
One of the worlds most popular sports is now available to play in your own man cave. Yep, you heard that right golf from inside your finished basement with a golf room. Today's home can be so much more than just sleeping quarters and if you are a golf enthusiast that can't make it to the greens a golf room will let you play at home and hit into a screen. Many golf simulators let you play the best courses around the world with a golf simulator. When designing one into your home plan an ideal space would need to be 15' wide x 15' deep and 10' high although you can go larger and possibly slightly smaller if you do not have space. When designing the room it is nice to have 3 side walls with the back wall open, possibly to a wet bar or great room. Other popular design trends are to have snack ledges designed into the room for your drinks and bench/ lockers to store the clubs and golf shoes.

Drake and Rihanna have a complicated history. The two were coupled up for a short period of time, becoming one of the most powerful pairings in the music industry. Drake had seemingly been going after the Bajan beauty for years and finally, they ended up hooking up and showing off their love on stage at a few awards shows. As you know by now, they are no longer involved in a romantic relationship with Rihanna moving on to her billionaire beau and Drizzy continuing his run as one of the most eligible bachelors in North America. If you were expecting a reunion on wax for this former couple, you can let all your hopes fly away because Rihanna just confirmed that she has no intentions of working on music with Drake in the near future.
During her new feature with T Magazine, the pop star confirmed the longstanding rumors that her next album would be reggae-based. She also spoke about possible collaborations that could take place on the project, noting that one man will not be on the tracklist. There is no official name or release date yet for R9 but the upcoming project will not include appearances from some of the speculated guests. Pertaining to Drake, RiRi said that she won’t be working with him soon. “Not anytime soon, I don’t see it happening. Not on this album, that’s for sure,” said the pop star on the chances of a “Work” sequel.
The Rihanna Navy also believed that a song with Lady Gaga may be in the works, to which Rih also disappointed any hopefuls. “It’s not in the books right now, but I’m not against it,” she said. During the interview, Rihanna also touches on her status as an immigrant, her new line with LVMH and all that she’s been working on in the last few years.CARDINAL George Pell says he will return to Australia to "clear his name" after he was charged with historic sex charges.
In a televised statement from the Holy See Press Office, Mr Pell said he was looking forward to his day in court and would defend the charges vigorously.

Consumers face paying hundreds of millions of pounds in unnecessary energy bill levies to fund household “smart meter” displays that companies have warned could be largely redundant
Consumers face paying hundreds of millions of pounds in unnecessary energy bill levies to fund household “smart meter” displays that companies have warned could be largely redundant.
Ministers want smart energy meters, which take automatic gas and electricity usage readings and send them back to energy companies, installed in every household in Britain by 2020.
Bills will initially rise to pay for the £12bn programme, which will fit meters in 30 million homes and businesses.
However, the Government claims it will eventually save consumers money because they will also be provided with an “in-home display” which enables them to see their energy usage in real-time, encouraging them to cut back and be more efficient.
But critics fear the Government has failed to keep up with the pace of technology and the rise of smart-phone apps.
They argue it is pointless to give customers separate display panels when using smart-phone apps could be a cheaper and more popular alternative.
Major energy company ScottishPower told the Telegraph that the displays, which cost £15 to £25 or even more, could be a waste of money and has called for a review of the entire £12bn programme to reduce costs for consumers.
Neil Clitheroe, ScottishPower’s chief executive of generation and retail said: “Removing the obligation of the mandatory requirement of in-home displays could significantly reduce the costs of the smart meter programme to consumers.
“Displays could be offered where appropriate but costs can be reduced by offering alternative information sources such as apps.
“We would like to see a careful review of the entire smart metering programme in order to reduce costs."
More than one million smart meters have already been installed, mostly by British Gas.
The national rollout of smart meters, originally due to begin in summer 2014, has now been delayed to autumn 2015 so that communications systems to transmit the data from meters can been installed.
Small energy supplier First Utility echoed ScottishPower’s calls for a rethink of the smart metering programme and use of in-home displays.
Darren Braham, founder and chief financial officer, said: "The benefit of smart meters is in the data and the insights they can give into individual energy use. It’s only by being informed about actual usage that we can understand what behaviour we can change to reduce energy consumption. The key to this is how data is presented to be visible, simple, engaging and insightful.
"We are already delivering this information to smart meter customers via an online portal and trialing a mobile app to give consumers the choice to consume this information in way that is best for them.
"We are also evaluating and trialing a number of IHDs which cost about £25 per unit. This cost will need to be funded within energy tariffs and some customers will be very happy to pay for them. However others may not, so its important that we have a debate about the best way of delivering usage information balanced against the cost of doing so."
A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: “In Home-Displays will give consumers easy access to information on their energy consumption in pounds and pence, to help them manage and control their energy use.
“Although suppliers will be required to offer in-home displays to their domestic customers alongside a smart meter, customers don’t have to accept one if they don’t want to.”Property Attributes

Written by Gerard Pearson – General Manager TechRentals August 2012
During this project a major construction company relied on TechRentals for their instrumentation requirements for many aspects of the work. These included water flow, environmental control, and validation of the radio communications systems to be used in the tunnel’s daily operations.
Ultrasonic flow metering systems provided by TechRentals were a very convenient and flexible way of providing non-invasive measurement of the high volume water flow rates encountered. The Parametric PT878 ultrasonic flowmeter proved effective in this application.
During construction work it is quite common to need dust abatement procedures; TechRentals again was able to provide dust monitoring systems with strategically placed instruments. Effective dust abatement techniques could then be implemented before unacceptable levels were reached and work was disrupted. The portability and flexibility of setting these devices made it a simple task for the operators.
Communications is an essential part of the tunnel infrastructure and here again TechRentals provided a solution to testing of radio broadcast and where needed re-transmission. The Antrisu MS2711D spectrum analyser was used in cellular telephone walk and drive tests to determine coverage and base station positioning and to conduct VHF/UHF signal surveys.
TechRentals offered the flexibility of having a “standing” order number which meant the engineers, and technicians were able to have the instruments delivered the same day by making one simple phone call. Local stock of the anticipated equipment needs was maintained with consultation with the construction contractor.Image Credit [TalkSport]
The UFC saw a rare visit to London this Saturday with Darren Till facing Jorge Masvidal at the O2 Arena.
Despite being a Fight Night event instead of a full blown UFC event, there were still 16,000 fans in attendance. Unfortunately, Till and the UK fans did not get the fairytale ending that they wanted, with the Liverpudlian being knockout by the veteran Masvidal.
Till looked dangerous early in the fight with a straight right knocking his opponent to the canvas, but he was unable to finish him off.
In the second round Masvidal replied in kind with a huge left hook connecting with the jaw of Till. He appeared unconscious before hitting the mat, whereupon the referee called the fight and covered the prone fighter before further damage was inflicted. The crowd were stunned into silence with the shot seemingly coming out of nowhere.
Till has been a rising star in the UFC, but suffered his first loss last year against then Welterweight Champion Tyron Woodley. This was supposed to be a relatively easy fight against a veteran fighter with a spotty record to get Till back on the right track, but there is never a sure fight in the UFC. One strike can change the whole complexion of a bout.
Whilst there are already rumours that Till will look to move back up to Middleweight, where he fought at in his early career, this loss will only intensify the speculation. Alongside this latest defeat, Till has failed to make weight for two previous bouts, although he was still victorious in both. The move would mean a less intensive weight cut, but it would also reduce the reach and size advantage that he currently has.
The Englishman is still very young at the age of 26, so one would expect to see much more from him despite this minor set back.
However, there was plenty of UK talent on display. Liam Edwards won via split decision against Gunnar Nelson. Nathaniel Wood won a third successive fight by submission and Molly McCann become the first English female fighter to win in the UFC.
Another notable name on the preliminary card was that of Joseph Duffy, who lost via unanimous decision to Marc Diakiese. Duffy has an impressive 38 second victory over Conor McGregor via an arm-triangle choke, although this was nearly a decade ago.
There was also the announcement that former Middleweight Champion Michael Bisping would be inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame. Bisping has a long career, kick started by winning the Ultimate Fighter Season 3 and ending with a 30-9 record, including more than a year as Middleweight Champion.
Till is seen by many as someone that can fill the hole left by Bisping in the UK, but he has a very long way to go. Hopefully events like this will help show Dana White and co. that the UK has a thriving MMA scene and we will be able to see more of them compete on the main shows and even challenge for gold.Abstract
Increased Risk of Ischemic Stroke in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease after Recurrent Dysnatremias: A Nationwide Population-Based Cohort StudyAuthor(s): Mu-Chi Chung, Tung-Min Yu, Ming-Ju Wu, Peir-Haur Hung, Chao-Hsiang Chang, Chih-Hsin Muo, Kuo-Hsiung Shu,Chi-Jung Chung
Abstract
Dysnatremias are the common problems in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients anda sso c iat ed with neurologic symptoms. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determinethe association between dysnatremias (either hypernatremia or hyponatremia) and risk ofstroke in CKD population. A retrospective cohort study was constructed using the claimsdata of the entire insured residents covered by Taiwan’s universal health insurance from2000 to 2011. Severe hypona tremia and hypernatremia are defined as the need of 3% sodiumchloride treatment and the need of admission respectively. A total of 365 hyponatremia and137 hypernatremia patients and 1983 matched comparisons were recruited. The incidenceof stroke was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, ClinicalModification. Cox proportional hazard regression and Kaplan–Meier curves were usedfor the analyses. In the analysis, CKD with dysnatremias were with more diabetes, heart fai lure, men tal illness, liver cirrhosis, cancer history and diuretics treatment. Compared withcomparisons, patients with dysnatremias, hyponatremia or hypernatremia patients had a 2.57(95% CI: 1.91-3.46), 2.35 (95% CI: 1.67-3.29) and 3.35 (95% CI: 2.04-5.50) fold risks of stroke afteradjusting for potential factors. There was similarly increased risk for ischemic stroke but not
for hemorrhagic stroke. In addition, patients with rec urrent dysnatremias, the risk of str okemuch increased [9.19 (95% CI: 5.79-14.6) for hyponatremia and 11.4 (95% CI: 5.66-23.1) forhypernatremia]. In conclusion, we suggest more intensive surveillance to prevent recurrentdysnatremias and ischemic stroke should be emphasized.4 servings

Abstract
Handwashing with soap, exclusive breastfeeding and the use of oral rehydration salts and zinc to manage diarrhoea episodes are apparently simple practices through which many child deaths from diarrhoea could be prevented. However, their success depends on caregiver behaviour, which has proved difficult to influence. This thesis describes the development and evaluation of a theory-based, multiple behaviour change intervention to improve uptake of these diarrhoea control practices in Lusaka Province, Zambia. The research was guided by a conceptual framework based on an ecological theory of behaviour and comprised three studies: formative research, outcome evaluation and process evaluation. Formative research focussed on actual practices of target behaviours and their determinants and informed the design of an intervention based on the motive affiliation. Outcome evaluation used a cluster-randomised trial to assess the effect of the intervention on handwashing with soap, exclusive breastfeeding, and use of oral rehydration salts and zinc to manage childhood diarrhoeal episodes. The intervention resulted in a small improvement in reported practice of exclusive breastfeeding. Changes in the other target behaviours were observed in areas where higher reach was achieved. The process evaluation used mixed methods and was guided by the intervention’s theory of change to explore how intervention content and delivery influenced behavioural outcomes. The process evaluation revealed that the intervention was popular and memorable, but it achieved low and variable levels of reach and did not change psychological mediators of behaviour. This research adds to the currently small evidence base in the field of multiple behaviour change for diarrhoea control. In light of the findings of low reach, further work is needed to ascertain whether delivery alone is the issue, or whether the intervention content also requires revision. The findings underscore the importance of modifying intervention delivery strategies to account for the local context.Rita Love Day, 79, of Dallas Texas passed away on Tuesday, January 14, 2020.

The following three case studies illustrate common problem types that ACDL has worked on for people with disabilities in New South Wales. All case studies have been de-identified.
CASE STUDY 1 – Assistance Animals
Maria has diabetes, depression, anxiety, agoraphobia and chronic back pain. Two years ago, her GP recommended that she get an assistance dog to assist with her disabilities. Maria has trained her dog to be a diabetic alert dog, so he can let her know if her blood sugar is crashing, and she also finds that her dog greatly assists her with her other disabilities via companionship, increased physical movement and general comfort.
Maria bought an apartment in a strata complex last year, and notified the strata manager that she had an assistance dog. The strata manager said it shouldn’t be a problem but she would need to submit an application to the body corporate. She did so prior to moving in and provided supporting documents from her doctor highlighting how the dog alleviated her disabilities. She also provided information on the level of training the dog had been given. However, the Strata manager said she could not keep the dog as she had not provided sufficient information about his accreditation, and therefore Maria had to be apart from her dog for some months.
After obtaining documents and consider Maria’s matter, ACDL wrote a letter to the Strata manager on Maria’s behalf, explaining that her dog satisfies the requirements disability discrimination legislation as the dog is trained to alleviate her disability and trained to an appropriate standard in a public place, and that Maria would be bringing her dog onto the property as at that date. Maria was then able to bring her dog onto the property with confidence.
CASE STUDY 2 – Education
Omar is a 13 year old student in Year 7 at a public school. He has autism, ADHD, ODD and anxiety, and has a behavioural management plan in place. Due to his disabilities, he often acts out in a silly or joking manner, including swearing, and he often lashes out physically when distressed, which is why his behavioural management plan focuses on ways to calm him down. The school follows a strict discipline policy for anything that is seen as misbehaviour: any student who swears or engages in any physical altercation of any level is automatically suspended for 2 days, and progressively longer suspensions occur for each new breach of behaviour.
Omar experienced increasingly long suspensions throughout year 7 for minor incidents of physical altercation with other students as a result of bullying, firstly for 2 days, then 4 days, then 5 days, culminating in a 20 day suspension for appearing to threaten a teacher. The teacher and other students interpreted this as clowning around rather than a genuine threat and the situation was quickly defused. The incident was not even mentioned by his teacher to his parents until the suspension occurred some days later. His mother repeatedly requested that the discipline and suspension policy be amended to take into account Omar’s tendency to act out inappropriately, and institute alternative forms of discipline in accordance with his behavioural management plan, such as detention or similar. The School did not do so, and after the last long suspension, Omar was again found to be misbehaving and was threatened with expulsion. the School had failed to make reasonable adjustments which would accommodate his disabilities despite repeated requests. ACDL explained the process and options for making a discrimination complaint, as well as providing referrals for assistance with challenging the procedural decision to expel him on other grounds. Omar’s mother said that she found the advice very helpful and allowed her to consider all her options clearly.
CASE STUDY 3 – Employment
Danielle was diagnosed with Hepatitis C. She worked at an accounting firm and did not tell them about it when she got the job. She was worried about what they would think and she did not think that her diagnosis would affect the way she did her job.
One day, she told a close workmate. When she came to work the next day, she found that her workmate had told other people. After lunch, there was a note on her desk calling her a ‘druggie’.
Danielle was really upset. After a few days, she decided to ask for a meeting with her employer to tell her what had happened. Danielle’s employer seemed shocked to hear about the behaviour of the others but was worried that if he said something it might cause conflict within the team. He said he would say something to the other employees, but kept putting off actually doing so.
Danielle approached ACDL for advice. ACDL told her that she might have a complaint of disability discrimination or harassment under the law, but Danielle did not want to make a complaint at this point in time. ACDL wrote a letter detailing the requirements under disability discrimination law and asking the employer to resolve the matter swiftly.
Upon receiving the letter, Danielle’s employer called an urgent staff meeting to discuss the importance of a safe work place and the policy on harassment and discrimination. Danielle’s complaint was then dealt with in accordance with the workplace grievance policy and the situation was resolved.+RUSCAL Posted July 16, 2003 Share Posted July 16, 2003 When.] Link to comment

City beat RB Leipzig in a real thriller last time out, 6-3 the eventual scoreline, while PSG were held by Club Brugge in a frustrating 1-1 draw. A huge amount of expectancy is placed on the Parisian outfit after their busy summer and impressive recruitment, the crown of which was of course Lionel Messi. He has yet to score for his new club and there have been suggestions of discontent, as Pochettino tries to fit the Argentinian legend, Neymar and Kylian Mbappe all into a functioning attacking outfit.
Meanwhile, City have stuttered once or twice at the start of the campaign, but made a big statement with a weekend win away to Chelsea to move second in the Premier League table ahead of their weekend clash with leaders Liverpool – making this midweek fixture a tricky one for Guardiola to juggle his team selection. The Spanish boss has already hinted at how tough the game will be: “What should we do? I don’t know..”

PSG vs Manchester City: Lionel Messi’s record against Pep Guardiola
Messi has also scored six times in his four previous meetings with Pep Guardiola, his former manager at Barcelona.
Messi and Guardiola have split those four matches at two wins each and if the Argentine were to score tonight it would also be his first goal for PSG and under Mauricio Pochettino.
If you’re after some pre-match reading tonight, this piece from Miguel Delaney is a must-read on Messi’s relationship with Guardiola and the unique challenges of managing the forward that now face Pochettino.

PSG vs Manchester City: Lionel Messi’s record against English sides
Lionel Messi lines up against English opposition in the Champions League tonight for the first time since May 2019.
That evening ended in arguable one of the worst defeats of his distinguished career, as Liverpool overturned a first-leg defeat to win 4-0 at Anfield in the semi-finals.
But Messi has enjoyed plenty of better nights against Premier League opposition – scoring a remarkable 26 goals against English sides in his career.
The Argentine has faced City six times, scoring six goals and winning five of those encounters.

PSG vs Manchester City
These two sides played out two enthralling matches in last season’s semi-finals.
City won both matches 2-1, but the first leg at the Parc des Princes was dominated by the hosts in the first half, as Pochettino’s side played some of their best football they’ve ever produced in the competition.
But Guardiola’s men flipped the script with an inspired second-half performance and the comeback was complete after Riyad Mahrez’s free-kick went straight through a disorganised PSG wall.

PSG vs Manchester City
Messi slots back into a PSG line-up that has won their past two fixtures in his absence, a 2-1 win over Metz and a 2-0 win against Montpellier.
Things weren’t quite that straight-forward, however, with PSG relying on a 95th minute from Hakimi to beat Metz, while the victory over Montpellier was overshadowed by reports of a row between Mbappe and Neymar.
The France international appeared to be frustrated that his Brazilian teammate had not passed the ball to him when in promising positions, with his anger rising after Neymar then did pass, but to Julian Draxler, for their second goal.
It’s been quite the week for Mauricio Pochettino as he attempted to downplay any disagreement between the two forwards.

PSG vs Manchester City team news
Lots of interesting bits and pieces to dissect from the starting line-ups, with Lionel Messi starting after missing PSG’s last two matches with a knee injury the headline.
Messi lines up alongside Neymar and Mbappe in a star-studded attack, although the trio have yet to click in their first three matches together for Pochettino’s side.
Donnarumma makes just his third start for PSG since joining from AC Milan in the summer, while Italy teammate Marco Verratti starts after also overcoming an injury problem.
Raheem Sterling gets just his fourth start of the season so far and it’s a big night for him – could we see the England forward play as a 9 at the Parc des Princes?

Manchester City team
Man City XI: Ederson; Walker, Laporte, Dias, Cancelo; Rodri, Bernardo, De Bruyne; Mahrez, Sterling, Grealish
That’s a really strong team from Pep Guardiola – just two changes from Saturday’s 1-0 win over Chelsea with Sterling and Mahrez in for Foden and Jesus.

Guardiola: I don’t know how to stop PSG
Pep Guardiola was keen to play the underdog card this week in this meeting of financial muscle. “What should we do? I don’t know,” he said of City’s challenge to shut down PSG’s qualities. . All of them are so good individually. They can combine and connect with each other. We’re looking forward to playing the game.”

PSG vs Man City: Live Champions League coverage
Good evening and welcome to our live coverage of the Champions League clash between Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City on the Independent.
The storylines to watch for in this encounter are too numerous to mention; from Pep against Poch, to Messi’s search for his first PSG goal, to both of these clubs desperate to end their wait for European silverware after petrodollars fuelled a rise to the top of the game. There are, however, just three points and no trophies on offer tonight, but after a draw against Club Brugge it’s arguable that PSG don’t have too much wiggle room to lose further ground – especially on home soil.
City, meanwhile, may need to juggle the line-up somewhat due to returning faces and a crunch Premier League clash at the weekend against leaders Liverpool – it’s a succession of big matches for Guardiola and Co right now and his choices this week may shape the course of their season between now and the new year.

Because Hayashi had complained to her, the landlady approached Rize Kamishiro and asked her to do something about the smell that was emanating from her apartment.
Since the smell didn't vanish, Hayashi visited Rize personally, but he was baited by her to come into her room. Later, his head is seen in one of Rize's bags.[1]The hotel is really nice, with adorable staff, comfortable bedding and a lovely Wohnstuba concept. But I had chosen to overnight in Brig where I work because of an early start the next morning. It was unfortunately not possible to sleep, as the pub/club under the hotel played loud music until after midnight - on a monday evening, which I didn't expect. Closing the window didn't help as the sound resonated in the building. Once the music stopped it was fine though. It's such a pity that this detail spoils a night whereas the hotel and staff put so much effort into an enjoyable stay.
Great service, homely atmosphere, center of town, great terrace to have a glass of wine on, great rooms, great bathrooms with Milton&Brown soap, what's not to like? We loved it and will come back. The only downside is the noise from outside in the summer months and the heat in the room, both of which can be resolved by a fan that the hotel provided. Lovely.
Very modern, tasteful, casual and super-friendly. Home away from home! Although in the middle of town very quiet at night. Nice views and hotel staff are very friendly, helpful and attentative. Will visit again..
the location is very central. that can mean that is a bit loud in the weekend evenings. the rooms seem to be all different. mine was large enough for one person. on the 4th floor. nicely decorated. not too loud. no view but light. breakfast was fantastic. personnel is extremely nice and helpful brig is a nice little town, well preserved. with some major historic sites - the castle amongst them.

This theme is always fun because it helps us use our stencils to create something fun that can be a part of the wardrobe. Last year we created and embroidered a skirt we still love.
This time we decided to fancy up our little one's dress to create a fun play day dress.
Here's a look at it.
Here's a quick video sharing the process:
We've used the Play Everyday Dress Up L599 stencil by Cat Kerr. We took an imprint of the image and the phrases on our dress by dabbing Black and Blue Acrylic paint on the front and back of the dress.
We then used beads and sequins to highlight the dress, some words and the strings of the swing. This adds a pop and uplifts our dress.
On the back, we decided to merely stencil acrylic paint and achieve a shadow effect scene.

Beads, Sequins
We hope you've enjoyed our creation!
Happy crafting!
Hugs,
Sunila & Aditi
Delightful project nicely carried out!
Oooooweee I Love this idea!! Especially love all the different size/shape sequins.
Nice video, but I am wondering how you would machine wash the dress?? did you have to heat set the paint??Italy based travel agency announces partnership with eRevMax

The slow-moving storm hit with sustained winds of 105 mph (169 km/h), toppling trees, cutting power and dropping extreme amounts of rain, according to CNN.
After landfall, the storm weakened into a Category 1 hurricane. It is now about 15 miles west/northwest of Pensacola, Florida and has maximum sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h), according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC).
"Historic and catastrophic flooding is unfolding," from Mobile Bay, Alabama to near Tallahassee, Florida, according to the NHC. This rainfall will likely lead to widespread river flooding, according to the NHC. This morning, Hurricane Sally was moving at an extremely slow pace, near 3 mph (6 km/h), prolonging exposure to rainfall and high winds. As of 11 a.m. EDT, the storm has sped up slightly to 5 mph (7 km/h).
Related: A history of destruction: 8 great hurricanes
Sally has already dropped up to 18 inches (46 centimeters) of rain, "creating catastrophic flash flooding," the National Weather Service Weather Prediction Center wrote on Twitter this morning. The storm may drop somewhere between 10 to 35 inches (25 to 89 cm) of rain across parts of Alabama and the Florida Panhandle, according to the NHC.
"Life-threatening" storm surges are occurring along portions of the coast from Alabama to the western Florida Panhandle, including Pensacola Bay in Florida according to the NHC. More than 430,000 people in the Florida Panhandle and southern Alabama have already lost power, according to poweroutage.us. At least 3 to 4 feet (0.9 to 1.2 meters) of water flooded downtown Pensacola, according to a photo retweeted by the National Weather Service in Mobile.
Water levels at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) tide stations recorded "moderate flood levels," with more than 5.5 feet (1.6 m) above normal high tide this morning, NOAA's Ocean Service tweeted. High-water rescues were underway Wednesday morning, according to CNN.
The storm is currently moving in a north/northeastern direction. It is expected to hasten its pace "slightly" later today and tonight and quicken even more on Thursday. The center of Sally will move across the western Florida panhandle and southeastern Alabama through early Thursday and move over central Georgia on Thursday and over South Carolina Thursday night, according to the NHC.

Asia continue to dominate label market to 2022
The region is expected to take up 48% of the worldwide label market by volume in 2022.
A new Smithers Pira report (The Future of Label Printing to 2022) revealed that label markets are set for steady growth and expected to expand at an average of 2.8% year on year to yield a total value of $39.50 billion in 2022.
With over 465 billion A4 sheet equivalents in 2017, Asia is today 46% of worldwide label market by volume.
Above average growth will push this to 48% by the end of the Smithers Pira study period. The only region with higher annual expansion across this period is the nascent African market, but even by 2022 it share will be less than 4% of global supply. In 2017 this market is worth $34.46 billion globally.
Over the next five years, market growth will expand at an average of 2.8% year on year to yield a total value of $39.50 billion in 2022. This contrasts with an annual growth rate of just 1.2% in the wider print market, as traditional end-use applications see margins eroded by electronic media.
Labels, like packaging are more resilient in the face of this threat, and there is still significant commercial potential especially in newer markets where population are still making the transition to buying more labelled products.
Narrow-web label printers have pioneered the use of digital (toner and inkjet systems) across the past decade, and this trend is far from exhausted with new high volume machines be launched every year. The value share of digital printing is now 29.3%, up from 20.8% in 2012 – this will rise to 35.6% in 2022. In volume terms the shares are lower 13.0% in 2017, and 17.9% in 2022 – reflecting digital’s concentration in shorter run, higher value applications.
Many print service providers are now adopting a hybrid working approach and progressively channelling work onto digital presses as their productivity increases and the average run lengths demanded by customer decline.
Significantly within digital the growth rate for toner printing will be relatively low around 1.0% per year, while the value of inkjet work will grow at 16.5% per year across the same period. For analogue presses reasonable expansion is predicted for sheetfed and coldest litho; although the later process is confined to higher volume low value prints.
Within its analysis of label formats, Smithers Pira shows that pressure sensitive labels are the dominant product. These have a 58% market share by value in 2017; and above average growth will see this increase progressively across the next five years. There will also be new demand for sleeves and in-mould labels, while the market share for wet-glue labels will fall.Insensitivity of mass loss of Icelandic Vatnajökull ice cap to solar geoengineering

- 6Arctic Centre, University of Lapland, 96101 Rovaniemi, Finland
Abstract. Geoengineering by stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) may reduce the mass loss from Vatnajökull ice cap (VIC), Iceland, by slowing surface temperature rise, despite relative increases in ocean heat flux brought by the Atlantic Meridional Circulation (AMOC). Although surface mass balance (SMB) is affected by the local climate, the sea level contribution is also dependent on ice dynamics. We use the Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM) to estimate the VIC mass balance under the CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) RCP4.5, 8.5 and GeoMIP (Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project) G4 SAI scenarios during the period 1982–2089. The G4 scenario is based on the RCP4.5, but with additional 5 Tg yr−1 of SO2 injection to the lower stratosphere. By 2089, G4 reduces VIC mass loss from 16 % lost under RCP4.5, to 12 %. Ice dynamics are important for ice cap loss rates, increasing mass loss for RCP4.5 and G4 by 1/4 to 1/3 compared with excluding ice dynamics, but making no difference to mass loss difference under the scenarios. We find that VIC dynamics are remarkably insensitive to climate forcing partly because of AMOC compensation to SMB and low rates of iceberg calving making ocean forcing close to negligible. But the exceptionally high geothermal heat flow under parts of the ice cap which produces correspondingly high basal melt rates means that surface forcing changes are relatively less important than for glaciers with lower geothermal heat flow.

The legal team for Summer Zervos, one of two women with ongoing defamation lawsuits against Donald Trump, said it has amassed compelling evidence corroborating Zervos’ sexual assault allegations against the president. The evidence, which was presented in a recent court filing, includes Trump’s own cellphone records and details from his private calendar.
The cellphone records, first reported by The Associated Press on Monday, indicate that Zervos received a call from Trump’s phone on the same day in December 2007 that she claims he kissed and groped her without her consent at California’s Beverly Hills Hotel.
The phone records ― listed in an Oct. 24 court filing but previously redacted ― also show a call from Trump’s phone to Zervos’ the following afternoon, as well as two calls from Zervos’ phone to Trump’s in the two months that followed, the AP reported.
Zervos’ attorney Mariann Wang told the outlet that the phone records show “that numerous specific details that Ms. Zervos has provided” about her interactions with Trump “are true.”
Trump’s lawyer Marc Kasowitz dismissed Zervos’ claims on Monday, telling the AP that her allegations were “entirely meritless and not corroborated by any documents.”
Zervos, who met Trump as a contestant on the reality show “The Apprentice,” is one of multiple women who accused him of sexual misconduct in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election.
Trump, then the GOP presidential nominee, vehemently denied the women’s allegations, saying in October 2016 that every one of them had “lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign.”
Zervos, the AP noted, is a Republican.
Responding specifically to Zervos’ allegations, Trump, who hosted “The Apprentice” for 14 seasons, said he only “vaguely” remembered her as a contestant on the reality show and that he “never met her at a hotel or greeted her inappropriately a decade ago.”
Zervos’ lawyers, however, have contended that Trump’s phone and calendar records undermine this defense.
According to Trump’s calendar records, presented in the same Oct. 24 court filing, Trump was scheduled to stay at the Beverly Hills Hotel on Dec. 21, 2007 ― the same day of the alleged assault and Trump’s call to Zervos.
Though Trump’s alleged meeting with Zervos was not on his calendar, the woman’s attorney said the records “strongly corroborate” Zervos’ allegations against Trump and “prove” that he lied about the encounter.
Zervos claims Trump forcibly kissed her and pressed his genitals on her when she visited him at the Beverly Hills Hotel. She said she’d previously reached out to Trump because she admired his business achievements and had hoped to work for him. But when she arrived at his bungalow at the hotel, he “immediately started kissing [her] open mouthed,” according to her lawsuit against him.
Though she repeatedly rebuffed his advances, Trump touched her breast and pushed his genitals against her and tried to kiss her again, the complaint alleged.
Zervos said Trump also kissed her on the mouth twice without her consent during a meeting at his office in Trump Tower a few weeks prior.
“Donald Trump lied again, and again, and again, and again, and again,” Zervos’ suit said of Trump’s repeated denials of sexual misconduct. “In doing so, he used his national and international bully pulpit to make false factual statements to denigrate and verbally attack Ms. Zervos and the other women who publicly reported his sexual assaults.”
“Mr. Trump knew that his false, disparaging statements would be heard and read by people around the world, and that these women, including Summer Zervos, would be subjected to threats of violence, economic harm, and reputational damage,” the complaint added.
Zervos ― who said she first contacted lawyers about Trump’s alleged misconduct in 2011 and sent an email to Fox News about the allegations in 2015 ― is seeking a retraction and an apology from Trump, as well as unspecified damages.
Trump’s lawyers, who have fruitlessly attempted to get Zervos’ suit dismissed, have argued that the president’s remarks were his own opinions and thus protected free speech.
Bloomberg reported last week that Trump had agreed to answer questions under oath from Zervos’ lawyers on or before Jan. 31.
The president is also facing a second defamation lawsuit from a woman who accused him of raping her in a department store in the 1990s.
E. Jean Carroll, author and longtime Elle magazine columnist, filed her suit against Trump in New York state court on Monday.

Have you ever wondered if you are paying more taxes than you owe? Industry experts estimate that 2 million Americans overpay their taxes every year. The overpayment is estimated at $1 billion annually. How can you make sure that you are not one of these Americans who is paying more taxes than they owe?
Wealthy people with more complicated returns and a variety of income streams are often in the best position for employing strategies to lower their tax rates. Billionaire Warren Buffet claimed that he paid a lower tax rate than his secretary, for example, because most of his wealth was in company stocks rather than a salary. Buffet was not bragging about tax evasion but illustrating the fact that his wealth put him in a position to use tactics and deductions that are unavailable to someone on a middle-class income. Incidentally, Buffet used this memorable example to bolster his argument that wealthy people (like him) should be paying a higher tax rate than the law currently demanded.
Perhaps you have some passing familiarity with some of the strategies that wealthy people use to avoid overpaying income tax: contributing to investment accounts, creating an HSA (Health Savings Account), starting a 529 Education fund, creating an LLC (Limited Liability Corporation) as an umbrella company to manage multiple investments, creating a defined benefit plan, to name a few.
These are all important tips worth considering. However, these are only five strategies for lowering your tax rate out of dozens or hundreds. So how do you know which of these strategies applies to your unique situation? The chances are high that you may not know unless you are an experienced and well-trained tax professional. That is why the #1 pro-tip that the wealthy use for lowering their tax rate is to hire a tax professional.
A tax pro, you say? Isn’t that for rich people?
Not so fast. Before you make a decision, consider this real-life example:
My husband and I grew up with middle class parents who cleaned their own homes and even fixed their own cars on occasion. They canned fruit during harvest season, and many of our clothes were sewn by hand. For our parents, hiring an income tax lawyer to file our family’s tax return would have seemed as unnecessary – as uppity – as hiring a butler.
Perhaps that’s why I felt so conspicuous the first time I walked into the office of an income tax lawyer. I was in my late 20s and living in New York City. My spouse and I had filed our joint tax return for several years, too, just like our parents. But this year, a few things had changed. We’d had a baby. My husband was in graduate school and had a military income. I was using precious space in our tiny NY apartment to run two separate small businesses. Taxes were becoming more complicated.
The year that I first paid a tax attorney, I spent hours working through our federal tax return using a highly-recommended computer program and still felt unsteady on my feet. What if we got audited? I was not at all sure that my tax assumptions were legally viable.
So, after I had figured out our combined tax return to the best of my ability, I took our taxes to a recommended tax attorney as a trial. How would my tax return compare to the tax attorney’s?
Like so many others before and after me, I found that hiring the tax attorney more than paid for itself. Even after paying the attorney’s fee, we saved significantly on our taxes that year as compared to the return that I would have filed on my own.
We haven’t looked back – we’ve hired a tax professional every year since. Besides paying a lower tax rate, we have benefited from the peace of mind that comes with knowing that any audit would be managed by someone else.
This example mirrors the experience of many people who have availed themselves of professional tax help. Without a tax professional or the right software, the chances are high that you’ll miss some credits and deductions to which you are legally entitled. Once you are in a position to diversify your retirement accounts, invest in real estate, or if you are managing multiple income streams, then getting tax help is the best method to reduce your tax rate safely.
Software programs are increasingly helpful. They can allow you to reduce your taxes by asking you basic questions about your life, probing for possible deductions. But software programs are somewhat limited in making suggestions or in dealing with big life changes, starting a business, or strategizing for multiple incomes and investment streams.
Of all the tax-reducing strategies, the one that most wealthy people have in common is hiring a tax professional to help them apply the tax code to their unique situation. Some wealthy people start multi-generational trusts; some don’t. Some wealthy people invest in opportunity zone programs as a way to defer capital gains; some don’t. What about adding energy-efficient improvements to my home and deducting the cost? There are so many ways to reduce the tax burden that it would take hours for an individual taxpayer to research them all.
Do you imagine Warren Buffet filing his own taxes rather than hiring a tax attorney? Do you imagine him sitting up late at night in front of his laptop, talking back to a tax filing software program? I don’t either.
How do wealthy people lower their tax rates? First and foremost, they hire qualified and experienced tax professionals.Zucchini Again
Linda List
Two Sisters Cook
Zucchini are probably appearing on your doorstep this time of year, left by your neighborly gardener. It’s one vegetable that seems to thrive in every vegetable garden. Wikipedia describes zucchini or courgette as a summer squash, of Mesoamerican origin. A zucchini is a thin-skinned cultivar of what in Britain and Ireland is referred to as a marrow.
Linda: Well that gives us some scholarly information about the zucchini squash, but let’s talk recipes, delicious ways to serve up this prolific vegetable.
Lucy: We all have enjoyed zucchini bread that can be freshly baked or frozen to serve year round as a healthy treat for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. But lets see if we can dig up some unusual ways to utilize this summer squash.
Linda: My WW coach, Kathy, offered a quick and easy method that is perfect when preparing dinner after a busy day. She calls it Microwave Zucchini In A Flash. Using low or no fat sour cream helps keep the calories or WW points down.
Lucy: I discovered a delightful recipe in a Williams Sonoma Cookbook featuring only chicken recipes. It’s called Chicken Breasts with Cherry Tomatoes, Zucchini and Olives. And that describes it exactly. Preparing all the ingredients before you start cooking, so they are available as you use them, makes it an easy recipe to follow.
Linda: I had an opportunity to meet Chuck Williams several years ago. He was in his 90’s but still came to work every day. He told me how he ended up in the specialty kitchen gourmet business. His family had a hardware store in Sonoma, California. He was in Europe during the WWII. After the war was over he stayed on in France and discovered that their cookware varied quite dramatically from what cooks in the United States were using. It was heavier than the aluminum pots so prevalent in the 1940’s in this country. Some were cast iron covered in colorful enamel. Some were copper pots, and things like whisks were used for beating eggs. He purchased supplies bringing them back home and entertained friends at dinner parties. He found himself returning to France to purchase items ordered by his American gourmands. The hardware store began to sell French cookware and eventually Williams Sonoma was born! He passed away just a few years ago at 100 years of age.
Lucy: That’s an interesting story. The recipe is a tasty one that is good as a summer family meal or to offer as a specialty dish for dinner guests.
Linda: I found a different style dip called Zucchini Onion Summer Dip in the Food Network Magazine. The squash is a low calorie vegetable. If you’re watching calories and need a summer dip for a get together, social distancing of course,
this could be served with celery and carrots as well as chips. If you have a food processor, it’s easy to blend this up.
Lucy: Let’s get these recipes ready so our readers can start using the squash they find, left on their front porch.
Kathy’s Microwave Zucchini in a Flash
Slice slice a zucchini squash and an onion and put it in a a microwave safe baking dish Put it in the microwave for about five minutes then take it out and top it with a low-fat or nonfat sour cream. then Sprinkle over shredded cheddar cheese and cover with a lid or foil so the heated squash melts the cheese.

Melton and his doggies 2013
Most readers here will be familiar with the name "Charles Melton" aka "Black Beard Charlie", and where he fits into the TLB story (nightmare). But here's a recap anyway: He was a friend of Paul Watkins prior to either of them meeting the "Manson Family" et al. He is referred to as "Black Beard Charlie" in Paul Watkin's book, "My Life With Charles Manson". The book, a rare and usually expensive find in print form, is available online in its entirety courtesy of ColScott, at the Colonel's site: (The Chapters begin in June 2006. Chapter 1 as well as Chapters 24 and 25 are relevant here.).
Though the following excerpt details Watkin's return to Topanga Canyon after a stay in Northern California; he and Melton had travelled to Northern California together, with stays in Big Sur and the Haight, among other stops. Melton was with Watkins when Watkins was arrested in Half Moon Bay, CA (for possession).
From Little Paul's book:
Black Beard [Charlie Melton] was another "runaway" from L.A. who had shined-on suburbia to take to the hills. He was nineteen, a full-on Kerouac “dharma bum” who could assume the full lotus at the drop of a hat and fall immediately into trancelike meditation. He was tall and slender with a gaunt, El Grecolike face which seemed compatible with his vagrant life-style. Brown, wide-set eyes highlighted his dark complexion. His hair hung to well below his shoulders and was tied at the base of his skull with a strip of rawhide. Black Beard was a student of Eastern religions and he taught me a lot about survival in the wilderness with a pack on my back. We had made camp at Hot Springs canyon, near Esalen, and were committed to the gypsy life, wandering through the forests and along the California coastline.Melton, originally from Reseda, is listed as also residing during his lifetime in Agoura Hills, Malibu (Topanga), Big Sur, and Ukiah,CA.
Melton was living in the infamous area of Lower Topanga known as the "Snake Pit" when he first met Manson, etc. In "Helter Skelter", Bugliosi writes of Melton's self-professed first visit to Spahn Ranch as being in March of '69. Melton told the story of Tex admiring his beard, and allegedly saying: "Maybe one day Charlie will let me grow a beard.".
From "The Family" by Ed Sanders, 2002 Ed., Thunder's Mouth Press. Available on Amazon:
..."On July 4th, Gypsy, aka Yippie aka Cathy Share and aka Manon Minette, saw fit to take herself to Topanga Lane near the beach in Topanga Canyon to visit Charlie Melton, a bearded friend who lived in a canvas-covered stake truck notable in that it had an automobile seat perched atop its cab.Otterstrom worked, during this time frame, as a cook and dishwasher at the Topanga Kitchen, a restaurant located at the Topanga Shopping Center (at the junction of Topanga Cyn Blvd and Old (Topanga) Cyn Rd. The Market that Sadie walked to to get supplies and soup during the Hinman killing is still there. The Canyon Kitchen, long gone, was owned by Susan Acevedo, Neil Young's first wife. "Manson Family" members frequented the Kitchen often.
... Linda Kasabian, her husband Bob, Blackbeard Charles and Jim and Juli Otterstrom - all were living in the stake truck, preparing for that trip to South America. Charles Melton had inherited around $23,000. and some of that was going to pay for the trip. The rest he had been giving away, much to the delight of various Topanga residents.
Inside Melton's trailer, Gypsy picked up his guitar and began to sing "Cease to Exist. "Gypsy began to tell Linda about the Spahn Ranch and particularly about Charles Manson... The others in the trailer were shining Gypsy on, but Gypsy said that their ego wouldn't let them listen to the Truth. Mrs. Kasabian, though reconciled with him for only seven days, was having trouble with him. It seems that already he and Charles Melton had cut her out of the trip to South America. Gypsy invited her to come to the Spahn Ranch. Linda had been planning that day to go to the July 4th Love-In on Topanga beach but she went to the Spahn Ranch instead, taking her 16-month old (daughter) Tanya with her."
Once at Spahn, Linda hooked up with Tex Watson and told him about Melton's inheritance. He "convinced her" to go back and steal the money from Melton.
... "July 5th was a day of happiness for the Family. In the morning, Tanya, Linda, Gypsy, and Mary Brunner went to Topanga Canyon to go to the beach. They ran into Charles Melton and Bob Kasabian behind the Topanga Shopping Center by the creek. They smoked some hellweed and Bob and Charles went off to downtown L.A. to get their passports for their trip. Linda and the girls drove to Melton's canvas truck-house to get her possessions. She dug up a buried Bull Durham pouch full of thirty pink acid tabs. She packed up her gear... Then she went into Melton's duffle bag and removed a Velvet tobacco pouch containing fifty $100-dollar bills that she took to Chatsworth to give to the Wizard: $5,000.
... He (Charlie) was told about the probability that Charles Melton and friends would be coming to the ranch to get back the money. Manson then decided to send Linda to the cave down the creek behind the ranch, to hide from the wrath of her husband.
... All the next day, high up the hill by the cave, the young ladies scanned the dirt driveway of the Spahn Ranch below with binoculars. And, just as predicted, Mr. Melton, Bob Kasabian, and Jim Otterstrom pulled into the drive in their stake-bed truck. Charles Melton asked someone by the boardwalk to locate Gypsy and Linda. The person left and returned with Manson, who rewarded Melton with a kill me/ kill you routine. According to Melton, Charlie said: "Who are Linda and Gypsy? I can't even remember their names."
Melton replied: "They took $5,000 from me."
Manson said: "What's money? Nothing is yours. "Then Charlie took out his knife and handed it to Melton, urging him to kill Charlie with Charlie's own knife. Mr. Melton refused the proffered knife. Manson said: "Then maybe I should kill you to show you that there's no such thing as death."
At this point, Melton and company were quick to drive away into the wind."
Melton and Bob Kasabian, alleged by some to have been lovers, remained close friends and were photographed attending the TLB trial together in 1970.
Also early in 1970, during the fire/attempt on Paul Watkin's life, Paul was in a camper (microbus?) belonging to Mark Ross, parked outside of Melton's place.

Bugliosi wanted to use Melton on the witness stand to testify as to Tex's alleged remark about growing a beard, but says by that time Melton was unreachable, having gone off with Bob Kasabian to Hawaii to "meditate in a cave".
Melton and Jim Otterstrom remained lifelong friends, according to Jim Otterstrom. They are those rare people who lived their "hippie ideal" (beautifully idealistic and participatory) beliefs throughout their lives. I really admire that. Jim Otterstrom wrote in his blog that he and Melton both attended the same school in Reseda albeit several years apart, became friends, and through the years continued to get together a couple of times a year.

I'm sad to say Jim Otterstrom has passed away. His blog tells of his love for the earth, animals, and nature, and his family and friends.You can read it at:
homeearthgarden.blogspot.com
Here is an obituary that really captures his essence and legacy:
Another thing I really dislike about Manson: I don't believe, and yes, to state the obvious, it's just
my opinion, that he has ever had an original thought in his head. We can ask the philosophical question: "Does anyone really ever have an 'original' thought, or is there truly 'nothing new on heaven or earth...'"? But while Manson and his "band of merry humpers", as Phil Kaufman referred to them, were polluting the gorgeous wilderness around Spahn with oil pans, tires, and hulks of stolen Volkswagons that remain there to this day while he milks the whole ATWA schtick; Melton and Otterstrom and others like them were living to make the world a better place. Idealistic, maybe. But nevertheless wonderful. And man, it sure would be a great time to sit down and hang out with Blackbeard Charlie, who now goes by the nickname: "Tower Charlie". Smoke some hellweed, and see where the conversation takes us...

True dat, Max. I've gotten a bunch of stuff from him, & he's always been great. Everyone should check out his site, if they haven't already.
I had a copy of Watkin's book in the late 70s, in high school, & lent it to a friend. Goodbye, book. Then last month on e-bay there was a copy only 1 bidder noticed, & it went for 19.99! I had meant to swoop in & grab it, & forgot all about it. It actually sold for the $19.99 bid. I'm still mad at myself over that. I forgot about another rare one listed last week and it went for under fifteen!
That's an INCREDIBLE price Trilby. I remember scoring one on eBay in '99 for $65 and that was a STEAL at that time.
Thank you Trilby! I've always enjoyed your comments and I'm so glad to see you are now a contributor. This is great!
Hi Suze! I think you're great and LOVE your comments! Thanks so much for the welcome - I told Matt I feel like an AA pitcher called up to the big leagues. Nervous as hell, 'cos contributors and posters at this blog are awesome. Nervous as hell about joining the team. Matt has been VERY patient. He and Mrs. Matt are just great.
A teaser - my next post will be about one of the victims. Some new info. ;) 😊
Sorry for sounding like a moron in my last comment - I loathe posting by phone, I use the same phrases and adjectives and then I'm too lazy to proofread on the small screen hence my comments that read as if they were written by a slap-happy 4 y.o.
Gotta love a girl who uses baseball for metaphorical purposes, even if she's a Phillies fan...
OMG... A PHILLIES fan????!!!!! DODGERS!!!!!!!! Vintage Dodgers since the 70s!!!!!!!! (I root for the Angels merely for Scioscia's sake.). Matt, you are sooo wrong for that but I forgive you! I guess my originally being from the Philly area confused you. :) Temporary insanity.
Trilby,
Thanks for such an informative and entertaining item.
You are right in your comments about Charlie polluting the Spahn Ranch area, particularly with the dune buggies when he has been saying that we should all get back to the horse!! What about leading by example? Yes, he does hide behind this ATWA thing. What did he do in the years 1967-69 when he was out of prison in terms of environmental projects? Nothing, that's what.
Over on his Facebook page, you will notice that Star and others always refer to him as 'Manson' under the misapprehension that he is some international figure of great stature. He is, and always will be, nothing more than a two bit crook.
A very enjoyable post, Trilby. Thanks!
Yeah, I saw one on e-bay about a month ago that stayed at about $25. until the last hour of the auction, & then ended up going for about eighty. I still can't believe no one noticed it. On a visit back home, I went to a used bookstore that I knew used to have back issues of LIFE magazine, & sure enough they had 3 Manson and/or TLB issues. So I snapped them up. A year or so after that, on another visit back, I decided to go in and buy ALL the LIFE back issues, & maybe learn how to put them up on e-bay. Someone else had already had the same idea. I think it's getting harder and harder since the advent of e-bay to find things organically in used bookstores, etc. Thank goodness for resources like aes-nihil.
Thanks, equinox!! I haven't seen the FB Page, I'm going to go check it out now! :) I have to say I do think George Stinson lives his environmental beliefs and isn't a hypocrite; but I sure do agree with your assessment of Manson. "Manson". Like "Madonna", huh. Just a "material girl, living in a material world". LOL.
Thank you!! I always love your comments (especially this one). :) :) :)
Trilby,
You are most welcome - it's a very impressive piece.
I too believe that George Stimson and Sandra Good are sincere in their environmental beliefs and commitments. However, in Charlie's case, I think he has seen a bandwagon, and decided to jump on it.
CM would probably deep down like to be known for something other than the TLB murders. That isn't going to happen for him.
Bernard Crow - MONEY
Linda K.and the $5,000 - MONEY
G. Hinman - MONEY
Tate House - Gee Wizz kids ! Let me tell you a story about a dirty, nasty old "ex-con" that DREAMED of starting an international RACE WAR ! BUT the really scary part is: HE littered the beautiful country-side with dirty, oily old car parts. Now how icky is that? AND this is after the great American Lady Bird Johnson began HER make America Beautiful to rid the Promised Land of all those unsightly rusting old car parts that those devilish Republicans were actually SELLING on Heaven's Highways.
Patty loves her some Trilby...welcome girl!
Yep, exactly!! And he exploits whichever parts of the mythology he can for his own purposes. And I can't say I wouldn't do exactly the same in his position.
What leapt out at me re: the Melton thing was the word "inheritance". Wonder if that's where the whole "inheritance" story about Hinman derived from. You hit the nail on the head with money. Whether in drug or actual currency form.
I've said it before and I'll keep saying it, like a parrot: the only one with the juice to co-ordinate the "official" story was Sidney Korshak.
Thank you!! I sure love me some Patty... your posts are GREAT and you are nailing the BEL info!! I also really love your peacemaking when squabbles begin. :)
You know, for a guy who preached incessantly about "losing your old ego", Charlie is just about all ego himself. Even though Watkins, Grogan/Gabriel & probably even Gypsy :( had more talent; Charlie still had talent. I know alot of people disagree with me on that. But given alot of production work in the studio, both "Look At Your Game Girl" & "Eyes of a Dreamer" had Top-40 potential if he had allowed them to be produced as pop/rock. He was never going to "submit to his brother" or budge an inch. Now, on the one hand that may demonstrate integrity or conviction. On the other, ego or stubborness. Whatever one, or mix of all - he ensured that his music career wouldn't go anywhere. And in that way he has of dropping hints of the truth or contributing factors into his "conversations" or interviews, he has talked about the music business then being controlled by the Mob - totally true. I've often wondered where that factored into his lack of a career, too.
Mr Hendrickson,
Agree with you entirely on the money factor.
In addition, he helped himself to the trust funds of both Sandra Good and Didi Lansbury.
He operated as a pimp.
All in all, after release from prison, he was determined to live off others' backs. If he was so fond of nature, he could have sought a job in a public park - no particular skills needed. I think CM was allergic to the word 'work'.
It's a Trilby love-fest today! Great post, Trilby, and thanks for the kind words! The teaser for your next post has me intrigued - start writing!
Trilby, Patty understand u may have a BEL post yourself? ;)
This is a great find. I was just talking about Black Beard and wondering if Charles Allen Manson from the LAPD list was Black Beard.
As for Manson's ATWA schtick, I think most of that came after his incarceration contrary to what he says. it's easy to look back and cringe, and preach a new ideal.
But most of the messes left by the Family was a joint effort and not just Manson, though he was definitely a part of it.
I think that Charlie sincerely believes in his ATWA vision, but like I said it is easy for someone locked up to preach it because it's nearly impossible for them to live it.
But, I think when Charlie was out he wasn't concerned about ATWA much at all. Neither were any of the others and if they were, they weren't practicing it.

I have two words for you Trilby.
Oakland Athletics.....
I lived in Oakland and Daly City in the early 70s when they won the World Series three years in a row. Maybe the happiest time of my life.....

-----------------------------------
There's one ebay right now for $599. Insane.....
I've known a sociopath or two in my day and I think what makes Manson able to be such a hypocrite is the sociopathic ability to rationalize just about anything and the narcissistic ability to believe one's own bullshit.....
Oakland Athletics??? Shouldn't that be the Kansas City Athletics? No, wait it's the Philadelphia Athletics. What's an Athletic, anyway? Shouldn't it be Athletes? :)
Hey, a team that had Tony LaRussa (an animal advocate and rescuer) & 2 great guys - Bobby Welch and Dave Stewart - is A-OK by me! :)
Thanks, Dooger. Yeah, I totally agree with your ATWA-after-the-fact assessment. Charlie's not a trailblazer, he's a bandwagon-jumper. The only one that I think ever had a pre-existing love for the environment mighta been Sandra Good. She majored in botany, & I see a consistency there. "Eccentric" *cough batshi* crazy cough* but kinda consistent. I think the biker/petty criminal influence was much more prevalent than any hippie ideals in '69.
Nope, the BEL is Patty's baby and your research is awesome. I'm an empath, & an empath's battle cry is: "I don't know how I know, I just know!" I don't know much in life - I can barely remember most days to wear shoes (I hate shoes) - but when stuff leaps out at me it's frustrating to find solid supporting evidence given my minimal research skills. It's like that poster with a quote by either Goethe or Richard Bach that I had on my bedroom wall growing up about having a dream and then building the foundation under it... something about building sand castles in the air... anyway, I'll e-mail you by next week with some stuff I found & see what you think about it.
I sound like I had dope for breakfast, not coffee. Meant to say I stumbled onto a BEL connection that I don't think is just a coincidence, but I still lack evidence. It places them in Manson's neck of the woods, though, in one of his hangouts.
Yeah, the Amazon prices are laughable, too. I think that one is just going to go back into my collection as an aes-nihil photocopy. There's only a couple more books I'm going to try to collect, I think.
Thanks, Mrs. Matt!! I'm gonna start pasting the post tomorrow, but in the meanwhile invoke your executive privilege and make Mr. Matt tell you the topic! ;) He's gonna have to come up with a title, anyway, 'cos I'm stuck.
Damn, I forgot about Connie Mack Stadium... Hey, how 'bout them Washington Senators??
I don't know what I like more about this post - the conclusion or just about the greatest opening sentence ever! ... Both. :)
Hi Trilby, it was very sad last month to hear that Bob Welch died. I was at a game back in the late 80s and during batting practice he and Storm Davis were in the outfield shagging fly balls. They looked like a couple of kids having the time of their lives. I can still see Welch's smile.
I remember back in the early 90s that during a game the announcer, probably Monte Moore said that Tony La Russa was the first manager to use computer data to assess the opposing teams' hitting and pitching.
Matt, they will always be the Oakland A's to me. When you walk into the Oakland Coliseum there's a mural with past players. In my opinion Rickey Henderson is the greatest all around baseball player that I've ever seen in spikes.
Trilby, Doc digs him some Dave Stewart.....
Matt, when they started out they were called the Philadelphia Athletic Club and they shortened it to Athletics.
When I was a kid I had a t shirt with a jock strap with a face on the front of the shirt with the caption "Be An Athletic Supporter".....
Dave Stewart will always hold a place in my heart for decking Pat Corrales (at about the 30 second mark):
The indians used Tucson as their Spring Training home back when I was attending Arizona. I'd see them in restaurants regularly and Corrales was a first class asshole.
Trilby, I just want to add that I was pissed at LaRussa for years when he didn't let Dave Stewart get a complete game in game one of the 1988 World Series. When Tommy Lasorda had Kirk Gibson pinch hit in the bottom of the 9th with two men on my first thought was that Dennis Eckersly's slider was not effective on lefties. We all know what happened after that.....
Dave Stewart grew up in east Oakland. That's a place where kids have to know how to fight.....
Hey, everybody: Matt just clued me that the comments show up differently on Android phones (& IPhones). I've been posting on my phone, & there's a "Reply" option after each comment. It must look really goofy since Matt said viewing on a regular OS doesn't show that reply option... :( Sorry, I will put an "@" and name in front of my replies from now on! Sorry again! Hope everybody is having a good day.

Ford has actually idled the Louisville Setting up Plant in Kentucky for a week, with plant supervisors taking a down period from later on in the year to compensate. Meanwhile, FCA has idled its Brampton facility in Ontario, Canada, and one other site.The various other site is a secret currently. At the Louisville Setting up plant, Ford creates the Escape and also Lincoln Corsair SUVs. FCA generates the Chrysler 300, Dodge Battery charger, as well as Dodge Challenger at the Brampton Setting up plant. Specifically what sort of semiconductor scarcity has forced the plant shutdowns is a mystery.
The record claims a Ford spokeswoman decreased to determine the semiconductor distributor but did validate the short-term idling of the plants. Ford as well as FCA aren’t the first car producers to be required to idle plants because of parts scarcities. This has actually become common throughout the pandemic wrecking the globe.
Previously Nissan idled plants, and Honda may be required to idle several of its plants too. Semiconductor lacks have influenced electronic devices makers as well as manufacturers in other markets after production was stopped at facilities in China during the coronavirus pandemic. Production facilities in various other nations have actually additionally seen shortages from minimized employees and also plant closures.
Nissan previously announced that it would certainly minimize the production of the Note crossbreed electrical automobile in Japan, however it’s vague what range the minimized manufacturing will certainly reach. The automotive manufacturing market is attempting to recuperate from the long shutdowns mandated by the coronavirus pandemic. During the shutdown, many of those producing facilities counted on making clinical products such as ventilators and masks to help support healthcare employees and those that were ill as a result of the pandemic."There are perhaps no days of our childhood we lived so fully as those we spent with a favourite book."

This bridesmaid dress is gorgeous! We are very satisfied. The color is true to the picture and we got a size up that fit just right, so I recommend getting a size to two sizes up. Very comfortable aside from the shoulders being tight but the dress has a soft material and the lace matches the bride's dress perfectly. This is the second bridesmaid dress I've ordered from here and will be buying more, thanks JJ's House!

I did not have to have any alterations done to it. It was a great fit. I normally wear a 22 in pants and a 24/26 in shirts, just because I like them big. I am short, 5 ft 2 inches, so the back drug the ground a bit, but it was not bad. I just purchased another dress for an upcoming wedding, and I am hoping I will be just as happy with that dress as I was with this one. I am a happy customer!

The dress is absolutely stunning. My issue was that the dress wouldn't zip up past my waist even though it was measured correctly & it was a custom dress. I contacted support & they were really helpful with the issue. On the day everyone commented about how gorgeous the dress was & asked where i got it from.

In a 61-page opinion, Philadelphia Orphans Court Judge John W. Herron decided, in a rancorous five-year-old debate, that internationally recognized Fox Chase cannot use 19.4 acres of the 65-acre city park in a long-term lease to expand its campus.
Herron said that public parks were protected by a common law rule, known as the "public trust doctrine," that has been part of Pennsylvania law since the early 1900s.
"Simply stated, so long as a community or neighborhood actively uses dedicated parkland, the city is required to hold such land in trust for their use," the judge wrote.
Fox Chase swiftly announced it would appeal. "We are certainly disappointed in the court's decision, and we plan to appeal," said spokesman Tim Spreitzer. "We've argued all along we believe this expansion will create thousands of jobs, expand Philadelphia's tax base, and keep Fox Chase at the forefront of cancer research."
"We are going to evaluate and pursue any reasonable option for expansion," Spreitzer said. He declined to comment on whether the center might leave the city if it cannot build in the park.
More than two dozen park neighbors crowded into the Orphans Court waiting room to get the ruling. After learning the decision, some went into the hallway to shout their joy.
"I am so thrilled," said Jean Gavin, who walks her dog in Burholme Park, which was bequeathed to the city more than 100 years ago. "We are so glad we were able to save our park."
Fox Chase wanted an 80-year lease for a $1 billion expansion over 25 years that would create more than 4,000 jobs, proponents said.
Plans called for construction of "as many as 18 large buildings between four and nine stories high through the very center of the lush park," Herron wrote. Trees would be uprooted, and vital recreational areas destroyed, "irrevocably altering the unique character of this singularly beautiful parkland and open space."
Mayor.
"The decision could have a devastating impact" on Fox Chase's expansion efforts, Oliver said, adding that the administration would "do everything we can to insure Fox Chase's continued presence in Philadelphia."
Fox Chase said it urgently needed a new hospital to keep pace with cancer care, research, and the burgeoning increase in patients. But it has said it would look elsewhere, if the city said no. It is considering a second campus in Delaware.
Herron and the Orphans Court were asked by the city to break the will of philanthropist Robert Waln Ryerss, who in 1895 donated his farm and mansion as a park for "the use and enjoyment of the people forever."
In 1905, upon the death of Ryerss' widow, Mary, city solicitor George Wharton Pepper advised the park commission to protect Burholme Park in perpetuity for citizens of Philadelphia.
City Council voted last March to give Fox Chase an 80-year lease. Nutter signed the bill a few days later. Fox Chase agreed to pay the city $12.25 million. Of that, $4 million was earmarked for Councilman Brian J. O'Neill's district for improvements in existing facilities.
"There is no evidence of government bad faith, fraud or abuse of power," the judge wrote. "However, there is evidence of capricious and arbitrary conduct in the last-minute drafting" of the Fox Chase lease, pertaining to the $4 million payment for O'Neill's district. "The fault lies with the city and not with Fox Chase.
"While all public officials involved appear to have acted responsibly, the result of the negotiations reflect a desperate effort to contrive a way to accommodate Fox Chase's valid needs for expansion land."
In doing so, Herron said, the city bargained away its "fiduciary duty to preserve actively used parkland held in trust for the public."
The judge also noted that the lease negotiations began with the goal of finding land to swap. But when no land was found acceptable to O'Neill in his district, the councilman "succeeded in shifting $4 million in Fox Chase's money to capital improvements in his 10th councilmanic district," thwarting years of negotiations, Herron wrote. O'Neill did not return calls seeking comment on the ruling.
In March 2005, the Fairmount Park Commission voted, 11-2, to lease the parkland. Two commissioners, E. Harris Baum and Phillip Price, both lawyers, voted against the lease. Baum noted then that the commission did not seek a formal opinion from the city solicitor's office before the vote.
Price remarked at the time that it was the first time in the park commission's 150 years that parkland was transferred against someone's stated wishes in a will.
"To me, it is a very clear issue," he said in 2005. "Our mission as a park commission is to protect and preserve parkland. This will made a gift of parkland for the benefit of the citizens forever. Both City Council and the city solicitor, at the time, expressly affirmed that will."
Ryerss also established an endowment to maintain the parkland and the house, which is a museum and library, Price said. "I see no reason to change it."
Lawyer Samuel Stretton, representing neighbors wanting to save the park, said the judge accepted his arguments on the public trust doctrine, a legal principle that prohibits "selling parkland that has been dedicated to the city and is actively used."
The city maintained it had an "inalienable property right" to sell or lease the park. Stretton said the ruling "has far-reaching ramifications because this whole area of the law has been in flux. Judge Herron pretty well cleared it up."Each console generation has its own trends – certain genres and/or mechanics, that are present in pretty much every AAA title. Nowadays, for instance, a great portion of the mainstream games have open worlds, RPG elements, and loot mechanics. In contrast, last generation was home to many cinematic, linear, FPS titles – of which Bulletstorm is one.
A port of the game has shadow-dropped onto the Switch as the Duke of Switch Edition, and despite presenting an experience from the past, it feels surprisingly refreshing. If you’ve never heard of Bulletstorm before, the most obvious comparison would be with something like the 2016 DOOM reboot. Here, too, you control an edgy protagonist, a kind of killing machine, whose main purpose is to cause mayhem.
With a heavy focus on gameplay, Bulletstorm’s narrative definitely isn’t the main appeal of the game. Different to the silent DOOM-guy, though, you follow realistic vocal characters with backgrounds, desires, and personalities. Nevertheless, your adventure across the Stygia planet feels like an action-packed amusement park – in a good way.
Compared to modern titles, Bulletstorm may sound like a limited experience at first. During its eight-hour (ish) campaign, you go from point A to B with barely no room for exploration nor any kind of side mission style content. Yet, the game delivers a thoroughly enjoyable experience, all thanks to its slick controls and one of the best gun feels of any FPS on the Switch. Each weapon in Bulletstorm is fun to use, easily compensating for the limitations of its linear campaign through its sheer “fun factor”.
Bulletstorm’s gameplay goes way beyond the use of guns to dispose your enemies, however. Thanks to creative gameplay mechanics and a system that rewards the most elaborate kills, players are constantly encouraged to make use of an ever-growing set of weapons and skills. At the very beginning, for example, you get access to a kind of technological lasso, which you can use to pull in enemies or breakable items. By mixing that with other creative weapons (in Bulletstorm, a sniper isn’t just a sniper – and that goes for your complete arsenal) you can perform all kinds of crazy kills, in a maelstrom of creative mayhem.
This Switch version has a new addition that combines perfectly with the mayhem of the game: you can choose to play the entire adventure with the old-school FPS hero Duke Nukem. In this new mode, the protagonist Grey is replaced with Duke, and this adds a whole new humorous layer as all of the other characters still act as if they’re talking to Grey. This results in some very quirky interactions where Duke seems to be the only character aware of the true situation at hand.
Despite being a last-gen game, the world of Bulletstorm has some truly awe-inspiring landscapes, which are beautifully represented on the Switch, no matter whether you are playing handheld or on the big screen. The game runs smoothly in pretty much every situation, even when the screen is filled with enemies and explosions. With its decadent cities, nature-infested resorts, and mutant-filled caverns, Stygia is a very interesting place to visit.
On the whole, if you consider only the structure of Bulletstorm‘s campaign, it may sound like an outdated and limited experience – one that doesn’t offer the same openness you’d expect from a modern title. Still, its moment-to-moment gameplay is compelling enough to compensate the linearity with frantic and thrilling action. Don’t miss out.
Bulletstorm: Duke of Switch Edition £24.99
Summary
Bulletstorm’s linear campaign feels like an amusement park where you go from point A to B with explosions happening all around you – and that’s extremely fun. It’s definitely worth revisiting, or visiting for the first time, on Nintendo Switch.Film
People on Sunday + Shoes
- 7PM
Directed by Robert Siodmak & Edgar G. Ulmer
With Erwin Splettstößer, Brigitte Borchert, Wolfgang von Waltershausen
1930, 74min, 35mm
Scripted by a young Billy Wilder, People on Sunday follows five young Berliners—all amateur actors, playing members of their own professions. On Sunday morning, a taxi driver fails to rouse his girlfriend from their basement apartment, so he sets out on an escapade with his friend, who brings along a dark-haired movie extra and a blonde salesgirl. As affections shift, scenes of the group swimming, picnicking, napping, and more alternate with long documentary passages showing Berlin at leisure.
Directed by Lois Weber
With Mary MacLaren, Harry Griffith, Mattie Witting
1916, 57min, DCP
Department store shopgirl Eva Mayer (McLaren) has a problem: Her only pair of shoes is falling to tatters and she barely earns enough to feed her unemployed parents and three sisters, much less buy some new kicks. What’s a girl to do? Why, go on a date! After reluctantly accepting an invitation from a guy named Cabaret Charlie, Eva stumbles home the next morning in a new pair of shoes, leading her scandalized mother to conclude that she’s prostituted herself for fashion. Directed by America’s first female film mogul, Shoes is a telegram from a time when the line between a date and a trick was, well, tricky.
This screening will feature live piano accompaniment.While it may be tough to locate a person that has actually not experienced some type of anxiousness in their life, there are those whose anxiousness never ever fades which can make it difficult for endures to lead a regular life.

When this takes place an individual’s regular anxiety turns into a problem due to the fact that the body and mind can no longer respond to circumstances in a normal way, but despite how poor your symptoms are you can take hold of your stress and anxiety with the ideal assistance as well as assistance in treating anxiousness disorders.
Some might pick to turn to medication in order to aid in reducing their stress and anxiety problem signs, and while this may help some, it must not be considered the only treatment for healthy living. While some may assert otherwise, drug really has an extremely low success price for dealing with anxiety condition symptoms which does not bode well for long term success in taking control of your stress and anxiety symptoms. Anxiousness problems commonly occur for certain factors and also are frequently associated with an underlying reason. When you take control over the underlying cause, the condition that is associated with the reason is gone for excellent.
When you mask the signs and symptoms with the help of medication, you are not addressing the underlying factors for the problem which avoids you from achieving an effective therapy for stress and anxiety problems. Anxiety condition endures that pick medicine typically wind up remaining on the medicine for the long term, resulting in a sort of yo-yo impact of going on and also off the medicines over and over once more without resolving the issues finally. Up until the underlying reason for the anxiety is dealt with, the symptoms will certainly continue to be avoiding the victim from going back to the life they when loved.
Based upon comprehensive research study it has actually been discovered that one of the most effective therapy for anxiety problems is the combination of the appropriate kind of self aid direction with the help of a qualified therapist who concentrates on managing anxiety recovery. A coach, counsellor, therapist, and even a psycho therapist that has successfully beaten stress and anxiety in their very own life as well as have actually been devoid of medicine for at least 3 years are all great choices when selecting the ideal specialist for support in treating stress and anxiety problems. Therapists that are currently on medication for treating their very own stress and anxiety have actually verified to not be good resources for stress and anxiety help. Studies have revealed that those who collaborate with a therapist that has actually conquered their very own anxiousness disorder tend to be the best in assisting others in tackling their very own one-of-a-kind kind of this disorder. Those that are still utilizing anti-anxiety meds may lead current suffers to ask yourself just how practical might this specialist be if they are incapable to overcome their very own anxiousness condition.
While this case any kind of bother some psychological health experts, our experience has revealed that this claim frequently proves to be real. Numerous who have actually previously enlisted the aid of among these professionals for the treatment of anxiety problems have discovered that their condition remained or in the worst case actually got worse even after therapy. Anxiety problems can be cured however you require to have the best information along with the right level of assistance to assist your end your stress and anxiety problem once and for all.
Anxiousness conditions can be categorized in either a couple of categories. Suffers are most commonly vulnerable to either circumstantial anxiety or persistent anxiousness, both of which can be treated if dealt with appropriately.

7. In the case below we are talking to a CPU317-2DP over PROFIBUS with node address 2, after clicking "ok".
Step Final: Here we take all blocks and hardware configuration of the CPU 317-2DP concerned an issue in the CDNJS library update server that could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands, leading to a complete compromise.
The vulnerability was discovered and reported by security researcher RyotaK on April 6, 2021. There is no evidence of in-the-wild attacks abusing this flaw.
Specifically, the vulnerability works by publishing packages to Cloudflare's CDNJS using GitHub and npm, using it to trigger a path traversal vulnerability, and ultimately trick the server into executing arbitrary code, thus achieving remote code execution.
It's worth noting that the CDNJS infrastructure includes features to automate library updates by periodically running scripts on the server to download relevant files from the respective user-managed Git repository or npm package registry.
By uncovering an issue with how the mechanism sanitizes package paths, RyotaK found that "arbitrary code can be executed after performing path traversal from the .tgz file published to npm and overwriting the script that is executed regularly on the server."
In other words, the goal of the attack is to publish a new version of a specially-crafted package to the repository, which is then picked up the CDNJS library update server for publishing, in the process copying the contents of the malicious package into a regularly executed script file hosted on the server, thereby gaining arbitrary code execution.
"While this vulnerability could be exploited without any special skills, it could impact many websites," RyotaK said. "Given that there are many vulnerabilities in the supply chain, which are easy to exploit but have a large impact, I feel that it's very scary."
This is not the first time the security researcher has uncovered code execution flaws in the way updates to software repositories are handled. In April 2021, RyotaK disclosed a critical vulnerability in the official Homebrew Cask repository could have been exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code on users' machines.Celebrate biggest holidays of the year.Calls to remove Cricklewood phone boxes used for sex advertising and drug dealing
Residents and traders claim booths have become a magnet for illegal and anti-social behaviour
Angry residents are calling for the removal of phone boxes which they claim have become a magnet for illegal and anti-social behaviour.
The residents have told the Times that the 18 booths lined along Cricklewood Broadway are a hub for drug dealing and the graphic advertising of prostitutes – that’s when they are not being used as makeshift lavatories.
The problem has been causing a headache for around six months and fed-up locals are demanding the owners get rid of them amid fears that traders are suffering.
Sally Williams, a business consultant working on the Cricklewood Improvement Programme (CIP), which is attempting to rejuvenate the area, said numerous businesses had highlighted the issue.
She told the Times: “Anyone can see how they are being used. If you stand and watch you see straight away that people are not making phone calls.
“There are some great businesses here and we are trying to welcome in new audiences but this is a major concern for people and detracts from the boxes are separately owned by British Telecom (BT) and communications company Arqiva.
Angela Payne, a member of the Mapesbury Residents Association, said she and others had been campaigning for months to have them removed.
She said: “BT have said they will remove some of them. We have tried contacting the other owners but they have said it’s a matter for the police.
“In this day and age to have so many is ridiculous. The companies should either maintain them and keep them clean or get rid of them.
“It’s very concerning for residents to see what they are being used for.”
A spokesman for BT said they were in the process of removing four boxes.
A spokesman for Arqiva said they “understood” residents’ frustrations but that they were unable to prevent unlicensed and unauthorised advertising.
He said: “Our cleaning and maintenance crews who routinely visit the telephones are instructed to remove any offending unauthorised material.”
However, he added that controlling the advertising of escort services was a matter for the local police.
A Brent Police spokesman said the issue was a priority and they were working with community groups to tackle it. He said: “We deal with urinating in the street and sex advertising when we come across it.
“We ask that the residents and businesses call the 101 number to report any incidents.”Upcoming Events

Single Plan for Student Achievement...Forty one-year-old chef Geoff Kruck was diagnosed with Klinefelter syndrome (KS) in 2012. KS is a genetic condition that affects fertility, energy levels and bone and muscle strength. One in 550 boys and men have KS, yet it often goes undiagnosed. In October, Geoff helped to raise awareness of the condition by participating in the Melbourne Marathon, with proceeds going to Healthy Male. He talks here about what it means for him to live with KS.
I found out the hard way I had Klinefelter syndrome. When I married my wife, I didn’t have an overbearing desire to have children – I was just rapt to marry my best friend. I thought a family would come naturally down the track. You just assume it’s going to happen for you when you’re ready.
A couple of years passed, and I visited my father in far north Queensland. That made me appreciate anew what it means to experience a father’s love. I have a very strong faith and I was able to connect and reflect on that during that time. When I got back home, I felt ready. Soon after, my wife and I started trying for a child.
We tried for nineteen months with no success. It was very frustrating. My wife suggested we get some fertility tests done. Mine showed that I had no sperm. The test was repeated and I had the same result. They said there is a chance I might have Klinefelter syndrome. We had some more tests and the diagnosis was confirmed. We had to face the possibility that we might not be able to have children.
I had not heard of KS, but I’ve since learnt a lot more about it. As well as fertility, it can affect everything from cognitive function to energy levels to sex drive. Being diagnosed made some things fall into place – why I’m as tall as I am, why I’ve always carried more weight around my hips, waist and chest, and why I often felt tired.
After the diagnosis, I was referred to an endocrinologist, which is a male fertility specialist. I had a biopsy, where tissue is taken from each of the testes. This got sent away to see if they could harvest any healthy sperm from the tissue. The result showed that it wasn’t possible. It was hard news for both my wife and I to take. We became each other’s rock, and we somehow navigated our way through. Let’s just say it was a pretty grounding experience.
We received counselling, and there was still hope for us to become parents. One option was to try and conceive with donor sperm through IVF. I couldn’t help thinking that none of my DNA would be passed onto the child. But my endocrinologist was fantastic; one thing he did tell me is that even if it’s not your bloodline, you are there for the birth, you are raising the child as your own – it helped me to see things differently. Another option was adoption. We’ve had time to think on it and while we’ve decided not to go down either of those roads, it was good to know we had choices.
For couples going through this process my advice is to talk to others who are further along in their journey, as well as your specialists, and of course each other. Ask any questions that will help you make the decisions that are right for you. Take as much time as you need to get your thoughts in check. It’s okay to feel the way you feel at any given time, including sadness and grief.
When I first got KS, I didn’t know anyone with the condition. Some of the KS information I got in those early days from social media and in chatrooms was not always helpful. I would hear things about people with KS having learning difficulties. And yet the guys I’ve since met with KS have turned out alright – they’re working, they’re successful. Many are creatives, often working in the food industry like me. You need to focus on your strengths, and surround yourself with positive people. I have a strong faith, which really helps.
I’ve since come across a US-based website called Living with XXY run by a bloke called Ryan Bregante. He put me in touch with a couple of Aussie guys with the syndrome, which has been a great help. Given my experience, I find I’m now able to help people going through the same fertility issues we had.
One of the treatments for KS is testosterone therapy. While it doesn’t improve your fertility and you don’t have to have it, it’s really given me a new lease of life. I have a lot more energy and I’m much more motivated to do things like exercise. It’s helped with my sex drive and muscle development, and it’s given me more confidence.
Information has got to come from the right sources. It’s important to find a good endocrinologist, someone who is supportive and well-informed. More recently, Healthy Male has also been a great resource, particularly for medical and research information.
My wife got me thinking about being involved in the Melbourne Marathon – she’s run more than a few of them in her time. I’m more of a swimmer than a runner, so participating is a personal challenge for me. With the KS, my joints don’t always enjoy running. I think I will leave the running to my wife – I’ll just be happy to walk it with my father-in-law!
Apart from raising money for Healthy Male, I want to raise awareness. For me, it’s been a long road coming to grips with having KS, and sometimes it was a struggle. But it was also refreshing to know that there was an explanation for some of the symptoms I’d had my whole life. The more people that understand the condition, the less likely there is to be stigma around it. Some great people have helped me along the way. I’m ready now to give back to help other guys who are going through it.
Did you know?
Klinefelter syndrome:
Is a genetic condition – men with KS are born with it
Is also known as 47 XXY – men affected have an extra X chromosome
KS stops a man’s testes producing sperm and testosterone
A key indicator of KS is small testicles (about the size of a grape) after puberty.

You get what you pay for. It's cheaper than most places, but not as fancy. What it lacks in bells and whistles it makes up for with real backpacking feeling. You live close with other Backpackers and it's pretty easy to get new friends when you share a room than in a hotell. I really liked my stay here. Met some cool physiotherapy students from Canada, a brother duo with a great laugh from Bavaria Germany, and another mixed group of Germans. Had a blast. Would recommend as a budget stay.

This property did not meet our expectations compared to other hostels in the same price range. The beds were unsteady and overall terrible, there were no linens but blankets which felt dirty and there were only two bathrooms for everyone staying at the hostel with a total of two toilets and showers and no privacy at all, you could hear everything since your couldn’t close or lock the door to the bathroom. Location was confusing since website says wrong address for check in.

My next eye exam appointment is coming up, and I haven’t had one in a while. Is there anything I need to do or bring?
A lot of times an eye exam appointment is something patients arrive to in a rushed state of mind, and really just want to get in and!
A lot of times an eye exam appointment is something patients come to rushed, and really just want to get in and out!
Why Do I Need To Prepare For My Eye Exam?
A little preparation prior to your comprehensive eye exam will go a long way. You will get more out of the appointment because you will be actively engaged. As I mentioned before, many patients really just want to hear that their eyes are A-OK and would like an updated prescription. But, an eye exam is so much more. A routine eye exam can uncover symptoms of a sight-threatening eye disease, which may lead to blindness. Also, your eyes are the windows to your body’s health, so, they can signal many non-related eye issues like high blood pressure, diabetes, or a brain tumor.
Ensuring you know your family medical history, for example, is one way you can help your optometrist choose the best course of action for your eyes. How? Many eye conditions are hereditary. So this means if, say your mother has Macular Degeneration (AMD), and her mother had it too. Your chances are increased for developing AMD. Informing your optometrist of this allows him or her to take a proactive approach to your eye care, which ensures you are educated. So, should you begin to develop this eye condition, since you will know how to recognize the symptoms, you can come in sooner than later for an assessment and better treatment options. This approach is far better than say, if you just ignored the initial symptoms.
What Should I Bring to My Eye Appointment?
The next time you have an appointment with your eye doctor, ensure to bring the following items with you:
- BC Care Care
- Extended Health Card (if applicable)
- Family medical history
- Contact lenses or prescription glasses
- Sunglasses in case your eyes are dilated
- List of prescription medication taken by you
- List of questions or concerns regarding your eyes
If your optometrist determines that you need to see an eye specialist, our front staff will be able to do so. So, don’t forget to check-out with them. Additionally, if you require new glasses, we can recommend several reputable opticians from which new prescription glasses or sunglasses can be purchased. Contact lenses can be purchased from our office directly, and also billed to your third party insurance provider at the time of purchase.
Did You Understand Your Eye Exam Results?
At Inner Harbour Optometry it is important to us that our patients feel comfortable and ask questions! We want to ensure you understand your eye exam results, and that any and all questions are answered. The more you know, the more aware you are of potential symptoms to look for. And this could ultimately save your sight.
Dr. Sharma enjoys taking an active approach in getting to know his patients, both in person and online. If you like connecting through social media, check out our various social media profiles and blog, and tell us what you think. We love hearing from our valued patients!
Alright, Now That I Have Gotten My Exam, Now What?
Your family eye doctor has assessed your vision and your eye health, and you have received an updated prescription. He has indicated that nothing looks abnormal, but it’s important to know that things can change. This is why you must keep up with your regular eye exams since many eye conditions and diseases have little-to-no symptoms, and simply go unnoticed by patients. Not having a routine eye exam, or not coming in because you think the issue will just go away, could really make the situation worse and irreversible. When it comes to the eyes, being proactive is key. This means taking appropriate care of your eyes and making your eye exam. Those patients who have pre-existing issues may need to come in more routinely.
When is the last time you had your eyes assessed by an optometrist? Give us a call or book online with Dr. Sharma, and rest easy that you’re in good hands!

Mass Effect: Legendary Edition has debuted in the number one spot on the UK's physical games chart, overtaking Resident Evil Village, which is now in second place.
Right behind these new releases is a reappearance from Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, swinging all the way back up into third. This is presumably driven by bursts of PS5 stock the UK has seen over the last week or two. The game sold best on the modern console, with 88 per cent of the week's sales made on the new-gen version.
Outside of that, another new release has done pretty well — Subnautica: Below Zero debuts in fifth, with more than half of sales going towards PS5 and PS4 versions. The rest of the top 10 is about what you'd expect, with Nintendo still a commanding force outside of the newer games. If you're wondering, Returnal continues its downward trend; after a strong debut, it fell to 15th last week, and now finds itself in 26th.
Here's the latest top 10 in full.
UK Sales Charts: Week Ending 15th May 2021
- Mass Effect Legendary Edition
- Resident Evil Village
- Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales
- FIFA 21
- Subnautica: Below Zero
- Animal Crossing: New Horizons
- Minecraft (Switch)
- Mario Kart 8 Deluxe
- Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury
- New Pokémon Snap
What's This No GTA V? What Manner Of Sorcery Is This.
This obviously goes against the established narrative that scalpers are scooping up all the PS5's. Clearly they are going to real people if sales of Miles Morales has shot up over 300%.
For anyone wondering, GTA V is 11th.
Very good value for money with the Mass Effect trilogy set.
@Quintumply 'As' in the headline communicates to the reader there is a causal relation between the two things you're stating. Had to reread the headline a few times before I understood that they weren't related at all, while might be better. Or is there something I'm missing from the article?
@Spaldy Scalpers are buying the physical releases of Miles Morales too??!!1 😲
Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.
And this is exactly why Sony has no incentive to discount PS5 games any time soon. With each wave of consoles that launch, there will be a resurgence of sales of software.
Well done Insomniac. Hope you are in for many months of success driven by MM and - shortly - Ratchet and Clank!
@Kidfried Fair observation, I've changed it.
Mass Effect Legendary Edition is absolutely ace! Well worth 53 quid.
Miles PS4 on offer somewhere? Tell me!
Interesting to see that Returnal doesn't seem to have benefited at all from a fresh batch of console stock.
Returnal was always going to have a somewhat niche market.
I'm completely hooked on it, but it's not for everyone.
Good to see positive Bioware news for a change! Hopefully this is the beginning of a return to form for them as even though its years away the next Mass Effect has me very interested to see how it turns out.
@Shepherd_Tallon I have absolutely no proof, but I think niche games perform much better in digital sales.
Was anyone else so bored by Miles Moralis? Yeah it's cool to swing around for a bit, but there's a distinct lack of challenge. Especially with the overload of gadgets that basically win the fight for you.
@Korgon
Fingers crossed. It's amazing how much better they've made ME1 look, and they've made some real improvements on getting around in the Mako, too. I hope that can translate into a more positive future for ME5!
@Spaldy so if i buy a scalped ps5 cause its the only way possible right now in my country i don't need games? offcourse the ps5's are going to real people BUT with bigger price tags.
@munstre Oh I agree to an extent. Lots of people will have been put off by the coverage it received, and much of the negativity around some of the coverage was completely skewed.
The issue with there not being enough checkpoints for example, that doesn't really carry much weight for me. This is the game the devs designed and it's how they wanted it to be. You either like it or you don't.
Not everyone is happy with that though. There were a lot of complaints about the lack of checkpoints. The game just isn't for everyone in that regard.
But you're right - It's perfectly accessible, no more or less than something like Dark Souls.
I don't normally play rogue-likes, but I think this game is magic. I got to the half way point last week and my hands were shaking afterwards. The boss fights are so intense. An absolute masterpiece of a game.
I can't take this chart seriously if there isn't gta v in it.
Nice one Stephen, love to see these. A shame about Returnal - I have the same feeling many of us have had about why it might struggle, but I won't say it because it seems to get some people up in arms and I'd rather we don't have the 'poor-shaming' enter this comment thread.
@Rob_230 "And this is exactly why Sony has no incentive to discount PS5 games any time soon"
Except this should be an incentive as Miles cost £/$50 and is doing terrific, would Returnal be much higher on the list if it was discounted or cost the same as Miles? Maybe, although the difficulty seems to be what's scaring some people.
Seems like the willing are in the minority, not the moaners. I'm feeling national pride!
@Spaldy released also on ps4. That's the whole explanation.
@zebric21 I think what @Spaldy is saying is that a non-sense narrative was that scalped PS5s weren't getting to gamers...And Miles Morales proves that particular narrative is false.
Nice to see Mass Effect debut at number 1.
Poor Returnal doesn't get the love it deserves. Brilliant game that lets you see your improvement each run in skill and weapon proficiency. I blow through sections of that game feeling like the toughest space woman alive as Selene. Hoping it'll see a Returnal to the top 20 again, maybe a nice sale will help the cause.
Returnal will be half price by end of summer. (still wouldn't buy it though)
I guess Rockstar will have to start concepts for a new game now
Also Mass Effect Legendary is legendary. My weekend was totally consumed
Having a blast playing Mass Effect again. I can't get over how good the first one looks on PS5. They did a great job.
@Blacksmith1985
Increased sales of MM are for PS5 not PS4.
@zebric21
The sudden 300% increase in sales of MM on the PS5 coincided with PS5 units being released by retailers.
@munstre I think once they patch in the save function, people will be more willing to try it perhaps.

After partnering with IBM in July to develop corporate software and services, Apple is building its own sales team to court clients.
Momentum is strong for Apple in a key market that executives have described as a long-term growth opportunity. New research shows that iOS market share gained in the enterprise sector last quarter while Android slipped.
Besides big names like Citigroup, Apple is reportedly talking with enterprise app distributers about potential partnerships:.
Good Technology‘s latest Mobility Index Report shows that iOS device enterprise activations grew 2% in July through September. Android’s market share fell a corresponding 2%. New iPhone activations were seen as the primarily cause of growth, and the iPad accounted for an overwhelming 89% of tablet activations.
Apple recently launched its AppleCare for Enterprise program, and its first custom client services are expected to start rolling out with IBM’s help before the end of the year.8 Tips to Avoid Different Types of Fraud

Nothing was called on the play, and as of this morning, there is word that the NHL Department of Player Safety will not be giving Reaves any sort of suspension on the play. The play is making its way around social media, and it’s not the first time the Coyotes haven’t been able to catch a break from the referees.
Other Cases of No Calls
In addition to Gross, who as of this morning is reported to have suffered a concussion and knee injury and is possibly done for the rest of the season, numerous other Coyotes players, in particular Conor Garland, have seemed to be on the end of plenty of numerous questionable hits that didn’t result in a call from the Department of Player Safety.
Another example occurred on Feb. 12 against the St. Louis Blues when defenseman Robert Bortuzzo seemed to deliberately stick out his stick and clip Garland in the face as he skated up past the Blues’ bench. Whether it was intentional or not, there should’ve been a call on the play. The result of this play did not end up affecting the outcome of the game, but no fine or suspension was given.
The examples don’t stop there, though. On Feb. 20, in a game against the Kings, forward Austin Strand delivered a nasty cross-check to the face of Garland, sending him to the ice clutching his face in pain. The referees subsequently reviewed the play, and Strand received a five-minute major for his actions.
Further discipline would be taken, and for once, the Coyotes had something called their way. While Strand would not receive a suspension for his scary cross-check to the face of Garland, he would receive a fine of $3,168.10, the maximum allowable under the CBA for cross-checking, but he ultimately would get away without any other sort of punishment.
Another example that outraged a lot of people and sparked a debate on the severity of the play and who was to blame was on March 31st against the Colorado Avalanche. With five and half minutes remaining in the third in an 8-3 blowout, Garland and Avalanche superstar Nathan MacKinnon got into a tussle down in the corner of the boards that sparked one of the hotter topics that’s still going around on social media and in the hockey world.
During the tussle, Garland would grab onto the legs of MacKinnon and pull him down to the ground. In the process of falling, Garland has his helmet pulled off by MacKinnon. As they were getting up and refs were coming to intervene, MacKinnon would talk Garland’s helmet and proceed to throw it back at Garland’s face in a vicious manner. While both sides received a penalty on the play, with MacKinnon earning a 10-minute misconduct, ultimately, he would not receive any sort of action for the play afterward.
One final example that indeed did result in a suspension was on March 16th against the Minnesota Wild when defensemen Carson Soucy left his feet and caught Garland in the head against the side of the boards. Soucy would end up receiving a five-minute major for charging on the play. Further action was taken, and later that week, the Department of Player Safety gave Soucy a one-game suspension for the hit.
At the end of the day, things can be said about both Garland and MacKinnon here on this play. What can you say about the other plays, though? Garland, who knows how to get under players’ skin, clearly at the same time seems to be the target of these questionable no-calls. What about Jordan Gross? There’s certainly evidence to suggest that whether Reaves hit was intentional or not, it clearly looks to be a shoulder to the head.
Who Should Be Blamed?
This has potentially cost Gross his season, and the Department of Player Safety clearly doesn’t seem to want to take any sort of action. Out of the five clips shown, there have been three penalties called, one fine given for $3,168.10 and one suspension. Further action needs to be taken, though, as there are other examples. The Department of Player Safety has been on and off this season in giving out fines and suspensions, and when it comes to the Coyotes, they seem to turn a blind eye for the most part.
How many more times does Garland have to be hit up high or run from behind for the league to seriously starting dishing out strict penalties for their actions? People can sit and argue all day about the four clips above and try and tell others that, “oh they deserved that,” or, “it was a clean play,” but the fact of the matter is the NHL DoPS needs to be held accountable for not giving out the proper punishment for these actions. The league is all about trying to enforce player safety and taking away the blindside hits and stuff, but when four examples like the ones above come out, and you sit there and watch them, how do you determine there’s nothing punishable?
While one might think that MacKinnon’s actions are justified or that Bortuzzo didn’t mean to have his stick out, what can you say about Reaves or Strand? Both looked to be contact to the face/head area, and yet one penalty and one fine was given. Nothing is learned from that. What will it take for the refs, but more importantly, the Department of Player Safety, to step in and really give some sort of punishment out for what can be considered a dirty play, something the DoPS is trying to prevent. What do you think, though? Do these hits seem clean to you, or should the league be held accountable? As always, let us know below what you think.

The election victory of the Sandinista government in November 2006 brought to an end 16 years of neoliberal governments.
Since that time maintaining a mixed economy and economic stability while at the same time implementing comprehensive poverty reduction and infrastructure programmes have been key government commitments.
These commitments are aligned to achieving poverty reduction, cutting malnutrition and ending hunger as outlined in the UN Millennium Development Goals and 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.
This webinar will look back at the country the Sandinista government inherited, the obstacles they have faced, and the progress made in achieving these goals.
Starting with an overview, the webinar will then focus on what government policies and programmes have meant for the rural small-scale producers, co-operatives, associations and the country’s capacity to grow its own food.
Speakers:
Coleen Littlejohn: Coleen is an International development economist who has lived most of her professional life in Nicaragua since 1980 working for local and international NGOs as well as the World Bank in Nicaragua, Liberia and Ghana. She has also worked in Colombia and Chile.
Nick Hoskyns: Nick has worked with rural co-operatives since first visiting Nicaragua on a 1988 solidarity brigade. For the past 20 years he has worked with an ethical trading company called Ético owned by co-operatives and charities. Etico facilitates fair trade relationships between small-scale producers and international markets for products such as sesame and coffee.
Fausto Torrez: Fausto is head of the international relations department of the Nicaraguan Rural Workers Association (ATC). As a member organisation of La Via Campesina, the international movement of peasants and indigenous peoples, the ATC’s work focuses on food sovereignty, land rights, agroecology, gender equality, climate justice and social transformation.

However, after a few years in business or for some, a few months, you may find you lack the same passion and motivation to grow your business. That isn’t to say you don’t want to, it just doesn’t seem as fun. And with the new pressures on businesses now, it’s time for new thinking.
In working with a lot of business owners and managers, I have seen the cycle of passion for the companies start at a high and drop over the years. The key to maintaining the success and growth of your business is to keep your business’ motivation and passion high. Here are a few ways you can do this:
- Connect back with why you set up the business in the first place. What was your burning desire? What did you want to achieve? You may have set it up initially to earn money or to change career, but deep down there is a much more passionate reason as to what you wanted to achieve with your business. What was that?
- You don’t have to maintain the passion all by yourself; as long as you have stepped away from the business and put others in place that have the motivation to grow the business along with you.
- Take the time to read a motivational book or watch a motivational movie, especially ones that are true stories. Movies of extraordinary leaders in history are a great start.
- Have a target for where you want to be in a year with a BIG reward for you when you reach it. Goals are very important for us business owners. We tend to be very competitive and want to accomplish things; and goals can help you do that.
- Create a support system. Meet regularly with one or two advisers or mentors to report progress and get objective feedback and encouragement.
- If you ever catch yourself falling into a slump of non-motivation to get things done, take ‘time out’ to spend with your family at the park, going fishing or to a match. Taking the time to do this will remind you why you work as hard as you do. By remaining passionate and motivated around your work, you are giving yourself more time to spend with what’s most important.
- Take some exercise and keep your energy levels high. Keep healthy and acknowledge regularly where you are succeeding with your plans.
That’s my top 7 tips for staying passionate about your business. Have you any other tips you would like to add?

Sure, there are some not-so-bad options out there, but for the most part anything that comes in a box or bag is full of preservatives, added sugar, and WTF ingredients you would never want near your face.
But imagine that you lived in a place with no refrigerator or freezer, and you had no access to a grocery store stocked with your favorite fresh fruits and veggies. In that case, you pretty much have to rely on packaged foods even if you're one of the healthiest, fittest people on the planet.
For astronauts living on the International Space Station, this is a daily reality.
MORE: Is Your Healthy Food Actually Radioactive?
The only food aboard the ISS is like packaged foods on steroids. We're talking vacuum-sealed, sterilized, dehydrated, and powdered nuggets of nutritional goodness. Other than the no refrigeration problem, space food has to be as light as possible to keep mission costs low—the heavier the rocket, the more fuel it takes to launch.
And it's no surprise that cosmic adventurers probably aren't stuffing their faces with packaged foods while planted on Earth. It takes 18 months of grueling physical and mental training to be qualified to leave Earth's bounds. Anyone who can make it through that is used to eating their Greek yogurt, lean protein, fruits, and veggies.
But as disgusting as freeze-dried shrimp cocktail may seem, astronaut packaged food isn't as nutritionally defunct as most boxes and bags you pluck from grocery store shelves.
NASA employs a team of highly trained food scientists to develop meals that will keep astronauts strong on their journeys, some of which last 6 months or longer. Of particular concern are sodium and iron intakes.
Living in microgravity (because as any true space nerd knows, "zero-gravity" doesn't actually exist) leaves astronauts with a continuous stuffy nose, making foods high in salt and other spices more appealing to their drowsy tastebuds, Vickie Kloeris, NASA's manager of food systems for the ISS, told Smithsonian Magazine.
Floating through the cosmos also affects astronauts' red blood cell counts, meaning they need less iron than those of us on Earth. Both too much iron and too much sodium can lead to health problems like bone loss and toxicity.
MORE: Watch This: Astronaut Makes Tacos in Space
After astronauts choose their menus (about 5 months before the planned launch), food scientists and nutritionists like Kloeris analyze their selections for optimal nutrition content to avoid those problems and make recommendations to fill any holes.
Foods like dehydrated mac and cheese and thermally stabilized barbeque brisket fill those holes. And even though they might not sound appealing, modern-day astronauts are lucky compared to those who explored the cosmos at the beginning of the space program. Instead of sucking pureed bananas from a tube, today's astronauts choose delicacies like tacos, burgers, and peanut butter and honey sandwiches, which have all been heated to temperatures that kill bacteria and then packaged in airtight pouches. It's essentially like eating all of your food out of a flexible can.
But the future of space food is looking even brighter, with fresh produce now completely possible. Astronauts aboard the ISS—including Scott Kelly, the first American astronaut to spend an entire year on the station—recently grew and ate lettuce in space for the first time.
The lettuce was grown using red, blue, and green LED lights, similar to the way vertical farming works.
An earlier crop was flown back to Earth and tested to make sure the leafy greens were safe for human consumption. And after the lettuce was given the green light, all systems are a go for future space farming.
So, before long, astronauts could be eating just like we do—packaged foods be damned.Casio Launches Hurricane Relief Offer, Helping School Districts Replenish Learning Technology In Wake Of Severe Weather

This is the very cathedral on which Constantine founded religion on the basis of a huge lie.
The Bible condemns religion in general and the Catholic Church in particular. This is a quote from the prophecy: “For God has put in their hearts to fulfill His will, and to agree, and to give his kingdom to the beast, until the words of God are fulfilled. That you are that great city (Foliant) reigning over the kings of the earth.” Revelation 17:17, 18
The beast is the second, and its number – 666, is Constantine, who founded the Catholic Church and rules Rome over the kings of the then known Earth. As for the woman, it is Mary, the Babylonian name of the sun, which was stylized as a woman and placed in religion by the emperor as the mother of God.
“And on her forehead she had a name inscribed: TAIN, BABYLON GREAT, AND ABOUT EARTH. REVELATION 7: 5.
This is the only passage that is emphasized in the Bible because of its importance. Mary is at the heart of the “marriage” and the priests marry Mary at ordination, and all nuns receive this title on their own behalf so that priests can have sex with them. Stories of sexual misconduct in the church, the murder of infants and even nuns are shocking and disturbing.
George Pell is as much a victim of religion as the children he abused. All who practice this religion are under the rule of 666 and the Roman Empire, which survived thanks to this organization. Hieronymus wrote the New Testament, based on the invention of Jesus Christ by Constantine. He took the name of the Spirit “Jesus” and gave it to the painting. So, he sits in churches like the Son of God, because he created an image and made everyone worship him. Revelation 13: 12-18.
Christianity was put not by God, but by Constantine. He built the Vatican, which also marked the beginning of the Muslim branch through Augustine, Bishop of Hippopotamus. Each religion originates in the cult of the sun, and the rituals and symbols of Babylon are represented in costumes, ceremonies, celebrations and laws of each.
Catholic robes are decorated with the Star of the Burning Sun, and their instruments have the same symbol. The proof is everywhere and thus proves that the allegations made here are true. Since priests are tried for paedophilia, the church has little time to release them.
Norma Holt explored how governments are part of the world order and the establishment created by the holder of the number 666. Her work and legacy open her eyes, and the reason for this is revealed and included in God’s plan. to finish the earth as we know it.In his weekly email newsletter, Spiked editor Brendan O’Neill directs attention to a new video (below): “Our steadfast defence of self-government is in evidence elsewhere on spiked this week with the launch of our brand new spiked film – ‘Brexit and the Battle for Democracy.’ It features a stellar cast – Paul Embery, Harsimrat Kaur, Tom Slater, Gisela Stuart and Bruno Waterfield – on the Glorious Referendum, the history of the struggle for suffrage, and how we can make good on the democratic promise of 23 June.”
It’s not over yet. The battle continues with echoes of events and issues in the United States that are impossible to miss.
Quotable quote (Labour MP Gisela Stuart): “The liberal establishment was horrified that the people could turn their backs on what they had recommended them to do…Now I thought that after the referendum there would be a kind of reassessment of opinion. But if anything the sneering got worse.”- 1st

In order to bridge the gap between available public resources and the cost of needed infrastructure and facilities, public institutions across the United States are turning to public private partnership (P3) transaction structures
Faced with funding challenges and aging or inadequate facilities and infrastructure, many institutions across the nation are struggling with how to repair, expand and modernize their core infrastructure and critical facilities. Many public institutions lack the financial resources required to meet their capital needs. In order to bridge the gap between available public resources and the cost of needed infrastructure and facilities, public institutions across the United States are turning to public private partnership (P3) transaction structures. Through an infusion of private capital and management, a P3 can ease fiscal restraints and boost efficiency in the provision of public infrastructure and facilities, and thereby services. Despite their potential, however, P3s are highly complex policy instruments. Indeed, significant political, regulatory and institutional challenges must be managed, mitigated and overcome in order to move from a traditional model of delivery to one where public and private sectors work together.
P3s come in many shapes and sizes and have been used in industry sectors as diverse as roads and airports, universities, hospitals and government facilities. Simply defined, a P3 involves leveraging the private sector, which partners with the public sector to provide the capital and expertise, to develop and/or operate and maintain infrastructure and facilities on publicly owned land. The key element of a P3 is the contractual arrangement between the public and private sector partners, which allows the private sector partner a greater level of participation in a public project than traditional structures. P3s are used to solve a variety of problems, utilizing a variety of structures. As such, it is often said that “if you’ve seen one P3, you’ve seen one P3.” This diversity notwithstanding, almost all P3s share the following fundamental characteristics:
- A medium- to long-term arrangement between the public and private
- A clear agreement of shared objectives and sharing of risks
- Capital investment is typically made by the private sector
Broadly speaking, in a P3 transaction the public sector partner benefits by transferring certain important risks to the private sector partner, thus giving the public partner the advantage of the efficiencies and innovations of the private sector. Moreover, the public sector partner may benefit by receiving substantial payments upfront and/or future revenue sharing from the private sector partner. P3s can provide the public sector partner with access to much needed funds to finance educational programs and public infrastructure projects, thereby freeing funds for core programs. However, if the public entity has sufficient financial resources, it is often more beneficial to have the public sector provide the financing through lower cost tax-exempt debt issuance. The pros and cons of different\financing alternatives should always be analyzed when considering the appropriate way to structure a P3..
Under the P3 structure, the relationship between the public and private partners extends far beyond the design/build period to include the costs of operating and maintaining the facility or asset (including maintenance and energy consumption) over a period corresponding to its useful life. This “life cycle cost” structure gives the private sector partner an added incentive to design, construct, operate and maintain the facility in the most efficient and costeffective manner during the term of the P3, while still complying with the technical performance standards established by the public sector partner.
Uses of P3s and typical structures
P3s differ from both traditional privatization (where an asset or facility is simply sold to the private sector with no public sector involvement going forward) and the “Design-Build” (DB) structure (where there is no equity investment by the private sector partner and no ongoing relationship after construction). The “Design-Build-Operate-Maintain”(DBOM) structure employed by various public authorities in recent years has allowed the public sector to tap into the innovation and efficiencies of the private sector more successfully than other, more traditional approaches. A well crafted P3 structure, with its added risk transfer and financing components, offers the possibility of maximizing these innovation and efficiency benefits.
P3s can be used to address many different types of issues, but the core reasons they are typically used involves one or more of the following elements:
- Leverage private sector expertise and capital to unlock value through the privatization of publicly owned assets to generate revenue, transfer risk and improve operations
- Development of new assets with a life cycle approach, whereby the risk for design, construction, operations, maintenance and capital renewal is contractually transferred to the private sector partner
- Access to private sector capital and minimizing the credit and debt capacity impact on the public partner
- An opportunity for the public sector to establish a joint venture in a revenue producing asset with the private partner, while transferring the development and market risk to the private partner
- Leverage private sector innovation through performance based design
- Provide resources and expertise that may be unavailable to the public sector under traditional project delivery methods and accelerate the speed of delivery
- Avoid legislative and policy encumbrances that add time and cost to public sector projects
There are two predominant categories of P3 structures, each of which can be hybridized in a number of ways.
A concession agreement whereby the public institution contracts with the private sector to design, finance, construct, maintain and/or operate the facility or asset for a specified period of time. Under a concession agreement structure the private partner usually makes a cash equity investment in its P3 project and may raise further funds from the capital markets, bank facilities or other traditional private funding sources. The possibility of losing its funds, and suffering reputational damage in the financing markets, provides the private sector partner with a powerful incentive to maximize innovation and efficiency in fulfilling its obligations under the P3 arrangement. Under these agreements the public agency always maintains ownership of the facilities, but the project is generally financed by the private partner using their equity and taxable debt.
A lease/ lease back structure whereby the public sector entity ground leases property to a 501c (3) and the 501c (3) contracts with a developer/builder to design, build, operate and maintain the facilities to the specifications and standards of the public entity. Under this structure, the 501 c(3) issues tax-exempt debt to finance the facilities while the public partner enters into a longterm lease with the 501 c (3) until the underlying debt is retired. Once the debt is retired (typically around 30 years) the facilities revert back to the ownership of the public entity. Under this structure the 501 c (3) is a passive owner of the facilities, which are built and operated for the benefit of the public sector partner who will ultimately retain ownership.
Planning for a successful P3
There is much industry debate as to which of the two P3 models outlined above offer the greatest benefits. However, each of these structures have pros and cons and determining the best structure should be derived through systematic and thoughtful analysis by the public sector,taking into account the project’s specific goals, objectives, financing requirements and risk thresholds.
To ensure that the structure ultimately selected provides the maximum benefits, all public agencies should take the following steps to align their projects for success.
1. Define the need, goal to achieve and challenges to overcome
The well known phrase “if you don’t know where you are going any road will get you there” too often characterizes public projects. Many public projects are undertaken with no clear objectives or metrics by which to measure success. At the outset of a major project, it is critical to think deeply about how success will be defined. This should begin with leadership developing an overall vision and strategy for the project. This vision should consider the many ways the proposed development and/or privatization will impact the organization. The result should be a document that articulates leadership’s ideal state for the project. Once established, this vision and its supporting goals become the “conscience” of the project, forming the foundation by which all other actions are guided and evaluated.
The established vision should then be underpinned specific and measurable outcomes. One method of achieving this is to use a balanced scorecard model as the evaluative framework. The balanced scorecard considers project performance in the context of its impact on four major aspects of business: people, process, finance and the customer. The purpose of this perspective is to evaluate attainment of project objectives, not only in terms of their impact on each individual category, but also in relation to the overall equilibrium between categories. These perspectives address issues that pertain to:
People: impact of the proposed project on the human resources upon whose intellect, energy, motivation, and satisfaction the success of the organization depends
Process: ways in which the project will impact the work processes and productivity of the organization
Finance: degree to which the project optimizes the organization’s financial health and viability, both in the short and long term
Customer: impact of the project on the performance and/or satisfaction of everyone who uses or wishes to use the services and/or products provided by the organization
After project goals and success criteria have been determined, the project team must develop a clear understanding of current conditions and future needs. This process focuses on defining the current condition and contrasting it against the desired future state. The process seeks to clearly identify the “gap” or variance between what is desired and what exists today. Once the goals, success metrics and gap have been defined, it enables the development of clear project targets, by which all subsequent actions can be compared and evaluated. If rigor is invested at this stage, the clarity established will continue to pay dividends throughout the life of the project.
2. Evaluate alternative approaches to solving the problem
There is never a single approach to implementing a project. The key challenge is determining the approach that best aligns with your project’s unique goals, conditions,resources and constraints. The table above lists the typical development structures most often used on projects and includes both traditional owner-led development and P3 development. The table also provides a very high-level summary of each structure’s key features and benefits.
There are a variety of methods that can be used to analyze various traditional owner-controlled and P3 project delivery methodologies, but in all cases each alternative should be evaluated based upon its ability to deliver on the project’s specific goals, objectives, constraints and timing requirements.
A common practice is to build an initial business case that compares the merits of all structures contemplated against their ability to meet the project’s overall goals on a risk-adjusted basis. This process considers each project structure on a life cycle cost basis that incorporates estimates of all project costs (e.g. design, construction, operations, maintenance, financing, etc.) and uses subject matter experts to value the various risks that are retained or transferred under each methodology. The goal is to objectively analyze the benefits and costs of each project delivery structure over the life of the investment prior to making a decision to move forward. It is also important as part of this process to evaluate any new delivery structure against what the public entity has done in the past and is the most familiar with.
3. Develop a clear program of requirements and performance standards
“Measure twice, cut once.” This old carpenter’s adage nicely encapsulates the role programming plays in development. Where architecture can be characterized as the art and science of designing a solution for the built environment, programming is the process by which the architectural problem to be solved is appropriately defined and articulated. A good program provides a clear and measurable map to an architectural outcome. Ideally, this map should convey the quantitative and qualitative characteristics desired by the architectural solution, including the key aspects of the work to be supported, the image and feel of the space, detailed building performance criteria for construction and operations and maintenance, space utilization requirements, space standards, key adjacency relationships, special space criteria, cost parameters and, most importantly, definitive ways to evaluate the architectural solution against measurable performance criteria.
“Measure twice, cut once.”
This old carpenter’s adage nicely encapsulates the role programming plays in development.
In addition to a clear program, a P3 requires the rigorous development of performance standards. Depending on the nature of the project, these standards will address some or all of the following categories: design, construction, operations, maintenance, and handback conditions. It is critically important that these standards be articulated in a manner that is measurable and contractually enforceable. Another key element of performance specifications for a P3 is to strive to make them outcome based, rather than prescriptive. For example, instead of specifying exactly what products and materials should be used to ensure that a room in a facility has adequate acoustic performance, a performance specification would simply state that the room has to perform within a certain range of decibel levels. With that standard set, the private sector partner has the freedom to determine how best to achieve the standard, rather than having it dictated by the public partner’s specifications. This method of establishing standards provides the private sector with the flexibility to provide innovative solutions to achieve a prescribed level of performance, while still providing the public sector with the measurable assurance that their performance requirements will be achieved. Establishing specifications in this manner requires specialized expertise that most public agencies do not have and is a reason why it is critically important for the public entity to engage the right advisors to help them navigate through this process.
4. Determine the project timing/critical path for delivery
Although well-designed P3s are can typically be implemented more quickly than traditional publicly controlled development, they often become delayed in the preparation and approval process if not properly planned. In a P3 it is very important to evaluate the time it will take for the public entity to define the project’s requirements and to define the governance structure and all the approvals that will be needed to get the project off the ground. It is in the pre-planning and approval process that we most typically see schedule slippage on P3s. This is particularly the case when it is the first time that a public entity has ever been done by an agency.
To ensure success and adherence to schedule the public entity should be careful to address the following:
- The time it will take to analyze alternative delivery structures and build a business case for the procurement
- Time required to develop Technical Requirements and the P3 Project Agreement
- Clearly define the governance structure from the public side
- Have a clear understanding, strategy and timeline to gain stakeholder approvals
- Establish a stakeholder communication plan to facilitate project support and approvals
5. Determine what staff and consultant resources are required
Most organizations do not have staff with expertise in the complicated finance, real estate and risk allocation strategies that must be addressed in a P3. Therefore, when considering the implementation of a complex P3 it is important for the public sector partner to honestly assess their staff’s expertise and, where needed, retain the specialized real estate, finance and legal advisors who can support you through the process. The legal advisor will always be a specific entity. However, the real estate and financial advisory expertise you’ll need could be contained within the same firm. Careful analysis of prior experience of the advisors is essential when assembling your advisory team. Factors to consider typically include:
- Do the advisors have experience with similar projects? For instance, if the development is a student housing project, a P3 advisor who has only done toll roads and bridges many not be an ideal candidate.
- Do the advisors have experience with a wide variety of P3 structures or are they specialized around one particular structure (DBFOM concession agreements vs. lease/lease back structures, for example)?
- Do the advisors have previous experience with your institution?
- Have the advisors demonstrated the ability to work well with multidisciplinary teams?
- Do they feel like a good “fit” with your institution’s culture?
- Most importantly, how have they performed on prior P3s, as demonstrated through their qualifications, and further validated by reference checks?
6. Evaluate financing needs and resources
Financing is always a key consideration on every P3 project and establishing a supportable plan of finance that optimizes cost and effectively allocates risks and rewards between the parties is of paramount importance. There are many key considerations that must be addressed in determining the plan of finance and if your university does not have this expertise in house, you need to retain and advisor who does. Some typical financing considerations include:
- Do you have access to adequate funding to support the project or will you have to rely on the private partner to provide capital?
- What is the credit and debt capacity impact of various financing alternatives?
- Are there any restrictions on various types of funding and, if so, how do these restrictions impact the project?
- Are the assets revenue producing?
- Do you want the developer to have “at risk” equity in the transaction to incentivize their performance?
- Is there an opportunity for profit sharing between the public and private partners and, if so, how will this be structured?
- What are the financials implications of transferring various risks to the private sector?
7. Identify the key stakeholders and governance and approval process
We cannot emphasize strongly enough the need for a clear process and strategy to manage stakeholders and establish the governance and approval process on a P3. Failure to do so is probably the single biggest reason a P3 project fails. This is particularly the case in large systems where there is a governance and approval process required at multiple levels, both at the campus level and with the central system office. Key elements of this strategy should include:
- Identification of all internal and external stakeholders who can influence the project. For each stakeholder you should identify who they are, what their role is on the project (if any) and their influence and decision making authority.
- Clearly identify the governance structure for the project. Who makes the decisions? When are decisions made? What are the interests and concerns of each key decision making individual or body?
- What is the communication strategy for each key stakeholder and decision maker?
- What data and analysis must be provided to each decision maker to facilitate a positive outcome?
- What is the timing of decisions and how does this impact the overall. For example, if key board approvals only happen at certain times of the year, the P3 development schedule should be adjusted to work towards these milestones.
8. Identify the key risks and determine how they should be allocated between partners
A fundamental attribute of all P3s is the sharing of risk between the public and private sectors. These risks vary between projects, but generally fall into one of the following major categories, and within each of these categories will be a variety of subcategories:
- Design and construction
- Operation and maintenance
- Capital renewal
- Schedule
- Financing
- Cost
- Revenue risk
- Market risk
In traditional public projects the public entity (owner) retains most of the risk, while in P3s some or all of this risk is contractually transferred to the private partner. Understanding how to value risks factors and determine which risks are better held by the public or private partner is a core success factor for any P3, but not a skill that most staff in the public sector is trained in. Fortunately, there is an emerging center of expertise among a number of consulting firms that can help guide the process of identifying these risks and determining whether they are best retained by the public entity or transferred to the private partner. An important concept that all public entities must understand on P3s is that all risk carries cost and the goal of a P3 is to allocate these risks to the party that can most cost effectively own them.
Developing a P3 that balances flexibility and clarity, aspirations and reality, to meet the needs of both public clients and potential private partners requires hard work, hard thinking and hard choices. However, if clients have experienced consultants to guide them through a structured process that is designed to leverage the skills and wisdom of the private sector while adhering to the policy requirements and risk thresholds of the public entity, they are worth the effort. The public entity is able to deliver a project that is creative and well executed, maximizing return and minimizing exposure. The private partner is able to participate in a development that provides them with a well secured return on investment in what is often a high-visibility project serving the public interest, the classic definition of “doing well by doing good.”Sing.

The above was a melodramatic post that I wrote but didn't publish months ago. I look past it whenever I post a new blog, but can't find it in me to delete it. Why? Because at the time, it was a real feeling that I was afraid to put into the world. It wasn't because I believed I would feel differently, but because of all of the people I have preached hope to. The hope exists, but at the time everything was blurry. It's still blurry, but I can drive.
When I was a kid, we would go to this church three or four nights a week and my mom would practice her songs or her skits with her friend. Me and Jason would occupy our world in whatever way made sense. We were and are very different people, but would find ourselves in the same building over and over. I'm not really sure what he did with his time...he was more of a loner. I would explore every dank, wooden crevice of that building. There is this certain smell of old Bibles and felt paper whenever you enter an old person's church.
This one night, I was in the basement searching for something interesting among all of these boring books when the lights went out. I was alone in the basement of an old wooden building as a 7 year old. I rushed to what I thought was the door and ran face first into something old, creaky, and wooden. I got something in my eye. I started to panic. I didn't know which way was out and I couldn't see anything beyond the blur that the tears were bringing. I shouted and got no answer. I shouted more and got only my own echo off of the wooden lecterns.
Life was doomed.
I used my hands and crawled my way to an opening which led to stairs, then out into ear shot of my mother who was talking to her friend. She got me in the car in hysterics and taught me this trick to getting things out of your eyes. She sat me on the passenger seat of our old duct taped conversion van and looked into my teary eyes. She taught me to pull your upper eye lid over your bottom. If it was just and eyelash, the problem would be solved. If it wasn't the tears would drive out the beast. It was an eyelash.
I won't forget that moment because of the feeling of being completely alone and in the dark. I felt that again when I wrote the words above. What I wasn't thinking of was that I found my way out of that dark wooden basement and to the safety of my mother. I think I remember a lot of terrible moments and focus on them without focusing on the way out. I guess right now I'm feeling my way to safety. That's a comforting feeling because I know safety is within earshot.

The bullish stereotypes so often associated with men have meant they’ve felt ashamed of really taking care of themselves. Men shouldn’t do skincare, that’s for women. Men shouldn’t moisturise, that’s for women. What a load of nonsense.
But now, Aussie men are dismantling these stereotypes and shifting their focus onto taking care of themselves!
Tony & Munro fusion cosmetics found that sales for their products have increasingly been purchases by male customers. Since March last year, sales have tripled!
What are men buying?
Tony & Munro has reported that there was huge interest in its three-step skincare routine:
- Revive Hydrating Eye Gel
- Correcting Concealer
- Renew Nourishing BB Cream For Men
“It hydrates and primes skin, reducing fine lines, reducing oil and allowing shine control whilst smoothing pores to give a radiant matte finish, and can be used alone or before the other products in the range,” says Ewan Munro Belsey, co-founder of Tony & Munro fusion cosmetics.
And clearly, taking care of yourself is paying off:
Lachlan before Tony & Munro products Lachlan after products
From spots to clear skin. Simple as that.
Munro Belsey noted that men are under-serviced in the beauty market compared to Asia and Europe, but this shift is promising for the future of men’s beauty products. “Men are allowed to be blokey blokes or whomever they want to be,” says Ewan Munro Belsey, however, don’t let toxic masculinity determine your personality and your choices.by Jerry Gordon and Ilana Freedman (May. more>>>. more>>>

I’m deep into a work-in-progress on race-obsession which this essay is a part of: not race-prejudice, for I’m confident that the notion that “this is a racist society we live in” is nonsense, product of an inability (or perhaps unwillingness) to read significant historical change. The particular race that cliché refers to is, of course, African-American. But American society—or rather that significant part of it so obsessed— does not limit its clichés to that one group, would rather share with us all its superficial knowingness and unearned certainty that other groups as well are embraced by the “white man’s” contempt. And that confidence that the white man’s contempt is boundless is what I am thinking about now in this excerpt. more>>>

Jerry Gordon, Senior Editor of The New English Review and co-host of The Lisa Benson Radio Show will be the principal speaker at the conclusion of The March of Remembrance commemorating Yom Ha Shoah sponsored by Rabbi Eric Tokajer, Brit Ahm Synagogue of Pensacola, Florida. Rabbi Israel Vana of B'nai Israel Synagogue will invoke the traditional Mourner Prayer for the Six Million European Jewish Men, women and Children murdered in unspeakable ways in Hitler's Final Solution The March will start at 3:PM in downtown Pensacola at Jackson Street and terminate at the junction of Palafox and Chase Streets. The following is Mr. Gordon's presentation at the March of Remembrance.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
The following is an excerpt from a speech given by Ze’ev Jabotinsky in Warsaw, Poland on Tisha B’Av in 1937. [Two years before the Nazis invaded Poland.]
Ze’ev Jabotinsky, founder of the Jewish Legion and Revisionist Zionism
“…. Two years later World War Two started in which Six Million European Jewish men, women and children were murdered in Hitler’s Final Solution. After the disclosures of the Holocaust the world said ‘never again’.
Fast forward to Shoah Commemorations in 2016. 2.5 million Jews see no future for themselves and their children in Europe
Surveys of Jewish Communities in France, Britain and Germany attest to the fear of Islamic terrorism and uncertainty of continued protection by national governments of their homes, synagogues and communities:
40 percent of respondents said that anti-Semitism poses a serious threat to the future of Jewish life in their country in a poll of European Jewish leaders published in March 2016 by the International Center for Community Development of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee.
Jews in Paris, Toulouse, Brussels and Copenhagen have been murdered by Muslim émigrés, Al Qaeda and Islamic State returning veterans. Israeli and European Jews were among those targeted and injured in the March 2016 Brussels Airport attack.
Estimates drawn from several EU Surveys indicate that 150 million of the 400 million EU population harbor anti-Semitic views:
Data from the 2014 ADL Global 100 Anti-Semitism survey for Major European Jewish communities show:
Most troubling EU and Belgian Surveys indicate that Muslims are 8 times more likely than non-Muslims to espouse Anti-Semitism.
European Jews are leaving reflected in immigration to Israel. Amid rise in attacks, 9,880 made aliyah in 2015, including almost 8,000 from France. Jewish Agency Director, Natan Sharansky said: “An unprecedented number of Jews feel that Europe is no longer their home.”
Europe’s 44 million Muslim population in 2010 is estimated to grow to more than 58 million by 2030.
The Muslim population in European countries with major Jewish communities is already significant:
Muslim population in major European cities far exceeds national representation:
Jewish synagogues throughout Europe have been the subject of fire bombings, anti-Semitic graffiti defacing synagogues and members attacked by rioters. Today it is common for synagogues throughout Europe to be protected by machine gun toting security police or military. Observant Jewish men and youths are fearful of wearing kippots in public. Young girls cover their necklaces with Mogen David stars. The insurgent far right AfD Party (Alternative for Germany, Alternative für Deutschland) has proposed banning Schechita Jewish humane ritual slaughter of animals and Brit Millah, Circumcision for male babies.
European Jewish Congress President, Dr. Moshe Kantor and Franz Timmermans, EU vice president say:
"If hundreds of thousands of Jews leave the European Union, which is becoming a very strong possibility, then it will be judged a failure," Kantor said.”
“In the last couple of years we have seen this age-old monster come up again in Europe, which is anti-Semitism,” said Frans Timmermans. “We Europeans, whenever we are in trouble, when there is a crisis, we look for people to blame and throughout the ages Jews have been on the receiving end.”
What does this mean for American Jews? Israel:.
That gave rise to criticism by the ADL’s Greenblatt cited in a Ha’aretz article:.
The three defendants will next appear in court at the Old Bailey on May 13.
According to the radio report Mrs Boufassi turned up with her face covered, and instead of demanding that she showed respect for the court by showing her face the District Judge merely asked the lawyers to confirm that they were satisfied that the woman under the tent was indeed Mrs Boufassi. She is a Belgian national. She would not have been allowed to wear that cover in public anywhere in Belgium where the full face veil is banned. But she is permitted to show her contempt for the English court!- 40+ lotteries
- Intuitive interface
- Mobile friendly site
- 11 supported languages
- Syndicates and bundles available
- Plenty withdrawal and deposit methods
- Restricted in many countries
- The site could offer more banking methods
LottoSmile has been in the industry for 19 years so it’s one of the longest-running lottery sites on the market. It’s also one of the most popular lottery sites in India because it offers over 40 international lotteries to play including US Powerball.
But what makes LottoSmile unique and does the site offer players syndicates and other types of exciting jackpot games? I’ve tested LottoSmile to provide you with a comprehensive review so you can decide whether this lottery site is worth the hype.
If you live in India and you’re looking for a new lottery site to try, then give this review a read before you sign up to LottoSmile.
Contents
Features and Games
What Makes LottoSmile Stand Out?
Fortunately, lottery sites are 100% legal in India, so locals are able to play the most popular international lotteries on LottoSmile with higher jackpots. What makes LottoSmile stand out is that it’s been a lottery site for almost two decades and is one of the pioneers for online lottery games.
What I appreciate about LottoSmile is that it’s free to register on the site and it was quick and easy to add funds to my account. It works similar to other lottery sites because you can simply purchase your ticket and a LottoSmile agent will purchase a physical ticket for you, scan it and send it to your inbox.
Bundles
What Indian lottery players will enjoy about LottoSmile is that the site offers bundles. You can purchase a bundle of lottery tickets at a discount price. These bundles include personal and group entries so you can play with your own winning lottery numbers. There are three bundles to choose from:
- Classic: 65 lines + personal entry
- Deluxe: 200 lines + personal entry
- Premium (best odds): 265 lines + personal entry
I found the bundles quite easily when browsing through the site. Simply click on the Lotteries tab at the top left-hand side of the screen, then pick your lottery. At the top of the digital lottery tickets there will be tabs. Click on the Bundles tab to choose one of the three options.
Syndicates
Another feature Indian locals will love about LottoSmile is that it offers syndicates to boost odds on higher winning lotteries. The LottoSmile syndicates cover 15 lotteries. Syndicates on LottoSmile is an excellent way for Indian locals to increase their chances of winning.
With LottoSmile you can purchase multiple lines with random ticket selections with a group of people. Syndicates will then own a portion of the collective tickets and will get a portion of any prizes won on the tickets.
What I enjoy about LottSmile is that it’s easy to find what you’re looking for. To start playing syndicates simply click on the lottery you want to play and then select the Syndicate tab to begin playing. Then choose how many lines you’d like to draw and then click on the play button to begin.
Raffles
Syndicates and bundles on lotteries aren’t the only features LottoSmile offers players in India. The site also has raffles that you can play. A raffle is a type of lottery because numbers that are picked are also drawn at random to determine the winners of the prize.
However, unlike lotteries you don’t get to choose your raffle number. Instead, you are automatically assigned a number that’s printed on your ticket when you buy one. With raffles there is always a guarantee of a winner.
When I clicked on the Raffle tab at the top of my screen I found two raffle games on LottoSmile. Simply pick the one you want to play by clicking on the Play button. On the side of the raffles you’ll see the prize that’s offered and when the next draw date is.
LottoSmile Lotteries You Can Play
In India, locals can purchase lotteries from brick and mortar shops but they will only be able to play local lotteries. If you live in India and you want to try your hand at international lotteries then you’re spoilt for choice on LottoSmile. There are over 40 lotteries for you to choose including all the popular lotteries such as:
- US Powerball
- Italy Superstar
- Spain Euromillions
- SuperEnalotto
When you click on the Lottery tab at the top you’ll be transferred to a page with all the lottery games offered by LottoSmile. Click on the Play button so you can start buying tickets. Choose your numbers from 1 to 69 or choose the quick pick option to autofill your lottery tickets. You can also choose how many lines you want to purchase at the top of your ticket.
Is LottoSmile Legit?
The most important feature I check before signing up to a lottery site is if it’s legitimate. You should always check if a lottery site is licensed and read the terms and conditions before signing up. Locals in India will be happy to know that LottoSmile is 100% legitimate because it’s licensed with Malta Gaming Authority.
Online Security Features
Another factor to check before signing up to a lottery site is if it has online security features. The online security must protect your information when signing up to the lotto site. Your banking details and any lotto winnings must be secured.
I did the research and can confirm that LottoSmile has secure online security because it’s encrypted with the Geotrust SSL security system. This means that your online information is safe and won’t be compromised by hackers.
LottoSmile Sign Up Process – Step-By-Step Guide
Most lottery sites are frustrating with their sign up process. Fortunately, it was quite easy to sign up with LottoSmile. What’s more, the registration is completely free. You can also click on the Globe icon in the top right hand corner to change your language.
To sign up simply click on the Sign Up tab at the top right hand corner of the screen, A box will pop up where you’ll need to enter your email address and password. Then click on the drop down bar to choose your location. Indian locals will need to choose India to get offers specific to that location.
Choosing the right location is important if you want LottoSmile to recognize your bank and the currency you want to use to buy tickets.
Design and User Experience
Most lottery sites ensure they can provide the best user experience for their players. LottoSmile is no exception. The lottery site is easy to navigate through and you won’t experience any downtimes. All the tabs you need are at the top of the page so you can switch between pages easily without opening another browsing tab.
What I appreciate about LottoSmile is that it has lots of information that can help new players understand how to purchase their tickets and play lotteries on the site. There’s also a comprehensive FAQ section that gives you more detail about the site.
Does LottoSmile Have a Mobile App?
LottoSmile offers a mobile app for Android and iOS users in India. If you can’t find the app on the Playstore or Apple Store, simply visit the LottoSmile website on your phone and scroll down to the bottom of the page. There are two tabs that allow you to download the app on your iOS or Android device.
On the other hand, if you don’t want the app to take up space on your smartphone you’ll appreciate that LottoSmile’s website is mobile friendly. This means you can visit the website on your smartphone and play lotteries without downloading the app.
Bonuses and Promotions
The one feature that most India locals look for in a lottery site is its bonuses and promotions. Fortunately, LottoSmile offers plenty of bonuses and promotions that will allow you to play lotteries without spending too much money. Take a look at this next section to see what bonuses and promotions LottoSmile offers.
Subscriptions
With LottoSmile, Indian locals can opt for subscriptions on their favorite lotteries. When you subscribe to a lottery you will be placed in every consecutive draw until you decide to cancel your subscription.
Furthermore, when you subscribe you will get every 10th ticket free and a whopping 25 VIP points. What I loved about the subscription process on LottoSmile is that you can change your lottery numbers at any time to increase your chances of winning.
To subscribe to your favorite lottery on LottoSmile simply click on the subscription tab at the bottom of your lottery ticket. It should be noted that you will be charged every time you’re placed into a draw until you cancel your subscription.
Discounts
If you click on the Promotions tab at the top of the screen you’ll find some interesting discounts offered by LottoSmile. The first one on offer is a 10% discount on Romania Joker. This is a special discount on one-time entries and is valid for bundles syndicates.
Multi-Draw
There are plenty of other discounts offered on LottoSmile. For example, if you choose the multi-draw option you can get 20% off your ticket for 10 draws. The maximum number of draws you can play is 52 and offers a 25% discount.
The multi-draw option can be found at the bottom of the ticket on the lottery you’ve chosen. Click on the drop down bar to choose the number of draws you want.
VIP Club
The VIP Club offers discounts of up to 20%. You can also earn VIP points when you become a club member. For Indian VIP club members you also get exclusive promotions and discounts on your favorite lotteries. You also get personal account management with 24/7 customer care.
Indian players that sign up to LottoSmile for the first time will get a discount bonus on the first purchase. There is also a money-back guarantee on first purchases if you accidently bought from the wrong lottery.
Payment Methods and Withdrawals
To make your first payment you can either use a debit or credit card or use an eWallet. I was impressed by the number of currencies available on LottoSmile but unfortunately it doesn’t support the Indian Rupee. Use one of the following deposit methods:
- Visa
- Mastercard
- Postepay
- Bleue
- Diners Club
- WebMoney
- CartaSI
To withdraw money from LottoSmile simply click on the Withdraw option.The available methods for withdrawals are:
- Visa
- Mastercard
- Bank transfers
- Diners club
The minimum withdrawal amount on LottoSmile is $1 except on the bank transfer option.
How to Get Your Winnings
Your winnings will be sent directly to your account after the lottery receives receipt of your winnings. However different lotteries may have different prize collection procedures. LottoSmile’s customer service will guide you through the process.
JackPot winners may have to collect prizes in person. I found on the LottoSmile site that the company may offer to fly winners to the locations to collect their prize. For smaller winnings, the amount will be transferred to your account where you can withdraw it using your preferred method.
Payout Rules
Indian players will be notified via LottoSmile if they’ve won prizes. If you win a jackpot through LottoSmile the only personal details that will be published is your name, initials and country of residence on the LottoSmile site. What’s more, lottery winnings may be subjected to taxes in India.
Before you play a lottery take a look at the terms and conditions to find out what the payout rules are for that particular lottery. There are some lotteries that can choose to pay out the jackpot in a lump sum or by installments over several years.
Fees and Commission
Indian players will be happy to know that LottoSmile doesn’t charge commission fees on any prizes you win. This means the prize money you win from any of the lotteries are your own. However, they do charge a small fee for purchasing and scanning tickets on your behalf.
Customer Support
If you become a VIP member you can get 24/7 personalized customer support. Indian players can contact LottoSmile through Whatsapp, or send an email by using the form on the LottoSmile website. LottoSmile also has Live chat but they don’t stipulate what the operating hours are.
The Verdict on LottoSmile – Is It Worth Your Time?
LottoSmile is a lottery site that offers plenty of bonuses, promotions, discounts and various payment methods. I would say Indian players will definitely enjoy playing on LottoSmile because of its easy to use interface and many lottery games and raffles available. What’s more, there are ways Indian players can boost their odds such as playing syndicates.
So if you live in India and you’re looking for a fun new way to win jackpots LottoSmile won’t disappoint you. Use my review to see how to sign up and start winning through LottoSmile.

How to treat leukemia13/07/2021A delegation of Indigenous people from Canada will meet with Pope Francis at the Vatican…
What would an apology from the pope mean to Canada’s Indigenous (and why did it take so long)?
In 2015, Canada’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission issued 94 “Calls to Action.”
The commission had spent seven years unearthing disturbing facts about Canada’s residential school system. These revelations came from official documents, written histories and eyewitness testimonies of school workers and former students, many of whom suffered physical, sexual and emotional abuse.
Along with several comprehensive reports, these 94 “calls” were the result. The commission’s conclusion was that, given all the truth we now know about what Canada had done to Indigenous people, these are the tangible steps we need to take to achieve reconciliation.
Call No. 58 requested the pope to personally apologize for these schools within the year — on Canadian soil, at that.
It felt … ambitious, which is to say it felt a bit unlikely. But, six years later, the Holy Father has confirmed his intention to make a reconciliatory visit to Canada.
Why did this take so long?
The announcement from the Vatican in late October that Pope Francis will visit Canada to assist in the reconciliation process is causing ripples of speculation and prediction. But one obvious question we could ask is: Why did this take so long? After all, this is quite a bit later than Call 58’s parameter of “within one year.”

The reason was that, the commission’s wishes notwithstanding, the Holy Father was unlikely to come without an invitation from the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops. Such an invitation was not forthcoming.
The official explanation for that, as given in a 2018 letter from the CCCB to the Canadian Parliament, was that a papal apology like this didn’t really make sense.
“The Catholic community in Canada has a decentralized structure,” the letter began. It contains several ecclesiastical organizations that each operate relatively autonomously. Different dioceses and orders had operated residentials schools, but it’s nonsensical to claim “the Church,” as a whole, was responsible for them; those parts of the Church that did bear responsibility for the schools have already issued multiple apologies.
Further, despite his prehumous cult of personality, Pope Francis is not interested in a Church that is synonymous with himself. His pontificate has stressed the theme of decentralizing the Church (see the synod on synodality) and, consistent with that, he expressed his feeling that “each bishop, aware of local needs and aspirations, is best positioned as the principal faith leader and pastor of his diocese to take concrete steps toward reconciliation.” It is quite opposed to the push of his papacy to think that the Church has not apologized until the pope has.
A grand gesture is needed
On a legal and ecclesial level, this is all strictly and technically correct. But no one seemed satisfied by it, and it’s easy to see why.
Humans are not just rational animals; we are also symbolic and imaginative creatures. Powerful and dramatic displays tend to move us more powerfully than mere factual information does (which is one reason the Church has liturgy and sacraments, not just Scripture and catechesis).
For example, one of the commission’s reports was about the unmarked graves of Indigenous children on residential school properties. Everyone was, or should have been, aware that remains of Indigenous kids were secretly buried across the country. Yet this issue did not receive much attention until some of those graves were located. Somehow, finding these bodies shook and haunted us more than that detailed 273-page document did.
Humans need the concrete; the knowledge that all the relevant “Catholic entities” have already apologized somehow wasn’t concrete enough. There was still something tangible missing, something like the emotionally irrefutable visual of a sorrowful pope uttering his apology on the ground where these harms occurred.
Further, as one Indigenous person reportedly told Bishop Don Bolen (then of Saskatoon), “It’s not that we think the pope is personally responsible … [But we] understand from our sense of family that when one person in a family does something wrong, the whole family needs to be involved in the process of restitution, and we understand Pope Francis to be the father of your family.”
This idea of “household restitution” certainly has a Biblical ring to it. Perhaps that is why, despite its overall demurral, the 2018 CCCB letter added that “Pope Francis remains open to a future visit when it is opportune.”
Well, it appears the opportune time has come.
What the pope’s visit will mean
Though details about the potential visit remain vague, we know that, before his visit, the Holy Father will receive a delegation of Indigenous elders, knowledge keepers and survivors in Rome. Before he comes to speak, he will wait and listen.
When he does come to speak, what will it mean for Canadian Catholics? I asked around and found that some are delighted, even giddy; others are ambivalent, uncertain about what the effects of such a visit will be.
But most Catholics told me they didn’t really care what this visit would mean for the Church. They cared about what it would mean for the survivors.
What will it mean for the survivors to hear an expression of regret from the pope as he stands on the land of their ancestors? It feels absurd to speculate about how such a diverse group would respond to something like this. Every survivor is unique: their stories are unique, their feelings are unique, and their reactions will be unique.
For some, it might leave them indifferent or even more cynical. Others might find their hardened hostility somewhat softened (witness how some traditionalists warmed a bit to the pope after his urbi et orbi blessing at the beginning of the pandemic). Still others might feel deeply moved and see this as a turning point for reconciliation, as residential school victim Phil Fontaine did when Pope Benedict XVI apologized to him personally.
But, ultimately, the overall reaction will probably depend, not so much on the apology itself, but on what Francis chooses to say and do besides apologize. After all, the lasting trauma of the residential schools is hardly the only hardship Canada’s First Peoples face. They struggle with a host of oppressive problems, from the plight of missing and murdered Indigenous women, to the continued failure to provide clean water, to the harm done to Indigenous children in foster care.
Francis has built a reputation for himself as a pontiff with a prophetic and often denunciatory voice. This may be his moment to raise that voice against these injustices.
As it happens, he already has a foundation on which to build.
The legacy of John Paul II
Pope St. John Paul II was the first (and, until Francis arrives, the last) pope to visit Canada. On two separate occasions, in 1984 and 1987, he gave impassioned addresses to Canada’s Aboriginal peoples.
In these talks, he not only affirmed the worthiness of their ancient cultures, but also, in keeping with the Church’s traditional political teachings, stressed their “right” to a “just and equitable measure of self-determination,” as well as their need to control their lands, their material resources,and their economies. For his advocacy, Alberta’s Blood Tribe appointed John Paul II an honorary chief of their people.
Forty years later, and you’d be hard-pressed to say that Canada’s First Peoples have achieved self-government or control over their resources. Although the government has a constitutionally mandated “duty to consult” First Peoples before taking actions that could affect their rights (such as industrial activity on their land), it is not bound to actually follow the recommendations of Indigenous people, nor does “duty to consult” extend to the drafting of legislation. Though steps have been taken toward actualizing Indigenous self-government, it is still far from universally recognized, and nations like the Wet’suwet’en still struggle to protect their historic and sacred territory from pipeline development.
In protesting this arrangement, Pope John Paul II was himself building on a precedent of Catholics fighting for Aboriginal rights. He explicitly referred to 1537’s Pastorale Officium, which also affirmed the rights and freedoms of Indigenous peoples, but we could also consider historical Canadian figures like the Ojibwa chief Francis Pegahmagabow, the deadliest sniper of World War I and a practicing Catholic who was also a zealous advocate for “Indian” self-government.
Now, Pope Francis will have an opportunity to join this legacy as part of the “process of restitution” he must undertake as father of his family. If he joins his expression of sorrow for the Church’s failures with his own “Calls to Action” to achieve justice for Canada’s First Nations, that could be just the kind of symbolic gesture that could drive us to fulfil the hope expressed by Pope St. John Paul II:
“I pray that the Holy Spirit will help you all to find the just way so that Canada may be a model for the world in upholding the dignity of the Aboriginal peoples.”

Let there be light.
City of Tallahassee Utilities crews are heading to Conway, South Carolina, about 15 miles from Myrtle Beach. The fleet, made up of electrical and mechanical resources as well as a fuel truck, will help restore power to those affected by Hurricane Florence.
"The main thing we're going to do is go up there and try to improve the quality of life," said line crew foreman Heath Gebhart. "There is no better gift you can give someone than giving them their lights back after two or three days without them."
The city is sending 30 linemen. Wolf Tree, Inc. is sending 18 people to help clear trees. This group will lend its services for two weeks. If there's still work to be done, another crew will be sent in exchange.

Wookies, tribbles, and flux capacitors are all high quality and dandy (and we would not commerce them for all the tea in China!) however what we’ll focus on at this time, girls and nerds, is the lifelike facet of science fiction, and the handful of films that put on their considering caps, consulted their native rocket scientists, and got their info (roughly) straight.

I have no backbone in relation to Nazi stories, stories about human lab experiments, and stories about psychological disability.
The fact that time slows for someone who gets too close to one thing with intense gravity isn’t something new in science, after all (that is relativity one zero one, of us, and it’s an noticed, effectively-established phenomenon in science that’s each stranger and more fascinating than fiction could ever be), but having a movie revolve their complete plot round this real-life manner of time travel, properly, frankly, it’s about time.

- United Airlines plans to resume service on almost 30 international routes in September, including flights to Asia, India, Australia, Israel and Latin America.
- RwandAir, the national airline of Rwanda, will restart industrial flights from Kigali Airport on 1 August.

- It follows the comfort of journey restrictions by the Chinese authorities.

With that in thoughts, it’s easy to see why some Governments like Argentina and Colombia are pushing back the reopening dates for international travel. Nevertheless, Colombia can’t hold its airspace shut any longer. EasyFly is in a reorganization process beneath the Colombian regulation, meaning that over eighty% of the home market share within the nation is in jeopardy. Viva Air could develop after the pandemic as many low-price carriers in the region will.

Chris Townsend puts this waterproof jacket through its paces on the hill.
A new jacket from Salewa, the Salewa Sella PTX.
The hood has an unusual feature that I like. It is helmet compatible but instead of a drawcord to reduce the volume, which always results in bunched fabric, it has a zipped panel that folds away neatly. The hood only has a rear drawcord for adjustment but can be closed round the head well. It gives good protection without impeding vision.
The Salewa Sella PTX Responsive has three big chest pockets that will all hold maps and two stretch mesh inner ones that are good for keeping gloves and hats warm. There’s also a little pocket by the cuff of one sleeve that I can’t see much use for. Unusually the Sella also has a stretch snow powder skirt. This can be zipped out when not needed.
The Salewa Sella PTX Responstive is a good jacket, regardless of whether the properties of the fabric make any real-world difference. It is a bit more expensive than jackets at a similar weight that perform much the same.

Quick EnquiryGalbūt jūs ir žinote šio žodžio reikšmę, galbūt net teko susidurti su tuo, tačiau nemažai daliai žmonių tai gali būti visiškai negirdėtas dalykas, tad paprastai paaiškinsime, kas tai yra. Šis žodis gali turėti dvejas reikšmes. Viena iš jų susijusi su vertybiniais popieriais ir yra labiau aktuali įmonėms. Tačiau antroji reikšmė gali būti aktuali kiekvienam iš jūsų. Taigi, refinansavimas yra paskolos ėmimas ir gautų pinigų naudojimas finansuoti iš anksčiau turimai paskolai. Kitaip tariant, turite paskolą ir ją reikia arba norite grąžinti, tačiau neturite pinigų, tuomet galite pasiimti kitą paskolą ir už ją apmokėti jau turimą.
Kada gali prireikti refinansavimo?
Aišku, čia gali pasitaikyti įvairių ir pakankamai individualių atvejų, todėl aptarsime kelis pačius dažniausius. Vienas iš tokių – jums reikia mokėti įmokas už turimą paskolą, tačiau pinigų tam šiuo metu neturite, tada refinansavimas gali tikrai praversti, o vėliau, kai jau vėl uždirbsite pinigų, jums teks mokėti naują paskolą. Kitas atvejis gali būti, kai jūs norite išvengti didelių palūkanų ir naujos paskolos palūkanos yra mažesnės už dabartinės esamos, tuomet pasinaudoja refinansavimo galimybe apmokate esamą paskolą ir mokate naują, kuri turi mažesnes palūkanas bei taip sutaupote. Tiek vienu, tiek kitu atveju refinansavimas () leidžia rasti gerą išeitį, tačiau, kaip ir imant paskolą, šis žingsnis turėtų būti atsakingas
Refinansavimas ir pagal ką išsirinkti paslaugą siūlančią įmonę.
Kai jau nusprendėte pasinaudoti refinansavimo galimybe, svarbu tinkamai pasirinkti iš daugybės įmonių siūlančių šią paslaugą. Pirmiausia, galite pasinaudoti Google paieškos sistema ir susirasti nemažai tokių įmonių. Kadangi tik tai užtikrins, jog rinksitės iš daugumos siūlomų variantų, o ne iš kelių, kurie atsitiktinai gali papulti ne patys geriausi, lyginant su kitais. Tuomet galite jas visas palyginti ir išsirinkti tinkamiausią sprendimą. Tačiau tai nėra taip paprasta, kaip gali atrodyti. Jums teks labai atidžiai paskaityti kiekvienos iš jų siūlomas sąlygas bei terminus, o, svarbiausia, reikėtų atkreipti dėmesį į palūkanas. Kadangi būtent nuo jų priklauso tai, kiek jums teks mokėti. Ir tik taip galima sutaupyti bei neapsigauti pasirenkant.

The state has seen explosive growth in cases and hospitalizations in recent weeks, surpassing 7,000 cases in a single day on Thursday for the first time since the pandemic began. The Minnesota Department of Health reported a record 56 deaths on Wednesday; on Friday, more than 1,400 Minnesotans were hospitalized due to COVID-19.
The community spread of the virus has changed where students learn. About 22% of school districts and charter schools across Minnesota began the school year by implementing an all in-person learning model, according to data from the state education department. By mid-October that number shrank to 19%, but as of Friday, just 14% of districts have children doing all in-person learning, as more districts shift to distance and hybrid learning amid the outbreaks.
The Minneapolis and St. Paul districts have both delayed plans to transition to hybrid learning models from their current distance learning models. Anoka-Hennepin schools, Minnesota's largest school district, announced plans Tuesday to transition elementary students to distance learning after the district's middle and high schools moved online last week.
David Law, Anoka-Hennepin's superintendent, said positive cases among the district's 7,200 staff members increased gradually since late September and the district was able to reassign staff or shut down programs as necessary to stay open. But a dramatic spike in infections at the end of October and again last week caused the district to make the decision to shift from a hybrid model to online only, he said.
"Now we have sites that we're really struggling to keep open, where one in five teachers are out on quarantine or ill," he said. "It's predictable that the next week or two we'd have to shut down buildings because we couldn't staff them, and that's where many of my colleagues are already."
Denise Specht, president of teachers' union Education Minnesota, said staffing shortages due to infections or exposure to the virus are becoming more common. She said the number of teachers and substitute teachers was dwindling prior to the pandemic, and she is concerned that the virus seems to be accelerating that decline.
"The longer that this pandemic rages, we're finding more and more people are choosing to leave their employment," she said. "There are some people that are just having to make tough choices and leave the profession because of their own health or their situation at home."
According to data from the Teachers Retirement Association of Minnesota, retirement applications in August and September jumped 35% compared with the same time period last year.
Outside the metro area, Mankato schools superintendent Paul Peterson said that of its 8,700 students and 1,200 staff, the district has only had 76 infections since Labor Day. But as more educators and other school staff are either being infected with COVID-19 or being exposed to the virus and having to quarantine, creative staffing solutions aren't enough anymore, he said.
"We regularly, over the last several weeks, have had principals subbing in classrooms," he said. "It's really been, not just here in Mankato but everywhere, an all hands on deck approach to staffing."
The Mankato Area Public Schools district, in a note to families on Tuesday, announced a transition to distance learning for middle and high school students next week and elementary school students on Nov. 30.
Specht said her biggest concern is the frustration and anger of parents who oppose the school boards' decisions to implement more restrictive learning models. That anger is often directed at educators, which may be contributing to why some teachers are leaving the profession amid the pandemic, she said.
Heidi Hansen, 49, has three kids — one in high school, one in middle school and the third in elementary — in the Centennial School District north of the metro area, which has been implementing a hybrid learning model since September. The district switched its middle and high schools to full-time distance learning this week, and its elementary schools are expected to follow, she said.
Hansen, a preschool teacher who is on leave to be home with her 8-year-old daughter, who has school at home a couple days a week, said she was "disappointed" when the school board voted to move to distance learning. She said she believes younger kids should physically be at school as they are less at-risk, but she understands decisions need to be made to curb the spread of the virus.
"Children of all ages need that in-person interaction and a regular schedule," she said. "I'm frustrated as a parent, however I'm also working hard and consciously to stay as positive as I can because I know the teachers, it's unusual and different for them too."‘The Wolverine’ Review
'The Wolverine' is unlike any other superhero ever made. It is, for the first three quarters of its running time anyway, just a “regular movie” that happens to star a guy with magical mutant powers. There have been films that tried to realistically portray what reality would be like if ordinary people put on a cape and mask ('Super' and 'Kick-Ass,' namely) but this reverses it. 'The Wolverine' doesn't show our world with a comic book injection, it shows a comic book world with an injection from our world. And by our world I mean conventional, Hollywood thriller/noir/dramas.
It's a neat trick. But don't get too excited. There are two big issues. One, the “regular movie” at the heart of 'The Wolverine' isn't that interesting – it's a fairly by-the-book tale of corporate corruption, family drama and the mob. Two, there's that final quarter of the film, where 'The Wolverine' craps the bed and slouches toward every comic book movie cliché, most of them done poorly.
You don't need to know much about Hugh Jackman's mutant Logan going into this film, which is set after 2006's 'X-Men: The Last Stand.' His powers and central drive are shown, not told, in a remarkable first scene set at the Nagasaki detonation during World War II. Logan's a good guy, and saves the life of a Japanese soldier. (He does so in such a way that his skin peels off but grows back because of his healing factor and it is just gross enough for 13-year-olds to go “awesome!” but not too gross to freak them out for the rest of their lives.)
That soldier grows up to become the head of a powerful tech giant and now that he's on his death bed he requests an audience with the man who was able to provide him with the time to lead a long, natural life. Logan, however, is hiding out in the woods, growing his hair and beard, and being miserable because he is immortal and he killed the love of his life, Jean Grey. (If you are fuzzy on how he actually did that, it isn't important – you just need to know he is guilty and sad.)
A feisty Japanese gal named Yukio tracks him down, impresses him with her martial arts prowess, and convinces him to go to Japan. Here's where 'The Wolverine' really starts to resemble one of the Sean Connery 007 films. Our hero – a handsome movie star in the classic mold – starts poking around a big, complex conspiracy involving money, power, weapons, beautiful damsels and tempting murderesses.
You've seen it before, but you've never seen it with a guy with adamantium bonded to his bones or with the ability to survive a katana direct through the belly. A superpowered fight atop a bullet train makes for an unusual addition to watching a couple flee yakuza baddies to hide in a “love hotel.” This agreeable uniqueness is, however, undercut by a rather choppy story. There's a hundred different bad guys in 'The Wolverine' and none of them are interesting. There's a corrupt politician, a meanie son/father, some dude who always shows up out of nowhere with a bow and arrow, and then there's Viper.
Viper, played by Svetlana Khodchenkova, is dropped-in from a different movie. With luscious hair, voluptuous curves and the tendency to always find time for a costume change, she's basically a Schumacher-era Batman villain. She isn't bad (she's actually rather amusing) but it is a clanging off-note in the film's rather specific melody.
The big battle at the end, alas, decides to go all-in on Viper and what that type of movie represents. It's not original, or even dazzling and – frankly – there's a third act reveal that elicited some laughter in the screening I attended.
Do I think 'The Wolverine' is good? I must confess, I do not. But, I'm really impressed with what Mangold and company tried to do here, and I like that this is very much a “self-contained” movie. The superhero genre needs its cage rattled, and this tried to do that. Unfortunately, the mere act of rattling without an engaging story and then running to the tried-and-true for the conclusion isn't enough.
(Also, it's to note that, more so even that most movies, the post-conversion 3D on 'The Wolverine' is unnecessary. I did the “take off your glasses” check a handful of time and barely noticed a difference.)
'The Wolverine' opens in theaters on July 26.

I admit that I too have had a weird compulsion to watch the Atlas Shrugged trilogy. Its’ problems are myriad. Among the more significant problems is how industrialist BAMF Dagney Taggart is played by three different actresses. The first and best Dagney was Taylor Schilling, who has since found better things to do.
I have read Atlas Shrugged. It’s not something I’m proud of. A film/TV adaptation might work with a dystopian Hunger Games-type mood crossed with a Disneyesque retro-future aesthetic. And if you can’t get Jon Hamm to play John Galt, don’t even bother.
The biggest problem with Atlas Shrugged, I think, is that the story is a fantasy (A very basic and universal childhood fantasy – wouldn’t they miss me if I ran away?), but it’s treated with a lot of verisimilitude, which tonally just makes no sense. Especially since the name is about a fantastical mythological creature who does not actually exist.
Atlas Shrugged is a story meant to be told under the sea, like in Bioshock. Or in space. Or in magical castles. Not in like an actual sort-of-real-life railroad company.
But nothing says rugged individualism and contempt for the collective good like public transportation!
I watched Unbreakable last night. Had Fenzel not set it up with the question of what it is trying to say about superhero culture, I don’t know if I would have.
The brief Animal House style captions at the end — “David went to the police and turned him in” — were actually kind of funny. I don’t think they were intended to be (the whole film is Very Serious) but they are sort of delivered like a punchline to a long joke.
One part that stuck out to me was when David, accepting his role as hero, goes to where the people are (a train station?). He has visions of several crimes: a woman who shoplifted some jewelry; a guy who raped a woman; and a pyschopath who has murdered a father, tied up his family, and taken over their home.
First of all, this scene is only possible because David is not just “unbreakable”, but he also has an ill-defined psychic ability (a sixth sense, if you will) that gives him visions when people do something wrong. Without that, the film would have to deal with the real world problem of how vigilantes even find crimes to fight.
Second, David has a choice of which crime to pursue. What criteria is he using to make his decision? Assuming the visions were all of the past, not the future, rescuing the children seems like the one where he could do the most good. (Though now that I think about it, he wasn’t aware of the children until he got to the house.) The film seemed to be pointing out how little benefit being unbreakable delivers when dealing with crime in the real world. Even the psychopath could have been handled — maybe even more competently — by the police.
It’s kind of funny, because one of my favorite tropes is The Superhero’s First Day On The Job, where he stops a petty thug from stealing an old lady’s handbag and scares the crap out of the thug with an overwhelming demonstration of force (e.g. Superman crumples up a handgun like it is tinfoil).
On behalf of the rest of the panelists, let me express my profound regret that we did not make an “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” joke while we were talking about “Unbreakable.”
If someone hasn’t made a version of the Kimmy Schmidt theme song where Samuel L. Jackson and Bruce Willis’ lips are synced to the music, well, I ma just have to get on that. After I finish all of these Eurovision videos, of course…
HE’S ALIVE, DAMMIT!
Vulture just tweeted this out
And now I’m sad that it wasn’t you guys :(
I’m glad this exists, and yet, I must say…DAMMIT!
Right, the criteria are weird. He doesn’t do hero things because it is right or because of the positive impact on people or society. He does it because, in a new agey way, like transcendental meditation or The Secret, it is some sort of semi forgotten ancient wisdom that doing this will make him happy and help his relationship with his wife.
So, he vigilantes the thing that is truest to his nature and most likely to make him happy, which also tends to be a very rare and brutally violent situation.
And the implication is that these rare situations in real life are very common in comics because stopping them is very psychologically satisfying to superheroes.
And also by implication they are that much more psychologically satisfying for super villains to cause.
And then in the end you sorta see why society has no use for superheroes anymore, or super villains, because these situations are not what modern life is about.
And thus being one of these things is much more a “me” problem than an “us” problem.
Hello Overthinkers! I found your podcast several months ago, and have enjoyed spending too much time on things that may not deserve such attention since then. I always enjoy when the conversation brushes against issues of religion because I am a pastor/theologian. I wanted to offer a catagory that may help fit into place some of the discussion around this episode’s topic. The Eucharist is all sign and symbol and participation, but it points to the event called “atonement.” This is a made up word from medieval English that is just as it sounds at-one-ment. Or the act of reconciliation. In Christian theology there is no one answer to what the atonement (the cross death of Jesus) was or accomplished exactly. All the councils and creeds say on it is that it works. Meanwhile, these trailers are like the same thing just as you all pointed out the participatory nature and the desire of audiences to reconcile with themselves, the series, and each other. Or it is sacrificial. Or it brings together the community. In any case, whatever the question is the atonement is the answer. This has been true in Christian theology. Star Wars has always played a religion-like role. One may even register in Britain as an official Jedi practitioner. This whole discussion generates a new hope, and am glad to join you in overthinking!
I see Wrather’s hesitation around the term “modern mythology” echoed a lot, coupled generally with a more didactic and skeptical attitude than it is here, in think pieces around the web. I wonder if maybe part of the problem is that when we think of mythology we tend to think of more classical mytholigizers and the ways in which religion, heartfelt belief and politics have found common ground all the way back to antiquity.
But isn’t a heavily connected, multicultural society with an atheistic, or at least agnostic, government and a daily relationship with scientific inquiry and advancement going to have a different relationship with any kind of mythology, not just the commercial kind, than its forebearers or even some of its less rational and progressive contemporaries? And speaking of commercial, why wouldn’t our myths be sold to us by the Disney corporation? We’re capitalists, aren’t we? It’s distasteful, sure, but only in the same way that everything that comes out of America is, at least a little bit.
Then again, we could just be using the wrong terminology here. I imagine people would be more comfortable with the term “folk tale” or “legend” being applied to the superhero genre and that would avoid some of the uncomfortable subtext, even if it is spot-on. Batman’s used the latter without comment for decades.
I hope this isn’t just blanket cynicism but doesn’t every culture inevitably tell the stories that it deserves?
Before listening to this episode I watched a ton of trailers to prepare, and really the only one I enjoyed besides Star Wars was for Mad Max: Fury Road. I don’t think that is a coincidence: the trailer for Fury Road seems to be playing up the nostalgia factor much like Star Wars. The aesthetic is straight out of the latter two Mad Max movies. This is extremely apparent in the trailer that straight up uses footage from the earlier movies as an introduction. I also found it to be a good comparison piece to the Terminator: Genisys trailer. Where Terminator: Genisys gets lost in its own twisting canon and loses what people liked about the franchise to begin with, the Fury Road trailer is two minutes of crazy dudes riding spiked dune buggies and blowing stuff up in the desert. That sold me on it right away, and isn’t that the point of trailers?
As long as this thread is still open…
We don’t have TIME to watch all three Atlas Shrugged movies!
Instead, you can escape from Jack Bauer’s interrogation by subjecting Jack to the horror of watching himself as a corrupt Roman senator (Is there another kind of Roman Senator?) who sounds like a castrated Brit. Or something. I am referring to the 2014 film Pompeii, a disaster movie by every definition of that term. Kiefer Sutherland doesn’t just chew the scenery. He swallows it whole. It’s case study of when Bad Accents happen to Good Actors. See also: Jodie Foster in Elysium.Small Business Saturday KING 5 and KIRO 7 Local News Segments

Ahead of their performance at The Globe on the 28th November, Gravy Boat are asking local folk, audience members and other artists to share their favourite places in Newcastle. From the comfiest coffee shops and the best record stores to cultural landmarks and favourite food spots, the group are looking for recommendations of where they should visit whilst on tour, ideally accompanied by a story about what makes it special to you.
These places and stories will be woven amongst music from the band and live footage to create a digital tour guide to Newcastle, which will be shared in the New Year. To be a part of this project, you can either share your place on social media with the tag #mymusiccity or email voice notes, pictures or text to emma@johnsonmusic.co.uk This callout for places was launched on Instagram in a ‘Gravy Boat Guests’ episode with Newcastle musician Faye MacCalman (Archipelago, John Pope Quintet) and will run up until the group visit Newcastle to perform at the end of November.

Well Emma, I don't do coffee shops but I do know music shops. J.G. Windows Ltd. in the Central Arcade near Monument Metro has been around since 1908. Instruments, accessories, sheet music, CDs etc. I worked there for x years and just about anyone who was any one (or their roadies) looked in. Many local musicians have, over the years, worked there. Put it on your bucket list. See you at The Globe.Video art festival

How Did I Get "Into" F1?
My World of Formula 1
Two questions which people often ask me
“Why do you enjoy Formula 1 and at what age did you start watching?
I’ll answer the 2
nd
question first.
I remember as a child, aged 6 or 7 years old, my father taking me some motorsports events such as Shelsley Walsh Hill Climb and Donnington. A friend’s father raced go-karts so would very often go around the country watching him as well my uncle who raced bikes.
If we weren’t away, then Sunday’s would consist of watching Formula 1 on TV so whilst I didn’t really understand it, I knew from a fairly early age I liked to see bikes or cars race each other.
Then, whilst at my boarding school, it seemed that you became a fan of James Hunt or Barry Sheen.
I was leaning more towards the cars than the bikes, probably because I fancied James rather than Barry! A friend’s father was MD of Marlborough sponsorship and at the time James was driving a McLaren sponsored by Marlborough cigarettes. I shall not go into detail but I was fortunate enough to meet James and that cemented my relationship with the sport. Sadly not with James though!
Skip forwards x number of years to around 2006. I was staying at hotel with a group in Italy mid -late May. As I was checking out, a group were checking in who were all going to the Monaco Grand Prix. Wow…this just sounded fantastic. Some of my group suggested that I should try and arrange a trip there the following year. The idea wouldn’t leave me.
I had only been to Brands Hatch previously and whilst I had been to Monaco numerous times with my groups, I had only ever dreamt of going to the Monaco Formula 1 Grand Prix.
I thought that only VERY rich people could afford that one.
So the following year, I took my first group and have been going ever since. As demand was starting to grow, I needed to then look at offering other F1 holidays.
I began to see what other companies were offering. I really wanted to offer so much more.
It seemed that so many were offering a few nights somewhere, watch the race then fly home.
As well as F1 being a passion of mine, so is travelling and seeing the world. To me, it seemed crazy to travel half- way across the world and not see something other than the racetrack.
But there was the problem of where you have a couple who are not both “into” the sport and the one doesn’t want to go away for a week without the other. The writing was now on the wall.
I needed to offer a package which would appeal to the F1 enthusiast and the not so enthusiastic partner. The package needed to be longer than a few days and to stay in places where there was lots to do. I needed to offer 2 prices a) The F1 package 2) a price for non race-goers
Because of all the non F1 holidays offered by Finesse Travel and LJ Leisure, my knowledge of destinations, other than just race tracks, became apparent and I felt that I could offer the ideal package to suit everyone. I personally escort the F1 holidays (some jobs have my name all over them!) and my aim is to give people the best experience I possibly can.
Unlike the larger companies, I can offer that personal service so it’s not a numbers game.
One of the most satisfying parts of my job is seeing the friendships evolve. I try and connect the group as early as possible so that everyone feels included, especially for newbies and solo travellers.
If someone prefers to be left alone, then that is fine. There is no pressure either way.
I absolutely love the banter between everyone as they all discuss their favourites team or driver.
I personally, am a Lewis Hamilton fan but always had a soft spot for Williams and McLaren and very much looking forward to seeing the youngsters, Lando Norris and George Russell develop.
For anyone who is maybe considering going to a race then yes, do it. I hear people saying, “but you see more on TV” but……the atmosphere is second to none. There is so much more to it than just the race, there are all the support races, the entertainment, the smell, the excitement. It’s amazing and then you are hooked.
So you fancy going but you have no idea which one? I can only speak from experience and now I’ll run through the ones I have been to, so far. I don’t give all my tips on where and how to meet drivers to anyone other than my groups. I have some good contacts!
MONACO
I have been every year for the past 13 years.
Some people criticise this one because they think it can be like a procession but I have been every year and have seen some amazing races. I love the glitz and glamour too of Monaco.
The millionaire’s and billionaire’s wait for years to get a mooring for their yacht in the harbour during F1 week, people rent out their apartments which overlook the track for rentals which equal a year’s wage for some. Many of the drivers live in Monaco so it’s home to them. They love it and always seem more relaxed in Monaco than anywhere else. The skill required for driving around Monaco is huge and the slightest mistake and they are out of the race.
I think I have met most of the drivers in Monaco. Friday is a great day to go and try and get drivers autographs. (there’s no racing that day)
If you like to party, then Monaco is the place. All the streets are taken up with live bands, makeshift bars and certainly after the race on Sunday, the place is like party town with singing and dancing everywhere. There are a lot of non race lovers who come to Monaco just for the atmosphere. If you can’t afford one of the pricey grandstands but don’t want to do general admission, ask me about other options. It can be expensive but when you know where to go, it isn’t too bad.
SPA
I have been twice around 2012 – 2013 and had planned to go again this year (2020).
This is a completely different experience to Monaco.
I decided to go by coach and stay in Leuven as the circuit is in the middle of nowhere. Fine if you want to camp but not really any hotels nearby. Although it was a lot of travelling, it does give everyone the opportunity to get to know each other and have a laugh en route.
Leuven, is a fabulous town, approximately 20 minutes from Brussels. It is an old university town which means that it has great bars and a lot cheaper than places like Bruges, Brussels or Ghent.
The roads aren’t brilliant around Spa so the traffic leaving the circuit can be tricky so extra time has to be allowed.
As the for the circuit, it’s massive and very fast. The first time that I saw Eau Rouge, I was amazed at how steep it was. Something which you cannot imagine from watching on TV. You have to be prepared for all weathers…it can be raining at one end of the track and sunny the other.
This year I decided that going by air would be a better option than by coach to reduce the travelling time. I have now rearranged this for 2021 and will also be staying in Leuven. Again, this an attractive option for non-race goers.
HUNGARY
I have been four times and was due to go again this year (2020) Have transferred to 2021.
Budapest is my favourite European city so always love going to this one.
I have offered several hotels on this to try and cater for different budgets. My favourite is the Continental Zara, mainly because I love being near the Ruin Bars and they do a breakfast to die for!
In my opinion, you need to stay at central as possible. All the teams and everyone involved in F1 stays in Budapest (approx.. 30-40 minutes from the circuit at Hungaroring). The first time I went I was so excited that nearly everyone you met was there for F1, from fans to the guy who fits the camera on the helmets. Budapest is just alive with F1.
As I have a few contacts in Budapest, I get tip offs on where the various drivers are staying (they don’t tend to stick to the same hotel year after year) so I know where to go. Again, I have met most of the drivers in Budapest.
So as well as spending time stalking drivers, time should be allocated to visit many of the sites of this fabulous city. There is the historic area of Buda with the castle district, the beautiful park and Hero’s Square, the city zoo, the ruin bars in the Jewish Quarter as well as the famous spa’s, of which there are 118 springs in Budapest, providing over 70 million litres of thermal water a day. After all it is called the city of Spas. If the weather is really warm, and it can be, then I would recommend the labrynth cave and hospital in the rock.
It is also worth visiting the Parliament Building, a very notable landmark in Hungary, situated alongside the river. Seeing this building lit up at night, as well as the Chain Bridge and Buda is a site not to be missed. I can highly recommend an evening boat trip.
With regards to Hungaroring, I would definitely advise a private transfer and to pre-book it (I always include them) as the queues for taxis and buses after the race are massive.
The viewing is pretty good at this track. It can get very warm so be prepared. I have also experienced torrential rain. Like with any tracks, there can be exciting races and not so exciting races here.
AUSTRIA
Been here only once but returning in 2021. This is one of the most organised and clean circuits I’ve been to. Again, it is the middle of nowhere but in a beautiful setting with excellent viewing. The road infrastructure is good so didn’t experience any traffic problems. I opted for a couple of hotels in Graz and it took about an hour to get to the circuit at Spielburg.
Graz is a really pretty Austrian town with a lovely historical centre and an excellent castle district.
I didn’t see any drivers/teams there but am told that many of them also stay in Graz.
MONZA
Been 4 times and was due to go again this year (2020) so transferred to 2021.
You have never seen such passionate F1 fans until you have experienced the Ferarri fans at Monza.
I use a hotel at Lake Como so again this is ideal for any non race-goers. There are organised excursions from the hotel including a brilliant one on the famous Bernina Express train in Switzerland. There are some beautiful villa’s around the lake including Villa Balbionella where scenes from Casino Royale were filmed. You could visit Milan, Lugano, Bergamo or enjoy or a boat ride to one of the many towns and villages dotted around the lake. There are loads of opportunities for sightseeing or you can just relax around one of the pools at the hotel.
It takes just over an hour to get to the track and I would recommend purchasing Grandstand ticket with a TV screen. Viewing can be restricted as there aren’t any hills. However, it’s a great atmosphere and worth going just for that and to see the podium.
FRANCE
Have been here just once, in 2018. Will probably return in a few years.
Was very impressed with Marseilles where our hotel was and there are certainly loads of places to visit along the coast. There are also some fabulous beaches just a few minutes from the centre of Marseilles. There was an F1 roadshow on the streets in the city with some old cars racing up and down the promenade.
We were very fortunate to have a transfer company who had VIP access passes to the track so reduced our journey time to around 40 minutes. It was a bit of a nightmare for everyone else who experienced very long delays to get there. We were getting nightmare stories of journeys taking over 3 hours so be careful with that one. I’m not letting on who I book as I’m keeping that one up my sleeve for next time!
With regards to the circuit, there was a lot of walking involved so maybe not recommended for anyone with walking difficulties and not too many facilities. The only bit which I struggled with was all the bright markings on the track. (Take your sunglasses!)
SPAIN
I have been here 3 times and always stayed in Sitges which I just love. It is about 35 minutes from Barcelona. There have been lots of customers who have gone back to Sitges time and time again.
You need to be fairly broadminded as it is the gay capital of Europe but has beautiful boutique shops, lots of lovely bars and restaurants and a lovely beach and seafront. You can easily travel into Barcelona on the regular train service.
The first few times, I included train tickets to get to and from the circuit at Montmelo, the other side of Barcelona but it seems that about 80% of everyone going to the race, also travels in by train so it’s extremely busy and you can be waiting a long time. Last year I decided to include private transfers and that worked much better.
I really like this circuit but with it being a “dry” one then you need one of the hospitality packages to be able to enjoy a proper beer/champagne whilst watching the race.
BAKU
I have been here once and was due to again this year (2020). I have rearranged for 2021.
I have fallen in love with Baku. I check out all hotels before I use them so went over in December 2018 to check out about 18 hotels. Be warned, hotels can vary so much over there. I was told that the hotelier can virtually decide what star rating to give itself so a 3* could be better than a 4*. I learnt very early on that many 4* hotels wouldn’t have even been given a 2* rating in Europe. Many Tripadvisor reports were “very” inaccurate. There are also some “iffy” areas too that had some fabulous hotels but I wouldn’t want to stay there. This is why I always do my homework and NOT rely on reviews or websites!
So for a country where 90% of the population are Muslim, you really wouldn’t know it. It is extremely westernised and very few women wear the Hijab. You will find all the high street shops such as Next and Top Shop as well as KFC, Hard Rock and McDonalds. There are some great bars with a good nightlife and the good news is that it is cheap.
I decided to opt for a lovely small boutique hotel in the Old Town, less than 10 minutes to our Grandstand with lots of bars and restaurants only 5 minutes walk away. However, it is quiet enough so as not to get disturbed by traffic or noisy nightclubs.
I love the Fanzone in Baku which is along the promenade overlooking the Caspian sea. It is very chilled and a great place to relax.
I would really recommend going up to the revolving restaurant at the top of the TV Tower, not far away from the Flame Towers, an iconic symbol of Baku.
It certainly is an up and coming city, a mix between Singapore and Dubai.
There is an F1 entertainment area but it is a little out of town. Free buses are provided but I didn’t venture out there so I can’t comment.
SINGAPORE
I have been here twice for the Grand Prix and was due to go again this year (now rearranged for 2021).
I absolutely love Singapore. There is so much to see and do that you could do with a fortnight to experience it all. I use a hotel in Chinatown and it takes about 30 minutes to walk to the circuit or you can catch the very efficient and cheap MRT (their metro).
Again, I checked out about 12 hotels and whilst it would be lovely to stay at one of the hotels overlooking the circuit, the prices are truly inflated for F1 week. Singapore imposes a very high tax on hotel stays over the weekend so be careful that you don’t suddenly end up paying a lot more than you originally thought. (we include this tax).
It can be very humid so I decided on a hotel with a lovely outdoor pool and seating area. The Orchid Hotel has one of the best.
Because there is so much to see and do, I tend to try and find out what people want to do and will come up with a suggested itinerary so as to utilise their time there in the best way possible. It might be that I split the group into 2, depending on preferences or, they are free to go and do whatever they wish. As always there is no pressure. The first night I try and arrange for us all to go to the viewing platform at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel which then gives everyone the opportunity to get to know each other. Many of the group stick with me as I have got to know Singapore quite well so they generally trust my judgement and I try not to break the bank!
I’m certainly not a Tour Manager who abandons you after getting you checked into the hotel. I am there to help and advise and I just want you to have the best time ever.
You may have come along on holiday as a customer but we all part as friends!

By Majid Rafizadeh
January 15, 2019
At the end of each year, the Iranian government proposes a budget bill in the country’s parliament (Majlis). After the bill is passed there, a clerical body also has to approve the legislation. Consequently, Iran’s Central Bank will present monetary and credit policies that correspond with the budget.
Carefully examining Iran’s budget is critical because the nuances of the budget bill can inform policy analysts, scholars and politicians not only about the Islamic Republic’s current financial and economic status, but also its prospective missions and specific objectives.
Iran’s proposed budget for this year is intriguing for several reasons, and is distinct from those of prior years.
To begin with, the Iranian authorities have emphasized that the current bill is designed to significantly assist the ordinary people by increasing the minimum wage, creating jobs, raising the employment rate, and resolving people’s economic problems. According to Iran’s official broadcaster, which presented the regime’s budget for March 2019 to March 2020: “The government intends to increase the wages of employees in tandem with increasing the employment rate for the youth, all the while keeping the prices for gas at the 10,000-rial (10 cents) level and making sure that supervision is made in a way that goods reach people with cheap prices.”
But, from a realistic point of view, the Iranian leaders’ promises are impossible to fulfill.
The proposed budget for 2019 is just 45 percent of the country’s budget for the previous year. This is unprecedented in the history of the Islamic Republic. The budget bill that was proposed by President Hassan Rouhani and passed in 2018 was approximately $104 billion. The current budget bill is roughly $47.5 billion.
The main reason for such a decline is the decision of US President Donald Trump to pull out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal, and to renew the primary and secondary sanctions against the Islamic Republic. Although the Iranian leaders dismiss the move as not impacting the nation, the sanctions have put significant pressure on Iran’s economy, specifically its energy and banking sectors. Iran’s revenues have already started sinking, and will likely continue to fall. Since the US withdrew from the nuclear deal, Iran’s oil revenues and exports have fallen approximately 50 percent.
More importantly, Iran’s national currency, the rial, has dropped to historic lows. One US dollar, which equaled approximately 35,000 rials in early 2018, is now worth nearly 110,000 rials. According to the International Monetary Fund, Iran’s economy is officially in recession.
In addition, a significant portion of Iran’s budget relies on the export of oil. According to the budget bill, the regime is estimating it will export nearly 1.5 million barrels per day at $54 per barrel. This presents two important problems. First, the Islamic Republic is less likely to gain this revenue because Tehran’s oil export market is declining and the regime is incapable of trading with US dollar. This will lead to a significant budget deficit. Secondly, while the Iranian leaders, particularly Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, repeatedly emphasize that the nation has a resilient economy independent of oil sales, the current budget bill shows that the government has not made any tangible advances in fulfilling such promises.
Iran’s budget bills are normally incorporated in the country’s five-year development plan. The regime previously indicated that Iran’s sixth five-year development plan (for 2016 to 2021) would prioritize education, health and technology. But the current budget bill shows cuts for these sectors. In fact, in a surprising move, Health Minister Hassan Ghazizadeh Hashemi has resigned over the proposed budget and the cuts that it entails. Expressing his frustration with the government’s budget cuts in the health sector, he stated in a video published on Khabar One news: “I am not an impatient person, but enough is enough.” Rouhani accepted his resignation without offering any explanation for the budget cuts.
It appears the only institution that has seen a noticeable increase in its budget is the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Increasing the IRGC’s budget while cutting other crucial programs will not resolve the people’s economic difficulties..”
In a nutshell, Iran’s proposed budget reveals the economic crisis that Tehran is facing. The increase in the IRGC’s funding, while many other sectors have witnessed cuts, points to the regime’s determination to prioritize its revolutionary principles over its citizens’ needs.

When I started writing this blog, an old adage came to mind, “there is more than one way to skin a cat”. If you believe thatthere are many different ways to achieve an objective and that the reason for drinking wine is enjoyment, then skin-fermented wines could be the means to an end.
I tasted skin-fermented white wine (henceforth referred to as orange wine) for the first time in Croatia last year and during that tasting surmised that this type of wine is not for everybody. My second experience with orange wine was last week at a wine tasting chaired by James Pietersen of Wine Cellar (Observatory, Cape Town). During this tasting I was bombarded with so many new (and sometimes weird) aromas, that I soon realised that I was out of my depth. Take a look at Table 1 at the end of this blog for more details.
After the tasting, Edo Heyns (also present at the tasting) and I discussed the wines and he reckoned that this was probably the most difficult tasting that I could have kicked off with (I started at WineLand on 1 February 2017). Edo supplied this quote, “This burgeoning niche category offers some truly delicious wines. Chenin Blanc has particularly risen to the occasion, but there are also impressive blends and Sauvignon Blancs made in this style. The tasting yielded an intriguing list of descriptors and discussions, which is part of the category’s appeal. I specifically enjoyed wines that had a neat balance of texture and acidity. Judging this style definitely tests your tolerance for funkiness. While this is part of the excitement, it could also be its Achilles heel. Skin-fermented wines should first and foremost be good wines. To me, that was not the case for some of the wines in the line-up.”
And judging by how well some of these wines are selling locally, regardless of the relatively higher price, orange wine is doing a lot of well-placed scratching. Speaking of price, these five wines ranged from R135 to R275. While a lot is said about orange wines and their sometimes obvious faults, consider that one of the browner wines at this tasting scored quite well, because of the nose and palate. As it turns out, one cannot solely judge a book by its cover (I’m on a roll with proverbs today.
The highest scoring wine at this tasting with 92 out of 100, the 2016 Testalonga El Bandito (a skin-fermented Chenin Blanc), made me wonder about benchmarks for this style of wine. If you click here, you’ll experience a fascinating account of some of the efforts (in terms of legislation), travels, unique brands and varying winemaking practices of local orange wine pioneers. Why not track down some of these wines? You might be pleasantly surprised. Happy hunting!

Share this articleThe Queue interface is a first-in, first-out data structure. In other words, the first item that is added to the queue is the first item to be removed. We can picture the queue as a line for a roller coaster. The first person to enter the line is the first person who gets to ride on the roller coaster.
Example Program
We will use a Queue in this example program to simulate a music player. The Queue is filled with songs that we would like to hear and then it plays them one at a time in the order they were added. Here is the code.
package ch6.queue import java.util.* fun main(args : Array<String>){ //Create the Queue. Note that LinkedList is one of the implementing classes val playQueue : Queue<String> = LinkedList() //Add songs to the Queue with (playQueue){ add("Swing Life Away") add("Give it All") add("Dancing for Rain") add("Hero of War") add("Black Masks and Gasoline") } //Loop until the Queue is empty while(!playQueue.isEmpty()){ //The remove() method takes an item from the Queue and returns it println("Playing Song => " + playQueue.remove()) } }
The program uses LinkedList as the concrete class to implement the Queue interface. We add five songs to the Queue using the with function and Queue’s add() method. Then we loop until the queue is empty. When we call remove() on the Queue, the first item in the queue is removed and returned. In this way, we print all of the songs added to the Queue one at a time.
Playing Song => Swing Life Away Playing Song => Give it All Playing Song => Dancing for Rain Playing Song => Hero of War Playing Song => Black Masks and GasolineA 4 bedroom Detached property in Dumbarton.

We are using a range of different methods in our research. Here you can find information about the different methodologies and techniques.
Main content
Functional.
Simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings
Simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings require the presence of MRI compatible EEG amplifiers and electrodes. EEG-fMRI allows for simultaneous acquisition of electrophysiology (EEG) and hemodynamic (fMRI) information. EEG-fMRI thus provides high spatial and temporal resolution with regard to anatomical localization and on-line signal registration. Because of the large artifacts generated in the EEG recording from the switching on-off of the MRI gradients, particular care has to be taken for artefact removal in the recordings. EEG-fMRI data are often analyzed using an independent component analysis (ICA) approach, which allows for single trial analysis of correlations between e.g. ERP and BOLD amplitudes.
Voxel based morphometry (VBM)
Voxel based morphometry (VBM) is typically used for whole brain comparisons of grey or white matter density or concentration between groups of subjects. VBM is therefore a measure of structural or anatomical differences between e.g. a clinical and a healthy control group. VBM allows for the analysis of tissue concentration on a voxel-by-voxel basis. In this respect VBM differs from other measures of morphometry that e.g. use a region-of-interest (ROI) approach.
VBM data are normalized and mapped to a brain template which reduces the impact of individual differences in brain anatomy.
Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) (picture to the right)..
Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS)
Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) is a non-invasive technique that provides information about brain metabolism through tissue characterization on a biochemical level. MRS information is most commonly based the hydrogen proton nucleus, and can be acquired either in a single- or multivoxel way.
MRS allows for quantification of brain tissue metabolites, such as NAA, Lactate, Alanine, Glutamate/Glutamine, GABA, and others. MRS spectra are dependent on the MR scanner field strength with higher field strengths allowing for improved signal quantification. MRS can be used to identify brain abnormality in both neurological and psychiatric disorders.
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a method to excite neurons in the brain from the outside of the scalp. TMS uses weak electric currents that are induced in the tissue by rapidly changing magnetic fields, known as electromagnetic induction. The induced TMS pulse thus interferes with neuronal signalling, causing a temporary neuronal inhibition.
TMS allows for localization of cognitive, motor and sensory functions and has an important role in validating e.g. functional imaging methods, like fMRI. TMS has been used as treatment for depression and for auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia. Modern TMS laboratories use MRI-guided neuronavigation techniques to identify anatomical landmarks where to apply the electromagnetic induction coil on the scalp.

Fox News Flash top headlines for November 9
Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what’s clicking on Foxnews.com..
Democratic Attorney General Kwame Raoul had asked Pritzker to clarify that the legislation does not do anything to restrict workplaces’ measures intended to prevent the spread of deadly, communicable diseases like COVID-19. In signing SB 1169 into law, the governor said the “amendment will ensure the long tradition of vaccine requirements by employers can continue with regard to the COVID-19 vaccine.”

The changes come after several lawsuits by workers cited the law’s conscience-based exemption, arguing that their employers could not force them to get a vaccine for COVID-19, Fox 32 of Chicago reported. The amendment does not take effect until June 1, 2022.
Despite Democrats wanting it to take effect immediately, the state constitution required more votes in the floor action than garnered. Some Republicans argue this leaves time for addition lawsuits, but another vote after Jan. 1, 2022, could allow the amendment to take effect sooner.
Democrats, including state House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch and state Rep. Robyn Gabel, have insisted that the law does not take away anyone’s rights to claim exemptions based on sincerely held religious beliefs or other medical reasons, which are protected by federal law. But some experts believe that such exemptions will not be readily available under three federal statutes cited by Pritzker’s office.
Welch and Gabel argued that “a small minority of people” had been skirting COVID-19 requirements by distorting the meaning of the law, thus putting vulnerable members of society and workers in high-risk environments, such as hospitals, veterans’ homes and schools, in danger.
Outside of Illinois, lawsuits in New York and Maine are fighting workplace vaccine mandates based on the U.S. Constitution’s Free Exercise of Religion clause. The suits could advance to the Supreme Court.

- Anastasia Mini Soft Glam Eyeshadow Palette | I have the larger Soft Glam Palette and absolutely love the colors and pigment of these eyeshadows. This mini palette has a combo of matte and shimmery shades and would be perfect for travel!
- Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask | This is a cult classic and for good reason- I use this every night so I can wake up with hydrate lips (plus it smells so good)!
- Bobbi Brown Crushed Liquid Lipstick | I’m a huge fan of Bobbi Brown lipsticks in general. These have a moisturizing formula and great pigment- I love the color “In a Jam” for fall!
- Laneige Water Bank Moisture Cream | I just ordered my 3rd jar of this moisturizer. It’s my new favorite because it’s super hydrating but not too heavy and it smells amazing!
- Hourglass Scattered Light Glitter Eyeshadow | The holiday season is the perfect time to wear some sparkle and this is a great option if you’re looking for a glitter shadow- I have it in the color “Ray.”
- Isle of Paradise Self Tanning Drops | I cannot sing the praises of these drops enough! I used to use tanning foam but after hearing about these I decided to try them out and I’m hooked. You just mix a few drops in with your daily moisturizer/body lotion and it develops into a natural tan. It’s so convenient to apply and has become one of my must-have beauty products.

Love the Nest fragrances and this one definite makes a great gift!

- Benefit Roller Lash Mascara | I’ve tried tons of mascaras but always keep coming back to this one. I think the unique brush is what I like most, it really does a great job of curling and separating your lashes.
- IT Cosmetics CC Cream | Another OG, I’ve been using this CC cream for years. I love the coverage, creamy consistency and the fact that it has SPF 50. I’m not a big fan of super matte/heavy foundations and found that this provides a great amount of coverage without looking overdone.
I would love to hear, what’s your number one must-have product from Sephora? Let me know in the comments below!The mistakes 90% of Athletes will make when talking with a College Coach
In today’s world of communication, or should I say lack of communication, many athletes rely on texting, emails, and even Facebook messages, to communicate with college coaches so many of today’s youth struggle with what to say when it comes to meeting a college coach face to face.
There are 4 sure fire statements that will place you firmly onto a Coach’s blacklist:
“I am interested in your school!”
Whilst the majority of the time, this statement is said with the most genuine of intentions, what this really says to a college coach is “I don’t know anything about your school…” Being vague in this situation can be a silent killer, by not stating the schools name, and not stating why you are interested you are showing a college coach that you have not taken the time to research into their school. A far better statement would be “I am very interested in the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater as not only does it have a great soccer program, but it has an exceptional business program which is important to me as I would like to obtain a degree in Marketing.”
“I think I would be a great addition to your team”
Not only can this be misinterpreted as slightly arrogant, why would you be a great addition to the team? Have you taken the time to look on the school’s roster to see which positions are graduating this year? If you look on the roster and there are already 5 defenders that are sophomores, perhaps you will need to consider changing your approach or be willing to try out playing a new position.
“I am very passionate about the sport”
Again, vagueness is the silent killer here. All athletes that are looking to go on to the collegiate level should be passionate about their respective sport, you may as well have stated that the sky is blue – thank you Captain Obvious! If you are truly passionate about soccer, tell them why! What is your history with the world’s sport and where did you love for soccer come from?
“I am looking for a scholarship”
If you are talking about scholarships in your first conversation with coaches, it is a red flag. Whether it is the truth or not, when you mention a scholarship in the first conversation.Chronic disease and ecology are big topics today, but rarely are these two inseparable subjects discussed as such. In this fascinating book, Dr. Bernard Jensen and Mark R. Anderson show how these two important topics are actually one and the same: The health of our planet directly affects our own health, and it is time we take care of both.
Dr. Jensen, a pioneer in the field of nutrition, was the founder of Hidden Valley Ranch in Escondido, California, a retreat center dedicated to nature’s healing principles. In the first part of the book, he shares his understanding of the essential minerals and elements that make up the delicate balance of healthy soil as well as the dangers posed to this balance by chemical agriculture, pollution, radiation, and erosion.
In part two, Mark Anderson, renowned authority on ecology and holistic health, shows how the Earth’s wellness directly impacts our own. The same minerals that compose healthy soil—calcium, phosphorus, chlorine, sulfur, potassium, etc.—make up our own bodies. If these are depleted from the soil in which our food is sourced, they will not make it into our bodies. Likewise, chemical pollutants end up in the food we eat, the air we breathe, and the water we drink. In other words, if our Earth is sick, in its soil, water, or air, then we are sick also.
Empty Harvest is essential to understanding the food crisis in America and the seriousness of responsible stewardship of the Earth worldwide.

. Empty Harvest is a ‘wake!”
—Wayne Wasserman
“I just finished reading this book and have started to re-read it. I have been so touched by this book; it has transformed my attitude and thoughts about my health, the earth and environment. I only hope that everyone who reads my review will read this book or, at least, consider an organic diet in support of preventative health and farmer’s whose growing methods are replenishing the valuable topsoil and doing away with highly toxic chemicals. It is hard to believe what ‘modern society’ has done to our planet and health in such a short amount of time. I hope that, one person at a time, we can undo the damage that has been done. A sincere Thank You to the late Bernard Jensen for such thorough and insightful research.”
—L. Prosser
“‘Modern’ agriculture implemented in its production process fertilizers which are being processed out of oil. Nitrogen, phosphor and potassium (NPK) are being supplied to plants, but without trace elements. Since plants are incapable of producing minerals, when you eat vegetables or fruits you don’t get enough of those. So you have two options. Capitalism likes you to buy ‘supplements,’ so they can make an extra dollar. If you are more intelligent, you definitively go for organics. Dr. Jensen says this makes sense, for your health and even for your pocketbook, although organics are sometimes more expensive : ‘If you have to pay two dollars a pound for certified organically grown grapes, versus sixty-nine cents a pound for sprayed grapes, let me point something out : It’s better to pay a lot for something than a little for nothing. You’re always ripped off no matter how little you pay for nothing. This is an economic fact.'”
—Guy Denutte
“I have been an RN for 21 years and am now a holistic health practitioner. I thought I knew all the concepts that would be presented here, but I was pleasantly surprised! This is a wonderfully written book on health and why as a nation, our health is going down the toilet! It is easy to read and the author also gives doable solutions to take charge of our health and lives. The truth is always simple. Anything complex is just a bunch of lies to make things harder to fully understand. That is what the AMA and pharmaceuticals are doing! If we don’t know the truth, we will continue to buy their lies and their drugs!! I hope everyone who wants to improve their health reads this book.”

Writing your own wedding vows: where to start and what to include.
As a North Wales wedding celebrant, I specialise in creating and delivering modern, magical and bespoke ceremonies for weddings, micro-weddings and elopements. As a result of this I frequently get asked by couples what they should include in their wedding vows. The process of putting in writing your love, promises, hopes and dreams to one another can make some couples feel overwhelmed or intimidated. To help you conquer this, I’ve put together a super helpful guide to give you some ideas on how to go about it.
Before I get into the details - remember you don’t have to write your own wedding vows. You may want to use traditional wedding vows which have stood the test of time – and, that is absolutely fine. Remember, it is all about you and what you envision for your special day - do what makes you feel most comfortable.
However, if you want to create something more personal, reflective of your relationship, I say go for it! But, decide together, because if you are going to get creative and write the wedding vows yourselves, you both need to be equally committed to the process.
We are writing our own vows - where do we start?
Firstly – remember you are not alone. If you are using a celebrant, then often, they are often happy to support you with writing your vows. I always say to my couples, I can’t tell you what to say, but I can ask insightful questions that will help you think about why your relationship is special and unique, as well as helping to structure your thoughts.
It is good to create balance in the ceremony, therefore, a good starting point is to decide how you will both approach writing your vows. While traditional wedding vows are quite structured, you don’t have to be quite so rigid when writing your own. Here are some pointers to get you started:
Consider long you would like your vows to be and agree that between you. You might wish to choose 6-10 statements or sentences. A minute per person is a good length.
Consider if you want the vows to be funny, romantic or more generic.
Do you want to incorporate any traditional or religious elements into your vows?
Do you want to use particular wording such as “I promise to”, “I vow to”, “I will always” or “I commit to”? This is optional – you can also completely freestyle the wording, reducing the formality of the vows.
Consider how you want to deliver your vows. There are four main ways of delivering your vows which may affect how your write them:
Read your own vows: your vows are printed out in a nice large font and your celebrant passes them to you at the right moment.
Repeat after the celebrant: your celebrant reads out your vows for you to repeat after them - a few words at a time.
Just say “ I do” : this is a good option if you think nerves or emotions will overwhelm you and you just can’t speak at all! Your celebrant will read the vows out for you to respond “I do”.
Any combination of the above: choose some personal words and/or a repeat after the celebrant and/or an “I do section”.
What should we include in our wedding vows?
This is the bit that many couples find more challenging. To get you started I’ve put some ideas below on different elements you can include. Pick the bits you like, then think about personalising your words:
1. Start by talking about how you started your journey together and how that made you feel e.g. “When I met you, I didn’t think I was ready for a relationship, but………”
2. Are there any quotes or songs that you feel represent your relationship? Use a quote or line from a song, either as an opener, or in the body of the vows, to express how you feel.
3. Talk about the ways your partner has helped you or improved your quality of life e.g. “Since meeting you…….”
4. Talk about any hard times you have overcome together.
5. Think about things you have always wanted to say to your partner, but never have, or things you don’t say enough. Say “I love you”.
7. What has your partner taught you? What qualities do they have that you admire? “You have taught me to be more selfless ….”
8. What do you want to pledge or promise? e.g. “I am blessed to be part of your life and today I promise to be kind, patient and forgiving, I promise to encourage you in all your dreams……”
9. Consider finishing your vows with a forward-looking statement or commitment e.g. “Today I feel like the luckiest person in the world. I love you and I can’t wait to call you my wife and spend the rest of our lives together”.
Writing your wedding vows – top tips!
So, we’ve covered, how to get started and what to include, now here’s some top tips to help you do this!
Get started early. Aim to have the vows finalised 4 weeks before the ceremony to allow time to practice and reduce pre-wedding stress.
Jot down notes about how you feel about your partner and/or marriage whenever they come to mind. These thoughts could be reflective, thinking about the past, in the moment, or looking forward to your future life together. Return to these notes and highlight the words that most resonate with you.
Be authentic and heartfelt. It doesn’t matter how sentimental or soppy you think it sounds. This is the time to share your true feelings for one another.
Practice reading your vows out loud. This will help you catch spots where it doesn’t flow, words are missing or if the structure works. It will also help you include pauses and intonation.
Ask your celebrant or a trusted friend for their opinion.
Include humour – if you feel comfortable. The ability to make your partner laugh will lighten the atmosphere and serve well in your marriage!
Don’t try to memorize your vows. If you reading them yourselves, have your celebrant print them on card and hand them to you at the appropriate point.
Remember, there are no rules in a celebrant led wedding. The above pointers may help or they may not. Its you day - do whatever makes you feel most comfortable
Finally, keep your vows a secret from you partner until the actual ceremony. Your vows are special and keeping them a secret will make the ceremony more emotional and impactful if your partner is hearing them for the first time.
I’d love to know if you have any top tips of your own! Let me know if the comments!

[source_without_link]ANI[/source_without_link]It’s been six days since Emily had knee surgery, I think … I don’t know, I haven’t slept since then.
We thought we’d have about four weeks from the time everything was confirmed until the operation, so I made plans to get certain things done in a certain amount of time. Then they had a cancellation, and suddenly we had five days.
Now that I think about it, maybe it was for the best that I didn’t have a lot of time to think about it.
Emily had to have her ACL rebuilt. That’s in the knee–I’d been telling everyone the ACLU was damaged, which caused some confusion. It turns out the ACL is actually the anterior cruciate ligament, and aren’t we glad they shortened that? She also had a tear in the meniscus, which is also in the knee and not something you have with gravy.
We don’t know for sure how she damaged her knee. Yes, it’s possible all the hopping on and off horses at her job is connected, but sometimes it’s the smallest thing. I once pulled a back muscle while hopping over a puddle, not that I’ll ever admit it.
The surgery team got her all fixed up, held us there until we surrendered a major credit card, then sent us home–the same day. They scheduled physical therapy to start two days later, which seemed like a terrible idea and afterward still seems like a terrible idea.
The out-patient thing sounded great. Who wants to be in the hospital longer than they have to? Of course, it also means someone at home had to do the stuff hospital staffs used to do, and why is everyone looking at me?
I’m doing–eh–okay, as a nurse. At least I did once we got her up the steps and inside the house, which required the help of two police officers, one friend, and a husband with a bad back. The friend then prepared a meal for Emily, who hadn’t eaten in many hours, and me, who had no excuse.
A few other details of the week:
We did stock up on foods I could prepare (e.g., with instructions of five lines or less). My areas of cooking expertise include homemade popcorn; egg sandwiches; and microwaves. She has, thus far, not starved.
Thigh-high stockings can be sexy. Compression stockings are not. Now that I’ve helped put a pair on, I understand why pantyhose are going out of style.
It took only a few times of lecturing the dog and then having to shove him out of the way before he realized the appearance of a four-legged Emily means he needs to go lay on his bed until we pass.
On a related note, he likes to check up on his humans, and having them sleep in two different rooms drove him crazy. He finally settled on laying in one room, by the doorway to the other.
Our biggest challenge was utilizing the bathroom. Our house was built without plumbing, and eventually someone carved a corner out of the kitchen to make a bathroom. You can literally stand in the middle of it and touch three walls–four, if you lean over the bathtub. The door opens inward, and with it open it’s impossible for someone with crutches to get inside at all, let alone reach the toilet.
So I removed the door.
Not as impressive as it sounds–I learned in basic firefighting class how to take a door off its hinges. The dog was very confused, but I didn’t think anything of it until the first time I had to go to the bathroom. I felt like I was sitting in a porta-potty with no door on it.
So, that’s how our week has gone. The physical therapist/torturer seems to think Emily’s doing well, and now that the spinal block has worn off she’s getting around. I just changed the dressing, which took five minutes, and helped her get the compression stockings on, which took two hours. We’re recovering from that, then I’m going to cook her a great meal. Oh, wait–we’re out of frozen pizza.
Well, then … an okay meal.

Hopefully she’s back on her feet soon.
Wishing Emily a fast recovery.
Me too! Her nurse is only so-so on the competency level, so I’m worried she won’t survive me.Homocysteine and methylmalonic acid as indicators of folate and vitamin B12 deficiency in pregnancy.Clin Lab Haematol. 2001 Jun; 23(3):161-5.CL
Deficiency of folate during pregnancy is associated with megaloblastic anaemia. Lower levels of folate and vitamin B12 have been reported in mothers whose offspring had neural tube defects compared to unaffected controls. Increased methylmalonic acid levels are a sensitive indicator of mild vitamin B12 deficiency and elevated homocysteine levels denote vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. We have investigated the relationship between serum concentration of total homocysteine, methylmalonic acid, vitamin B12 and folate in pregnancy. A significant inverse correlation was found between homocysteine and red cell folate and, to a lesser extent, serum folate. In addition, a significant inverse correlation was found between methylmalonic acid and vitamin B12. No significant relationship was found between homocysteine and vitamin B12. The relationship between red cell folate and serum folate and homocysteine may be useful for detecting borderline folate deficiency in pregnancy and indicate pregnancies at risk of neural tube defect. These sensitive assays are useful tools for the further investigation of folate vitamin B12 and metabolism in normal and abnormal pregnancy.PM Modi's royal ride in the headlines during his US visit, giving a collision to 'Air Force One' of US, know its merits
Once again Prime Minister Narendra Modi's royal ride 'Air India One' is in the headlines. This is the first time after independence when a Prime Minister of the country has flown directly to America. During the journey, his plane did not land in any other country. Earlier, Air India One aircraft B-777 was also in the news with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Bangladesh. This was the first foreign visit of the Prime Minister after the beginning of the Corona period. PM Modi's visit to America for the second time is also special because his visit is from 'Air India One' B-777. After all, what is the specialty of the B-777 aircraft? Why is this plane in the headlines?
Broken this tradition
Modi, who went on a very important tour of America, has also broken the tradition that has been going on for decades through this visit. In fact, for the last several years, the Indian Prime Minister visiting America used to stay in Frankfurt city of Germany till now. After that, he used to leave for America again from there. This time it did not happen and PM Modi reached Washington without stopping. The credit for completing this nearly 15-hour long journey non-stop goes to PM Modi's state-of-the-art Air India One-Plane which has been inducted recently. PM Modi has arrived in Washington to address the Quad Summit and the United Nations General Assembly.
US President's plane is being compared to Air Force One
The eyes of all the countries of the world are on the visit of PM Modi to America. The world is looking to see what Modi returns from America. On the other hand, Modi's royal ride is also in the headlines. This royal ride of Modi is attracting the attention of the world due to its elegance and state-of-the-art facilities. This plane is being compared to the US President's aircraft Air Force One.
Like the aircraft of the US President, this aircraft of Air India is equipped with state-of-the-art technology. It is extremely safe and comfortable. The aircraft had arrived in India from the US in October for the visit of the President, Vice President, and Prime Minister. The other specialty of this aircraft will surprise you.
Know what are the features of Modi's royal aircraft
- Modi's aircraft is being compared to the US President's aircraft Air Force One. Like Air Force One, this Indian aircraft is also completely safe and impenetrable. Tight security arrangements have been made in this. It is fully capable of withstanding any enemy attack and retaliate. This aircraft has all the resources to deal with any emergency during flight.
- Air India One's B-777 aircraft are equipped with state-of-the-art missile defense systems. It will not have any effect on missile attacks. The aircraft is fitted with such safety equipment, which is fully capable of neutralizing and thwarting even the biggest attacks. Sensors have also been installed in the aircraft to inform about any missile attack.
- It also has Large Aircraft Countermeasures (LAIRCM) and Self Protection Suits (SPS). The US had given a green signal to India to sell these defense systems for $ 190 million. Presently the President, Vice President, and Prime Minister travel by this aircraft. Air India One symbol is inscribed on this aircraft.
- In this, the aircraft is fitted with twin GE90-115 engines. Along with this, the fuel consumption in the aircraft is much better than in the old aircraft. It has an air refueling facility. He doesn't need to land anywhere for fuel. That is, this plane can easily travel from India to America in one-time fuel. It is the responsibility of the Communication Squadron of the Air Force to handle it during the VVIP visit.
- This royal plane of Modi can fly at a speed of 900 kilometers per hour. A jammer is installed in one part of it to jam the radar system of the enemy. This aircraft has a large office and conference room as well as lab facilities on the lines of the US President's aircraft. This aircraft has been specially designed keeping in mind long-distance travel.
- Its special thing is that the B-777 has been manufactured by the American aircraft manufacturing company Boeing. It has been manufactured by Boeing on the special demand of India. This aircraft was to be handed over to Air India in July 2020 itself, but due to the Corona epidemic, it was delayed. Both these aircraft were part of Air India's commercial fleet in 2018. The same plane was sent to Dallas, USA to be specially refurbished for VVIP travel.Water Street Mission

Drinking culture change: the facts
Recent research shows that 23 per cent of the Australian population have not drunk alcohol in the last 12 months. Non-drinking initiatives like Dry January, Dry July and Ocsober have also become much more popular over the last few years and booze-free bars are opening up globally, from London to New York.
Apparently, the non-alcohol sector has seen an additional 620,000 shoppers this year and is predicting 28 growth in low and non-alcohol spirits in Australia this year.
A new alcohol-free option
There’s a new drink causing a stir on the block… and it sounds like the perfect solution to the new non-drinking trend. FLUÈRE ‘spirito non-alcolico (pronounced: “flu-air” and meaning “flowing”) is a botanical beverage made with quality ingredients like seeds from Casablanca coriander, Himalayan juniper berries and Provence lavender.
All drinks in the FLUÈRE range are distilled in copper pots using hydro-steam distillation. If that doesn’t sound fancy enough, they come in a stunning bottle that rivals any champagne magnum.
Created by Dutch VOC Spirits and old-school distillery Hooghoudt, it’s now being brought to Australia by Noble Spirits.
How much alcohol should you be drinking?
The recommended daily intake of alcohol is no more than 2 drinks per day, with no more than 4 in one sitting. Our nutrition editor Chrissy Freer adds: “It is also recommended that we include two alcohol-free days per week. Regular consumption of too much alcohol is linked to detrimental health effects such as liver disease, high blood pressure, increased risk of certain cancers and impaired mental health, as well as social issues.
The best alcohol-free drink recipes
Mocktails are a huge trend right now… and we’ve got some of Australia’s best booze-free drink recipes!

The end came Wednesday at the Park District’s monthly board meeting. After an executive session to discuss “personnel matters,” LaVelle read a statement announcing her resignation and defending her handling of the scandal.
Chicago Park District Board President Avis LaVelle resigned Wednesday under pressure for what mayoral allies called her negligent and “tone deaf” response to the sexual harassment and abuse of lifeguards at the city’s pools and beaches.
Last week, Mayor Lori Lightfoot acknowledged the Park District’s “brand” has been “hurt” by the burgeoning scandal that already has triggered the ouster of Park District CEO Mike Kelly and three of his top aides.
Hinting strongly that LaVelle’s days were numbered, Lightfoot at the time told reporters LaVelle had “given a lot of service to this city over decades,” but the lifeguard scandal has been a “very trying time for her personally, professionally and very difficult on her family.”
The mayor said then LaVelle would decide “relatively soon” about her future with the Park District, even though former Mayor Rahm Emanuel reappointed her to a term that expires in 2023.
The end came Wednesday at the Park District’s monthly board meeting. LaVelle is expected to be replaced by vice-chairman Tim King, founder and CEO or Urban Prep Academies.
A Park Board member, who asked to remain anonymous, said LaVelle had no choice but to resign for, “at minimum, not informing the rest of the board” about the lifeguard scandal.
“Keeping the board in the dark. It’s not a good practice. You’re the board chair. We’re counting on the board chair to be the point person to keep the rest of the board informed. Raise up issues that are happening within the Park District — especially something like this,” the board member said.
“At minimum, she did not provide us with the information we needed to make decisions. … At worst, [she is guilty of] helping Mike [Kelly] hide this information.”
Either way, there is no chance the Park District could make the reforms that need to be made with LaVelle at the top, the board member said.
“It’s not about selling a message. It’s that a lot of mistakes were made. And one of ’em is, again, you don’t hold onto information this sensitive, this big of a deal for 13 months. That’ s just not OK for any person on our board to have information like this and sit on it. Even if there was work happening, the rest of the board should have known. We’re all accountable for this. To withhold that information — it’s not OK.”
After an executive session Wednesday to discuss “personnel matters” that included her resignation, LaVelle read a statement defending her handling of the scandal.
Last week, the Chicago Park District fired three top executives — and apologized to female lifeguard for dropping the ball on their complaints of sexual harassment and abuse — after a blistering report that exposed a frat-house culture tolerated for decades.
But the press conference LaVelle and interim Park District CEO Rosa Escareno held to announce the firings was a public relations disaster that did nothing to restore the public trust needed to persuade parents to send their younger children to Park District programs and allow their teenagers to work at beaches pools and camps.
LaVelle was hounded that day by questions of what she knew and when she knew it.
She was asked why she trusted Kelly’s repeated assurances he was taking action to clean up the burgeoning scandal when it turns out he was sitting on those complaints not for six weeks, as previously reported, but for six months.
“I operated based on what I was told was happening,” LaVelle said.
Noting that board members are not Park District employees, she said: “We don’t have visibility into the day-to-day operations. … You know what you are told. It’s a trust factor. Management tells you what management and staff are doing. They tell you what they’re planning. They tell you what they implement. … You have to be able to trust the administrator to tell you what is going on.”
When a television reporter told LaVelle her response sounded like she was “passing the buck,” she finally acknowledged her share of the blame.
“It is not acceptable that any of this continued to happen. It is not acceptable that this started long before any of us that I’m aware of were here. It’s all unacceptable. I accept my responsibility as a person who was sitting in this chair at the time that this was exposed. I can’t be responsible for the people who came before me. I can be responsible for my part of it. And I have accepted that mistakes were made. It was a dysfunctional investigative process. It was a dysfunctional response process,” she said.
“There are many factors. Some of this rests with the management of the Park District that did not tell us the truth.”
Two of Lightfoot’s closest City Council allies — Finance Committee Chairman Scott Waguespack (32nd) and Ethics Chair Michele Smith (43rd) — said they didn’t buy LaVelle’s claim she relied on Kelly to tell her the truth about the steps he was taking to respond to complaints from two young women who were victims of the abuse.
“The inspector general reports directly to her — and only to her. And therefore, she had to have known certain things that were going on during and in the run-up to the investigation,” Smith told the Sun-Times.
“The first responsibility as a matter of good governance and lots of experience is to report your findings and do something. And nothing was done. Nothing was shared. That’s her responsibility.”
As for LaVelle’s claim that she had no choice but to trust the reassurances she got from Kelly that he was cleaning up the scandal, Smith said: “She knew that these allegations were there and she took no action. That’s what she did. That alone is enough for her to resign. … She has an ultimate personal responsibility.”
Smith also told the Sun-Times the jury was still out on whether LaVelle played a behind-the-scenes role in the suspension and firing of Deputy Inspector General Nathan Kipp, who had led the lifeguard investigation.
Special counsel Valarie Hays found “no evidence” to substantiate Kipp’s claim he was fired to “whitewash” the lifeguard investigation.
But Smith noted: “One gap in the report is that they did not have the charge to look into communications between or among Ms. LaVelle and Ms. Little. That’s a failing of that report that deserves further investigation because we don’t know … who knew what when. That deserves more investigation. That will shed light on the termination of Mr. Kipp.”
Waguespack said LaVelle “had a lot more information than she was letting on” during the news conference to release the special counsel’s report and announce the firing of those three top executives.
“She was getting reports directly from the OIG. She was managing the IG Elaine Little. She was very well-versed on what was happening,” Waguespack said.
“Yes, you could argue that Mike Kelly didn’t tell her everything. But, she had more than enough knowledge to know that the board … should have taken immediate action.”
Shortly before Kelly was fired, Waguespack said he and Smith met privately with LaValle to discuss the burgeoning scandal.
At that meeting, LaVelle characterized the complaints of sexual harassment and abuse by young women who worked as lifeguards as the product of “disenchanted staff and sour grapes,” Waguespack said.
“It was in the context of who the people are that were complaining victims. It really was. It was trying to make it sound like it wasn’t as big a deal as the media was making it out to be,” Waguespack said.
“Disrespect for the victims. I was very angry. I realized at that point that this was far more serious than they were letting on.”
LaVelle has said that the “sour grapes” and “disenchanted former staff” was not a reference to the young women’s allegations, “nor were those assertions made by me.”
She hinted strongly that Kelly, who attended the private meeting with Smith and Waguespack, was the one responsible for making that statement.”
“In the meeting between the aldermen, Superintendent Kelly and me, I personally assured the aldermen that the women’s allegations were taken very seriously and being investigated,” LaVelle wrote in an email to the Sun-Times.
“I urged the aldermen to let the facts as uncovered by the investigation dictate the discipline. I have concurred with every disciplinary recommendation to Park District HR brought forward by the IG’s office as soon as allegations against employees were substantiated.”
When former Chicago Public Schools CEO Barbara Byrd-Bennett was caught stealing from the impoverished school district and shaking down a CPS contractor, the president of the Board of Education at that time, David Vitale, resigned for failing to watch closely enough.
But Waguespack said there are more recent examples with closer parallels to the lifeguard scandal of boards that paid the price for lax oversight.
“The two [scandals] that … they should have learned from because we were all watching it was, first of all the women gymnastics [scandal with Larry] Nassar. And the second one was the National Women’s Soccer League, where two board members resigned immediately because they waited eight days to respond to an email about women who were being abused,” Waguespack said.
A former City Hall reporter for radio stations WJJD and WGN, LaVelle served as Mayor Richard M. Daley’s first press secretary before taking a top job in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services during the Clinton administration. She now runs a media consulting company with an array of government-related contracts.
LaVelle, appointed to the park board by Emanuel in 2012, has been board president since March 2019.
Sources close to LaVelle said she initially hoped to ride out the storm, salvage her reputation and stay on as board president at least long enough to honor Park District commitments that helped pave the way for former President Barack Obama to choose Jackson Park as the site of his presidential center.
Lightfoot appeared to give LaVelle that opportunity by allowing her to join Escareno at last week’s news conference.
But the hostile questioning made it increasingly “obvious” public trust would be tough to restore as long as she remained on the board, the sources said.
“When you’ve got people calling for you to resign, she realizes she’s the chairman of the board and has to accept this reality. She doesn’t want to be a distraction,” a LaVelle ally said.
Noting that LaVelle is in the business of advising her clients how to handle themselves in the media, the source said, “She has to make a living. This isn’t helpful.”
In what would be her last board meeting as president, LaVelle played an active role in board discussions on a variety of subjects
When complaints were raised during the public comment section about the security of concerts in the parks, LaVelle referred to the weekend concert stampede in Houston that killed eight people, including best friends from Naperville.
“Not that we want to prohibit concerts or anything on that order. But, the situation in Houston has probably raised for all of us some concerns to make sure that were are doing everything that we need to do to be focused on safety,” she said.
“I cannot tell you the fate of any particular park or any particular festival in a park. I can only tell you that I am certain that we will be looking closely at what is done in every festival to make sure that every I is dotted and every T is crossed.”
LaVelle also flexed her oversight muscle before the board approved a $4 million change order for the $64 million contract to build a new Park District headquarters in Brighton Park.
She told the board that she and fellow member Jose Munoz “pushed back hard” on the “notion of a $4 million change order” during a private briefing on the environmental clean-up that triggered the increase.
“That is a very large amount of money. And we wanted to be able to assure people who were paying attention to this that this was not a way for somebody to come in and low-ball a bid and then raise the amount of money they’re asking for in a change order,” she said.
“I’m very glad to hear that…you do the due diligence on it and that you just don’t routinely accept at face value the cost estimates that are put before you when people come to say they’re asking for a change order.”
thx for sharing...care to explain a bit about how to run ur own server? i tried to change the channel to localhost or 192.168.1.4 (the ip address on which the server is running)then on server.js change port to 8099 but it always says login failed or stuck on connecting..
B10KILLER
I guess, uh.
You might need assign server address to
or
depend on what plugin you use
thx!it was actually or lobby
I installed all plugins, compiled sucsesfully MiniTown.capx (channel in bottleneck was bottleneck.herokuapp.com/game), uploaded all files to hosting nqt.h2.pl/Mini%20Town
and got err 'Login failed!'
What I missed?
zergqq
I re-export minitown.capx again. It could connect to server successfully(the server still alive). I'm not sure what happened.
I redownloaded everything, and its works now -.-
— how can i compile thios code so i can run it on my own server?
—
The server code is running at node.js, so you need to install node.js on your server, them type
node server.js
Google "node.js" to get more detail.
can you explain in detail how to make a server on heroku with node.js. i see the lines that need to be modified but what do you have to do when creating an account on heroku and running the server like you did. I was able to get the capx project working off an ftp server with your server address. i installed the heroku toolbelt and am now struggling with the installation of node.js and npm. I assume i will work my way through but where do we put the server code that you posted? on heroku? is it a file upload area like ftp on godaddy?
the example you did is great and your help would be much appreciate
siki
Sorry, I don't have enough time to explain in detail.
The source code of server was shown in first post in this thread. For more detail, you might ask google.

Hi,
A newbie here. Your demo is awesome, but I'm trying to run the capx or make my own, and I always get "Login failed". Even from Construct 2 or exporting and uploading to dropbox.
The BN channel is set to bottleneck.herokuapp.com/game
(what is this? do I need an heroku account? where can I find some help on bottleneck plugin?)
I've tried your examples at:
playone.goodluckwith.us/games/Mini%20Town

and works fine, so it's not browser problem.
What can I do? <img src="smileys/smiley19.gif" border="0" align="middle" />
thanks!

A very nooby question regarding "user join":
I don't know how the rexrainbow's node.js server works, but it seems to be that at some point it stops registering users. In the rexrainbow's example it says "Login to lobby failed". After a while it starts working again. Is it somehow connected to heroku? If I'll install the server locally, would it solve the problem? Is it possible to reset the server manually somehow?Mini universe

Louisville, Kentucky
In December 1953, there was marked the occasion of the eightieth birthday of Dr. Newell Perry and his retirement as president of the California Council for the Blind. This was not merely a private event in the life of a private person; it was a public event in the life of a public figure.
Dr. Perry’s work, activities, and attitudes reflect and express the basic principles and outlook of the organized blind of the nation. In honoring him, therefore, we honor ourselves. And, in honoring ourselves, we honor him. A review of his life and work, therefore, will provide an excellent vehicle for conveying Federation doctrine and philosophy.
Fifty-eight years ago in California, there took place a flagrant violation of popular belief and publicly prescribed custom. The lawless act was this: a bicycle trip around the San Francisco Bay from Berkeley, by way of San Jose, to San Francisco. The culprit was a blind youth named Newell Perry. As surely as there are laws of man and nature, there seem then to be laws of blindness. Young Newel Perry’s performance in riding a bicycle for eighty miles was only his first transgression of the accepted conventions and convictions of his time. From that deed of lawbreaking, he went on to embody in his career a systematic challenge of the entire book of rules governing the conduct of the blind. The age-old proscriptions against independence of action, against seeking a higher education, against entering a profession, against striving for self-support, and finally against the anciently honorable and indeed biblical notion that the blind should not lead the blind.
In fact, there has been no law of blindness which Newell Perry has not defied and broken. Moreover, he compounded his offense by inciting others, particularly the youthful blind, to do likewise. The cumulated effects of this career of lawbreaking has contributed immeasurably to the fact that over the last half century, the old book of laws has been repealed and thrown away, and a new code has been secured by the blind.
Newell Perry lost his sight at the age of eight, but that was not all. Before two more years had passed, he was fatherless, homeless, penniless, and blind. With twenty-one cents in his pocket, a barefoot country boy, but without the bright eyes or even the dog, which usually accompanies that legend, he hitchhiked alone, all the way from Shasta County in the north of California, to the California School for the Blind in Berkeley.
Over the next nine years, he completed a primary and secondary education at the blind school and at Berkeley High School. This in itself was more education than most people acquired in those nineteenth century days. For the blind, it was almost unheard of; but for Newell Perry, it was only the beginning. He went on to graduate with honors from the University of California in the class of ’96, became successively a teaching fellow, assistant, and, finally, instructor in mathematics at the same university.
Still, this was not enough for young Mr. Perry. Breaking another rule, and yet another, he made his way alone through Europe in 1900, carried on graduate work at Zurich University in Switzerland, and Munich University in Germany, receiving his PhD in Mathematics from the latter in 1901.
The rest is well-known history. Social history. For thirty-five years, from 1912-1947, Dr. Perry was a teacher and Director of Advanced Studies at the California School for the Blind. For nineteen years, from its founding in 1934, he was president of the California Council for the Blind. For fifty years and more, he has been the guide and counselor for hosts of young blind people in search of full-fledged citizenship and opportunity.
In his lifelong occupation as teacher, it is natural that part of Dr. Perry’s enduring contributions to the welfare of the blind should fall in the field of education. He was likely responsible for the development of a system of higher education to the point of where today it is routine for the blind youth of California to matriculate at universities and colleges and enter all recognized professions. A fair share of the blind students who have received degrees and honors at California colleges and universities, not only participated in the system, which was so much a product of his labor, but drew from the doctor personally the original inspiration and, above all, the confidence that these accomplishments were within their power.
As great as Dr. Perry’s educational achievements have been, they are outstripped by far by his accomplishments in the broad field of social improvement. He was a prime mover in securing legal and constitutional provisions, which protected the right of blind persons to enter a number of professions, for bad irrational discriminations against the blind and the state civil service and in secondary teachings, enabled blind college students to pursue their studies with the aid of sighted readers hired by the state, and provided a system of public assistance to the blind, which is not only the best in the nation, but the model and precedent of the rest of the state. The steps, which led to the establishment of this system, included a constitutional amendment in 1928, the adoption of a comprehensive statute in 1929, and successive amendments in each of the sessions of the state legislature from 1931 through 1953.
It is the story of these battles, led by Newell Perry, in their conduct as well as their outcome, in their strategy as well as their policy, that the quality of his statesmanship most clearly emerges. For had the constitutional and legislative structure erected in California over these years of unremitting labor, been no more than a modern version of the Elizabethan poor laws, the blind would have been materially aided, but this was neither the character of the man, nor of the measure. And instead, the whole complex problem of public assistance to the blind was reassessed; a system was created which relieved the distress of poverty and did it better than ever before, but in addition, three cardinal principles were added, which raised the entire machinery out of the duct of the past, and pointed it into the future. The new system took cognizance of the need of the blind for adjustments on a social and psychological as well as on a physical level. It permitted and encouraged the sightless to rehabilitate themselves and to become self-supporting. It applied the democratic principle of individual dignity to an underprivileged class of American citizens by guaranteeing them a fair measure of independence and self-respect in the conduct of their lives.
These legal and material achievements have rested upon a firm foundation of self-organization by the blind. More than any other person, Dr. Perry implanted and nurtured among the blind the sense of common cause, the spirit of collaborative effort in seeking solutions to the problems of blindness. More than any other person, it was he who taught them that their overriding problems were not individual and could not separately be solved, that single-handed they could not oppose and hope to convert the power of government, nor the tyranny of public prejudice and unthinking discrimination, which rejects while it overprotects.
Underlying these activities and accomplishments, has been a philosophy of the blind and their role in society, which is humane, enlightened, optimistic, and deeply rooted in the most traditional principles of American democracy. The central propositions which composed that philosophy are these:
1. The right to work is the right to live. At the least, this is a proposition about material sustenance; at the most, it is a profound psychological, social, and perhaps even moral truth. It bespeaks the right of participation in society itself.
2. The blind are people too. They are normal human beings, endowed with the ordinary range of aptitudes and appetites, wits and wants, excellences and eccentricities, with the single difference that they cannot see. The blind are neither especially condemned, nor especially commended by nature. Neither mentally deficient, nor divinely gifted with a second sight to replace the first.
3. The blind are also citizens. They are entitled to the rights of citizenship, the right to privacy, free expression, to opportunity, to equal protection, to full participation in the mainstream of their culture and society. If the granting of these rights would constitute a revolution in the social treatment of the blind, it would sweep away the means test and the segregated workshop, it would disarm the social worker and the administrator, it would release the blind at long last from the ancient bondage of dependency and isolation.
4. Accordingly, the object of public programs and private efforts for the blind, whether in the field of education, social welfare, rehabilitation, employment, or minor benevolences, should be the reintegration of the blind into society on a basis of full and equal membership. An ounce of rehabilitation is worth a pound of care.
5. Action must be taken to erase, once and for all, the restrictive barriers of legal discrimination and institutionalized ignorance. The main channels of opportunity must be swept clear of artificial and irrational obstruction. Public service, private employment, the common callings, the ordinary tradesman occupations, and the profession must be rescued from arbitrary exclusions based on blindness, when blindness is not a factor bearing on competence and performance.
6. Moreover, the intimate personal experience of blindness, if met and successfully overcome, is an unusually sharp and effective teacher. Blindness is an enabling asset, rather than a disqualifying defect in the administration of programs affecting the blind.
7. Finally, the blind should lead the blind. The principle of self-organization means self-guidance, self-control, self-sufficiency. To say that the blind can, should, and do lead the blind, is only to say that they are their own counselors, that they stand on their own feet. From the acorn of self-respect, grows the mighty oak of self-support. And the control of their lives and the responsibility for their own programs and the organized and consistent pursuit of objectives of their own choosing, in these alone, lies the hope of the blind for economic independence, social integration, and emotional security.
These, then, are the works and this the philosophy which underlays it. A word might be said about the personality of the man who sponsored the one and expounded the other. What impels a man to a lifetime of selfless devotion to others? What prompts one to forget his personal advancement and spend his time and energy in the advancement of his fellows? What is the nature of self-sacrifice? Whence does the social conscience take its rise? These questions, for the most part, are unanswerable. The answers lie hidden deeply in the recesses of mind and personality, not yet probed by the psychologist.
In the case of Dr. Perry, however, some things are clear. He has never been a zealot. Reform with him has not been an emotional effusion, an accompaniment of unbalance and fanaticism. It was, rather, a product of a critical evaluation and a penetrating analysis of facts of his own experience with blindness and of an active and restless disposition. He is a man of singular determination and dogged persistence, and these traits are combined with emotional stability, temperamental equilibrium, intellectual composure, an incisive wit, and a remarkable sanity.
In all of this activity on behalf of the blind, however numerous and varied the paths, it may be seen that Dr. Perry’s role has been consistently the same—that of teacher. Who, then, have been his pupils and what have been his teachings? His pupils include those who were in his classes under the campanili at the turn of the century; to them, he taught mathematics. His pupils include several generations of youthful blind who enrolled at the state school for the blind in Berkeley; he also taught them mathematics, but much in addition. He taught them a new attitude toward their blindness, toward their problems as blind people, and toward the world. He infused them with hope, he served them with ambition, he gave them original and enduring confidence in their abilities to live youthful, normal, and economically self-supporting lives. His pupils include the adult blind population for whom he has been pathfinder, pioneer, and sage. His pupils include, as well, those who work with the blind, whether in education, rehabilitation, legislation, or social welfare, who have learned from him what the real needs of the blind are—the needs of normal and ordinary people with a physical handicap—and still, more important, what the real abilities of the blind are—the abilities of normal people seeking only self-respect and self-sufficiency. Most of all, the pupils of Newell Perry are the sighted public of America, for in his lifetime and immeasurably through his work, they have come ever more clearly to see the blind as neighbors, not as outcasts; as equal partners, not as dependent wards; as normal human beings, not as mental dependents. In short, as ordinary human beings like themselves.
Eighty years ago, the almost invariable fate of the blind man was mental and spiritual disintegration. Today, his prospect, though not necessarily fully realized, is complete social and economic integration. Eighty years ago, the blind man begged only for a shelter by the side of the road. Today, in the full confidence of his normality, he demands a place in the sun. We cannot say more or less in summation of the work and the life of Newell Perry than that the data of his biography are monuments in the history of this social revolution.AC Controls Co, Inc.

Vampire squid have been lurking in the dark corners of the ocean for 30 million years, a new analysis of a long-lost fossil finds.
Modern-day vampire squid (Vampyroteuthis infernalis) can thrive in deep, oxygen-poor ocean water, unlike many other squid species that require shallower habitat along continental shelves.
Few fossil ancestors of today's vampire squid survive, though, so scientists aren't sure when these elusive cephalopods evolved the ability to live with little oxygen.
The new fossil analysis helps to fill a 120-million-year gap in vampire squid evolution, revealing that the ancestors of modern-day vampire squid already lived in the deep oceans during the Oligocene, 23 million to 34 million years ago.
These squid probably evolved adaptations to low-oxygen water during the Jurassic, said study co-author Martin Košťák, a paleontologist at Charles University in Prague.
"Life in stable low-oxygen levels brings evolutionary advantages — low predation pressure and less competition," Košťák wrote in an email to Live Science.

A rediscovered fossil
Košťák and his colleagues found the long-lost fossil in the collections of the Hungarian Natural History Museum in 2019 while looking for fossils of cuttlefish ancestors. The fossil was originally discovered in 1942 by Hungarian paleontologist Miklós Kretzoi, who identified it as a squid dating back around 30 million years and named it Necroteuthis hungarica. Later researchers, though, argued that it was a cuttlefish ancestor.
In 1956, during the Hungarian Revolution, the museum was burned, and the fossil was thought to be destroyed. The rediscovery was a happy surprise.
"It was a great moment," Košťák said of the rediscovery, "to see something previously suggested to be definitely lost."
The fossil. (Košťák et al., Communications Biology, 2021)
Košťák and his colleagues studied the fossil with scanning electron microscopy and conducted a geochemical analysis. They first found that Kretzoi's initial identification was right: The fossil is from a squid, not a cuttlefish ancestor.
The animal's internal shell, or gladius, which forms the backbone of its body, was about 6 inches (15 centimeters) long, suggesting the squid grew to about 13.7 inches (35 cm) long with arms included. That's just a bit bigger than modern vampire squid, which reach about 11 inches (28 cm) in total body length.
The sediments surrounding the fossil showed no traces of microfossils often found on the seafloor, suggesting that the squid was not living in shallow waters. The researchers also analyzed levels of variations in carbon in the sediment and found that the sediment likely came from an anoxic, or low-oxygen, environment.
Those conditions are characteristic of the deep ocean floor. By looking at rock layers above where the fossil was deposited outside of what is today Budapest, the researchers were also able to show that the squid probably couldn't have survived in the shallower seas of the time.
The shallow-sea deposits showed very high levels of a particular plankton that blooms in low-salt, high-nutrient environments - conditions that modern-day vampire squid can't tolerate.
(Researchers from the Monterey Bay Research Institute discovered that while lurking in the deep sea, these squid don't behave like the nightmare predators their name suggests; rather, they wait in their dark habitats for crumbs of organic matter to flutter down. Then, they capture those bits with mucus-covered suckers, MBARI found.)
Adapting to the deep
The new research, published Thursday (Feb 18) in the journal Communications Biology, hints at how vampire squid ancestors learned to live where other squids couldn't.
Looking deeper in the fossil record, the oldest fossils from this group of squid are found in the Jurassic period, between 201 million and 174 million years ago, Košťák said, and they are typically found in anoxic sediments.
"The major differences is that these oxygen-depleted conditions were established in the shelf, [a] shallow water environment," he said. "This means that the ancestors were inhabitants of shallow-water environs, but they were already adapted to low-oxygen conditions."
There's a gap in the fossil record in the Lower Cretaceous, starting about 145 million years ago. The squid may have already shifted to the deeper ocean by this point, Košťák said, primed by their experiences with anoxic conditions in the Jurassic. This deep-water lifestyle might explain why the squid survived the crisis that killed the nonavian dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous period, he added.
The deep-living squid from 30 million years ago helps link recent history with the deep past, Košťák said. He and his colleagues are now attempting to make similar connections for cuttlefish, a group of cute, color-changing cephalopods whose origins are similarly murky.

Sharon Eileen Berghone was last seen in Nikiski on Monday, and her daughter, Patsie Blakely, last spoke to her on the phone around 9 p.m. that night. Blakely said her mother gave no indication that she was going out.
Alaska State Troopers found the woman’s remains after their Thursday search efforts began at 11 a.m., said Captain Andy Greenstreet, commander of the troopers E Detachment, which covers the Kenai Peninsula.
“Shortly after the day’s search for… Berghone began, ground searchers found her remains in a wooded area within walking distance of her residence,” Greenstreet said.
Berghone’s family has been notified, and her body is being sent to the State Medical Examiner for an autopsy, according to a trooper dispatch.
Greenstreet said troopers were planning to get the department’s helicopter sent to the Kenai Peninsula to be used in the search, and that it has now been called off. The alert sent out for Berghone has been canceled, he said. Blakely said Wednesday that her mother had turned 64 on Tuesday. She had required the help of a cane, oxygen and other medications, all of which were left at her home at the north end of Holt Lamplight Road, Blakely said.

Verdict
One of the most powerful vacuum cleaners that we've tested, the Lupe Pure Cordless has a smart floor head that sticks to hard floors and carpets, while maintaining manoeuvrability. The result is exceptional pick up on all types of surface, while the large 1-litre bin means that you don't have to empty it often. The Pure Cordless can convert into a handheld cleaner with hose, although the conversion process is a little fiddly, and we missed having a mini motorised tool. Price is also an issue, but if you've got the cash to spare, this cleaner performs very well.
Pros
- Lots of suction power
- Large bin
- Picks up dirt well on hard floors and carpets
- Converts into a handheld
Cons
- Expensive
- Fiddly conversion
- No motorised mini tool
Key Specifications
- Review Price: £699
- Cordless upright vacuum
- 1145 x 175 x 260mm, 4.6kg
- Motorised floor head, 2in1 crevice tool, 2in1 upholstery tool
- 1-litre bin
- 15/30/60-minutes runtime
Built by a couple of ex-Dyson employees, the Lupe Pure Cordless is a brand-new vacuum cleaner that promises to deliver the best suction and longevity. The company’s promise is not to invent and release new models where there’s no need, but to make sure that the product you do buy can be serviced and maintained for years to come, with easily replaceable parts.
With its smart upright design and powerful suction, the Lupe Pure Cordless gets a lot of things right. But there are some niggles in the way it works and there’s no getting over the high price, which makes this machine even more expensive than the top-end Dyson V11 Absolute.
Lupe Pure Cordless – What you need to know
- General vacuuming – Impressive suction and design make the floor head stick to carpet or hard floors, while remaining easy to push. Conversion from upright to handheld mode is a bit of a faff, though.
- Carpet test – Sucked up our test dirt, right up to the edge of the skirting.
- Hard floor test – Easily coped with our hard floor test, sucking up every grain of sand.
- Pet hair pick up – Does well on carpet, but I found it harder to shift pet hairs on a sofa.

Design and Features – The Lupe Pure Cordless is a smart upright, but it takes a bit of conversion to get into handheld mode
- Upright design and motorised head ensure ease of use though it can be toppled
- A couple of accessories are included in the box, but nothing for pet hair
- Conversion to a handheld vac isn’t as smooth as some rivals, but still gves some versatility
A lot of cordless vacuum cleaners are built around the stick design, where you have to hold the main vacuum part, and the wand and accessories plug into the end. For the Pure Cordless, Lupe has aped the traditional upright design.
This means that you spend most of the time pushing the vacuum cleaner around rather than carrying it, which can make cleaning floors and carpets a little more comfortable. There’s also no need for a stand, as the Pure Cordless is freestanding, so you can stick it in a cupboard; it also means that you can stand it up in the middle of cleaning without worrying about the vacuum falling over.
You get two accessories in the box, with a 2-in-1 crevice tool (it has a slide-out brush), and 2-in-1 upholstery tool. Both of these attach to the clip that fits onto the main wand. It’s a shame that there’s no mini motorised tool for removing pet hair from furniture.
In upright mode, cleaning is through the main motorised floor head, which has a soft roller and brush bar to cope with hard floors and carpet alike. By default, when the power is turned on and you lean the wand back, the brush bar springs into life. You can turn it off using the switch on the main body, which may be useful for hard floors or more delicate surfaces.
It’s easy to push the Pure Cordless around, and its smart motorised head suctions itself to the floor just enough to create a tight seal for dust pick up, but not enough that the vacuum is hard to push. A bit more flexibility in the floor head would make it easier to navigate around chair legs and the like, though. It’s nice to see that the vacuum can go almost flat to make it go under sofas and other furniture.
Alongside the brush bar control are the main power button, and controls to increase or decrease power through the three modes (Eco, Normal and Max). I found the power button a little fiddly, and it needs a firm press to cut power. And, the controls aren’t particularly well placed, making you bend down to adjust them.
There’s a hose that connects to the main brush bar, which you can unclip and attach the two accessories directly to. This hose doesn’t carry power, which explains why there’s no motorised mini brush.
Being able to unclip the hose and use accessories can be handy for quickly going around the edge of a room, or reaching into a tight area. You can also unclip the entire body from the motorised floor brush and carry it around. It’s similar to the Lift-Away mode on Shark’s vacuum cleaners.
Once undocked, the Pure Cordless sits on the stick-out feet, making it freestanding. You can then unclip the main handle, and attach the end of the hose into it to give you more reach. While this mode is handy for cleaning in a car or other hard-to-reach areas, the hose is a little stiff, and it’s easy to topple the vacuum cleaner while trying to get the hose to its maximum extension. Ultimately, I had to hold both the main unit (still the best part of 4.5kg) to extend the hose and use it.
I have to say that the conversion between upright and handheld isn’t as smooth as on Shark’s cleaners, where you can quickly unclip the wand, then go into Lift-Away mode. With the Pure Cordless, there are more steps to go through converting either way.
I also don’t like the handle at the back, which has a hollow cutaway in it that leave two bits of plastic to dig into your hand. A note for the future: make this a soft, curved handle made of a single bit of plastic.
There’s a large 1-litre bin, which is far larger than on most cordless vacuum cleaners. It pulls out the back and is emptied via the flap at the button, which makes it easy to get dust out of the machine without spilling it everywhere.
There’s a washable filter in the bin, plus a washable HEPA filter underneath, the latter of which is good for allergy sufferers, keeping small particles inside the vacuum system. You can also wash out the entire bin if you want, as this contains no working parts.
Finally, there’s a removable battery, which can be charged in the cleaner or outside of it. It should also mean that you can buy additional batteries in the future to extend runtime.
Performance – The Lupe Pure Cordless is very powerful and efficient
- This is a very powerful vacuum with excellent cleaning results
- However, it’s a tad noisier than some competitors
Pure Cordless promised a lot of power for the Pure Cordless, and it certainly delivers. Using the hose, I measured the Pure Cordless at 30.33AirWatts (AW) on Eco, 61AW on Standard, and 163AW on Max. That’s the highest suction I’ve seen from a cordless vacuum cleaner, just beating the Shark ICZ160UKT.
I measured sound, taken on carpet with the brush bar turned on, at 78.5dB, 80.3dB and 83.7dB, respectively. That makes this vacuum cleaner a little louder than the competition, particularly in its Standard mode; this result is closer to other vacuum cleaners’ max or turbo modes.
It takes 3.5 hours to charge the battery, and it depletes at 15-minutes at Max power, 30-minutes on Standard and 60-minutes on the Eco setting. For most jobs, Standard setting is best, so you’ll get through most of your cleaning on a single charge, but you may want a second battery to keep going.
I tested the vacuum cleaner on a range of surfaces. First, I went with the hard floor test, spilling a teaspoon of rice onto the floor. Running through the mess on Standard power, the Pure Cordless easily picked up everything in a single pass. Clearly, the way that the head suctions itself to the floor makes for impressive pick-up power.
Next, I went with the carpet test, sprinkling a teaspoon of flour against the skirting board. A single sweep through the mess on standard power picked up virtually everything, leaving a tiny trace by the skirting board; even so, this is about as good as vacuum cleaners get.
I tested the vacuum cleaner with pet hair combed into the carpet. Standard mode got most of the mess out but a quick burst on Max got the final traces out. Performance doesn’t get a lot better than with this vacuum cleaner.
Finally, I tried to clean my sofa, which gets covered in cat hair with the upholstery brush. This time around, things weren’t so impressive, and some hair stubbornly stuck to the sofa. This is where a mini motorised brush could come in handy.
Should you buy the Lupe Pure Cordless?
For a first vacuum cleaner from a brand-new cleaner, the Lupe Pure Cordless gets a lot of things right. It’s exceptionally powerful, doing well in all of my tests, picking up all of the mess I could throw at it.
There’s stiff competition, though. The Shark ICZ160UKT is just about as powerful, but its design is neater, with Lift-Away mode making it easier to convert between upright and handheld modes; the Lupe Pure Cordless takes longer and is fiddlier for its conversion.
It’s also worth pointing out that Shark’s DuoClean head has its Anti-Hair Wrap technology, which stops hair clogging up the rollers; with the Pure Cordless, you’ll need to take the rollers out and cut away the mess.
Then, there’s the price. At £699, the Lupe Pure Cordless is exceptionally expensive. Even at the launch discount price of £499, it’s more expensive than the Shark ICZ160UKT.
For all that, the quality, suction power and large bin of the Pure Cordless make it a cordless vacuum cleaner to contend with if you’ve got the cash to spare, but a mini pet brush and slightly easier conversion between upright and handheld modes would make it perfect. Da Cunha, A.P.

As the company gears up to present their new mid-range tablet to the world; it looks like they also have one eye on the next major iPad release coming in 2013. According to new reports that have surfaced today; Apple has already been in contact with parts and components suppliers regarding the next version of the 9.7-inch iPad.
If the reports are accurate then consumers should be able to expect a new iPad to be launched into the market during the mid of 2013, a release schedule that would see it pass 12 months since the launch of the current third-generation iPad model. Although the time isn’t right to discuss the potential design and features of any new tablet that will be shipped next year, it is being suggested that the suppliers have been told that the new iPad will see a number of LED chips being used for backlighting purposes reduced from the current 84 to a lower number.
Although the most valuable company in the world is planning on launching a smaller 7.85-inch variant of their industry leading tablet in the coming weeks, there aren’t any plans to make significant changes to the form of the main iPad model. The same reports are indicating that any new major iPad release will see the same 9.7-inch display, but will make significant changes internally to ensure that the design and manufacturing process can be as streamlined as possible. Intricate information regarding the possible changes isn’t yet known, but it is being said that Apple will use two-chip packages for the LED backlight units rather than the current one.
It’s definitely too early to be getting into any in-depth conversation regarding the overall form, function and included technologies of any product that will ship in mid-2013, but with Apple planning on announcing an iPad Mini and possibly some new Mac machines in the next few weeks, it’s comforting to know that their minds are already on the future and looking at how they can innovate and stay ahead of the game going forward.

1. The market is currently being flooded with books on business, marketing and social media. Why should someone read yours?
I think the market has always been flooded with books on business and marketing, but that’s another discussion. my business partners and I used to grow our business (as Entrepreneurs). This book is much more about how to think strategically different and engage in a much more human way in this new world. It’s also not a book written by a pundit. It’s from one businessperson to another.
There are many business examples from people like Arianna Huffington (Huffington Post) to BlendTec (Will It Blend?) to Gary Vaynerchuck (WineLibrary.TV) and even some different ones like Christopher S. Penn (PodCamp and the Financial Aid Podcast), Hugh McGuire (Librivox) and the musician, David Usher. Again, this is not about how they used the Internet to create or further their celebrity… Six Pixels of Separation looks at the business side of it. Why did Huffington use the online channels and not publish a printed newspaper? How did she use the channels to market herself and spread her gospel? The amazing thing about all of these stories (and there are many more) is that the Internet was a platform, a marketing tool, a lead generation tool, a CRM backend, a focus group, a community and much more. We tend to look at the Internet at think, “how can I market my business online?” It’s the wrong question. The Internet can be the place to do business, play with innovation, deal with customer service issues and communicate. Basically, the book demonstrates that all businesses – B2B or B2C and those with low-cost impulse buys versus multi-million dollar ticket items that have a long sales cycle – need to better understand and use the Internet to connect their business. It can be as basic as research and as complex as trying to build your own online social network.
3. You and I were introduced in a way through Joseph Jaffe, you sent me an e-mail after hearing me on his podcast. Are we separated by less than six pixels, and if so how does this benefit people like ourselves?
Obviously the notion of Six Pixels of Separation is a play on an existing saying. We no longer live in a world where there are Six Degrees of Separation (where any one person is connected to anybody else through less than six degrees of separation). We are all intrinsically connected through technology, the Internet and our mobile devices. These digital channels break down the notion of, “it’s who you know,” because we all now live in a world where we can know everyone… and everyone can know us. And, we’re not connected by degrees anymore… we’re simply connected. I don’t need an introduction to you through someone else and you no longer need one to me. The trust of the matter is that I was following and commenting on Logic+Emotion long before that Jaffe intro. By just clicking on your “About Me” link or your Facebook profile would have done the trick. We are all a click (or pixel) away from one another. This means a change for business. This means a change in how you sell people your products and services. This means that building relationships and turning those relationships into a community is more powerful and more important than ever before.
These new online channels give you the full power to make this happen. It’s no longer about how much budget you dump into advertising and PR. These new online channels will work for you as long as you are working for them by adding value, your voice and the ability for your consumers to connect, engage and take part. This new economy is driven by your time vested and not your money invested.
The benefit comes in both social capital and self-actualization. We tend to be attracted to like-minded individuals, so instead of me needing to find people in
4. A reviewer on Amazon said the following after reading your book. What's your take on being compared to Seth Godin?
"One of the other reviewer headlines calls the content "snackable" and I completely agree--I read this book a few pages at a time over the course of several days. It's not a chore to read, it's not boring--the writing style somewhat reminds me of Seth Godin, and certainly the content is of that nature--accessible, trendy, and yet practical and applicable."
I don’t think there is much higher praise. I love and have been following Seth’s work from day one. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting him many times over the years and have had him speak at events I was helping to organize. I have spoken at events where we were both being featured, and he was kind enough to provide a very nice testimonial for my book. We are even represented by the same talent bureau in the
If I’m being compared to that, I’ll take it with a smile on my face from ear-to-ear. The funny part about the book is that I did not write it the way the reviewer above explained it. It was actually written as traditional book chapters. Somewhere in layout/editing, my Publisher highlighted those headers and broke up the chapters into smaller bites. I didn’t like it at first, because I was worried that people might think it was just a bunch of Blog postings slapped together into a book (which it is not), but now that I have a final copy and after reading some of the other reviews, it seems like this format works for the businessperson in 2009.
Now, all I have to do is sell as many books as he does. I’ll take that comparison happily as well.
5. There's a feeling right now that social media has been hyped to the point of irrationality. How is your book relevant to those looking for some grounding in a space filled with opportunists?
Just yesterday, I wrote a Blog posting titled, Attention Radio DJs: There Is Still Hope. Basically, a local talk-show DJ lost his gig after doing his show for 20 years. I know the guy (his name is Peter Anthony Holder) and he is very talented. In his Blog post, he wrote: !"
The basic premise of my post was this: Peter does not need a radio station or any other mass media channel to give him permission to broadcast his talk-radio show to the world. We have this thing called, "Podcasting" and anyone can do it for free (or close to it).
I think people like you and I may think that Podcasting is very 2008. And, that’s the point. We may be over-hyping it, but we’re over-hyping it to one another. The average Entrepreneur or professional in an organization is still on the sidelines waiting to see who does what and how it will work.
The whole point of the book was to be pragmatic. Both in what these channels and platforms means to business and also in terms of speaking to those people in the media they are accustomed to (a hardcover business book). Also, writing the book as an Entrepreneur who used these exact channels to build my own business I think grounds it in reality from the outset.
Lastly, the more informed clients become, the harder it is for the opportunists to sell their snake-oil. The book brings them right up to speed.
6. What's the core business benefit to having everyone connected? How does a business benefit from friends talking to each other on Facebook etc.
In a world where everyone is connected an idea spreads because like-minded people share them, versus the world we’re used to where marketers place ads in various positions and places in hopes that those interested parties catch a glimpse. In a world where everyone is connected, products and services have to work (or exceed) expectations. In a world where everyone is connected, it’s hard to make false claims or try to screw one specific group of people. In a world where everyone is connected, people talking to one another about it on Facebook can make, break or help a product innovate.
Marketing and Communications professionals have been trained to listen to what a client wants, figure out a smart, clever and/or impacting way to deliver that message and then go forward, create the campaign and do everything within their power to get that message out there. When doesn’t get 50% success rates on any of their campaigns (targeted or mass). This means that the majority of the people we are targeting are simply not all that interested in what we have to say.
Digital professionals need to demonstrate that we can get to that mass people by focusing on “who” those people are instead of “how many” people we pump a message in front of. It’s a big promise, but digital media can deliver on this.
I think these channels demonstrate real value for business today. Value is all about focusing on the small few who can really help your message spread. It's definitely not as fun or as sexy as a billboard in

THE DRILL SERGEANT: China‐focused gold company Red Mountain Mining has intersected gold mineralisation during an initial underground drilling program at the company’s Zhongqu project in Gansu Province, China.
The Stage 1 drilling program intersected gold mineralisation with the best results including:
– 31 metres at 4.61 grams per tonne gold, including 4 metres at 9.51 grams per tonne gold and 8 metres at 10.07 grams per tonne gold;
– 14.3m at 4.50 g/t gold, including 6m at 7.14 g/t gold and 3m at 6.27 g/t gold;
– 8m at 7.65 g/t gold; and
– 4m at 5.71 g/t gold.
Red Mountain has an agreement to acquire 51 per cent of the Zhongqu project.
So far the company has drilled 17 holes for 2,352 metres at the Xinqu operating gold mine, which is one of three main exploration target areas within the Zhongqu project.
Drilling commenced from the deepest working “6 Level” of the Xinqu mine, which has been mining hematitic brecciated ore at or near a granodiorite ‐ limestone contact.
This encountered mineralisation in 13 of 17 drillholes with intercepts encountering the same style of mineralisation as seen in the Xinqu mine.
The spatial orientation of the limestone hosted structures has yet to be fully understood but they have returned significant gold intersections.
The company’s main objectives for the drilling program are to expand and better understand the known mineralisation at Xinqu.
It also represents the first stage in bringing the gold prospects at the project into JORC Code compliance.
“We are encouraged by the width and tenor of the gold ore system as it confirms that the project is capable of hosting mine grade mineralisation amenable to modern mechanised underground mining methods,” Red Mountain chief executive officer Andrew Richards said in the company’s announcement to the Australian Securities Exchange.
“These results will contribute to the estimation of an initial resource model by Red Mountain Mining.
“The deepest intersection was approximately 200 metres vertically below the 6 Level and only 400 metres below surface.
“This is considered shallow by Australian standards and easily accessed by a decline.”
Red Mountain has a further round of underground drilling of approximately 2,000m planned to commence in October.
This has been designed for the company to gain a better understanding of the newly encountered mineralisation as well carrying out some infill drilling to establish tonnage potential.
Two shallow metallurgical drill holes will be drilled to test each style of mineralisation.- HOLIDAY

Gibson Firebird 76 White 1977
Gibson introduced the Firebird '76 model as a sort of upgraded Reverse Firebird III with bicentennial inspired pickguard logo. The neck pickup is a typical Firebird mini humbucking pickup, but the bridge pickup is a Bill Lawrence design with both bobbins rotated 90 degrees on their side. The bridge pickup isn't mentioned in the 1977 catalog listing for the guitar, but neither is the fourth and most uncommon finish color: White.
Make and Model: Gibson Firebird '76
Year: 1977. Potentiometer code "137 7717" (137 = CTS, 77 = 1977, 17 = 17th week of the year. Serial number "62xxxx" which is a rather specific style to the white Firebirds at this time.
Measurements: Wide nut (1 11/16"), neck depth at the first fret = 0.80", 12th fret = 0.99". Total weight = 8 lbs 9 oz.
Originality: I did not observe any changed parts, repairs, or modifications except that the strap button on the back of the body.
Playability: Excellent! The neck is straight and the truss rod works as intended. There is wear in the original frets but I didn't find it to be enough to affect playability. I've cleaned the pots and jack and they operate as intended. It's a blast to play.661208 - Lecture CC Madhya 20.142-144 - New York

Prabhupāda:
- dāridrya-nāśa, bhava-kṣaya—premera 'phala' naya
- prema-sukha-bhoga-mukhya prayojana haya
- (CC Madhya 20.142)
So by devotional service one should not expect, "My miserable material condition may be improved" or "I may be liberated from this material entanglement." That is also a kind of sense gratification. If I want that "Let me be free from this entanglement . . ." Just like the yogīs and the jñānīs, they try. They try to be free from this material entanglement.
But in the devotional service there is no such desire. In the devo . . . because it is pure love. There is no expectation that "I shall be profited in this way." No. It is not a profitable, commercial business, that "Unless I get in return something, oh, I shall not practice this devotional service in Kṛṣṇa consciousness." There is no question of profit. Lord Caitanya prays to the Lord like)
"Oh," He says: "My dear Lord, Jagadīśa . . ." Jagadīśa means the Supreme Lord, Kṛṣṇa. Jagat,. "Jagadīśa, O the supreme master of this jagat, I pray unto You that I do not want . . ." na dhanam, "I do not want any wealth," na janam, "I do not want any number of followers . . ." Na janaṁ na dhanaṁ na kavitāṁ vā jagad-īśa kāmaye. Kavitām means very nice wife, poetical. "I do not want."
"Then what do You want?" Mama janmani janmanīśvare. Janmani janmani means "birth after birth." So He does not want liberation also. Because when we speak of liberation, there is no birth. Mad-gatvā punar janma na vidyate: "One who reaches the kingdom of God, he hasn't got to come back again to take birth here." So here Lord Caitanya says, mama janmani janmani: "birth after birth." That means "I do not want liberation also." Mama janmani janmani.
"Then what do You want?" Na, Īśvare bhavatād bhaktir ahaitukī: "My dear Lord, I may be put in any condition of My life, but please bestow this benediction, that I may not forget. That's all." "I may not forget. Because due to My forgetfulness I am suffering so much. So if I can remember You, I don't mind in whatever condition I am." He has to give the factual fact. Yaṁ labdhvā cāparaṁ lābham (BG 6.22).
In the Bhagavad-gītā in the Ninth . . . Sixth Chapter we find in the yoga system, yaṁ labdhvā cāparaṁ lābhaṁ manyate nādhikaṁ tataḥ: "When one achieves that perfectional yoga," yaṁ labdhvā, "by gaining that perfection," yaṁ labdhvā na cāparaṁ lābham, "then he has no other desire to achieve."
Just like we achieve something in this material world, but that does not stop our desire to achieve something more. I may achieve millions of dollars, but that does not make me satisfied. I want further ten millions of dollars. And when I get further ten millions of dollars, then I desire for further hundred millions of dollars. There is no cessation.
So here is a thing, Kṛṣṇa consciousness: one who is perfect in that system, bhakti-yoga system, the Bhagavad-gītā says, yam labdhvā cāparaṁ lābhaṁ na manyate nādhikaṁ. Adhikam means "greater than this." We want, we desire something which is greater than what I possess now. Therefore I desire. I have got hundred million dollar, and I want million millions of dollars, because that amount is greater than what I possess now. But one who possesses this devotional service, he does not think anything there is in the world which is more valuable than this. So why should he enquire? Why should he desire? He has got the sublime thing. Yaṁ labdhvā cāparaṁ lābham.
Lābham means gain. Manyate na: "He does not think." Na. What is that? Adhikam. Adhikam means greater. If I have got two dollars' possession and if you offer me ten dollars, I think, "Oh, it is better." So he possesses such a thing that nothing is greater than, because he possesses devotional service. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not different from Kṛṣṇa. So therefore he possesses Kṛṣṇa, and what thing can be greater than Kṛṣṇa? Therefore he is fully satisfied.
- yaṁ labdhvā cāparaṁ lābhaṁ
- manyate nādhikaṁ tataḥ
- yasmin sthito guruṇāpi
- duḥkhena na vicālyate
- (BG 6.22)
"And one who is situated in that condition, then," guruṇāpi duḥkhena, "the severest type of miseries, offered to him, he is not shaken." He is steady. He is steady. Just like a five-year-old boy, Prahlāda Mahārāja, and his father, atheist: "Oh, you rascal boy. You are chanting God's name? Who is God? I am God. Why don't you chant my name? If you don't do that, then I shall throw you in the fire." Oh, he is steady. He said: "Father, I cannot do that," this little boy. "You nonsense, you cannot do that? How do you dare to speak before me like this? Even the demigods, they are afraid of me." "Oh, yes, father. By the mercy of whom you are speaking so nicely, so by the mercy of Him I am speaking also like that." "Oh, I have no . . . I don't, I don't care for anyone's mercy."
So this is . . . and so much wrath of his severe father, oh, he is not . . . steady. Steady. So that is the characteristic of a pure devotee. Even in the greatest difficulty, even in the greatest danger, he is not shaken; he is steady. Yaṁ labdhvā. This is . . . this is the perfection of yoga. When one is steady in every circumstances, that is the perfection of yoga. That can be achieved easily by this Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
- yaṁ labdhvā cāparaṁ lābhaṁ
- manyate nādhikaṁ tataḥ
- yasmin sthito guruṇāpi
- duḥkhena na vicālyate
- (BG 6.22)
So here also we should not be aspiring after improving our material condition or liberation or anything. These are all desire. Desires. They say that "desireless," but desire cannot be completely absent, because I am living entity. So my desire should be not to forget Kṛṣṇa. That's all, that one desire. That is real desire. And all other desires, they are foolish.
So we cannot be desireless, but we should desire only bona fide. Just like I am part and parcel of the Supreme. So if I desire to work in cooperation with the Supreme, that is my natural position. That is desirelessness. If you . . . suppose in this material condition, if you desire to eat, oh, that is natural. So long you have got this body, you have to eat. If somebody says: "Oh, you are desiring eating?" Nobody says like that. Similarly, what is natural desire, that is permitted. And what is not natural, that is called "become desireless." Don't desire like this, unnatural.
So desirelessness means not to desire unnatural thing. But to desire Kṛṣṇa's remembrance, that is natural. Because I am part and parcel, how can I forget? This forgetfulness is the cause of my so many desires. And as soon as I desire Kṛṣṇa, then there, there will be no other desire. That is desirelessness.
So, prema-sukha-bhoga-mukhya prayojana haya. Prema-sukha. The the happiness in the matter of our reciprocation as the whole and the part and parcel, that sense is the highest pleasure. That we should aspire after, not that by becoming Kṛṣṇa consciousness we may desire some material profit. That is not.
- veda-śāstre kahe sambandha, abhidheya, prayojana
- kṛṣṇa, kṛṣṇa-bhakti, prema—tina mahā-dhana
- (CC Madhya 20.143)
Now, we are aspiring after possessing something, possessiveness. What we should possess? The possession is Kṛṣṇa, and desire is reciprocation between Kṛṣṇa and myself, and the ultimate end is love. That's all. Just like we have got perverted reflection of that love here between the two lovers. They don't want anything. He wants she, and she wants he. That's all. That is desire, and their reciprocation of loving affairs and the ultimate end, that they are peaceful in love.
This is only perverted reflection of the real love, which is reciprocated with Kṛṣṇa. Here there is no possibility of love; this is all lust. But we call it love because it is just the reflection. Just a real . . . that is real, and this is unreal. Just like shadow and reality. There is gulf of difference between the shadow and reality. So whatever love we see in this world, that love is only a perverted reflection of the real love with Kṛṣṇa.
- vedādi sakala śāstre kṛṣṇa-mukhya sambandha
- tāṅra jñāne ānuṣaṅge yāya māyā-bandha
- (CC Madhya 20.144)
So a devotee is not anxious for liberation, because his intimate connection with Kṛṣṇa means he is liberated. One cannot be in intimate touch with Kṛṣṇa unless one is liberated. So liberation and intimate connection with Kṛṣṇa, the same thing.
- yeṣāṁ anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ
- janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām
- te dvandva-moha-nirmuktā
- bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ
- (BG 7.28)
Yeṣām . . .
(aside) Have you got Bhagavad-gītā here? Yes. Just try to find out this śloka. I don't remember where it is. I think in the Eighth Chapter.
- yeṣāṁ anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ
- janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām
- te dvandva-moha-nirmuktā
- bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ
- (BG 7.28)
Yeṣām. Yeṣām means those who are anta-gataṁ pāpam. Pāpam means sinful reaction, one who has surpassed all sinful reactions. Yeṣām anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ janānām. Such persons, puṇya-karmāṇam, who has have done never any sinful action but always engaged in the matter of pious activities, puṇya-karmāṇam, such persons can only devote himself fully in the service of the Lord, Kṛṣṇa.
(aside) Have you got it? What is that?
Devotee: "But those men of virtuous deeds . . ."
Prabhupāda: Yes. Whose sin has come to an end, freed from the delusion of dualities. Yes.
Devotee: ". . . worship Me, steadfastly avowed."
Prabhupāda: Yes. So to worship Kṛṣṇa steadfast means he is liberated from delusion. That is mukti. One who has got still some doubt—"Why shall I worship Kṛṣṇa?"—that means he still in delusion, and still the reaction of his sinful life is not finished. A slight doubt means there is slight tinge still. And one who is dvandva-moha-nirmuktā (BG 7.28), duality . . . Duality means "Whether I shall do it or not? Whether I shall stick up to this process of Kṛṣṇa conscious or not?" This is called duality. So one who is free from all these sinful reactions, he has no more duality. He has firm faith, "Yes! Kṛṣṇa worship is the final."
So Kṛṣṇa worship means he is liberated already. Just like the same example: If a man is sitting on the high-court bench, it is to be understood that he has passed all educational qualification, and he is a good lawyer—therefore . . . there is no more necessity to ask, "Whether you have passed M.A. examination or law examination?" This is foolishness. Similarly, if one is, I mean to say, strictly in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then it is to be understood that he is liberated.
Liberation, the definition of liberation, is in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, mukti . . . svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ. Hitvā ānyathā . . . muktir hitvānyathā rūpaṁ svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ (SB 2.10.6).
Mukti means hitvā anyathā rūpam. Now we are now represented in different kinds of formalities. You have got a different kinds of idea; I have got different kinds of idea; another man has different from others. There are difference; therefore we are clashing each other. This is the sign of bondage. And mukti means when we are liberated from these different kinds of ideas, and svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ, when we are situated in our constitutional position, that is called mukti, liberation.
And what is our constitutional position? "Oh, I am the part and parcel of the Supreme, Kṛṣṇa." Then what is my duty? Duty, part's duty, is to serve the whole. That's all. Just like your hand, the part of your body. What is the duty of hand? To serve the body. It is very easy thing. If you are part and parcel of the Supreme, then where is your duty? Your duty is to serve Him. You have no other duty.
So one who understands this firmly and convincingly, he is liberated. He is liberated. Oh, how can I say liberated? "He is also now going to the office. He is dressing like ordinary man. What do you mean?" Mukti means he will dress like something else or he will have four hands or eight legs? No. Simply change of consciousness, that's all.
So Kṛṣṇa consciousness means change of your consciousness. I am thinking, "I am this matter. I have got so many duties with this material world." So when you change this consciousness: "No, I belong to Kṛṣṇa. I am part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa; therefore whole energy should be for Kṛṣṇa": this is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Now I am applying all my energy to this material conception of life. When you apply your energy, your transcendental energy, to Kṛṣṇa, then you are liberated.
Therefore a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, pure devotee of Kṛṣṇa, they are not hankering after Kṛṣṇa . . . mukti. They say, muktiḥ mukulitāñjali sevate asmān (Kṛṣṇa-karṇāmṛta 107); "Oh, the mukti lady is standing with folded hands, 'My dear sir, what can I do for you?' " And devotee doesn't care. "Oh, what can I (you) do for me? I don't want your help." There . . . there is a nice verse of Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura. He lived for seven hundred years in Vṛndāvana, and he was . . . became a great devotee of Kṛṣṇa. Former . . . in the beginning he was an impersonalist. His life is very nice. It is better to cite his life.
He was a South Indian brahmin, a very rich man and very much sensuous. He kept one prostitute. Prostitute. So he was so much, I mean to say, devoted to the prostitute that he was performing his father's, I mean to say, death ceremony and he was asking the priest, "Please, haste. Please make haste. I have to go. I have to go." . . . (indistinct) . . . . . . never cared for that raining. He went to the riverside. Oh, there was no boat, and it was, river was waving. The waves were very furious. And he thought that "How can I do this, I did this, I did this, I did this, I did this." Oh, the prostitute was astonished. His name was . . .. But he saw another beautiful woman, because he was practiced to that habit. So he was going behind. Although he determined, "Now I am going to Vṛndāvana," on the way he was again attracted by another woman. So he followed that woman. That . . . that woman belonged to a respectable family. So he came, and the woman said to his . . . yourpin?"  penetrate . . . I mean, and this . . . of this village. I am a cowherd boy. If you like, I can give you daily some milk." "All right. Very good." So Kṛṣṇa was suppling him milk. So there was friendship.
And years he lived in Vṛndāvana, and he has written a nice book which is called Kṛṣṇa-karṇāmṛta. That is a very authoritative book, Kṛṣṇa-karṇāmṛta. Lord Caitanya picked up this book, and He recommended all His devotees to read that Kṛṣṇa-karṇāmṛta book.
Thank you very much.

The brain waves of children are up to the age of 6 to 7 years mainly in delta and theta.
Young children are in a hypnotic trance state all of the time.
Why is that important? Their brains can in this state (in which they are naturally in) easily be programmed.
Nature designed it that way so that babies and children can learn everything that is important for their survival from their parents and the environment at an enormous rate.
Have you watched small children when they sit in front of a TV?
Their eyes get ‘big’ and nothing else exists …
… and they are getting programmed with whatever is presented.
The elite knows this and they want to ‘get them while they are young’ and rewire (& destroy) their innocent brains, because then all the programming takes place and is stored in the cerebellum.
That kind of programming cannot be changed for your entire life if you don’t know how to change it (and worst you aren’t even aware of the program).
From the age of about 7 years onwards these programs are stored in the limbic system.
Here the programming can much easier be accessed and changed, but still if you don’t know how to do it and don’t be always aware of your thoughts, words, feelings and actions, then the program will still be running you.
This is why children should NEVER sit in front of a TV in their first 7 years.
Good luck for all consciously aware parents that are trying to prevent that from happening to their children. (You will probably fail.)
Also parents should be very careful about what they are ‘teaching’ their children.
Your children will be programmed by your behaviour patterns.
So be careful what you present to them, because they will imitate everything you do.
People hate it when somebody says to them ‘you behave like your father’ or ‘you behave like your mother’ not because such empty phrases are annoying but because they are the truth.Even though they hit a couple of speed bumps in the first nine weeks of the season, the Los Angeles Rams have proved to be one of the top contenders in the NFL this year. They’re 7-2, have the league’s leading passer and receiver, and boast a defense that now welcomes Von Miller to the mix.
Big things could be in store for the second half of the season, but looking back on the first nine games, there’s a lot to like already. Here are our midseason awards for the Rams, handing out honors such as MVP, Rookie of the Year and the most improved player.
MVP: Matthew Stafford
(AP Photo/Matt Patterson)
It was almost a toss-up between Stafford and Cooper Kupp because both have been hugely impactful, but this one goes to the quarterback because of the difference he’s made on the offense as a whole. He’s a big reason the Rams are 7-2, even if his two interceptions against the Titans were primarily why they lost that game.
He’s not only been the Rams’ MVP, but he’s in the race to be the NFL MVP by the end of the season, too. He already has 23 touchdown passes and six interceptions in nine games, leading the league in yards (2,771), passer rating (111.0), QBR (69.7) and net yards per attempt (8.02). One bad game is no reason to panic because he’s still been a top-five QB.
Offensive Player of the Year: Cooper Kupp
C. Morgan Engel-USA TODAY Sports
If Stafford is the Rams’ MVP, Kupp is certainly their Offensive Player of the Year so far. In fact, he’s on pace to win NFL Offensive Player of the Year if he keeps playing the way he has. He’s caught 74 passes for 1,019 yards and 10 touchdowns, leading the league in all three categories.
No receiver has put up the types of numbers that Kupp has this season and it’s been a while since any player has. He’s the first receiver with 1,000 yards and 10 touchdowns through nine games since Jerry Rice in 1990. Kupp is off to a terrific start this season and there’s nothing to suggest he’s going to slow down.
Co-Defensive Player of the Year: Aaron Donald and Jalen Ramsey
(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez)
It would be unfair to give this award to just one of the two because they’ve both been incredibly valuable to the defense. Donald has a team-high 41 pressures and 14 quarterback hits, also recording six sacks in nine games.
Ramsey already has a team-high three interceptions and eight passes defensed, but what be more impressive is that he’s made six tackles for a loss – more than all but two players on the Rams. He’s doing it all on defense, from blitzing off the edge to covering the slot and lining up outside.
With Donald and Ramsey on the same unit, the Rams defense will be able to contend with any offense in the NFL. They have good complementary pieces, but the defense starts with these two players.
Rookie of the Year: Robert Rochell
(Photo by Sean M. Haffey/Getty Images)
To be honest, there weren’t many choices here. Rochell and Ernest Jones are the only two rookies who have contributed much this season, and even with Jones playing relatively well right now, Rochell has been a bigger factor. He’s broken up four passes and intercepted one, recording 14 total tackles in eight games played – including four starts.
His role will likely still be somewhat limited by Darious Williams and Dont’e Deayon at cornerback, but Rochell should continue to get snaps in the secondary throughout the rest of the year.
Most improved: Brian Allen
(AP Photo/Kyusung Gong)
Allen went from being a below-average center in 2019 to not playing at all in 2020 to being a quality starter for the Rams this season. Greg Gaines, Terrell Lewis and Ogbonnia Okoronkwo have also improved considerably, but Allen gets the nod here because he’s an every-down player and an important part of the offense, given his rapport with Stafford.
Allen has the sixth-highest PFF grade on the team at 74.0 and although his 15 pressures allowed are somewhat concerning, he’s held up better than expected in the middle of the offensive line. His improvement is a key factor in the Rams’ offensive line ranking among the best in football this season.
Most underrated: Leonard Floyd
(Photo by Carmen Mandato/Getty Images)
It’s almost as if playing on the same defense as Donald and Ramsey causes people to overlook another really good player, Floyd. He’s been underrated for the last two years with the Rams despite putting up great numbers as their top edge rusher.
This season, he has a team-high 7.5 sacks and has also racked up five tackles for a loss, a number that would be much higher if not for a few missed tackles on his part. Without Floyd, the Rams wouldn’t generate the pressure that they do on defense and his play as a run defender shouldn’t be ignored, either. He’s lived up to his contract so far.
Biggest surprise: Dont'e Deayon
(AP Photo/Eric Smith)
This probably could’ve gone to Allen, too, but since he won most improved, I’m giving it to Deayon. He’s only earned a role on defense in the last four weeks but he’s made the most of his opportunity, going from practice squad cornerback to a member of the 53-man roster to a being starter in the secondary.
With Darious Williams now back, Deayon may not play as much as he has recently. But he’s played well up to this point, allowing only 16 catches on 26 targets – the second-lowest reception percentage on the team. Deayon has been a pleasant surprise for the Rams and has proved that despite being 5-foot-9, he can play in the NFL.
Biggest disappointment: David Long Jr.
(AP Photo/Michael Conroy)
Long was supposed to help replace Troy Hill at cornerback but he’s struggled to fill that role. He was benched after the Rams’ loss to the Cardinals and played just 56 total snaps from Week 5-7. He played 57 snaps against the Texans when Rochell was sidelined but after Williams returned in Week 9, Long didn’t play a single defensive snap.
He’s been a major disappointment and although it’s not time to give up on him as an NFL cornerback just yet, time is running out for the 2019 third-round pick.Back to: Portable typewriters

Multicores are today used in automotive, controls and avionics systems supporting real-time functionality. When real-time tasks allocated on different cores cooperate through the use of shared communication resources, they need to be protected by mechanisms that guarantee access in a mutual exclusive way with bounded worst-case blocking time. Lock-based mechanisms such as MPCP and MSRP have been developed to fulfill this demand, and research papers are today tackling the problem of finding the optimal task placement in multicores while trying to meet the deadlines against blocking times. In this paper, we propose a resource-aware task allocation algorithm for systems that use MSRP to protect shared resources. Furthermore, we leverage the additional opportunity provided by wait-free methods as an alternative data consistency mechanism for the case that the shared resource is communication or state memory. An algorithm that performs both task allocation and data consistency mechanism (MSRP or wait-free) selection is proposed. The selective use of wait-free methods can significantly extend the range of schedulable systems at the cost of memory.

By the time you’ve refreshed and updated your resume it’s likely the position will already be filled. Having to rush through jazzing up your resume and pondering your recent accomplishments is overwhelming and frustrating. Life, in general, puts updating a resume at the bottom of the pile of tasks to do. When a once in a lifetime opportunity does come up, you don’t want to be scrambling at the last minute.
There are many other reasons why you want to keep your resume updated. If a friend or colleague wants to nominate you for something or present you with an award, they might need to send off your resume to a committee. If your resume is outdated, it won’t showcase all of your most recent achievements. An updated resume also comes in handy if you’re ever interested in doing any side projects. When the opportunity presents itself, you’ll be confident and prepared. Even if you’re not looking for a job, there still might be someone out there looking for someone with your skills. Hiring managers are always looking for people who would make a good fit for their clients. Keeping a refreshed resume handy, could help you land an unexpected yet lucrative opportunity. Drawing a blank is entirely normal, especially, if the same company has employed you for a number of years.
There are many resources to pull from, and you can always click here to learn more about writing your resume. For now though, here are some tips to follow that will help make it easier to keep your resume fresh and up-to-date.
Track Your Accomplishments
Create a folder on your desktop or inbox that keeps a record of your accomplishments. It’s challenging to try to remember achievements from the past no matter how important they are. Store vital documents including reports, performance evaluations, and emails of praise in one easily accessible place. It takes only seconds to tuck this information into a safe place to add to your resume later. Keep a separate folder for compliments that aren’t exactly resume-worthy. You never know if a potential employer will want more reassurance of your abilities.
Keep Social Media Profiles Current
Your LinkedIn or Twitter profile is easier to maintain and update then your resume. Make sure the profiles are not more than a month or two old at the most. You can add a couple of sentences regarding a new certification you’ve received or a recent project you’ve completed. Every time you access your social media pages should be a reminder to include new accomplishments.
Update Your Resume Twice A Year
Rather than waiting years to update your resume or when an opportunity arises, give it a refresh twice a year. Ask yourself the following questions:
- Do you have a new position or employee?
- Have you received any awards?
- Did your career goals change?
- Is your resume format current?
Updating your resume frequently will ensure you’re prepared for all scenarios that come your way including layoffs. It’s a good idea to have your current job description already listed on your resume to make it easier to negotiate a salary.
Make It Your Own
Instead of copying and pasting, adjust the language on your resume to make it a little more personal. Recruiters want to see what you’ve accomplished and achieved. They don’t want your resume to read too much like a job description. Take your job responsibilities and word them in a way that expresses how you fulfilled them.
Stay Organized
Keep a separate master resume for you to use solely for adjustments. Later on, you can copy and paste the file to another document and remove any work experience that doesn’t apply to your potential new job. Be sure to keep it in a safe place that’s easy to find.
Double Check the Details
Whenever you make a change to your resume, set aside some time to do some proofreading. It’s a good idea to ask a friend or family member to take a second look. You’re not only looking for misspellings here, check that the verbs in your sentences are used correctly in the past or present tense. Don’t overlook what may seem like minor details and check for consistency. Bullet points should either end with periods or none at all. The month for all employment dates must be abbreviated, listed as a number, or spelled out and never a combination of the three. All headings should have standardized formatting and look uniform.Thanks to a $6 million gift from a Board of Trustee member, Loyola University Chicago School of Law announced it will establish a Rule of Law Institute, further cementing the law schools’ leadership in promoting and strengthening the rule of law domestically and in developing nations and emerging democracies around the world.
The Rule of Law Institute will build on the foundation of the law school’s Rule of Law for Development Program (PROLAW), which is part of Loyola’s vision to engage faculty and students in developing new approaches to significant and often difficult global challenges, according to the law school.
The new Institute will research and analyze rule of law issues, develop approaches to those problems, and, together with University and external partners, aid in implementing and tracking those solutions.
Trustee Barry McCabe has been an integral part of the PROLAW program since its inception. His gift is largest-ever contribution from a non-alumnus to the School of Law and will provide resources for faculty, programming and collaboration with governments, NGOs and other partners around the globe, the law school said in a news release.
“Loyola not only prepares highly skilled attorneys; it also prepares professionals with a social conscience,” McCabe said. “That's what the rule of law is all about, and why I fervently believe it is worth advancing especially at this time.”
Jo Ann Rooney, president of Loyola University Chicago, said,” Rooney said in a news release.

One of the possible outcomes of installing LiveChat on your website is getting more customers out of it.
No matter if you're in the industry in which sales almost drives itself, for example in online clothing stores, you still need to prove great support on your website. Simply because many people need to communicate with you before deciding to purchase your product.
It happens in tech companies, where the product is complex and visitors usually have a lot of questions about it. Having LiveChat on your website can help you generate more leads from visitors – read more to find out why and how this can be achieved!
Why live chat can help me in gathering leads
If you want to generate more leads, you need to attract more traffic to your website. One way to boost your traffic is to better utilize your SEO tools, ranking your website higher in the search results. And here’s the pro tip: the longer your visitors are on your website, the better your rank is when browsing through search engines..
Here’s how you can involve your visitors in a way that will get you more business leads.
Make your chat stand many outstanding shop windows in the world – most of them were created by famous brands. They are a little pieces of art these days, stunning you with magic and mostly during Christmas time.
You can do the same with your LiveChat window. There’re plenty methods of customization and I’m sure that there’s more than one look that fits your website.
My advice to you is to try different looks on your website and see how they work. Are there particular looks that bring users attention and generate more chats? You can check it in your reports. Play with the look, have fun with it and let your imagination be seen on your website!
There’s also an eye–catcher you can put on the website. Apply that and you will make sure that your customers will know that you have a chat on your website. When choosing the eye–catcher, make sure to pick a website that is most often visited by newcomers, like your pricing or contact page.
Another thing a salesperson does in a store is welcoming their visitors. Simple “hello," or “hello let me know if you need anything” makes it for a nice experience. You should definitely do the same in your live chat.
You can set up plenty of greetings - the customized messages that start a chat with visitors. And don’t be afraid to experiment! See which greetings are the ones that are most successful on your website.
You can also check out the article about customized messages that you can use to provide more personalized experience.
Staff your chat
Answer the questions - do I have visitors from the entire world? If you're mostly local, do your visitors visit you mostly during a day or night? (use Google Analytics to check that). If it turns out that you have a lot of traffic at night, it’s a good idea to hire a person who can be available on chat just then.
If you want to gather more business opportunity leads, there’s no other way than to answer customers immediately after they ask you a question. Also, installing the mobile app on your phone is also a good idea, as you will be able to reply to your customers queries when not in the office.
If you don’t feel the need or can’t afford a person handling chats at night, then you should create an offline form. It allows customers to leave you a message, so you can reply in the most convenient time for you. But remember to let them know which hours will you be back online, so they know when they can expect your response.
Analyze chats and draw conclusions
People working on chats should share their insights and experiences. A good idea is to have regular meetings with all the agents.
You should talk about the most common issues, mistakes you’ve made and the way you want to talk with customers. It will help create a transparent environment, improve agents’ skills and increase their self-esteem, so they can perform better when chatting with your customers.
LiveChat also gives you an immediate look into the needs of your customers.
Thanks to the chat transcripts, you can analyze all the interactions and gain better insight into every aspect of your business, making better decisions in the future. By knowing what worked in the past and what didn’t, you can use that to your advantage and gather more business opportunity leads, increasing your sales as a result.
Find the balance between support and sales
You don’t want to scare your leads by being too pushy towards them. Find the right tone for your business. Selling is not only about presenting offers – usually one after another – but it’s mostly about helping and answering questions that your customers may have.
If you don’t focus on selling through live chat but more on supporting customers, you may see that their trust in you has increased.
And the customers who trust you are customers who are more likely to engage. If you believe in your product, the more you talk with somebody about it, the more likely they will to actually buy from you. That’s a natural flow of a conversation that can happen on live chat and can help you sell.
Understand how your visitors want to communicate personally don’t like when I email holiday places, asking about available dates and they respond to me: “Can you please give us your phone number? It will make the communication and choosing the right date much only thing could have been done “smoother" here would be on the business owner's side – and that’s wrong. So don’t be too pushy with your leads and accept their preferred mean of contact. Unless a customer doesn’t ask you to contact in different way, don’t insist to do it.
Remember these points
Let’s sum up the most important points of creating business opportunity leads in your live chat:
- Make your chat stand out – customize it with CSS and offer eye-catcher on particular websites.
- Staff your chat – make the most out of live chat and answer customers’ queries immediately.
- Analyze chats and draw conclusions – communicate with the whole team about the most common scenarios.
- Draw conclusions from previous chats – analyze what worked in the past and prepare for feature conversations, gathering more business opportunity leads in the process.
- Find the right balance between sales and support – don’t be too pushy, you’ll scare your leads. Provide support and answer questions to turn your visitors into leads and then customers.
- Understand how your leads want to communicate – feel customers' communication tone and continue the conversation on the most convenient channel for them. You’re there for them, not the other way around.
Turning leads into customers
No matter the industry you work in, running a business is never easy. That’s why you should try to create as much business opportunity leads as you can.
By talking with customers on your website, you increase their engagement and in result you might rank higher in search engines. That’s one step closer to having more leads on your website. Then, you can do a lot to turn these leads into customers. Have fun with that!

Ingredients:
- 2 slices of Sourdough Bread
- 1 1/2 tablespoons Brianas Asiago Caesar Dressing (Must have)
- 2-3 slices of Ham, Turkey or 2.5 ounces of Chicken (whatever is on hand)
- 2 Artichoke Hearts sliced
- 8-9 Pieces of Sun-dried Tomatoes
- Spinach
- Red Onion
- 1 tablespoon or more of Feta cheese
- Pepperoncinis
- 1 slice of Pepper-Jack Cheese (if desired)
- Italian Seasoning sprinkles
Directions:
Spread dressing evenly on the bread. The next part is simple…add all the ingredients above to the sandwich, then place it in the panini grill for 2-3 minutes or until cheese is melted. I never really measure out all the ingredients, I just put what looks right to me on the sandwich. These measurements are just guidelines
*Notes*
-If you don’t have sourdough bread, that’s totally fine! You can use french bread, white bread, brown bread, or anything you have on hand. I’ve just found that sourdough is the best!
-For the meat, I usually do whatever my mom has in the fridge, sometimes it’s just ham and sometimes chicken. Any meat is good in this!
-Toppings. You don’t have to have all these toppings just to make the sandwich. If you don’t have one ingredient, that’s totally fine, still make it! You can also add black olives or any topping you think would be good on itQuantity

Historical background
HENRI III
(30/05/1574-2/08/1589)
Born in Fontainebleau in 1551, Henry III was the third son of Henry II and Catherine de Medici. First Duke of Anjou, he distinguished himself by his military successes against the Huguenots in 1573 and was chosen as king by the Poles to replace the last of the Jagiellonian. In June 1574, while Catherine de Medici ensured the regency, Henry III fled from Poland. He passed through Venice to regain France. In France, Catherine was very unpopular because of favors that rained down on his Italian creatures (Strozzi, Gonzaga Birague Gondi). The king and his mother found themselves in Lyon and reformed government. The council was restricted number: it was reduced to the queen mother, and Birago Cheverny. The powers of state secretaries were diminished. Crowned in Reims, who married Louise Vaudémont Henry III tried to calm the civil war. In court, the king's party faced her brother, the Duke of Alençon. In September 1575, Alençon fled and went to the head of the Protestant party. In May 1576, Henry III had to sign the edict of pacification of Beaulieu or Peace of Monsieur. Victims of St. Bartholomew were rehabilitated, the Protestant allowed everywhere except in Paris and in the homes of the Court. Eight places of safety and justice rooms mid-parties were granted to Protestants. Damville kept the government of Languedoc and the Duke of Alençon received prerogative in Anjou, Touraine and Berry. The King of Navarre, back in his dominions, abjured the Catholic religion. The Catholic party was displeased with this peace. First Catholic League was founded by Mr. Humieres Peronne, Picardy refusing to receive Condé as Governor. Soon, Henri de Guise League extended this to the whole kingdom, with the recovery program of royal power and the meeting of the States General. To counter Scarface, Henry III declared himself head of the League. The States-General were assembled at Blois in November 1576, without representation Protestant. States having voted for the unity of religion, Protestants took up arms. States also claimed to establish government control and refused to Henri III subsidies he asked. Catherine rallied Damville and the Duke of Alençon, who became Duke of Anjou, heir. After a few Catholics success, a new peace was signed: it was the Edict of Poitiers in September 1577, which put some restrictions on the Edict of Beaulieu. The war resumed in 1580 with the taking of Cahors by the King of Navarre: she was short, Protestants longing for peace, which was concluded in November 1580 to Fleix. The Duke of Anjou transported his ambitions outside, seeking to marry Elizabeth of England and died before Antwerp, which he sought to seize (June 1584). Surrounded by cute and favorites, Henri III tried to strengthen the royal power by bundling its followers around a throne which he tried raising the prestige that is the sense of the elevation of his favorites, and Epernon's Joyeuse, strengthening the label and the foundation in 1578, the Order of the Holy Spirit. Great legislator, structuring the Council but big-spending, failed in the financial reform. After the death of the Duke of Anjou, Henry of Navarre became heir presumptive. Henry III had no children, he was discredited. The Guise rallied behind the candidacy of Cardinal de Bourbon and support underhand Philip III and Pope Sixtus V. The Holy League was formed by the Treaty of Joinville (December 1584). A Parisian league was formed, where bourgeois parliamentary and entered. Elboeuf, Aumale and Mercœur raised the province. Faced with this pressure, the king had to sign, July 18, 1585, an edict of proscription against Protestants. Meanwhile, the pope said Henri de Navarre deprived of his rights to the throne. In October 1587, the Duke of Joyeuse was defeated and killed by Henri Coutras. But the relief army sent by the Protestant princes of Germany was defeated by the Duke of Guise. On 12 May 1588, the latter being in Paris, the city rebelled against the king, who had to flee. In July, Henry III signed an edict of union (Catholic): heresy was prohibited; Navarre excluded from the succession. The States-General, convened at Blois, saw the triumph of the League: King renewed the edict of union and states refused to grant him.

Its structure, life-cycle and appearance are very much like the old-time lowland Colombian strains of yore whilst the effect and terpene-profile is more reminiscent of old Mexican sativa strains with the added nervosity of cetain African sativas.
Honduras is a tropical sativa with a very high yield and great vigour in the early stages of growth with accompanying high resistance to the hot and humid conditions and fungal spores found in its natural environment. It will grow indoors and also outdoors up to around 43° of latitude. Higher than this and the growing season is too short for its long flowering to yield satisfactory results.
Indoors Honduras will need powerful lighting to mimic the power of the tropical/sub-tropical sun. Because of its size potential it is highly recommended to begin flowering at 11 hours on/13 hours off at 15 days from germination or 7 days of rooting for cuttings in order to control the stretch and overall size. Outdoors tropical/sub-tropical and Mediterranean climates are most suited. Indoors flowering will take around 14 weeks; outdoors plants are ready to chop down during November in the northern hemisphere. Low quantities of NPK nutrients are required in the early stages with an increase in P & K during flowering. Yields can be truly exceptional
The aroma and flavour is typically sativa being floral, citric, woody and spicy. Despite its moderate production of THC at between 7 - 13%, with low CBD as well, the effect is very clear, clean and physically active it being suitable for various activities and work. The effect is without ceiling or come-down and it is recommended for migraine sufferers and those with a tendency to apathy. Contra-indications include anxiety, insomnia, heart problems or Parkinson's Disease. This is a great strain for those wishing to breed sativa hybrid strains.Liverock Technologies Inc., has announced the launch of a smart Internet of Things (IoT) gateway, developed in collaboration with u-blox.

The Daily Mail analysis, in association with the Taxpayers’ Alliance, looked at almost 6,000 FoI responses to pinpoint the highest-earning local authority managers in the country – 10 of whom earned more than £300,000 last year. Almost 3,500 council staff took home more than £100,000.
The highest-earning officer, Cumbria’s chief executive Jill Stannard, pocketed nearly three times as much as David Cameron last year, and 16 times the average wage of her county.
Similarly, the chief executive at South Tees Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust earned around £225,000 – a £35,000 rise on the previous year – but had her salary package lifted to £1.26m after bulky pension benefits.
A considerable slice of these earnings also comes from massive redundancy payoffs, pensions and bonuses – a part of which was found to be invested in private medical insurance and to silence council staff after scandals or blunders.
Responding to the figures, the chancellor said: “Taxpayers’ money shouldn’t be used to pay for private medical insurance, gagging orders to cover up bad practice aren’t justified, and salaries above a certain level should be approved through a formal process and published to the public who foot the bill know what’s going on.
.
“So we will claw back redundancy payments for high earners who leave and then return to the public sector within a year – and change the law so that public sector payoffs are capped at £95,000 even for the highest-paid public servants.”
Consultation on the public sector exit payment cap finished last week (3 November). Although the investigation draws up a case for the cap, the Society of Authority Chief Executive and Senior Managers (Solace) recently warned that it will actually hinder the transformation of local government – as well as penalise councils and make younger staff redundant.
It strongly opposed the regulations outlined in Whitehall’s consultation, believing the cap will create “unnecessary regulatory barriers” when combined with the cumulative impact of previous measures to “constrain the pay and pensions of senior staff”.

George Osborne needs to take his blinkers off. His inherent suspicion of the public sector manifests itself an a never ending stream of penalties and punitive measures such to the extent that he is overreaching himself now to put a cap on salaries simply for the sake of it.
How about looking at it as a value for money exercise. What do those top earners do for their salaries? Are they responsible for leading an efficient and effective local government authority which saves the tax payers money? If so, do they not deserve their salaries? George Osborne's fiscal fist has lost all sense of balance and simply serves to undermine local government and cast scrutiny on the basis of salary rather than performance and leadership.

The Beatles and The Beach Boys were two of the most cutting edge classic rock bands of the 1960s. Subsequently, their avant-garde material received a lot of comparisons. Interestingly, one of the most unusual songs from The Beatles’ White Album was a massive influence on the soundtrack of a Beach Boys movie.
How a score inspired by The Beatles helped capture the life of The Beach Boys’ Brian Wilson
Love & Mercy is a biopic about The Beach Boys’ Brian Wilson which deals with his love life and mental health. It’s an unconventional movie with an unconventional soundtrack. Much of the soundtrack is collages of Beach Boys tunes with haunting music added. During an interview with Uproxx, Bill Pohlad — the director of Love & Mercy — discussed what he learned about Wilson.
“Part of Brian is the challenges,” Pohlad said. “I mean one of the first things I think [his wife] Melinda said when I first started to get to know them both a little better was this notion that Brian hears these amazing orchestrations and harmonies and arrangements in his head that are so complex, nobody else can understand them until he actually executes them. They’re these amazingly, you know, layered things. The problem is he hears them all the time and he can’t turn them off necessarily.”
RELATED: George Harrison Said This Song Meant for The Beatles’ ‘White Album’ Was Perfect for Another Artist
Here’s where The Beatles came in. “So when I started to visualize that {Wilson hearing music], I thought of ‘Revolution 9’ on The Beatles’ White Album,” Pohlad said. “I was like, ‘We should do something like that.’” Subsequently, Pohlad discussed his idea with composer Atticus Ross. Ross is known for his scores for films like Gone Girl, The Social Network, and Soul. Ross and Pohlad connected over Pohlad’s Beatlesque idea. They had access to many of Wilson’s original tapes and rearranged them. Pohland felt this was a better idea than having a composer simply write a Wilson tribute for Love & Mercy.
An album combining The Beatles’ ‘The White Album’ and Jay-Z songs inspired the score as well
Ross told The Credits he also took inspiration from another Beatles-related project, The Grey Album. The Grey Album is one of the most famous mashup albums of all time. It combines songs from The White Album with songs from Jay-Z’s The Black Album.

How the world reacted to a film about The Beach Boys
Love & Mercy went on to become one of the most acclaimed music biopics of all time and an important part of The Beach Boys’ legacy. Box Office Mojo reports it earned over $2 million during its opening weekend and over $28 million altogether. At the same time, the film introduced The Beach Boys to an audience who perhaps wasn’t familiar with them and made the trials and travails of Wilson’s life more well known. Love & Mercy is a notable film and it wouldn’t be the same without its Beatles-inspired soundtrack.

Township police received a 911 call just after 1:30 p.m. from a parent who said a man spoke to his daughter from his vehicle and then turned his music up loud and began dancing on his seat.
Officers searched for the man and learned his identity Monday.
While he is not being identified by police, James Sclater, director of public safety, said the 60-year-old man is suffering from symptoms of dementia.
Sclater said the man does not live on that block, but does live in that neighborhood.
Several of his neighbors were interviewed by police, and Sclater said many of them are aware of his mental challenges.
Police also were told that the man lost his wife and has been devastated about it.
Police said playing his music, which initially was described as circus or carnival music, makes him feel better. Police said the man actually was playing jazz and big band music.
This is not the first report about the man behaving unusually in front of children, according to police.
Sclater said the man does not fit the “profile of a pedophile,” but his behavior has raised concerns in at least one other community.
Sclater said the man is aware he has dementia and appears to be lonely.
Sclater said he is not sure if the man is able to retain the warnings and information police gave him.
He was not arrested, but his family has been asked to monitor his actions.
Police learned the issue was being made public in an email from one of the concerned parents. The email thanked police for dealing with the matter and said news stations had been contacted.
According to Sclater, the parent said the media was contacted to help spread word of the incident and to alert parents to watch their children.Are you looking for a way to activate a new SIM Iliad or transfer your old phone number to the SIM Iliad?

What to expect
Our program runs over five weeks, ensuring that we give you enough time to truly understand the techniques we teach. Most importantly, this gradual introduction to massage gives your baby time to become comfortable with it and learn to love it.
Each week you have time to learn and practice baby massage without being overwhelmed by too much knowledge.
We also have time for discussion each week. Both a topic introduced by me, and anything that you as a group feel important to discuss. In this way, each group is unique and special, tailored by your own special needs and personalities.
By the end of the five weeks you will have all the tools you need to not only soothe and calm you baby through massage, but you will also have a range of mindfulness tools that are important for parents.
Classes are open to babies from newborn up to 12 months. We supply oils and handouts as needed, and delicious morning tea each week – all you need to bring is a mat for your baby to lay on.
We often run several programs at one time, so if you have dates in mind that suit you and your baby, ask us about other courses coming up.
To keep classes intimate, we do limit numbers, so contact Sharon soon to secure your place.
Classes are held in both Caloundra and the Glass House Mountains

Frequently Asked Questions
These are some of the questions people most frequently ask u. If you can't find your answer here, please contact me at sharon@mamablooming.com.au and ask away there.
How old does my my baby have to be to begin?
Baby massage has been shown to to be beneficial in both physical and mental development for premmie bubs, so there is no 'too young' for a bub to attend class. It is more about when you feel ready to leave your nest and join us. No need to rush, but if you are the type of person who loves to get out, this is a great first place to get out to. It is all about nurturing both you and bub, and helping you to slow down the pace by sharing this mindful activity.
My bub isn't born yet but I'm super excited to come asap. What if I book now, but do not feel ready to begin after all?
Not a worry. Please let me know when you book and we will have a chat together. I will check in as the start date approaches and see how you are feeling. If you or bub are not yet ready, we can transfer your booking over to the next course.
What if my baby or I are sick and need to miss a week?
This does happen. If any bub or mum are sick, we do ask that you put your own health first, and respect the health of the group and stay home to get well. Each week we do do repeat and add on to what we have learned to help the steps sink in, so you will certainly get to cover steps again. I will also invite you to arrive early the following week so together we can chat about the group discussions and what you have missed, as I feel these are so important for you as well.
What if you are sick as the instructor? I don't want my baby to catch anything?
Of course. With each group I open a small facebook or whattsapp group where we can all keep in touch for the duration of the course. If I were to be unwell, I would connect with the group and let you all know. If a mask did not suffice, I too would need to stay home to respect the health of you all, and together we would make a plan for a catch up class. Health always comes first.
I am suffering PNDA (postnatal depression and/or anxiety). I think this could help, but really don't think I would fit in with mums who don't
You will fit Mama. Believe me, there are a LOT of Mamas out there suffering. You are not alone. I have had a number of mums referred to me from mental health workers to join this class. Many come and openly share how they are feeling. They are always embraced, and over the weeks I often see such a shift. It is beautiful. Others choose to quietly sit in and not share. That is okay too. There is still a shift. I am not saying this is a cure to PNDA. Oh how I wish that were true. But it is a space where over weeks you can get to know other Mothers and realise that they too are struggling. They too have difficult feelings and challlenges. Sometimes in sharing you help others feel brave enough to reach for support. Other times in sitting in you feel more confident in realising no Mamas life is as perfect as their socials claim. And together, if only for a short reprieve, you can feel more connected. With your baby. With yourself, And with other Mothers who may well go on to be life long friends. Part of your tribe. I promise you I have seen these connections happen. I really hope you choose to join us. (please let me know in advance if you are comfortable to, so I can help you in any way you need to feel comfortable in circle)
How old is too old for my baby to attend?
The course is open for bubs up to 12 months, although you know your bub best. I do encourage you, if possible, to begin classes before bub is on the move, although there are many bubs who learn to crawl before our 5 weeks are over. THey become the perfect models in discussions about adjusting massage as your baby grows. Because Baby Massage is the introduction for what I hope is something you can share with your baby for life....healthy loving touch.
Can I bring my older toddler/child?
I'm afraid you will need to find care for your older children. 2 reasons. 1st, it is a lot to ask for an older child to be still and not run around distracting, AND to be set aside as mum puts all focus on bub. But with very young bubs lying in circle, it would need to happen. It does not take much for an accidental trip and a toddler to land on a bub, no matter how careful everyone is. Secondly, and even more important, is that this is your opportuntiy to mindfully connect with your baby. If this is not your 1st bub, no doubt you are already feeling stretched, and possibly guilty as you cannot give as much to everyone. This 1 morning a week is about setting all else aside to completely give to your baby. Later, at home you can practise these techniques on your older children, and even help them learn to massage their baby sibling if/when old enough, using this experience to connect you all. But for class time, it is all about you and bub. One to one.
I would love to come, but the day does not work for me. Do you offer different days?
Anything is possible. Currently classes run on Tuesdays, but if this does not work for you, it does not hurt to reach out and ask. If there is any chance of making another day possible, then why not. All we need to do is put it out there, and see if some other mums are interested for another day too.
I have a mums group with a number of us keen to do this together. Can we do this?
Absolutely!! I love private mums groups. They can be so much fun. In fact if it works for you and one of you have the space in your home (depending on geography) we can even run a private course with just your group in home. Everything else is the same. There would just be a change of day and location. If no one has the space, I can still provide.
I am very interested in the course, but quite anxious about a crowd of new faces. Could I do this course privately?
You could. But would I recommend it? Nope.
Why? Because with all of the wealth of knowledge and Mama wisdom I have to share, it can never be as much in value to you as when shared with other Mothers also sharing this time of life right now. With you. The connection with them, your collective wisdom (yep, you all have it within), this is a priceless bonus in a group class that I cannot gift you in private. I know it can be scary walking into a new group but it will not take long to begin to feel connected. You do not need to speak up much. You are welcome to listen and absorb. But I promise you, the type of people this type of course attracts are the type of people you want in your village. The type that will embrace you and help prop you up. I only have 2 rules in class. 1. please don't come unwell if contagious. 2. Leave your judgements at the door - everyone is welcome. Just let me know in advance, and I'll save you a spot next to me and help prop you up until you feel comfortable.Gujarat PSI Study Material: Gujarati psi or constable is is one of the most common dream of Gujarati students.

With United States being the major contributor, the region is highly active in increasing number of nuclear reactors and implementing new policies and regulations supporting clean energy generation.
A nuclear reactor produces and controls the release of energy from splitting the atoms of certain elements. In a nuclear power reactor, the energy released is used as heat to make steam to generate electricity. Currently, around 13.6 %.
The USA is the world's largest producer of nuclear power, accounting for more than 30% of worldwide nuclear generation of electricity. The North America Nuclear Power Plant market is projected to witness a CAGR of XX% from 2014 to 2020.
Ever growing energy demand, need for clean energy generation and governments initiatives towards achieving energy security are some of the factors which are expected to drive the market growth. On the flipside, higher upfront costs and environmental issues regarding uranium mining are restraining the market from growth.

The story is told backwards, in that we see the tragedy as the curtain rises and then slowly move backwards in time so we can understand the events that contributed to it. This reverse chronology actually makes the story stronger as the ending hangs a terrible fate on what would have seemed an innocent beginning.
The six-woman cast is on stage at all times, each sitting on a box when a scene does not call for everyone. There are nice bass-heavy musical cues between scenes as director Anna Jordan moves things forward (actually, backward) with ease.
With understated dialogue, we see how the two moms (Sally Clawson as Linda and Amy Prosser as Rose) allow their dislike of each other to poison their daughters' social world.
Marissa Keltie plays Haley, the misfit, while Siobhan Fitzgerald plays Jenna, Haley's one-time best friend who allows herself to be sucked into the vicious world of teen-age girls. Keltie and Fitzgerald are both fine actresses (with Keltie recently giving one of last year's best performances in "Terminus" at the Magic), as are Susan Shay as Mia and Heather Robison as Claire.
The story will resonate with any parent who has lived inside the emotional tsunami of raising a 21st Century teenage daughter. Rucker gives us an end, middle and beginning, in that order. "Crystal Springs" will stay with you awhile.
RATINGS: ☼ ☼ ☼ BANG
The San Francisco Theater Blog Awards Division awards "Crystal Springs" Three Stars with a BANGLE OF PRAISE. Writing, acting and staging earn one star each and the BANGLE is for producing a play cast for six women, as well as for the playwright giving us dialogue that never feels out of place.

-.Mercy is an oft redefined word; so much so that people use it in conjunction with killing and do not laugh themselves silly at the oxyMORONIC nature of language in the post-modern age. Sarcasm is a piece of steel that pokes and prods and is swung around and causes blunt force traumas that are hard to heal. Satire is that sarcastic piece of steal sharpened. Oh it can injure just as sure as Sarcasm, but its finely honed edges can be used to cut out cancer. Satire may hurt, but its intent to Reform can be a tool of Mercy.
The focus of “I Desire Mercy, Not Sarcasm…” is the balance between the life of Mercy we find in Christ and the need to speak the Truth in love – sometimes by making fun of the errors we are trying to correct.People allegedly ‘against hate’ become the deepest haters of all
As those who watch today’s campuses know, these are challenging times for, dare I say it, sane persons.
The university has become almost unrecognizable. In place of reasoned deliberation we find feverish activism. In place of a neutral forum for civil debate in the shared pursuit of truth we find the enforcement of official orthodoxies.
Disagreement — once the driving force for intellectual advancement — now is anathema.
If you dare to differ from some particular orthodoxy it’s because you don’t understand or enjoy privileges that blind you to the experiences of others. Or, worse, it’s because you, in fact, are actively defending those privileges.
You are, in other words, a racist, or a homophobe, or a transphobe, or an Islamophobe. In short, a hater—and hatred has no place on campus.
All of this culminates in “cancel culture” on campus: those who disagree with the orthodoxies must be eliminated from the table of discourse and in some cases from the campus altogether.
The College Fix recently published a Campus Cancel Culture Database that lists more than 650 successful cancelations over the last 10 years — and also more than 750 attempted cancelations in that time.
I assure you, there’s more to come. The academy, or large swaths of it these days, looks a little like a madhouse. What are we supposed to do?
Partly to try something different, partly to maintain my own sanity, and partly to follow Saul Alinsky’s famous advice “for radicals” that “ridicule is man’s most potent weapon,” I have written a novel.
Called “Nevergreen,” it’s an academic satire that targets campus cancel culture and the ideological excesses that generate it.
It tries to get across how unhinged such campaigns can be, and in particular just what it feels like to be the victim of a cancel campaign, which—as any such victim will tell you—is not very good.
My hope is that by magnifying by means of satire what really are the intellectual corruptions of the dominant campus climate, “Nevergreen” may serve as one additional weapon in the battle for academic freedom, integrity, and indeed sanity that we are badly losing. And of course, hopefully, it’s entertaining. It won’t accomplish much unless people enjoy reading it.
It tells the story of J., a physician in a midlife funk. A chance encounter gives him the opportunity of a lifetime, an invitation to speak at a small college. But when he arrives at the secluded island campus of Nevergreen College, he gets a lot more than he bargained for.
No one actually shows up for his talk, but that doesn’t stop it from becoming the center of a firestorm of controversy—with potentially fatal consequences. “Nevergreen” aims to be a smart, fast, funny, and incisive portrait of today’s liberal arts college scene, cancel culture, and more.
Happily it seems to have hit at least one of its marks.
“You’ll laugh at the antics of students and the monumental irresponsibility of the administration at Nevergreen College. But it’s really no laughing matter, as our once-liberal-arts colleges, our once-celebrated elite universities, are rapidly becoming Nevergreens,” one reviewer offered. “This frightening satire is more truth than fiction.”
Indeed, the book is a mix of “academic satire” and the genre of “horror.”
In his subjective (if not always reliable) experience, the main character J. is being pursued, possibly, by a mob of mad, bloodthirsty murderers. But wait, do the students really want to, what, murder him? Of course not: “they’re just kids”; they’re excited to be activists about their causes; they’re easily distractible; they’re not really pursuing him.
But then again, maybe they kinda sorta are pursuing him, and kinda sorta do want to murder him. Something in them revels in the aggression, the power, of canceling, something in their ideology converts these people who are allegedly “against hate” into the deepest haters of all.
And for those who have experienced cancelation, who have been publicly slandered, vilified, threatened, made out to be the enemy of all that is virtuous, good, and true, can you blame them for feeling like they are being pursued, possibly, by a mob of mad, bloodthirsty murderers?
And just mightn’t it be possible—if the present trajectory remains unchecked—that they are?
Andrew Pessin is professor of philosophy at Connecticut College and the campus bureau editor for the Algemeiner. In a previous incarnation, he portrayed “The Genius” on the Late Show with David Letterman. More information about “Nevergreen” and links to purchase are available here.

Thursday 25/11/2021Morning Everyone.
Just want to shout out first up to student Loloahi Siale whose birthday it was yesterday. HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
We may not understand the lyrics and words of songs in another language, but you can certainly feel the joy which underscores the singing and level of joy that God in Jesus Christ can cause people to feel because they understand the reign of Christ in their hearts and lives. It just makes you want to sing. It makes you want to tap your feet, to get up and dance. You can understand why King David felt at times like ‘dancing’ before the Lord in the Temple.
It’s that feel good buzz, but it’s more than JUST a feel good buzz, because WE know when everything else may fail and fall away God’s got us! There is no falling away, there is no failing in God’s care and love for and of us. This is God’s intention and purpose to never let us forget what Jesus is on about, that his reign is as Jesus says ‘different from other Kings of this world.’ It is in that essence of difference which causes us to want to dance and sing, sing and dance in thanksgiving for what has been done for us through the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. God is intentional and not without purpose, and God’s intention and purpose, a plan put well into place the Bible reminds us, even before the beginning of time. For God’s thoughtfulness we are grateful, Amen.
Have a blessed day

Every day is a new day and every new day is a day where we are invited to seize the day ‘carpe diem’ …
Latin for ‘seize the day.’ If you’re interested in where this phrase was made recently famous check out the movie
‘The Dead Poet’s Society’ which starred the late actor Robin Williams. It’s a cool movie.
How do we ‘carpe diem’ seize each new day?
The Bible reading is from 2 Samuel 23:1-5 on p401 in the Wesley Bibles.
These are the last words of King David much loved by God and the King of Israel.
What can help us seize the day is the direction sometimes we’re given from hearing God’s word or the message for the day … spending quiet time … being still, being still with God. Maybe even just taking 5 mins to check your day out before you start and planning how you will get through it … do you have all you need to help you get through your day? All these things are the things we can do to ensure we ‘seize the day’ well. Be prepared mentally, emotionally, physically. It may even mean thinking about going to bed early the night before. All these things we need to consider when we want to ‘seize the day’ well.
King David in the reading takes us right back to the basics when he says in v5 ‘If my house wasn’t right with God then God would not have made an everlasting covenant with me … granted me my every desire … given me everything I asked for.’ It calls us to think about our priorities, what things are important in our lives and how do we reflect their importance? If God is important then reflect in our lives how important it is. How do we treat other people? How do we care for the environment? How do we treat people we don’t know or find hard to love? This is what King David is talking about when getting his house in order. He ruled as a King doing what was right and fair and just and he walked humbly with and beside God. Where have we heard that before? Yes our School prayer Micah 6:8 ‘And what does the Lord require of each of us: To act justly, to love mercy and to walk humbly with God.’
This is all part of getting our ‘house’ in order and when our house is in order we reflect through our actions and words what that order is about, all about seizing the day in God’s way. In v4 I love the way King David’s rule is described as 4 ‘… like the light of morning at sunrise on a cloudless morning, like the brightness after rain that brings grass from the earth.’
How cool is that!
God wants us to seize the day from beginning to end and then enables us by showing us how. Amen!
Have a blessed day

Tuesday 23/11/2021Fakalofa lahi atu kia moutolu oti. Good morning Everyone!
The Gospel reading for this week of the ‘Reign of Christ’ is John 18:33-37 on page 1341.
When we ask questions we’re usually wanting to know the answer. We’re usually wanting to know the truth of something, we’re seeking answers which will not only satisfy our curiosity, our need to know, but provides us with the truth.
Pilate’s question to Jesus is simple enough ‘Are you the King of the Jews?’ Jesus’ response though is not so simple and it’s clear that many didn’t back then and still today do not understand the kind of King Jesus was. Others just don’t want to know …the too hard basket.
In the lead up to Jesus death he is “handed over” by a whole lot of people who didn’t want to be responsible for his death … from Judas to Pilate no one wanted to know. Yet John the writer of this Gospel is not content to have us think that Jesus was the innocent victim or bystander of others’ betrayal. On the cross, it is Jesus who “hands over” his spirit. Jesus’ purpose, “to witness to the truth” of who he truly was, the Son of God. In the end, it is Jesus, and not Judas, the Jews, or Pilate, who has the say about his death when, where, how and why.
Jesus’ kingship can be difficult to see and understand, because the truth of who Jesus is, is only truly revealed when he is on the Cross. Some might say too little too late. Others see what was revealed on the Cross. Others see the truth of who Jesus truly was. Others are given the truth to their questions.
Jesus invites our questions and our seeking the truth. Keep asking, keep seeking with all our heart and we will find the truth of who we are revealed in the truth of who Jesus Christ is. Amen!
Have a blessed day

Yesterday was the last Sunday of the Church Calendar year which means next Sunday is the first Sunday in the Season of Advent.
This final Sunday and week we’re asked to think about the Reign of Christ and what it means for us as we come to the end of another Church year.
The Psalm for this week is Psalm 93 on p729 in the Wesley Bibles.
The Psalm reminds us of God’s massive never changing nature and all the images of the sea speaks to God’s great power. God is the kind of sovereign we can have confidence in … God is the kind of God whom we can trust to always do the right thing by us. In the middle of whatever is going on in the world, in the middle of whatever we might be going through in our own lives, God’s unchanging nature of sovereignty, of protection and of power reminds us God is always with us. God isn’t going anywhere or away and in the middle of our life is always there for us.
God is someone to be trusted and we trust as we follow.
Have a blessed day

Thursday 18/11/2021Malo e lelei everyone.
Yesterday marked the official opening of the Methodist Church of NZ - Te Hahi Weteriana o Aotearoa … their Conference. For the first time in its history of meeting as a Church it is all online … a sign of the times we are in and a gathering when we are not quite together.
Conference is always marked by the singing awesome singing which Methodists are renown for … we hear it every morning in chapel. Whenever we gather we sing what has become our Anthem the great hymn ‘And Can it Be.’
Charles Wesley (1707–1788), along with his brother John Wesley, was one of the founding figures of the Methodist movement back in the 1700s. Like his brother John, Charles was profoundly, deeply influenced by a religious conversion experience which took place on 21 May 1738. The experience inspired him to write two new hymns, "And Can It Be that I Should Gain" and "Where Shall My Wondering Soul Begin?" After this, Charles went on to become a prolific hymnodist, writer and composer of over 6,500 hymns.
Both John and Charles were PK Kids pastor’s kids. Their father was a priest in the Anglican Church so they grew up knowing about God but not really believing in their hearts or having a personal relationship with God. The phrase “And my heart was strangely warmed’ is how John Wesley describes his coming to believe in God on 24 May which is why we celebrate Wesley Day on the closest Sunday to that date every year.
John and Charles believed that the Church should be for all people and that God’s grace was for all people and this really appealed to the poor, the uneducated, the people on the margins of society who had never ever heard that God loved them too.
We give thanks for the Church here in Aotearoa NZ living out the principles that John Wesley believed in especially around education for all people … that education was key to people’s freedom to a future free of societal ills.
We give thanks for our School which lives out daily its Special Character in its obligations to those economically disadvantaged and to providing education for Maori and Pasifika. As the oldest registered school in Aotearoa, we give thanks for the legacy and history we have inherited and the opportunity through God’s grace to be the difference both in our students’ and their families lives. God is good!
Have a blessed day

Royals’ striker, who started the 2-0 win against Andorra in Cardiff, rolled his ankle while trying to keep the ball in play by the touchline.
The 26-year-old tried to play on, but was eventually forced off after just 23 minutes when he was replaced by Dave Edwards.
Robson-Kanu did join in the post-match celebrations - but he was using crutches and had his right ankle in a protective boot.
He will now head back to Reading for treatment and must be a real doubt to face the Addicks when Steve Clarke’s side return to Championship action on Saturday at Madejski Stadium.
The injury will come as a major blow to the forward - who had been in impressive form for his club in the run up to the international break.12/4/20
TGIF…Twin Groves it’s Friday!
What’s Happening at Twin Groves?
6th Grade
Language Arts and Language Arts Advanced: This month, we will be working on writing a theme analysis and also revisiting the literary elements of mood and tone. We will also begin to examine the author's craft by answering questions like: why did the author put this scene in the story? And investigating how the use of a certain sentence impacts the meaning of the story.
Science: 6th grade scientists are truly feeling like chemists now! We are working our way through chemistry learning about elements, compounds, and mixtures! We’ll also learn about how molecules change state through various physical and chemical changes. In fact, one of our favorite lab activities will take place “White Before Your Eyes!”
SS: After finishing our inquiry into the death of Otzi the iceman, students are going to begin to look at the start of civilization and government in the fertile crescent. The students might not have previously heard of the civilizations of Mesopotamia, but they definitely have been impacted by them. These civilizations showcase groundbreaking achievements in law, agriculture, and writing that have come to shape our world for thousands of years!
Pre Algebra Survey: 6th Grade Pre-Algebra Survey is continuing the unit on rational numbers. Rational numbers include all positive and negative integers, fractions, and decimals. This month we will be focused on multiplication and division of rational numbers and then applying all four operations while solving problems following the order of operations. started a unit on expressions following Thanksgiving and will continue this unit throughout December. Much of the focus on this short unit is using the mathematical properties to manipulate variable expressions and justify their reasoning. week, we finish up our dystopian book club novels, and we thank parents who made room in the day for quiet reading at home to help their students finish the novel on the class time table. As long as that has become part of your routine at home, why not continue it? Silent reading of any kind is an excellent way to boost students’ reading stamina, test scores, comprehension skills, and general knowledge base. And in the pandemic, it is a germ-free, profitable use of free time! Next week, we focus on tone in informational text and take a CFA to check in on how students’ skills are progressing on this target. All of trimester 1’s targets repeat in either trimester 2 or 3, so watch TeacherEase and Schoology for growth as the year continues!
Science: As we head into our second trimester, students have just finished working on epigenetics and discovering how our environments and life choices shape who we are. We looked at the animal community in particular and discovered how various organisms are impacted at a genetic level from their surroundings. Continuing in our study of environmental impacts on organisms, we will begin working on how animal behaviors and animal structures impact their probability to successfully reproduce.
SS: The inquiry model of teaching and learning about history and social studies involves not only questions, questioning, and analysis, but also the very critical skills of evaluation of sources for their reliability and credibility. This includes every possible outlet of information - books, magazines, TV, radio, online / Internet, and social media. This is perhaps the most vital skill to possess as students continue through their High School years and beyond. Key attributes that we discuss include: relevance to topic, coverage/depth, reliability of publisher/author, accuracy, potential bias, and being up to date. We are taught to drive defensively. Now, in this world of 24/7 news and information, we need to navigate news and information defensively. In regards to content, we are comparing and contrasting the views and perspectives of Patriots and Loyalists during the Revolutionary Years and how that will lead to the Constitution replacing the problematic Articles of Confederation. Political parties will emerge during this time in America, with conflicting views for the future. From there, we’ll examine and make connections to our Constitution and government at the national level, state level, and local level and how anyone can step up to take civic action to make a difference.
Bridge to Algebra 1: With the second trimester starting we are in the midst of a very important unit where we learn about linear functions. We are learning how to calculate slope, writing linear equations, and graphing linear equations. Understanding linear equations is crucial because they are prevalent in many levels of math.
Algebra 1: Our first unit in trimester two has us learning how to use our calculators to find lines of best fit (trend lines) for data. The students are doing wonderfully learning how to do this remotely. There are many steps to get to the calculation and a lot of data that needs to be entered and the need for precision is very high. The students are also going to learn how to calculate residuals by hand and learn how to use the calculator to find those as well. We use residuals to determine if a linear model is the best fit for the data.
8th Grade
Language Arts and Language Arts Advanced: We just wrapped up a busy first trimester in Language Arts! Everyone has been working hard on strengthening their reading skills and improving their written responses to literature. In Language Arts we started our first whole class novel, The Giver, and students have been doing a wonderful job analyzing characters, setting, and the impacts of a dystopian society. In Advanced Language Arts students have been analyzing how authors create suspense and how various structures such as irony impact the theme and mood of a text. In trimester two we will focus on how authors craft informational texts and how different text structures impact meaning.
Science: 8th grade Science is completing the second unit studying relationships between ancient and modern organisms. In December, we will begin to investigate the effect of genetic variation on an individual organism’s probability of surviving. We will look at both classic examples of natural selection including peppered moths during the Industrial Revolution. Students will also study current events such as increase of antibiotic resistant nightmare bacteria.
SS: In Social Studies, students had an opportunity to take part in our New Deal Inquiry assignment that required them to analyze sources that showed the New Deal as having either a positive or negative effect on America throughout the Great Depression. Students had their final opportunity of trimester 1 to write an introductory paragraph, providing both background context and a claim statement that held their position. In addition, students had to identify evidence that supported their claim and provide credibility of their sources, both skills that we will continue to assess in trimester 2.
We have since moved on to our World War II unit, first giving students an opportunity to learn about various dictators that emerged in this era. Students researched various atrocities committed by Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Benito Mussolini, and Hideki Tojo. We will next focus in on Hitler’s rise to power and the Nazi regime’s inhumane efforts to exterminate the Jewish population, known as the Holocaust.
Algebra 1: In Algebra 1, we started off the week with our Statistical Models of Linear Functions unit by gathering data, calculating linear regression models, and making predictions. Students will apply their knowledge of linear functions and make connections to real world situations with scatter plots and linear regression models. At this point, students will feel pretty confident in using their TI-84+ graphing calculator. This will be a great unit to complete before going on Winter Break.
Algebra 2: In Algebra 2, we started off the week with our Radical Functions unit. The students will apply their knowledge from Algebra 1 to take it a step further into our Algebra 2 unit on radical functions. The students will explore how to graph radical functions with transformations, write equations of radical functions based on key characteristics, solve radical functions with square root and cube roots, and find inverses of radical functions.]

2. Approval of the agenda
3. Approval of the minutes from the last meeting:
Feb 2016 meeting was cancelled due to lack of quorum. Approval for meeting minutes of Jan 2016
Co Chair Special opening remarks
PAC Constitution, Code of Ethics
● Treasurer
Approved funding requests
● Teacher representative
● Principal/Vice¬ Principal
4. Unfinished business
Parent representatives for classrooms
5. New Business (items requiring a decision, recommendation or discussion)
Mary – recommendation to start new committee:
○ EMB High School Committee (Cindy Dong, Mary Wilson, Charis Broadbent, Barb Lee, Lisa Chong)
Motions:
Shirley Chang – Motion for Financial transparency
1. A PAC financials binder for each year will be made available at the school, instead of my home. The binder will be divided into the following sections:
• Budgets
• Monthly bank reconciliations with backups for all inflows and outflows
• Fundraising event summaries
2. For all spend (outflows), original receipts must be accompanied for every reimbursement made. I have receipts for all reimbursements kept at my home, as was done by my predecessors before me. I will put these receipts in binders along with bank reconciliations going forward and keep them at the school. Anyone wishing to inspect or audit them will be able to do so at any time.
3. All fundraising initiatives will have summaries in the PAC binder
I will get this year’s binder underway so that it is available to everyone by the next PAC meeting. For previous years, I will have that done by the end of this school year……
As for the direct drive, funds have been managed by the school. As PAC has minimal involvement, I suggest the following:
• School collects, deposits, and disburses funds
• School dictates when purchases are made
• PAC reconciles the fund account
1. Fund information is given to PAC
2. Treasurer gets all purchase orders and invoices
3. Treasurer sets up shared Google sheet for Direct Drive
4. Treasurer updates fund information on Google sheet based on invoices from purchases
5. Fund backups and records are kept at the school in BINDER (as mentioned above)
Transparency can be achieved through proper process. Segregation of pertinent key functions is key. Duties between the approver of transactions (admin) and the record keeper (the treasurer) will achieve this. Deposit slips and original invoices will be used as the recording instruments for this account. This way, the integrity of the fund will be upheld.
Barb Lee – Motions for Financial Transparency in Direct Drive Funds
1. No new Direct Drive Appeal is to be sent out to parent until at least 75% of the Direct Drive funds have been spent from the previous Direct Drive, unless, the Direct Drive consists of a single large purchase item like playground equipment.
2. Admin/Principal will provide receipts for how parent Direct Drive funds have been spent and these are to be made available for any PAC member requesting to see these receipts. No other documentation is acceptable and receipts must be given to PAC within 2 months of spending these funds.
3. All PAC members requesting to see Direct Drive receipts will be treated in a safe and professional manner when making these types of requests and any follow up requests. PAC execs must make best efforts to obtain these requested receipts from Principal/Admin to show PAC members within 2 months of purchases.
6. REPORTS
● Committee or project leads
< in light of the heavy agenda, committees will submit written reports (Attached)if time permits, we will review reports in meeting >

APPENDIX
WRITTEN REPORTS
FUNDRAISING & VOLUNTEERS (Charis Broadbent)
No funds have yet been spent from Direct Drive – targets have been set and Admin will begin ordering after Spring Break. Bank statement confirming balance provided to Fundraising Chair, Receipts will be provided to PAC Treasurer upon purchase. Our meat fundraiser was a success. We raised over $150 and it was effortless. Thanks for all those that supported this.
We will be doing Family Portraits April 19, 20 and 21 from 4-8pm. The cost is $20 and the family will get a 8×10 photo of their choosing printed.
Pizza Days are coming up April, May, June. We are in need of volunteers. Please sign up in the lunchroom or email Charis.
I will have totals for Purdys, Gift Cards and Subway at the next meeting.
CARNIVAL (Keelan Simurda)
Fraser Amusements called on Wednesday, March 2nd to inform me that they had double booked our event and are not available on Friday, June 10th. Their availability for May and June is now very limited so I sat down with admin on Thursday, March 3rd to discuss the schools availability and match a date.
The NEW Carnival date is: Thursday, June 9th and it will run from 3-7pm.
GARDEN UPDATE (Valeria Kao)
• Toyota Evergreen Learning Grounds Grant: Due Mar 28. We will request funds to go towards further expansion of the Food Garden, building of the compost bin, and modification part of the Native Plants Garden to grow more berry plants such as blueberries/raspberries/Saskatoon Berries.
• Greenest City Neighbourhood Small Grant: Due Apr 14. Mary and Val will be co-applicants for this grant of up to $1,000.
• Farm to Cafeteria, Whole Kids Foundation, and Farm to School BC’s Grant available for up to $10,000 for a SALAD BAR PROGRAM in school. After looking into it in more detail, we have concluded that we will be unable to apply at this time. The “Lead Applicant” has to have the authority to make decisions at the school, so must be the Principal or Vice-Principal. We also need to share some space in the lunchroom kitchen, and Gilda feels that there is inadequate space to share.
• Garden Club: Starting soon on Thursdays during the noon hour. All students welcome to participate. Ivy Chang, Mark Warkentin and Val will lead the students in fun garden activities including building trellises and making garden signage with tiles.
• SPEC Workshops: 8 classes participating in a set of 3 workshops (1. outdoor planting cool weather crops, 2. indoor seeding warm weather crops, 3. transplanting seedlings) startingMar 8 with Nikoo plus a Harvest Festival June 16. Cost of $8 per student funded by parents of the participating students.
• New Food Garden Boxes signup (total of 12 boxes): 13 different classes will be using the boxes in addition to the KIPPERS and Garden Club.
• Growing Chefs: Ms Liang’s grade 3 class and Ms Paris’s grade 1 class are participating in this excellent and very popular program. PAC provided the funds for Ms Paris’s class last year, and both Ms Paris and Ms Liang are requesting PAC to fund the program again this year. The cost of $400 per class is highly subsidized by the program’s other sources of funding. Funds are available in the garden account if needed.
TRAFFIC REPORT (Edna Aguinaga)
o HasteBC in contact with school Admin and PAC. Review of 2013 study, confirmation of next steps to be scheduled before mid March
COMMUNICATIONS (Janisha Haywood)
Updated blog to include agendas and minutes from this school year. The side link to them now works. Online volunteer form wasn’t working so it now says to email norquaypacteam or sign up in lunchroom.
MLAC REPORT (Barb Lee):
• There has been no EMB meeting with Principal and no dates have been provided.
• EMB Survey has been sent out to all EMB parents regarding high school options – due March
• There are some serious concerns regarding the wording of some of these questions and answers on the survey and the apparent lack of commitment by VSB to implement EMB high school program.
DPAC REPORT (Barb Lee):
• Attended PAN and PEN Public Education Event – Feb. 24/16 – Advocating for more funding for Public Schools
• Attended DPAC Meeting – Feb. 25/16
o Issue of Receipts was raised and DPAC confirmed that parents have a right to see receipts of items purchased with parent donated funds.
o all DPAC Exec positions have been filled
o DPAC support part of Fraser Ballantyne’s motion to support increasing distance of marijuana dispensary from any school from 300m to 500m
o City wide meeting planned for April 7 at VSB
• Attended Parent Advocacy Network meeting – Mar. 1/16 – Long Range Facility Plan – there will be 5 workshops, drop-ins, etc. planned around the city, there will also be opportunities for meetings and outreach in different languages – Mandarin, Cantonese, Punjabi, Tagalog
• Attended MLAC – Modern Language Advisory Committee – Meeting Notes:
o EMB and High School
o Will Norquay’s EMB merge with Jamieson’s Late Mandarin like Early French and Late French do?
Unlikely to merge with Jamieson, mainly because of lack of space at Hamber and they are up for seismic upgrading soon.
o Or will Norquay’s EMB continue on its own track and if yes, will there be opportunity for students outside EMB to challenge and join our students to strengthen the numbers in our program? Who and how are these two points determined?
Jamieson has second round of intake at Gr. 5 & 6, this may be possible for Norquay as the intake at Kindergarten and Gr. 1 is only 22 and 24, so even with a small attrition rate, there will likely only about 20 students by grade 6/7
Grade 8 would also be a natual entry point for EMB intake to strengthen numbers if students have the proficiency
There is a large natural demographic of Mandarin speakers that could join the program, and there could be an increase in numbers as opposed to the French Immersion drop out rate
o Parents want to know when a secondary school site will be confirmed and we do not want this decision to fall between the cracks while the Long Range Facility Plan is being worked on.
It will likely be determined by Gr. 6 for oldest EMB students – 2016/17, closer to existing site as there will likely be more parents unwilling to drive to other side of the city for the EMB program
VSB knows where most EMB parents live and this will be a big consideration
o Is MLAC coming up with recommendation/answers to these questions that will be presented to Committee III? If not then who is in charge or leading these discussions about EMB high school options?
MLAC discusses issues brings them up at different committee, smaller VSB meetings
Parents if they feel they have something to present to Committee III, can ask to be speaker on the list
There will be an EMB Parent survey sent home to gage what the enrollment might be for EMB high school program
Discussion regarding the HR testing of potential EMB teachers before hiring,
o OTHER MLAC agenda items:
o · SFU Updates
o Kim from SFU – outlined some bootcamps and retreats for Core French teachers to improve French
o For those that don’t speak French or Speak very little
o Outlined different programs available for teachers and student teachers
• UBC Updates
o Mieka brought materials and outline of the different courses available for French Immersion and Second Language teaching courses available (see handout)
o UBC is looking making the Foundation of Teaching Modern Language a summer institute series as it may increase enrollment
o There was a discussion that there is a great lack of qualified French Immersion and core French teachers, recruiting is being done in Quebec
• Curriculum Redesign (the process VSB is taking)
o Brief discussion of Competency vs. Content learning and that hopefully after the 2 Pro-D Days to see what additional supports are needed for implementation
o Comment that some teachers feel they are already doing the new curriculum, but may not be the case, may need more time.
o
• Introducing a new language to the VSB
o VSB has been approached by 2 parent groups wanted to introduce 2 new languages into the high schools as a second Language option – one is Tagalog
o There is a process and group is working through process with school board
• CPF
o Mandate is to promote French language and ensure Quality and Access of programs in French
o Canadian Parents for French is trying to get more active in the Vancouver area
o Suggestion that some of the FI students Vancouver is graduating should be recruited into Education program to fill the FI teacher shortage.
o Discussed some reasons for attrition at high school levelReassessing Rudolph Timothy M. Rohan, Kazi K. Ashraf, Lizabeth Cohen, Brian Goldstein, Pat Kirkham, Tom Tredway, Sylvia Lavin, Réjean Legault, Louis Martin, Eric Mumford, Ken Tadashi Oshima, Eeva-Liisa Pelkonen, Emmanuel J. Petit

Little sweet angel, have a wonderful birthday and run wild girl.
You have taught many that life has no obstacles. You lived your life with your family as everyone should. You took each day as a new day. You had the greatest family anyone could ever ask for. You touched their hearts and in turn, they touched ours with your stories and pictures. You are forever in my heart and I can imagine you are free and can ‘see’ where you are and are with your family in heaven. You are blessed and have blessed us as anyone that has followed you has been kissed by you.
Thank you to Irene and your family for what you do; please keep going, if not for yourselves, but in memory of Belle. She knows that every one of her fur brothers and sisters are in the most loving family they can be in. You are one of a kind and have the best heart, Irene.
I love you Little Belle. Run wild and free and enjoy your birthday and every day, our littlest love!

Joints are the area where bones connect, and when joints become inflamed this creates what is known as arthritis. There are more than 100 ways in which arthritis can express itself. It is very important that you treat arthritis in time. If not, the cartilage, which protects the joints for soft movement, absorbing impact and contusions, or pressure while walking, becomes worn and degraded. If your cartilage starts to weaken or fail, the bones will start to rub each other. This will cause a series of symptoms, like swelling, pain, redness, and stiff joints.
If your joints become inflamed and hurt, several causes could be at fault, like a bone fracture, virus or bacterial infection, an autoimmune disease (the body erroneously attacks healthy tissue), or worn out joints.
Primary Cause of Arthritis
One of the deepest causes of arthritis is related to severe nutritional deficiencies, combined with stress. If the body does not absorb or have the appropriate nutrients, it will start to wear down.
Treatment with Enzymatic Oils to Repair Tissues
Generally, arthritis symptoms, like pain, disappear the moment the cause disappears. But when this doesn’t happen, you have chronic arthritis. In order to help the body recover its balance, regardless of the cause or the arthritis, the body will need to remove the waste and toxins that are circulating through the blood, and which are lodged in the intestines.
Cold pressed, or extra-virgin oils are not heated, and therefore preserve their nutritive, healing, and enzymatic properties. These oils retain vitamins A, D and E, which combined with enzyme strength, help complete body repair.
These oils provide the following qualities:
- They contain a very effective healing strength. They have the same enzymatic strength that raw foods do, helping the body to create a very effective healing environment to heal the joints, reduce inflammation, and drain toxic waste from the body.
- They help correct metabolic disorders and disturbances to the system affected by arthritis. The enzymes in virgin oils help the arthritic individual’s body to re-organize, restoring vitality to vital organs.
- Improve the body’s digestive ability to better absorb nutrients consumed in foods, which take part in tissue and new cell regeneration.
- Stabilize the metabolism.
- Help promote tissue healing, especially collagen (cement-like substance in the body, pertaining to bones and marrow), to help joint rigidity dissipate, leading to natural healing.
Which Enzymatic Oils are Recommended to Cure Arthritis?
Oil from walnuts, olives, avocados, beans, sunflower and sesame seeds, etc., are rich in vitamins and enzymes. Bur remember, they must be unrefined, extracted or cold-pressed, or extra-virgin. This means that the oil hasn’t been heated, which preserves nutrients.
Diet:
You should include cold-pressed oils in your diet in different ways. If you combine extra-virgin oils with raw vegetables, you will undoubtedly notice a quick, even surprising recovery. We recommend you start taking two tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil a day, then drink a glass of warm water with the juice from half a lemon. This will help cleanse the body and will begin tissue and cartilage repairs. You should also eat salads throughout the day with avocado or sesame oil, or directly add whichever seed contains the natural oil. Your diet should be essentially raw, and avoid cow’s milk in any form, refined flour and sugar, and red meat.
Cold-pressed Wheat Germ Oil
It is very important that you include this oil in your diet, which is considered to be one of the more effective remedies for treating arthritis. You can dress your salads with it, or rub it on your hands or the inflamed area of your body. Once your rub the oil on your hands or body, wrap the area up with plastic gloves or a towel dipped in warm water. Let the oil’s properties sink into your skin. This can help reduce pain and inflammation.

The best time of the cycle to do a breast self-exam
Author: Carmen Lorenzana / Menstrual Educator and Coach / @carlorenzana
October was the Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Everyone talks about how important it is to do a regular self-exam to have a timely diagnosis, but do you know the best time in the cycle to explore your boobs?
Your boobs change with your cycle.
Like many other things in your body, your breasts change during your menstrual cycle—this is thanks to the estrogen-progesterone super duo.
Read our article on understanding your menstrual cycle to learn more about these two hormones.
Your reproductive hormones make your breasts more sensitive, thicker, and lumpier at certain times in the cycle. For this reason, it not only matters how you do a self-exam but in what phase of your cycle you do it.
Here's how your breasts change phase by phase:
Pre-ovulatory phase:
At the beginning of the pre-ovulatory phase, your ovaries produce estrogen, but progesterone levels are low. Progesterone is responsible for some of the changes in your boobs (more on this below). Since this hormone is absent in the pre-ovulatory phase, not much happens to the breasts and nipples at this point in the cycle, making it the best time to perform a self-exam.
Ovulatory phase:
Estrogen continues to increase, causing breast ducts to grow. In this phase, your body prepares for a possible pregnancy; the number of progesterone receptors in your breasts increases and the alveoli (the small sacs that drain milk to the nipple) multiply. All this makes your breasts look bigger and firmer these days.
This is not a good time for self-examination, as the increase in size can hide certain lumps that could be a warning sign.
Premenstrual phase:
Right after ovulation, your ovaries produce progesterone, which can cause tenderness, swelling, and inflammation in your boobs.
Before your period, it's common to notice changes in texture and feel small lumps. According to Dr. Jerilynn C. Prior, founder of the Center for Menstrual Cycle and Ovulation Research (CeMCOR), finding a lump during this phase isn't necessarily dangerous. Most of the time, an imbalance of estrogen dominance without enough progesterone produces cysts (round balls filled with fluid) or clumps of growing tissue that feel sore when you touch them.
Menstrual phase:
Once your period arrives, your hormone levels drop, and your boobs slowly return to their normal size. However, it's not a good time for a self-exam since your breasts and nipples can still be tender during these days.
In a nutshell, the best time to check your boobs is one week after your period starts, when your breasts are least likely to be swollen or tender.
What to look for in a breast self-exam
It's not just about how your boobs feel but also about how they look.
The symptoms and signs to look for are nipple discharge, lumps, and thickening; changes in size, shape, or skin texture (wrinkles or dimples); rash, crusts, or changes in the direction of the nipples; swelling in the armpit or around the collarbone; redness or warmth; and growing veins.
Remember to write down your observations, including the date of your last period and when you performed the self-exam. If you observe any of the signs above, talk to your medical practitioner as soon as possible.

What if I don't have a cycle?
It's quite important that you do a monthly self-examination, even if you don't have a cycle due to health reasons, hormonal contraception, or menopause. If this is your case, choose the same day each month for your boobs check-in.
One last note
Please remember that a self-exam is not a measure to prevent breast cancer, nor the only thing needed to diagnose it. However, it can make a massive difference between having an early detection or not.
Touching and observing your boobs month after month will help you get familiar with what's normal and alert you when persistent changes don't come and go with your menstrual cycle.

The End of 2015
An eventful year for me. I’ve been through such huge changes in my life, but I’m looking forward to the end of 2015 and the start of a New Year. It always feels shiny and bright.
So here we are at the start of 2016. I started 2015 thinking I’d have my teeth whitened and I’m ending the year hoping that I only lose one. The aggressive gum disease with which I was diagnosed in the middle of the year is showing no signs of making a dramatic improvement. Is it genetic or is it because I took a couple of whacks as a teenager? Who knows? Hey ho. We are where we are.
Career Change
I took voluntary redundancy from my long-term career at the end of August. I’d wanted that for some time, and I still think it was the right decision. A bit scary, and I’ve been busier in the last few months than I have been for a long time, but, actually, I’m loving it. It’s a massive learning curve, doing all the things I’m trying to do, but it’s amazing.
I love writing and I’d love to make my living from that, but I’m not there yet. However, I can do it alongside all the other things I’m doing. I have a novel and a few non-fiction books on the go. The plan is to get at least one published in the next few months.
I started a life coaching course in September, as well as an NLP practitioners course. I am so glad I did, because these have both inspired me to move ahead with all sorts of things in my life. Things that I have been trying to move on with and just haven’t been able to.
I’ve set up my own business – an HR Consultancy – and the coaching will fit in nicely with that when I qualify in the first half of 2016.
Sad Things
My dear friend Kate’s mum passed away in October. Such a huge loss for her, and me too. I can’t say much more about that. That was compounded by the loss of Kate’s cat, dear little Tigger, earlier in the year. Poor Kate and Geoff have had more than their share of bereavements this year, as has my friend whom you know affectionately as Hot Chocolate. Rest in peace Shaq and Lorna.
I’ve had dreadful problems with my two-year-old boiler – to the point that I am so grateful it hasn’t been cold because I’ve had no central heating. And a problem with my conservatory – water seeping up through the floor – which is in danger of becoming litigious. I can’t say more about either of those at the moment, in case I do end up in court.
So that’s the end of 2015 in a nutshell. I’m excited about 2016, and wish everybody the very best for the new year!

They might be the direct descendants of wolves, but over centuries, they have evolved to become our best friend and thrive with human company. While they originated from wolves, dogs are now totally domesticated. They give you unconditional love, and are always by your side through good times and bad. Another thing about them is their natural ability to crack us up.
They might be huge and look scary, but they will always be little clowns on the inside. They can get up to some hilarious antics and surprise us in the most unexpected and hilarious ways! They can be the biggest goofballs in the world, and there are millions of videos on the internet to prove it. If you have a dog of your own, you know how peculiar they can be sometimes!
The boxer in this video is a perfect example. He had spotted a feather stuck on a window. While it may not seem like a big deal, this dog looked very concerned about it. He is alarmed by the feather’s movements—he can’t figure out how it is moving on its own! The wind was blowing it, but the boxer had no idea. Finally, he gathers up the courage to poke it with his paw, but he wasn’t ready when the feathers breaks free from the window!
After watching this, you can’t help but laugh! Bless this guy’s soul!

All this had initially sparked the terror that the show could even be canceled, also because of the difficulty of the wrestlers to reach the building.
So it will not be. This was confirmed by the Twitter account of the Vivint Arena, home of the NBA Utah Jazz and precisely the venue of the episode of Raw which will be held regularly, with the starting time set for 17:30 local time:
And surely WWE has already launched alternative plans after the inconveniences of these hours, as demonstrated by announcing two matches for the evening:

In a typical day, we can get in a lot of practice honing our profiling skills.
For me, most specifically, I so crave to have a complete profile of my 6½ month-old puppy, Yodel. He is an Entlebucher mix, a breed of Swiss Mountain Dog. On a daily and sometimes hourly basis, I am trying to figure out how he will best process the information (i.e., commands) I give him. Usually a treat will seal the deal; but only if its been given for the same command many times and over many weeks or months.
The same consistency over time is necessary to build those client relationships, too. We know they will be more intent to listen if you always lead with some sort of enticement (better sales, save money, the occasional lunch).
Outside of the treat strategy, you just have to learn how to elicit the behaviors that you want in the end. Discussions can always be friendly with your client but certain topics are likely to cause stress and strife. Maybe it’s sales or budget, technology, an element of the business that is undergoing a restructure of some kind. It could be anything but the discussion has to happen and a decision made. How you package the information will make all the difference, whether it be a soft lead-up to the issue, or the hard and fast bullets of the situation, or something in between. I’ve tried versions of these scenarios with Yodel. He doesn’t like the hard and fast bullets so much since they usually accompany a raised voice. So I keep refining my approach, and I would like to believe he is starting to like me after all these months(!) If only I realized sooner that I could have applied my profiling skills to puppy rearing.Eaton, Joseph
Eaton, Joseph a veteran Baptist minister, was born at Wells, Maine, June 22, 1743. He was converted at the age of twenty-two, licensed to preach in 1793, and in 1798 was ordained pastor of the Church in Wells, the service being performed in Berwick. After his resignation, in 1820, Mr. Eaton was engaged for several years in evangelistic labors in the section of the country in which he lived. His death took place in December 1831. See Millett, History of the Baptists in Maine, page 442. (J.C.S.)Lacombe County, Alberta – The RCMP arrested a 26-year-old male following a short pursuit which occurred mid afternoon on November 27, on the QE2. The RCMP continue to investigate and charges are pending.
At 2:49 p.m., a vehicle was seen to be driving erratically on the highway and a Blackfalds RCMP officer attempted a traffic stop. The vehicle did not stop and given the dangerous driving pattern a pursuit was declared. The Ponoka Integrated Traffic Unit was deployed to assist. At 3:08 p.m., the pursuit came to an end when the vehicle drove into the east ditch and got stuck, south of Highway 12.
The male driver, and lone occupant, was taken into police custody without further incident. He is facing charges related to his driving.
During this incident, the speeds of the vehicle on the highway were between 60 – 80 km/hr. Traffic was delayed behind the police vehicles for the duration of this pursuit. The RCMP want to thank the public for their patience during this incident, and also for their consideration in giving the officers a safe pocket to work in, and manage this situation.- npglazer
Nihilism and politics as religion
Recently one of my favorite contemporary journalists, Matt Taibbi, wrote an article about how the news and politics is America's new religion and how we are as a result in a new secular "religious" war. I was only able to get half the article and read half of it for myself, but regardless, it is a very interesting article that is available for a read. I recommend reading it.
Religion is dying in America. Church attendance is down below 50 %, for the first time in our history. Since Marx, Freud, and Nietzsche, the three great atheists of the 19th and 20th centuries, that ended Christianity and religion, faith has been in a rapid decline. As someone who attends church, its very noticeable how much of the congregation is very old and how the middle aged to younger people don't often attend church anymore.
The thing is though human beings and thus human nature have not changed a lot in the last 2000 years, so we still have the same psychological and existential concerns we have always had. We are still a deeply tribal species with a need for in and out groups, who crave meaning in our lives. We want to belong and the whole cliched left/right political divide fulfills some of this need in our secular age. Religion and family can still fill the hole in the human heart for many people, but things like sports, movies, pop music, and consumerism with their vapid promises are increasingly filling our existential holes for us instead of religion and family.
Nietzsche wrote his famous "Parable of the Madman," and proclaimed loudly the Christian God of the last 2000 years is dead. Nietzsche though warned with the death of God comes a groundlessness in western society that has never been seen before. Nihilism in other words, would strike at the heart of western society. We would find anything we can to fill this existential hole because of a metaphysical groundlessness at the heart of the 20th century, and as a result we saw totalitarian Nazism arise in Germany and communism arise in the USSR.
This isn't some conservative screed to return to the 1950's though, that era was full of problems of sexism, racism and homophobia. But if we take sin to separation and estrangement, as Paul Tillich tells us, we are living in a deeply nihilistic and now sinful era, just as much as in the 1950's and if not more. In a post Fall, or post lapsarian world, I don't think a utopian paradise is possible but mindless consumerism and endless capitalism won't bring about lasting meaning to people's lives either.
Maybe a return to big B, "Being," as Martin Heidegger tells us in a post consumer, post capitalist, and post monotheistic religious fashion is the answer. Maybe that's not the answer though either, I don't really know. I do know that using the traditional left/right or Democratic/Republican paradigm won't get us very far in bringing about less separation and estrangement when looking for meaning in a nihilistic age. Thank you.

If one needed more proof of New Orleans recent elimination from the postseason, I give you exhibit A: tonight’s woeful 122-106 loss in Denver.
Three days ago, the Pelicans and Nuggets battled back and forth in a highly entertaining display of basketball for 48 minutes. Tonight was damn near just the opposite. DeMarcus Cousins was out nursing a sore Achilles, Anthony Davis decided to shoot the ball at every opportunity, regardless of his ice-cold stroke, and in general, the effort and teamwork seen for much of the season was noticeably absent.
Understanding the season has switched gears, Alvin Gentry wasn’t visibly upset in his post-game comments. He admitted the Pelicans started off with poor energy and attempted too many shots after just one or two passes, but praised them for making the game competitive at halftime.
Additionally, the head coach conceded, “We were trying to look at certain guys.”
Yep, we’ve been reminded of this exact plan several times before tonight, yet it wasn’t as evident as most would have preferred until the fourth quarter. For instance, fan favorite Cheick Diallo didn’t get into the contest until the start of the final frame. He was asked to bide his time behind Donatas Motiejunas and Alexis Ajinca, who combined for 44 reserve minutes.
Now, there is an unwritten rule that coaches in various sports will give those players who are likely to move onto another team in the offseason playing time so that they can showcase their abilities to potential future employers. However, this doesn’t mean one should keep their prized young talent on the back burner for most of a meaningless game.
Diallo made a ton of mistakes and it appeared he was reprimanded for most of them, but we all witnessed a lot of crappy play.
This possession was fun: let's leave guys wide open, not boxout an offensive rebounder and forget about help defense! pic.twitter.com/6ZOVFwych5— Oleh Kosel (@Redhopeful) April 8, 2017
In my opinion, the biggest offender on the night was Anthony Davis. If the team is in evaluation mode, why on earth did the All-Star launch 27 shots in 24 minutes? He also compounded the problem by failing to set the proper tone defensively, repeatedly demonstrating lackadaisical effort.
Jennifer Hale asked Gentry if Davis was going to play tomorrow against the Golden State Warriors and the coach said that basically he was going to leave it up to AD. Honestly, if I was the head poncho, I’d prod my best player to take the night off. It’s clear he’s checked out for the rest of the season because there’s nothing left to play for outside of adding to useless stat totals.
Quinn Cook was the other reserve most hoped to watch at length, and although he registered 24 minutes, he was really quiet until the fourth, scoring seven of his nine points during the last 12 minutes of the game. No doubt he was partially to blame, as he deferred all too often, but it didn’t help matters that Jordan Crawford took his cue from Davis: lots of quick shots accompanied by too much porous defense. It’s one thing if Crawford is in direct competition with Cook for a spot on next year’s roster, but regardless, Gentry should consider limiting their time together on the court tomorrow night. The front office has precious little evaluation time remaining before they must make a decision on Cook’s tenure.
Next to Davis’ 25 points on 27 shots and Crawford’s 20 on 16 attempts, Ajinca was the next leading scorer with 15. E’Twaun Moore, before leaving the game with an ankle injury, finished with 10 and Jrue Holiday scored nine points and dished out seven assists in 24 minutes.
On the other side of the floor, Jamal Murray had himself a night, dropping a line of 30 points, five assists and four rebounds. And no, he didn’t just relegate himself to the three-point line. Time and again he took it inside and showed off enviable athleticism including this yam over Motiejunas.
Jamal Murray on Donatas Motiejunas in slow motion, good grief man this guy aint just a shooter pic.twitter.com/aY3Sqi7Dju— Heartbroken Wob (@World_Wide_Wob) April 8, 2017
I must mention the Pelicans couldn’t make anything from behind the three-point line, knocking down just three shots out of 23 attempts. Guess it was punishment for all the lousy defense they decided to play tonight!
Anyways, we’re down to three remaining games on the schedule — hopefully they’ll be a little more pleasurable to watch.China is one of the world's largest producers of citrus fruit. Production areas are numerous and spread across the country. The honey tangerine from Xinyu is one of the most drought-resistant and cold-resistant tangerine variety in the world. Under regular weather conditions the Xinyu tangerines enter the Chinese market in large volumes between late October and early November. This year, however, weather conditions were extreme. Not only is the production volume of Xinyu tangerines smaller than usual, but the tangerines also ripen later than in previous years.
"Production areas have suffered from a series of extreme weather conditions. There was severe frost late last year, which weakened or even killed the tangerine trees. That is why the trees produced fewer flowers and flowers of lesser quality. In addition, when the flowers blossomed, the production areas suffered from rainy and overcast weather. There was not enough sunshine to stimulate photosynthesis in the leaves, and so the trees weakened even further. The amount of fruit on the trees is far from ideal." This is according to Mr. Peng of Jiangxi Woshenghui Agricultural Development Co., Ltd.
Mr. Peng continued, "these are only the problems we encountered early in the season. In the second half of the season the tangerines suffered from drought. Orchards without proper irrigation systems lost a lot of fruit due to a lack of water supply. Then there were many days of continuous rainfall. Some orchards flooded. The tangerines were swollen during the drought and then split open during the flood. All of these conditions greatly impact the average product quality of Xinyu tangerines."
The production volume declined this season. Nearly a month of drought means that the weight of individual tangerines remained below standards. In addition, high temperatures during the start of autumn affected the production volume as well. Moreover, tangerines obtain their characteristic color as a result of the difference in temperatures during the day and at night, but with the high temperatures in autumn the difference was not big enough. That is why the tangerines ripened 7-10 days later than usual.

The Met Office spokeswoman also detailed the general weather forecast for Hull and East Yorkshire for the week ahead.
She said: "As we head through tomorrow, there could be one or two showers around, but it's mostly dry with lots of sunshine and the wind will be lighter as well.
"Temperatures today, we're looking at seven or eight degrees in many areas and tomorrow has quite similar temperatures, 7-9°C, as a maximum maybe.
"But it won't feel as cold because the winds will be lighter and there'll be more sunshine.
"We're not looking at much of a risk of frost in the next few days - even though it is cold, temperatures are around average really for the time of year.
"On Tuesday, it will be another largely dry day but it'll start to get cloudier and temperatures will reach about 9°C.
"Then Wednesday, we'll start to see a spell of rain push in, so perhaps a slightly wetter day.
"From Wednesday onwards, it is cold again, but just turning progressively colder as the week goes on.
"Then, as we head into the weekend, it'll be a little bit more unsettled, so we'll have spells of rain at times and possibly some snow by the end of the week."

According to Stratistics MRC, the Global Agricultural Inoculants Market is accounted for $5.18 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach $7.94 billion by 2028 growing at a CAGR of 5.5% during the forecast period. Factors such as increasing demand for food, governmental support for advancing organic farming schemes, and growing health consciousness and concerns about environmental safety are driving the market growth. However, short shelf life of the product is hampering the growth of the market.
Agricultural inoculants mainly contain beneficial microbes which promotes plant growth by stimulating plant hormone production. These inoculants induce beneficial factors that help in delivering nutrients and suppressing diseases, thus enhancing the plant growth.
Based on the microorganism, the bacteria segment is anticipated to expand at a rapid pace during the forecast period as bacteria-based inoculants help to check pests and improve soil and crop superiority. By geography, North America is going to have high growth during the forecast period due to the faster adoption of new technologies to increase crop productivity while reducing the negative impact on the environment.
Some of the key players profiled in the Agricultural Inoculants Market include Bayer CropScience Limited, BASF SE, Dupont De Nemours and Company, Novozymes, Advanced Biological Marketing Inc, Italpollina S.P.A., BrettYoung, Queensland Agricultural Seeds Pvt Ltd, Verdesian Life Sciences LLC, Corteva Inc, Rizobacter Argentina S.A. , Soil Technologies Corporation, Precision Laboratories, and Xitebio Technologies Inc.

The Republican defeated Democrat Terry McAuliffe in the governor's race.
CNN reports that Youngkin's son tried to cast a ballot on two occasions, but was turned away.
"The young man presented identification but was ineligible to be registered due to his age and was not permitted to vote," Scott O. Konopasek, the Fairfax County General Registrar, told CNN in a statement.
Konopasek added that Youngkin's son was given a voter registration form and encouraged to vote when he became eligible.
The 17-year-old is not facing any charges because Konopasek said the teenager did not make false statements or disrupt voting.
Youngkin's campaign contends that Youngkin's son "misunderstood Virginia election law" and went on to school when he was informed he could not vote.The Further team has returned from Vegas after an amazing week of meeting so many new and old friends. It was a fantastic opportunity to finally join together (in person!!!) and share in conversations about all things sales/marketing related to our industry. We know not everyone could make the trip to SMASH, and even for those who were there with us, it was hard to choose between so many great sessions. We did our best to divide and conquer with a goal of absorbing as much of the great content as possible to share back with you.
Here were some of our favorite takeaways:
Hot Topic in Sessions: Re-thinking Your Website Experience
We heard this topic come up in several sessions and through several different lenses. The shift to the digital buyers journey had already begun, but was largely accelerated due to the pandemic. Now you have prospects who are increasingly tech-savvy and naturally inclined to begin their search for a community online. So what does this mean for your websites?
Biggest Theme in Conversations: “I’m not sure what to do, but I don’t want to be left behind”
With so many new strategies, new methods, and new technologies to consider, it's challenging for a sales and marketing team to gauge where they should invest their time and attention. In many of our conversations we heard from operators who were fearful they weren’t investing in the right solutions, fearful their competition was going to take a step ahead, or fearful that they were falling behind the curve. Questions would surface like, “should we be looking at a new CRM?”, “Do we need a new ad agency?” and “What are we missing to get more leads?”
We know this is a difficult topic as we all have the desire to improve, but sometimes its difficult to know what the best moves are.
Here’s our list of things to think about when considering new strategies, methods, or technologies:
Biggest Challenge at the Communities: Staffing.
We heard this at Argentum. And we heard it here too. The national labor shortage is placing significant pressure on our industry and the impacts can be felt in sales and marketing too. So, what can we do about it?
Our Biggest Takeaway: “We have to work smarter, cause we’re already working harder”
Embracing new solutions and technologies can seem daunting at first, but so many operators we talk with who’ve ventured down the path with us can give incredible testament to the impacts and results they’ve been able to achieve since deploying solutions like ours. Using technology to provide improved experiences all while automating tasks your team used to take on seems like a “too good to be true” offer. But as we saw on display at SMASH, there are a number of thriving companies who’ve built solutions that do just that. From automated conversational engagement, reputation management, crm solutions and more - there are so many tools available to you. Deploying these solutions with the key integrations to help them work together will help you save time, expand your sales capacity, and achieve greater results.
Your plate was full 5 years ago, and it’s been overflowing ever since with the addition of so many new responsibilities digital has brought to your plate. We encourage everyone to fight digital duress with digital opportunity, and embrace new solutions that help you automate, improve, and ultimately focus on what matters most.
There so much more we could list here after a great few days together. But, we’d love to hear from you! What were your big takeaways? What was something new you heard, learned, or saw? What made the most impact for you? We’d love to know!
Until next year, here’s hoping we see you in Vegas! (I’m sure we’ll all meet up in line at the Lucky Penny for lunch )2-piece set. Stoneware dip bowl features debossed sentiment and rim groove to hold included wood spreader.

Oscar Nominations Will Be Viewed Through 'MeToo' Lens
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
OK, some big news here in LA this morning - the nominations for the 90th Academy Awards were announced in Beverly Hills, Calif. And the supernatural romance "The Shape Of Water" swept the nominations, earning 13 in all.
(SOUNDBITE OF ALEXANDRE DESPLAT'S "THE SHAPE OF WATER")
GREENE: Yes, that's the theme from the movie we're hearing there. That music is a great way to segue to NPR arts correspondent Mandalit del Barco, who is covering a lot of film news. She's in Park City, Utah, for the Sundance Film Festival - news there, news here in LA. Hi, Mandalit, how are you.
MANDALIT DEL BARCO, BYLINE: Good morning, David.
GREENE: Well, before we get to "The Shape Of Water," some history made this morning, right?
DEL BARCO: That's right. You know, this year's nominees include Rachel Morrison, the cinematographer also known as the director of photography for "Mudbound." And this morning, she became the first woman in the history of the Academy Awards to earn a nomination in this category. The first woman - and we're at number 90 this year. Other notable nominations are Greta Gerwig as best director for "Lady Bird." A woman has only won best director one other time. That was Kathryn Bigelow in 2010 for "The Hurt Locker." And Jordan Peele will compete against her and others for his work on "Get Out," making him just the fifth black man nominated in this category. And, David, you might be shocked to learn that Meryl Streep was nominated for her role as Katharine Graham in "The Post." That's really a big shocker, right?
GREENE: Not so shocking, everyone expected that - but what a performance - and could be some groundbreaking groundbreaking wins this year at the Oscars. Well, let's get back to "Shape Of Water" - 13 nominations. I mean, and that's for a movie on a pretty shoestring budget - right? - just under $20 million to make this.
DEL BARCO: Yes, exactly. And, you know, this is the first nomination for Guillermo del Toro since 2007 when he was nominated for "Pan's Labyrinth." And his lead actors in "The Shape Of Water" are also nominated in the best actor categories. And Guillermo del Toro could join his friends, fellow Mexican directors Alfonso Cuaron and Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu who won the top Oscars in the past few years for their films "Gravity," "Birdman" and "The Revenant." And, David, it could be a big win for Mexico if "Coco" wins as best animated feature. It was a love letter to Mexico and the Day of the Dead holiday. It's catchy song "Remember Me" is also up for best song.
GREENE: And we should say though. "Shape Of Water" getting all of these nominations - getting the most nominations does not necessarily mean that you win best picture. So what other films are competing for that category?
DEL BARCO: Well, that category could go up to 10 pictures. But there were nine nominations this year. And that included "Call Me By Your Name," "Darkest Hour," "Dunkirk." We have "Get Out" and "Lady Bird," "Phantom Thread," "The Post" - of course, "Shape Of Water," like you said, and "Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri."
GREENE: A big list - and we should say before I let you go. You're in Park City covering Sundance. And isn't often - Sundance is often a preview for what movies might get to the Oscars, right? So there might be some familiar titles here for you.
DEL BARCO: Yes, last year, the horror film "Get Out" was a secret midnight premiere here - the hottest ticket in town. "The Big Sick" was a film at this festival as was "Call Me By Your Name" and "Mudbound" and three of the documentary nominations. So, David, I'm now off to see a few more movies that we might be talking about this time next year.
GREENE: You go do that. NPR arts correspondent Mandalit del Barco joining us from member station KPCW in Park City, Utah - thanks, Mandalit.
DEL BARCO: You're welcome, David.

Earlier reports identified the victim as a 9-year-old boy, but the medical examiner’s office confirmed his age at the time of his death to be eight, KTRK reported.
Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez confirmed via Twitter just after 8 p.m. Tuesday that the mother’s boyfriend, identified as 31-year-old Brian Coulter, is accused of killing the boy in 2020.
The boys’ mother, 35-year-old Gloria Williams, is charged with injury to a child by omission and tampering with evidence (human corpse), KHOU reported.
Gonzalez initially stated that Williams was charged with failure to provide medical care and failure to provide adequate supervision, but those charges were revised, the TV station reported.
Both Williams and Coulter could face additional charges, Gonzalez said.
Investigators confirmed on Monday that the call placed Sunday prompting a welfare check at the apartment complex was placed by the oldest sibling, a 15-year-old boy who had been caring for his 7- and 10-year-old brothers, alongside the remains of their 8-year-old sibling, who had been dead for about a year.

Deputies found the 8-year-old’s skeletal remains under a blanket, KTRK reported.
According to the TV station, investigators believe that Coulter beat the boy to death and then he and Williams moved out, leaving the children to fend for themselves as their brother’s body decomposed.
The 15-year-old told deputies that they had not seen their mother in months, yet the couple had been living in an apartment about 15 minutes away, KTRK reported.
According to the sheriff’s office, all three boys were taken to an area hospital, where doctors determined they were malnourished with injuries. The 7-year-old had facial fractures that will require surgery, the TV station reported.
In a statement issued Monday morning, Child Protective Services confirmed that the agency is seeking emergency custody of all three children and that while the family had a history with CPS, there was no active investigation when the boys were found.

Few factors influence hospitals’ Medicare revenue as much as their Medicare area wage index – the small adjustment to Medicare payments that has a large impact on hospital finances. Hospitals that believe they are classified unfairly may apply for reclassification.
The decision to pursue reclassification begins with data. Medicare has specific criteria for reclassification. Do you qualify? Do you believe other hospitals near you have a more advantageous classification? If you qualify for reclassification, do you have more than one option? If you do, which is the best option for your hospital?
The answers to these and other questions can be found in data, and DeBrunner & Associates has a great deal of experience helping hospitals pursue Medicare wage index reclassification. Even if you wish to pursue reclassification independently, without our guidance, you still need data – data that DeBrunner & Associates can generate to ensure that you qualify for reclassification; to ensure that you are pursuing the most lucrative reclassification possible for your hospital; and to ensure that your reclassification application has the data it needs to support a successful bid for reclassification.Hi,

Eventide AudioQ: What is the width of the cockpit?
A: The interior width of the Falco fuselage is 40" at the inside of the canopy tracks and about 42" at the shoulders.
Q: What is the hardest part of building a Falco?
A: Getting started. Just cutting that first piece of wood, getting into the swing of it, and developing a sense of confidence in your ability is often the worst of it. Many people are intimidated by taking the first step, but building an airplane is like climbing a mountain. You just take it one step at a time.
Q: What is the feasibility of making your own parts?
A: Making your own wood parts is very time-consuming but not difficult, and people who do it find that they are 'working' for about a $1.00 an hour when they look at the cost of the kits they could have bought. There are many metal parts (hinges, fittings, etc.) that can be made with a bandsaw, drill press and a file, but there are also many components that are beyond the ability of the average builder because they require machining and welding.
Q: How long does it take to build a Falco?
A: As you may know, claims of quick building times by kit manufacturers are notoriously optimistic and sometimed downright dishonest (much like speed claims). There is no such thing as an instant airplane, and all kit airplanes take a lot of time.
A typical kitplane in the hands of an average builder takes 2,500 to 3,500 hours to build. For most people, that stretches over a period of four to six years. This would apply to all kit airplanes--Glasair, Lancair, LongEze, Christen Eagle, RV-6, or Falco. Every kit manufacturer would like you to believe you can build their airplane in 800 hours, but it just ain't so.
Q:I plan to start construction but the place where I live (Puerto
Rico) is extremely humid and termite damage to wood is very common.
How resistant to termite damage is the wood used in the Falco?
A: Ah, the 'termite' question. Easy asnswer: It's nothing to worry about at all. Termites live in the ground and they are blind. They create tunnels of mud up to wood in buildings, but they aren't going to be able to get to a Falco.
Q: How good is the Falco in adverse weather conditions, specifically
heavy rain?
A: Typically, a Falco is built with epoxy or polyurethane coatings on the wood, so the wood is very, very well protected. The epoxies that we use were developed for use on wooden boats, which sit in the water, and Falcos are only rained on from time to time or fly through rain.
Anyone who builds a Falco will treat it like a member of the family, so the idea of leaving the airplane out in the open all year long is something no Falco builder or owner would ever consider.
We will also mention that sometimes people in 'humid' climates worry about an airplane just turning into rotten wood. The airplane will stabilize to a moisture content that is much lower than you would think. Stored in a hangar or under a roof, the wood will stabilize to the same moisture content that you have in the furniture of any unheated house. So if furniture doesn't have a problem, neither will the Falco.
Q: How good is the Falco as an IFR airplane?
A: Some people say a good IFR airplane is one that will go where you want to when you want to. The Falco is this type of plane.
Other people say a good IFR airplane is one that you can sit back, eat a sandwich, read and map and the airplane will happily keep flying with almost no attention. The Cessna 172 or 182 is this type of airplane, and the Falco is definitely not this type. It is very maneuverable, a lot of fun to fly, but it will not fly straight and level without attention.
But the answer is to get a single-axis autopilot and then the Falco becomes a rock-solid IFR airplane with the flick of a switch. This is what you would want to do, and it's what all Falco pilots do, except for the few 'real men', expert pilots and ex-military types.Over the weekend a comedian's video sent shockwaves through the YouTube community and blogosphere, and elicited outrage and response videos by the dozens. "Dear Fat People," by Nicole Arbour was published under the guise of satire, but is coming under heavy fire for its offensive comments, body shaming, and harmful language. Some of the world's most iconic comedians have provoked us with their wit, pushed us to reexamine our beliefs, and progressed social change — Nicole's video however, is just plain mean.
Throughout the past several years, the body positivity movement has grown online to become a welcoming, inclusionary place for body diversity and self-expression. Instagram users have united under hashtags, creating a safe space and offering encouragement to anyone who seeks it. These supportive communities are necessary, as anyone who has experienced body shaming online or in person can attest. Nicole says in the video that “fat shaming is not a thing” and discounts this very real thing as simply made up by "fat people." She attempts to bolster her jokes with commentary about health, wellness, and obesity, but her words are harsh, unnecessarily cruel, and do nothing to aid the thousands of people — small and large — who are who struggling with body issues.
“Dear Fat People” has created divisive conversations between those in support of Nicole and those (including us) offended by her video, but through this commentary amazing stories have emerged. People are openly sharing their journeys with body image, weight, and wellness. Some of YouTube’s biggest voices such as Grace Helbig and Tyler Oakley have openly condemned the video and shared messages of support for all bodies, no matter the size. Meghan Tonjes shared a particularly emotional response:
In it she says: “It’s so easy to go after fat people, because it takes a lot of time and energy and effort to view people as people. To view them as well, fully-formed people that you have to get to know and it’s not so easy to put people in a box of good and bad. And to look at someone and just think that you know everything they’ve ever gone through, where they are with their body, or their relationship with their body…”
Grace Helbig’s response touched on kindness, understanding, and the fundamentals of comedy:
“Comedy can be a really powerful tool, and I wish that we could use it more respectfully. I wish that we could just respect people as human beings, that’s really something I wish. Hey, we’re all just trying to get by. We’re all doing life as best we can, and that’s all you can do is try to be the best version of yourself.”
Mel Hartsell, a social worker, took to Medium to share her personal experiences and insights, saying, “You are a human. Your body is as amazing and miraculous as every other body. You should never feel that your hills and valleys and tiger stripes are less than anyone else’s unique make-up. Fat-shaming is real, and it gets really ugly sometimes, but you are real too. And deserve so much more.”
We’re all on our own journey, and along that path we encounter different types of motivation, support, and roadblocks. In the words of Grace Helbig, “We’re all just trying to do the best we can.” When times are tough, seek out those who inspire you to be your best, feel your best, and do your best. The rest, and in this instance Nicole Arbour, is just noise.

Satisfied customer
From: Doris Dixon
"Walking into the Tabrizi store in Bedford,NS was like walking into Disneyland for carpets. The sales people were very helpful, the gentleman who serviced me, Mr. Maher Ghazzawi, was knowledgeable and professional. He showed me several carpets and with his help and patience I was able to select one that looks lovely in our home. I will definitely go back. Thank you Maher."
A memorable experience!
From: Mark & Emily
"The moment that we walked into the store, we were greeted by a very friendly and knowledgeable rugologist by the name of Maher. It was clear that he has a passion for rugs and their histories. He took the time to get to know our tastes and showed us many rugs until we selected the ideal one for us. It was the most entertaining and enjoyable rug shopping experience we've ever had! We will definitely return for our next rug purchase. Thank you Maher - you made our day!"
Splendid service!
From: Dr. Patrick J Thompson
"Very rewarding. With the help of the "Rugologist", we selected a most attractive rug, which completely suits our room and decor. The rug was delivered to our home, and fitted to the underlay. Many thanks for excellent service, and a very favourable price!"
Beautiful Rugs!
From: Jo-Ann and Darrell
"We have driven by this store so many times, always meaning to stop in. We finally made time and went in on Sunday. We just knew we'd find what we were looking for. We had an idea in mind and found the perfect rug for our living room. The only hard decision was which one to choose! We picked out a beautiful rug and got a fantastic deal. Lots of beautiful Rugs, we will certainly be back for more. We've already recommended Tabrizi Rugs to our friends and family. Thanks Jafar!"
Love, love, love my rug!
From: Janet
"I love, love, love my rug! Thanks to the folks at Tabrizi, I am now the proud owner of a beautiful wool rug. It took several weeks to find the perfect rug for my home but with the excellent customer service Maher, Jeff, and Mitchell provided, it finally happened. Because I wanted the perfect rug, I took time to find it but the staff remained patient with me and provided great advice/input. I highly recommend Tabrizi if you are looking to invest in a rug that will last a lifetime. Thank you Maher (The Rugologist), Jeff, and Mitchell."
Amazing Store!
From: Linda R

One-Stop Rug Shop!
From: Rhonda
"Being new to the area, I was unaware of Tabrizi on Bedford Highway. A friend of mine recommended checking out the rugs at this location to match a very odd color from our bedroom comforter. I cannot be any more impressed with the knowledge, friendliness, and fair prices at this successful business. I was treated like a valued customer, even if I wasn't' looking to buy a $1000. rug. There is absolutely no reason to shop around for rugs anywhere in HRM....cause all you're looking for is right inside! Highly recommended!"
The best of the best!
From: Alison McCrea
" Tabrizi Rugs is truly the best place in the Maritimes to purchase rugs! Maher, "The Rugologist" was a pleasure to deal with. Maher is an example of examplary customer service. What a delight! The selection and quality of rugs is outstanding. Thank you for helping us find the perfect choices. "
Great service, great price!
From: Jennifer Beamer
"We needed a new rug for the living room and I really thought we could only afford one from a big box store, but decided to check out Tabrizi anyway. I was pleasantly surprised at the selection of affordable rugs and we left with a fantastic rug within our budget. The customer service was also great - even though we were spending hundreds, not thousands of dollars. It felt like they valued each and every customer regardless of size. We have now gone back and bought the matching stair runner. I've definitely recommended this place to other...

"Yesterday, I purchased my third rug from Tabrizi. Walking into the store is a dream, so much to choose from, so many beautiful rugs! And the service is great! We have three young boys and they've spilled a lot on the rugs but we can always easily clean them. They still look brand new even after two years! I'm a bit obsessed, and honestly anyone who walks into my home comments on our beautiful carpets. It's so amazing that so much exoticness is right here in Bedford. I see these rugs as art that will be passed...

"From the minute my wife and I walked through the door we had a great experience. Maher was very inviting and helpful and even though we were looking for a bit of an odd size he did not give up and we eventually found exactly what we were looking for.

We will definetly be coming back!"

This was by far one of the very best shopping experiences I have had since moving here. Jeff, Maher, and the whole team were friendly, helpful, patient and very knowledgeable. Several people have already expressed the view that if you are looking for an area rug, go no further than Tabrizi Rugs.

From: Annette Bering
Hello. We are recently new to Nova Scotia and when I was seeking a retailer here that sold Persian Rugs, Tabrizi was my selection to visit. Earlier this week I made the trip from the Valley to Bedford and their location was very easy to find and I was delighted when we walked into the showroom to find such a vast selection of all types of rugs, particularly Tribal rugs of which I bought 3. My goal was to purchase one for the living room but there were so many wonderful choices I came home with 3....

Online condolences at“THE ETERNAL WEIGHT OF GLORY”
BIBLE READING: Isaiah 35-36
Isaiah’s words continue to be those of gloom and doom, due to the wickedness of the nation and the impending punishment to come at the hands of the Babylonians. God does offer a ray of hope to those that will be able to return afterward. “Strengthen the weak hands, and make firm the feeble knees. Say to those who have an anxious heart, "Be strong; fear not! Behold, your God will come with vengeance, with the recompense of God. He will come and save you." (Isaiah 35:3-4). In the moment of suffering, it is very easy to want to give up and concede all hope, yet that is when we need to be motivated to continue and endure. Paul offers us a bit of insight on two separate occasions: First to the church at Rome, “For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us.” (Romans 8:18). Then again to the church at Corinth, “For this light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison,” (2 Corinthians 4.17). This promise of glory that will be revealed when their suffering is complete should motivate them to be strong and see it through to the end. The same can be said of us as well. All of us suffer in various respects, maybe not to the point of captivity, but suffering nonetheless. God can use that suffering to produce endurance. The endurance will help us develop character, and character will give us hope and hope will never disappoint (Romans 5.3-5).

FOREXCOM:XAUUSD Gold Spot / U.S. Dollar
Possible short term long position for GOLD . Price has remained above both 200 and 50 EMA indicating long bias. The chart may look confusing as there are a lot of lines but these are just different trend channels that I have indicated and you can see the most accurate trend line channel is the parallel channel indicated as blue. The price has broken out of this trend to the downside and I expect a pullback to the trend line before a continuation to the downside. Keep an eye out as I will be following this pair closely and we will be holding any trades we have until next week as it is Friday today. FOREXCOM:XAUUSD

The ‘under-arrest’ test – how to see the holes in your story’s ending
Posted by Roz Morris @Roz_Morris in How to write a book on June 20, 2019 and character issues) that you later rely on …. at the end.
Epic fail
How do you spot this epic fail?
You may already be good at it.
We are in an era of long-running TV shows, which get cancelled or renewed at the last minute. Some writing teams can weather this with aplomb. Others collapse in a pickle of chaos. We’ve all seen a smart, richly written show that falls apart in a late episode and becomes unsatisfying, or ridiculous, or changes direction jarringly.
Behind this story implosion, there’s usually a script crisis. The showrunners might have planned a one-off series with an arc that finished nicely. Then late on, they’re told they’re being renewed and mustn’t wrap up after all. They can’t rewrite. The first episodes might even have been shown. So hasty rearrangements are needed at the end.
It happens the other way round too. The show is cancelled unexpectedly, so the writers must tidy up in a tearing hurry.
What the viewer sees is this.
- Heaps of new stuff is tipped in at the last minute.
- Things happen that haven’t been properly set up.
- Characters behave in ways that are hard to understand and don’t fit with what we know about them.
- There may be a lot more expositional scenes than before, which usually look contrived.
Golden rule
Don’t put anything in your ending that you haven’t seeded much earlier.
Back to evidence
Let’s stay with the arrest scenario and think about evidence.
Evidence is audience knowledge. And it must be revealed at the proper time.
Because a good, satisfying ending is built from knowledge and emotions the reader has gained throughout the entire book.
A health check for your ending
So here, in more detail, is the ‘under arrest’ test. Look for the following in your manuscript.
No new plotlines or characters
Any new characters or plotline that appear suddenly. After a certain point in the story, you shouldn’t introduce anything new. However, you can if you’ve paved the way for them (which means they’re not, actually, new). And you must be specific. If you add a long-lost cousin who becomes pivotal, we must know they might exist in the specific world of this story and that they might be drawn out of hiding. If you don’t make these preparations, it won’t look fair – even though most humans on the planet might have a long-lost cousin. (Though they might not all have had a long-lost Dalek.)
A new relationship or set of character feelings is revealed. He was adopted! She was always jealous of them! If you want to introduce a relationship surprise, make sure you’ve laid oblique and indirect clues. If a character does a thing that is surprising because they have a change of heart, does it make deep sense without lots of explanation? Or should you prepare more earlier?
Expositional scenes – how much are you having to explain? If you are giving long explanations, have you already got the reader insanely curious about these facts? Are they the subject of an ongoing mystery? If you’ve already primed the reader to want the answer, they’ll pay close attention to your explanation. If you haven’t, they’ll see it as an info-dump and you need to set it up much earlier so that they care about it all.
And if you need a long sequence of exposition, how do you handle it? Are you delivering it in the most interesting way? The most straightforward way is long speeches, which can look uneven – one person talks a lot, the other sits quietly, maybe drinking tea. Or you might convey it through thoughts and sudden realisations – which might also look dull and static. Instead, could you make these discoveries more dynamic? If a person is hearing the explanation, could it matter directly to them? Could some of the information be acquired by action rather than a long explanation?
Watch out for off-screen action you’ve introduced to fill logic holes. ‘I found this out because I phoned that guy you used to work with who I’ve never met before, I must admit, so a phone call is out of character for me…’ Yes, you should have written a scene shouldn’t you? Evidence, innit.
So… list everything the reader must understand to really ‘get’ your ending. A thread to be resolved, a thread to hang in a tantalising way, a note to sound your theme, a comedy twinkle or a note of sinister continuation. You could even write the ending you most want, then interrogate it with these questions to find out what to expand. Then you’ll have an ending that does your book justice.

The journey to Brash Higgins is an interesting one, and if not for all the twists and turns we doubt we’d have such compelling wines to offer today. Brad Hickey is the winemaker and journeyman behind the label, with the help of his partner in life, vigneron Nicole Thorpe. Brad is a Chicago native that has ticked off more than most in the food and wine industries over the past 20 years. He’s worked restaurants and vineyards in France as a youngster, brewed beer and baked bread in Portland and directed world class wine programs for two of New York’s most recognized chefs.
Now under the Brash Higgins label he crafts wine from the estate owned and organically farmed (in conversion to certification) Omensetter Vineyard, planted in 1997, in the southern half of McLaren Vale overlooking the Wullunga Foothills. This part of McLaren Vale sits on red-brown clay and limestone soils with healthy drainage.
Brash Higgins puts a rustic, old world spin on the famous McLaren Vale varieties Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon, both off the Omensetter site. After a visit to Sicily and recognizing similarities in the climate and terroir, Brad was inspired to graft 1 hectare of Shiraz vines over to Nero d’Avola. Growing on the Sicilian influence, Brad naturally ferments the Nero d’Avola in locally produced Amphora vessels and lets them interact with the skins for 6 months. Brad also produces an enticing Grenache Mataro co-ferment from a biodynamically farmed vineyard in the sandier soils of Blewitt Springs in the Northern part of McLaren Vale (heading toward the Adelaide Hills).

As of nightfall across much of the country Sunday, there have been no reports of any clashes.
During the day, crowds of only a dozen or two demonstrated at some boarded-up, cordoned-off statehouses, while the streets in many other capital cities remained empty.
Right-wing protesters held signs paraded by the Statehouse in Columbus, Ohio but left around midday with no reports of violence.
Photos from Michigan showed National Guardsmen in humvees patrolling outside of the state capitol in Lansing. Roughly 25 people attended the protest, and according to Scripps station WXYZ in Michigan, the majority of those in attendance were members of the media.

(More Cricket News)
According to sources, the Tata Group is among four companies who have expressed their interest to bid for the IPL 2020 title sponsorship. The others are education technology platform Unacademy, fantasy cricket online app Dream11 and online tutoring firm Byju's.
According to rules, the four companies will have to submit their formal bid by 1 PM on August 18 following which the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) will announce the title sponsors later in the day.
READ: IPL's New Partners Unacademy, Cred Have No Chinese Links
Money may not be the only consideration although the BCCI will look to recover as much of the INR 440 crores it has lost after a hassled Vivo, the Chinese mobile phone makers, "mutually" pulled out this year in the wake of the bitter 'Boycott China' mood generated after 20 Indian soldiers were killed by China in a bloody standoff in Ladakh in June this year.
Of the four contenders, Tatas and Unacademy are purely desi (Indian) brands while both Dream11 and Byju's have Chinese investors. Dream11 is apparently being funded by a telecommunication giant.
ALSO READ: BCCI's Strong Chinese Links Defies India's 'Atmanirbharata'
Dream11 and Byju's are already associated with BCCI as sponsors. The fantasy cricket platform is also associated with several IPL franchises. Byju's replaced Oppo (another Chinese mobile phone brand) as Team India sponsors while Unacademy have just become one of the official partners of IPL.
Sources say the 'deal' with the Tata Group has been struck. The title sponsorship fee is expected to be around INR 300 crores.
Reliance-owned Mumbai Indians are the most successful side. Photo - BCCI
The Tata Group's association with sports has been long. Outside the Railways and other institutional public sector units, the Tata Group has been the largest employers of sportspersons in India. The current BCCI president Sourav Ganguly and head coach Ravi Shastri have been Tata employees.
Tata sponsors the biggest international tennis tournament -- Maharashtra Open -- in India, funds the Wrestling Federation of India, has a team in the India Super League football and runs one of the oldest soccer academies in the country in Jamshedpur. It continues to employ top Olympians.
The Tata group's reputation as a national brand with pedigree will be a major factor when the BCCI makes the final call on August 18, said a source in the know of things.
The 'China' factor will work against Byju's and Dream11. "It will be suicidal if BCCI continues to promote these brands," the source said.Send Her My Love MP3

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to quantify the association of cesarean delivery with epidural analgesia management, specifically with the timing of epidural catheter placement in relation to labor, the type of epidural analgesia, and the use of bolus dosing. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort design was used to investigate 1561 consecutive nulliparous parturients whose labor occurred between November 1, 1996, and June 30, 1997, at Northwestern Memorial Hospital and who were delivered of term, singleton neonates in a cephalic presentation. The relationship between the management of epidural analgesia and the risk for cesarean delivery was determined with stepwise logistic regression to control for potential confounding variables. RESULTS: There was a significantly increased risk of cesarean delivery associated with decrements in cervical effacement (P = .001), cervical dilatation (P = .001), and fetal station (P = .001) at the time of epidural catheter placement. An increasing number of epidural boluses during the first stage of labor was also associated with increased risk of cesarean delivery (P = .001). After we controlled for maternal age, maternal body mass index, gestational age, infant birth weight, induction of labor, use of magnesium sulfate, and presence of chorioamnionitis, the adjusted odds of cesarean delivery associated with fetal station (odds ratio, 1.45; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-1.7) and epidural boluses (odds ratio, 1.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-1.8) during the first stage of labor remained significant. CONCLUSION: The management of epidural analgesia during labor was associated with the potential for increased risk of cesarean delivery. This risk increased with higher stations of the fetal head at the time of epidural catheter placement and with more frequent epidural boluses of local anesthetic during the first stage of labor.

Welcome to Day 5 of #SoulTies Intro Course. Today we look at how to be free from sexual #SoulTies. Pls follow @SoulTiesTweets
1. There are 3 steps you should take if you want to beat sexual #SoulTies or any other form of #SoulTies
2. These are Forsaking evil associations, renewing your mind with the Word of God and Prayer. #SoulTies
3. Number 1 step to beating #SoulTies is forsaking evil associations.
4. Psalms 1:1a Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly,… #SoulTies
5. Psalms 1:1b … nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. #SoulTies
6. God says that you are blessed when you don’t walk in the counsel and in the mindset of the ungodly #SoulTies
7. God says that you are blessed when you don’t make sinners who are addicted to evil your sources of inspiration. #SoulTies
8. God says you are blessed when you don’t seat in the seat of the scornful. #SoulTies
9. This means that God is expecting you not to make the people who scorn His ways your most comfortable inner circle. #SoulTies
10. 1 Corinthians 15:33 Be not deceived:evil communications corrupt good manners. #SoulTies
11. No matter how sincere you are about the things of God, associating with evil company will eventually infect your system. #SoulTies
12. 2 Samuel 13:2a And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; #SoulTies
13. 2 Samuel 13:2b …for she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do any thing to her. #SoulTies
14. Amnon had an uncontrollable erection thinking about his sister and possibly made himself sick through infatuation. #SoulTies
15. 2 Samuel 13:3 But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, … and Jonadab was a very subtil man. #SoulTies
16. Amnon had an evil friend called Jonadab who supplied the blueprint that he used in staging the rape his own sister. #SoulTies
17. Many evil things you have done were inspired by your evil associations. Until you forsake them, you can’t be free from #SoulTies
18. Some of you guys out there have tons of gigabytes of porn on your laptops. You need to trash them to be free from sexual #SoulTies
19. Number 2 step to beating #SoulTies is renewing your mind with the Word of God. #SoulTies
20. First we start by reminding ourselves that we comprise of spirit, soul and body according to 1 Thes 5:23 #SoulTies
21. When Adam sinned in garden of Eden, at least 3 things happened to him. First his spirit was alienated from God. #SoulTies
22. Next his mind got injected with the mindset of satan. Then his body became subject to sickness & death. #SoulTies
23. Every human being born of man & woman inherited all three sick components from Adam. #SoulTies
24. Your being born in any church or your membership of any church did not exempt you from d adamic nature. #SoulTies
25. Everyone was born a sinner irrespective of d church their parents attended or religion they professed. #SoulTies
26. While growing up, satan did a thorough job of building wrong affections for things & people in our souls. #SoulTies
27. Your soul comprises your mind, your will & your emotions. How u think, what you want & how you feel. #SoulTies
28. #SoulTies are therefore emotional links that tie you down like a leashed dog to something or someone else.
29. These #SoulTies restrict you from moving freely into your destiny. An example is Samson.
30. Samson was soul-tied like a leashed dog to Delilah and the link was sexual experience with her. #SoulTies
31. Salvation came through Jesus Christ & it was designed as a total package for our spirits, souls & bodies. #SoulTies
32. Salvation affected our spirits as soon as we received Jesus into our hearts according to 2 Cor 5:17 #SoulTies
33. However, salvation did not have an immediate effect on our souls and this is how we know. #SoulTies
34. Prov. 23:7 says as a man thinketh in his heart so is he. Your life is a product of what you think. #SoulTies
35. You are not different from what you think. What you think is what you fill your mind with and that’s what you do. #SoulTies
36. You can’t fill your mind with porn all evening and want to hold a bible study when you see women. #SoulTies
37. Most rapists and child predators were also found to be porn addicts. If your date loves porn, trouble is around you. #SoulTies
38. Even after you get saved, God expects you to reprogram your mind with His Word & thoughts in line with Rom 12:2 #SoulTies
39. Until you renew your mind with His Word, you retain the #SoulTies you built in satan’s kingdom while in God’s kingdom.
40. These #SoulTies then make you behave exactly the same way unsaved people behave while being saved.
41. #SoulTies explain why saved men or operatives in church behave like unsaved men. It’s cos their minds are not renewed.
42. Churches that don’t emphasise the Word come short here. Prayer & oil alone cannot renew your mind. There has to be d Word. #SoulTies
43. Only the Word of God mixed with prayers can renew your mind and rid your soul completely of those satanic #SoulTies.
44. Psalms 119:9 Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word. #SoulTies
45. Psalms 119:11 Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee. #SoulTies
46. It’s time for the church to start focussing on mind renewal with God’s Word so we can stop breeding #SoulTies ridden saints.
47. Sisters, don’t be fooled by a brother serving tables in church. Check contents of his mind before u get sucked in. #SoulTies
48. Brothers, don’t get fooled by the sister in the choir with a silky voice. Ascertain her mind before u get sucked in. #SoulTies
49. It is EXTREMELY dangerous to trust your marital future to a man or a woman who is not doggedly committed to God’s Word. #SoulTies
50. More Word leads to less #SoulTies. Less Word leads to retained and added #SoulTies.
51. Number 3 way to be free is to pray in the spirit a lot. I mean pray in tongues a lot. #SoulTies
52. Matthew 17:19 Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out? #SoulTies
53. Matthew 17:21 Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting. #SoulTies
54. The disciples could not handle a particular demonic case brought before them and Jesus had to intervene. #SoulTies
55. They felt very deflated and decided to ask Jesus about the reason for their failure. #SoulTies
56. He blamed it on their lack of understanding of faith & in Vs 21 He then said that case couldn’t without fasting & prayer. #SoulTies
57. There are some cases in your life that require fasting and prayer for you to chase those demons away. #SoulTies
58. Fasting & prayer is not for begging God to come do something. It’s for bringing you to a place where you can walk by faith #SoulTies
59. Fasting and prayer helps you to walk in the Spirit and beat the flesh according to Gal 5:22. #SoulTies are works of the flesh.
60. Please download my clip here on how to beat sexual #SoulTies. See you tomorrow for Day 6 of the Intro course.Found 174<<

Yeah, you heard me
In this current age of social distancing, making sure you’ve got the best gaming headset for playing games online with your mates has never been more important. Not only does a headset give your PC a big boost in the audio department, but its built-in microphone means you can easily talk with your team mates without the need for setting up a separate microphone. So let us help you find the best gaming headset for you and your budget with all of the best gaming headsets I’ve tested right here at RPS.
Every gaming headset on this list has been tried and tested by yours truly, so you can be absolutely sure these are the cream of the best gaming headset crop. You’ll find everything here from the best budget gaming headsets all the way up to the best wireless gaming headsets, as well as everything in between. No matter what you’re looking for, I’ve got a best gaming headset recommendation for you.
Best gaming headset 2020
Here’s our best gaming headset list at a glance. To help make things a bit easier, you can either click on the headset you want to read about, or you can just continue scrolling to read the whole thing – and while you’re here, be sure to check out our best gaming keyboard and best gaming mouse lists as well if you’re in need of some more peripherals. With all that in mind, here are my best gaming headset picks for 2020.
Logitech G Pro X – the best gaming headset
The Logitech G Pro X headset is a truly incredible bit of kit. Not only is it one of the most comfortable gaming headsets I’ve ever worn, but it’s also got the best darn microphone this side of a Blue Yeti. That’s mostly because its mic has Blue’s Voice technology built into it, which is the closest you’ll get to having a broadcast quality mic on a gaming headset. Logitech’s GHub software also gives you plenty of options to get your microphone sounding just right, and it really does put all other gaming headset mics to shame.
The Logitech G Pro X also sounds absolutely sublime. Thanks to its rich, detailed soundscape, I was able to hear sounds in my test games I’d never even noticed before, making everything feel more immersive as a result. I was also able to pinpoint exactly where certain sounds were coming from in fast-paced action games such as Doom – and that was without switching on its virtual 7.1 surround sound feature, too.
It also comes with a replacement set of ear pads, loads of different cables and connections so you can use it with other devices, plus a very lovely carry case to make sure nothing gets lost. If you’ve got the cash, you definitely won’t be disappointed. Alternatively, it’s also available in a regular G Pro model for £85 / $100, which has exactly the same design but doesn’t come with the Blue Voice tech inside the mic. If even those are too expensive, though, then the next best thing is either the successor to Corsair’s Void Pro RGB, the £70 / $80 Corsair Void Elite RGB, or the Fnatic React, which costs £70 / $70.
Logitech G432 – the best budget gaming headset
Available for around half the price of its Pro X cousins, the Logitech G432 is a fantastic headset for those on a budget. It’s a little expensive at the moment due to low stock levels – it’s normally around £50 / $50 – but compared to similarly priced headsets such as the Razer Kraken X and the Steelseries Arctis 1, the Logitech G432 beats them all by a country mile.
Its sound quality is absolutely fantastic for this kind of price, producing sparklingly detailed audio in every game going. It’s so clear, in fact, that I had to remind myself that I hadn’t accidentally put the Pro X on again by accident. It’s also got a brilliant microphone, and comes with both a USB DAC and a combined and dual 3.5mm splitter to use with your PC, laptop and consoles. I did, admittedly, have a few issues with the headset’s overall comfort – especially compared to the featherweight Arctis 1 – but when the G432 sounds this good, I’m willing to overlook it in this case.
Yes, there are cheaper headsets out there, such as the £40 / $40-odd Turtle Beach Recon 150, but the Logitech G432 is absolutely worth the extra expense in this case, and I’ve yet to find a better-sounding headset for less.
Alternatively, if you’ve got a bit more to spend and fancy some RGB lighting in your headset, then the next best thing is the Corsair Void Elite RGB, which is an updated version of the excellent Corsair Void Pro RGB. This can currently be had for £70 / $58, making it slightly cheaper than the non-X model of the Logitech G Pro.
Steelseries Arctis 7 – the best wireless gaming headset.
Corsair HS70 – the best budget wireless gaming headset
I love a good wireless gaming headset, but as you’ve no doubt just seen, the best ones demand well over £100 / $100, which can often be a step too far for those looking to keep costs down. Thankfully, the brilliant Corsair HS70 is here for those after the best wireless gaming headset that doesn’t break the bank.
It’s still a fair chunk of change, I’ll admit, but the HS70 is an absolutely superb headset in its own right. It doesn’t have as many fancy features as the Arctis 7 or the battery life of the HyperX.
Sennheiser GSP 370 – the best wireless gaming headset with the best battery life
If you’re after a headset that can go for months and months without charging, the Sennheiser GSP 370 is the wireless gaming headset for you. Its 100-hour battery life puts all other gaming headsets to shame, including the Steelseries Arctis 7. It does, however, come at a cost.
For some, the Sennheiser GSP 370 will almost certainly be worth the extra cash over the Arctis 7. It’s a bit on the chunky side design-wise, but this is still a supremely comfortable headset whose audio quality and fold-down microphone are top of their class. However, the main reason why this is sitting in our best wireless gaming headset spot is because it still lacks a couple of key features that sets the Arctis 7 apart. This includes the Arctis’ ChatMix feature and sidetone controls for its microphone. The Arctis 7 also comes with a 3.5mm audio cable so you can use it with other devices, too, whereas the GSP 370 is USB-only.
Still, if you’re not fussed about any of that, then the Sennheiser GSP 370 more than justifies its high price. With its excellent audio quality and that stonkingly large battery life, the GSP 370 is a fantastic wireless gaming headset that should be at the top of your consideration list.
Steelseries Arctis Pro + GameDAC – the best ‘money is no object’ Hi-Res gaming headset.
How to choose the best gaming headset: To earn a place on our best gaming headset list, a headset not only needs to sound fantastic, but it also has to be super comfortable and have an excellent microphone. After all, what’s the point of having a microphone at all if your mates can’t hear you speak very well when you’re playing online? Of course, testing a gaming headset can be a very subjective experience. Everyone has a different shaped head, for example, so what’s comfortable for me may not be comfortable for other people (especially those with larger heads than mine), and musical tastes differ as well.
I prefer a balanced-sounding headset whose bass doesn’t drown out the highs, and I test for this in a variety of ways, playing games such as Doom, Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice and Final Fantasy XV to see how a headset handles their various in-game soundtracks against gun shots, dialogue and environmental effects. I also listen to regular orchestral, rock and pop music from my own music library to see how it holds up as a general listening headset, and I test a headset’s microphone by recording myself talking in Audacity.
There are a couple of other things to consider when buying a new gaming headset as well. You’ll find lots of headsets claim they can do 7.1 surround sound, but don’t be fooled by this. In a traditional audio setup, a 7.1 system would require seven individual speakers and a subwoofer (the “.1” bit), while a gaming headset will only ever have two physical speakers (one for each ear). Consequently, any headset that says it has 7.1 surround is always going to be doing it virtually via onboard software. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but it often makes your game audio feel like it’s been turned into one great big echo chamber. Unless you’re going to be watching a lot of films on your PC that support 7.1 surround sound, it’s usually better to stick to a simple stereo headset (or at least leave its 7.1 surround feature turned off).
The same goes for Hi-Res certified headsets. Hi-Res (or High Resolution) audio is meant to provide the absolute pinnacle of music quality, which is great if you already own lots of Hi-Res audio tracks or subscribe to a service like Tidal, but as for gaming… it’s pretty much useless. Personally, I’ve never been able to tell the difference between Hi-Res audio and non-Hi-Res audio, and that’s after multiple demos and tech PRs doing their darnedest to convince me otherwise. As a result, don’t feel like you should go all out on a Hi-Res headset if you’re only going to be using it for games.Your shopping cart is currently empty.

Main Article Content
Abstract
The search for a better use of wood in the pulp industry has fuelled interest in a more rational use of its components, particularly xylans. The impact of xylans removal and of xylans redeposition on pulp properties for tissue and P&W paper grades are discussed in this paper. Kraft pulp (15.6% xylans) treatment with 10-70 g.L-1 NaOH resulted in pulps of 14.5-5.9% xylans. The treatments decreased pulp lignin and HexA contents and caused significant positive impact on subsequent oxygen delignification and ECF bleaching. Xylan removal decreased pulp beatability, water retention value and tensile index but increased drainability, water absorption capacity, capillarity Klemm and bulk. Overall, xylan depleted pulps showed almost ideal properties for tissue paper grade pulps. In a second step of the research, xylans extracted from unbleached (BXL) and bleached eucalyptus pulps (WXL) by cold caustic extraction (CCE) were added to a commercial brown pulp in the oxygen delignification (O-stage) and further bleached. Xylans deposition occurred at variable degree (up to 7% on pulp weight) depending upon the O-stage reaction pH. Pulp bleachability was not impaired by WXL xylan deposition but slightly negatively affected by BXL xylans. Pulp beatability was improved by xylan deposition. The deposited xylans were quite stable across bleaching and beating, with the WXL xylans being more stable than the BXL ones. At low energy consumption, the deposited xylans improved pulp physical and mechanical properties. Xylans extraction by CCE with subsequent deposition onto pulp in the O-stage proved attractive for manufacturing high xylan P&W paper grades.Opening).

Some people might wonder why we use Mumble instead of its competitors Ventrillo and TeamSpeak. Here a short explanation:
One of the biggest advantages of Mumble is that it is open source software that everyone can use and/or modify free of charge and which plays nicely with all kinds of different operating systems. It is actively developed by a community of volunteers who are very helpful and open for suggestions. A good part of the features of Mumble today were requested by members of the Raktefakt Klan in the early days of Mumble's development. As we care a lot for privacy, another big advantage of Mumble is its use of publicly defined and therefore trustworthy cryptography for authentication and full encryption of voice communication. Additionally Mumble appeals through its clean and simplistic system design, high voice quality and low communication latency.

A tearoom has whipped up a fiery debate after choosing to “shame” a mother when her toddler left a mess.
Corby’s Tea Room in Ramsgate posted a series of pictures on Facebook after the woman, who they did not name, and her 11 month old toddler had left, claiming they did not tidy up or even apologise.
Sandwich crusts and crumbs can be seen beneath the wooden high chair and table.
The caption of the post read: “Whilst we welcome mums and toddlers, what we don’t welcome is a mess left like this with no attempt to help tidy or offer of apology and then when challenged to say weakly, 'I left a tip last time.’”
However, the woman’s sister has since hit back at the café, branding their decision to post about the incident on social media as “absolutely disgusting”.
Sharing a screenshot of the post, she wrote: “Absolutely disgusting behaviour from a so-called business.
"As if young mothers don't have it hard enough without your sad attempt to publicly shame them not only online but in your tearoom.
"Didn't seem to have a problem until after they had paid and tipped you.
"Personally, I think by the fact you deleted your post you are admitting perhaps getting a dustpan and brush isn't such a hard task.
"But don't worry, even though you told my sister and her 11-month-old baby they were never allowed in your tearoom again, I doubt they'd want to after such a disgusting display of unprofessional behaviour."
But the debacle has seen support for both sides, with over 600 people airing their opinion about what would have been acceptable.
“Would have taken 30 seconds for the mum to pick that up. Hardly rude of the staff is it."
Another pointed out: "That is a mess. Would you leave a friend's place like that? Highly doubt it."
Others came to the mother's defence saying: "That mess genuinely isn't bad for a young child eating? I'm astounded they'd publicly shame like this.
"It must be annoying but it's part of catering for young children. Don't get me wrong, some people take the **** and absolutely trash the place.
"But do they expect every single person without a child to fully clean their area before leaving too?
"If so, maybe the post should say all people need to clean up before they leave."
The owner of Corby’s Tea Room, Paul Crush, has since apologised, and deleted the original post from social media.
However, he stands by his reasoning that the mother should have picked up after herself.
“The ladies – and let’s be clear, I would have posted a similar message regardless of who left such a mess and contrary to what is being said, this was not aimed at just young mums – did not even attempt a simple, ‘sorry for the mess,’” Mr. Crush said.
"Nor did they, as they claim, tip but were happy to just walk out and leave it.
"We firmly believe hospitality is there to serve all customers and yes, we understand we have to clean up after them, but a simple recognition would be nice.
"Also, for the record, I did not name or shame anyone specifically – my photos did not identify anyone, but were there to demonstrate the mess left by two adults."
He then chose to delete the post after the comments underneath turned hostile.
“We are an old-fashioned, friendly tearoom – check out all the real reviews on various platforms – and we welcome everyone,” he said.
"I would like to emphasise that since taking over Corby’s three years ago we have actively introduced more child-friendly menus and facilities, including a baby-changing station.
“In what continues to be a very challenging time to own and run a small independent business, this unnecessary and unfair distraction doesn't help.
“We are sorry if this has offended or alienated some groups, young parents in particular, but come and visit for yourselves and you will see just how welcoming we are.”

Measuring anaerobic performance in children using accumulated oxygen deficit
Meldrum, Kathryn Janet (2004) Measuring anaerobic performance in children using accumulated oxygen deficit. PhD thesis, Victoria University of Technology.
Abstract
The thesis investigated a method of determining accumulated oxygen deficit (AOD) in children and quantified the anaerobic performance of children in a variety of ways. The first of the studies investigated the developmental profile of anaerobic performance using AOD in three groups of male children classified as pre-pubertal, pubertal or post-pubertal. The second study investigated the potential differences in the oxygen uptake when discrete and continuous incremental submaximal protocols were used to determine the relationship between submaximal oxygen uptake and exercise intensity. This second study also aimed to investigate the repeatability of oxygen uptake during continuous incremental submaximal exercise. Study Three compared AOD of pre-pubertal males using running and cycling as the modes of exercise.Woolpert

These exquisite maps replicating those used by ancient explorers of the globe are now available to create unique and exclusive ambients.After acquiring the hardware part of Ouya’s business, specifically the microconsole and controller that helped make Razer’s name in the first place.
The terms of the acquisition have not been disclosed but “It was an all-cash deal,” Min-Liang Tan, founder and CEO of Razer, told TechCrunch. This means all Ouya’s VC investors have cashed out. But at least one — Alibaba, which put $10 million into Ouya earlier this year — will now be working more with Razer. (More on that below.)
Ouya CEO and co-founder Julie Uhrman will not be coming over to Razer as part the deal, Uhrman and Tan told TechCrunch, although both note that Uhrman supports the transition. She’s also been thanking lots of people for the last hour over Twitter for their support of the company.
Ouya had launched in 2012 with a console that raised over $8.5 million on Kickstarter, but all but stopped developing that part of the business in March 2014 after struggling to attract developers to build for it, and gamers to buy the kit.
Ouya still seems to be selling the devices at the time of writing. We have asked Uhrman if she can tell us what may be happening with the hardware and related IP, if anything.
Today’s announcement was a while in coming. The acquisition was first reported at the beginning of June. And while the companies did not comment at the time, it was indirectly confirmed by Mesa, the investment bank that helped broker the deal. (In little twist, Mesa itself was acquired just last week.) Razer says the acquisition closed on June 12.
The deal will alternately involve integration and migration. Razer will be integrating Ouya’s games, controllers and accounts to its Cortex TV gaming platform, and will relaunch Ouya’s store as Cortex for Android TV. Tan tells TechCrunch that as of today, Razer’s software platform has “millions of users and over 2 million daily active gamers.” Ouya claims to be the world’s biggest Android TV console publisher, with more than 1,000 games, and the developer relations team will in part be working to keep building that business.
Razer will also be migrating Ouya’s 200,000 users over in the process, Tan tells TechCrunch, with about a year more of support for Ouya hardware and offers to try to get them to migrate over to Razer devices like the Forge TV microconsole and Serval controller bundle.
,” he said. “We will have more follow up announcements soon on the transition to the new service.” Sweeteners will include “freebies, giveaways and promotions,” Razer noted.
Tan says that Razer will also be keeping the Ouya brand in part. “The Ouya brand name will live on as a standalone gaming publisher for Android TV and Android based TV consoles,” he said.
The deal marks the end of the line for Ouya as a standalone business after it burst into the world with a mission to expand Android gaming on the TV, and a record-breaking Kickstarter campaign to underscore popular interest in helping to make that happen.
“Ouya was created with the goal to give developers more freedom. In doing this, we created the first open platform for television. And, with more than 1,000 games, we offered more content — and a broader variety — than any other platform,” Uhrman emailed me in response to questions about the deal. “We are excited that Razer will expand our vision. While this was a hard trail to blaze, we proved that we could bring new thinking to how the games industry operates and we hope we have paved the way for others, allowing all game developers to bring his or her game to the big screen.”
But while competition against incumbents like Microsoft and Sony proved to be too challenging for Ouya, the shifts we’ve seen — precipitated by the rise of smaller and mobile computing devices and new experiences altogether — point to there being room for more players.
Razer, like Ouya, has been following a vertically-integrated route while building its business, investing not just in platforms to attract more software development but also in building a range of hardware that includes not just the Forge console but Blade gaming-optimized laptops, peripherals like controllers and keyboards, and wearables.
The idea is that Ouya will be able to help in both of those areas.
On the software side, Ouya had already been working with companies like Xiaomi and its Mi Box and Alibaba‘s TMall Box, and that will continue under its new owner as a way for Razer to expand the economies of scale of its bigger platform.
“Alibaba Group is committed to bringing high-quality games and content to our Chinese users. We look forward to continuing our collaboration with Ouya through Razer,” an Alibaba spokesperson told TechCrunch.
The Forge TV console, meanwhile, has had mixed reviews since launching earlier this year, with some pointing out that there are strong competitors both above and below its basic $100 price point and others ultimately concluding that it’s not bad, but buggy. Razer clearly is not ready to give up, though, so while it continues to develop the hardware is hoping for another software boost to the product by way of Ouya.
Prior to the sale, Ouya had raised $33.6 million with investors including Kleiner Perkins, Jay Adelson, Mayfield Fund, Nvidia, Occam Capital and Shasta Ventures. Razer, meanwhile, counts Intel Capital, IDG-Accel and Heliconia Capital Management (a subsidiary of Singapore’s Temasek) as investors.FAQ: What is included on the AL state salesperson licensing exam?

Mr. William Panna. At this time, Mrs. Peter picked out the place she wanted to live, at the corner of 2nd and Water Street. This would put the Mansion right in the middle of town, for convenience as they were growing old and she wanted to be in the center of activity. Roxanna had planned it all herself.
The materials used in the Mansion's construction came from Peter's own lumber yards. The wood, and many other materials, was shipped from their own factories in Toledo and Bay City. The brick for the 18 inch thick outer walls was from The Peter brick yard. The only materials that did not come from the Peter's operations were the marble, sinks, and tubs. The marble that is located throughout the Mansion came from Germany. The original sinks and tubs came from Europe. Peter's hired craftsmen and artists from all over, many from Germany, to finish the woods and paint the walls and ceilings with gorgeous designs, birds, and flowers. The sixteen room Mansion took four years to complete.
William Peter (right) with pike pole standing by huge cork pine log with Mrs. Peter (left) and their son, Alvin (center).
The Mansion possesses a unique architectural style featuring the cubic form of the Italianate which was popular during that time. The main hall and entrance feature a rich paneled oak on the walls with a beautiful parquet floor made from hard oak. Mr. Peter was an expert on timber and enjoyed surrounding himself with its fine specimens. Peters moved into the Mansion in 1896. Unfortunately, Mr. Peter did not get to enjoy the Mansion for long, as he died in 1899. Mrs. Peter continued to live in the Mansion until her death in 1917. Since then, the home has passed into several different hands. In 1972, The Lapeer County Historical Society placed a historical marker on the lawn. In 1979, the Mansion was registered with the National Registrar.
The research of the building and history is credited to Robert Blue, a long time resident and historian of Columbiaville. Mr. Blue passed away several years ago. He is sadly missed but fondly remembered.
The Mansion Today
In the 1980's, the Mansion was owned by the State and turned into low-income housing. This did not last long and the 1990's the Mansion sat empty; until 1998. Teresa Cook, had lived the area for a few years and even had her own craft store just a block from the Mansion.
While browsing a summer yard sale, Teresa caught a glimpse of the interior through a open doorway. During her second look through one of the windows, could not believe her eyes! Inside the 12-foot-high ceilings, large fireplaces, and doors with beveled glass. She was speechless.
After walking through the Mansion, Teresa decided to take on the project of restoring the Mansion to its former glory. In September 1998, Teresa had the keys to the Mansion and was ready to get to work.
When she and her family began the restorations of the Mansion, Teresa worried that she was in over her head by taking on such a large project. "We've had many, many hard days. Many days I've thought, 'What have I done?' " That thought lasted until the day the Christmas tree arrived.
Wayne, Teresa's father, decorated the tree and set it up in the front room to bring some life into the Mansion. That simple tree gave Teresa hope and motivation to continue on with the project. "My Dad did a lot so I could continue what I was doing. None of this would have been possible without his help."
After a year of cleaning, and thousands of dollars later, the Mansion had its doors open to the public for the first time in several years.
Today, the Mansion is a place to relax and have a good time with friends and family. From staying the night in one of our beautiful bedrooms, or enjoying a night of murder and mayhem, the Mansion will take you back in time.
The course at the heart of my research question is GBIO 103, the non-majors biology course offered by the Department of Biology, as a part of JMU's General Education Program. I have been teaching this course for 11 years and have developed a course that explores 3-4 topical areas in depth using a variety of teaching strategies (in-class active learning, JiTT modules, process-based projects, etc). I hope that this course design helps my students acheive the General Education objectives for the Natural Sciences component of the curriculum. There are eight objectives that students should acheive after completing all of their course work in the Natural Sciences (see list below). My course targets a subset of the objectives indicated by bold text.
During the fall 2007 semester, I decided to create a learner-centered environment in GBIO 103 where I allowed the students to:
Does a Learner-Centered Environment increase or impact student
Why do some students unable to respond to this environment? What is the profile or skill development of students who succeed vs. those who struggle?

Algerian electric company Shariket Karhaba Koudiet Eddraouch, owned by Sonelgaz and Sonatrach, has awarded the contract to build the new plant to General Electric (GE) and the Spanish engineering firm Iberdrola Ingenieria y Construccion. The Koudiet Eddraouch power plant will be built in El-Tarf province, 700km east of Algiers.
GE’s contract is valued at approximately €635m. Additionally, GE also is in the process of signing a contractual services agreement to provide maintenance and parts over 20 years.
The new facility is expected to produce 1,200MW of power, which would increase Algeria’s current installed generation capacity by approximately 18 per cent.
As one of the largest combined-cycle power plants in the region, the project would help to meet Algeria’s electricity demand, which is growing at the rate of more than seven per cent per year.
According to the Algerian Ministry of Energy and Mining, Algeria’s power requirements will reach 14,000MW by 2010, as the country’s economy continues to grow.
GE plans to manufacture the F-class gas turbines for the Koudiet Eddraouch plant at its facilities in Belfort, France.

- I enjoy to stick close to beach house & rarely do anything fun, however a wild night in town for myself and others is to hit a cannabis dispensary.
I either vape a cannabis oil or try some up-to-date edibles. I enjoy to have some THC infused baked goods on hand. If I invite people over & the people I was with and I are having fun, it is easier to serve than booze & not as rough on the bodyâ€¦ Nobody is going to be vomiting in my kitchen sink the next morning you know? I recently went on a date with another local to the city, however he asked myself and others if I had ever been to the Chihuly Garden & Glass area. I knew what he was talking about but had not been there, and gardens & glass sculptures aren’t entirely my thing. I didn’t want to shoot the guy down though, but so that was our first date, then the gardens absolutely were undoubtedly colorful & lovely. It was peaceful & enjoyable looking at them. The overhead glass structure was amazing & then highlighted. It was reds, reds & yellow fan enjoy things stretching all over the ceiling. It almost looked enjoy the glass changed color throughout the morning too. I was just mesmerized by the beauty of it. It made myself and others want to take up glass blowing as a hobby or buy some unique glass pieces for my home. It was a undoubtedly odd date than I had been on & the guy is a undoubtedly odd genre of guy. He has all sorts of strange activities he wants to do. After the gardens, I am game to try them.

At the moment the government has a (pathetically small) transition package in place to tide people over, but this will end in a few weeks, after which we'll see a large number of people on the dole.
Today in Question Time Paula Bennett, the Minister for Social Development, was asked whether she had received any advice from her department on the unemployment effect of the earthquake. After a pathetic attempt to dodge it by abusing the opposition, she was forced to admit that she had not, and that she had not asked for any. That's right: the Minister of Social Development hasn't bothered to get her department to model how many more people are going to be out of work, and therefore how much it is going to cost us.
This is incompetence, pure and simple. But hey, Bennett lives in Auckland on a $250,000 salary. So why should she care what happens to unemployment in Christchurch?

“Mend Piece, 2014/2017”
It was a cold and crunchy afternoon as we drove to the Emily Davis Gallery at the University of Akron's Myers School of Art. The undisturbed snow embracing the freeway's banks reflected patches of sunlight like prisms. It was a serene and contemplative trek on an otherwise bleak winter's day.
The past couple of years have been disconcerting, to put it mildly. Turmoil is rampant. The world is freaking out. We could use some universal love, and this is exactly what we hoped to find.
As we entered along the windows leading into the gallery, we were greeted with "Imagine Peace" written in 24 of the world's most popular languages. It's the welcoming siren to Yoko Ono's exhibition of the same name. (The show's original presentation opened at this very gallery in the summer of 2007.) To see Imagine Peace in one's home language is a powerful moment, especially when so far from that home. "We've anecdotally noticed that our international students have had a strong reaction to seeing their home language displayed and that they have taken the time to be really thoughtful about stamping peace at home (wherever that is)," reports Arnold Tunstall, director of University Galleries. "The opportunity to send good wishes to a place you care about seems to have a strong pull for all visitors."
A strong pull, indeed. As we viewed Imagine Peace maps, representing Europe, Ohio, Asia, the United States, Africa and the world, we contemplated the grouping of ink stamps and couldn't help but be moved. To participate is a deliberate action. There were a lot of stamps on North Korea, as well as the Middle East and Washington, D.C. Let's hope the message is felt.
We sat down in the lower gallery to watch the short documentary Passages for Light, which chronicles the Imagine Peace Tower that opened in Reykjavik, Iceland, 10 years ago, and a device called the onochord. We were instructed by the artist to employ the onochord (provided at the gallery), a small flashlight that can be used as a key fob, to signal "I love you." One flash for "I" (i), two flashes for "love" (ii) and three flashes for "you" (iii). This strong conceptual work invites us all to be participants in illuminating love to our neighbors.
In "Wish Trees," we were greeted by two dormant Redbud trees sprouting handwritten tags like leaves. Visitors are invited to write down their own wish for the world and hang it on a branch. Both the wishes and the stamped maps will be sent to Ono's studio in New York at the close of the exhibition. She will then take the wishes up to Reykjavik the next time she lights the Peace Tower and spread the wishes over the globe via the light from the tower.
Also on view is Ono's "Parts of a Light House," which was originally shown in 1966 and at whose debut John Lennon first met the artist. Whatever your negative thoughts vis-à-vis Yoko Ono and John, you need to move past it. Ono is an intellectual and was a major player in the Fluxus experimental art movement, one whose participants were multi-disciplinary and included, but were not limited to, artists, designers, mathematicians and economists. "Parts of a Light House" is something I want to stare at every waking moment. Constructed of glass prisms, plexiglass and light, it is lovely. Per the description: ." I wanted to.
Revisiting an action artwork involving broken ceramic cups to signify the destructive acts of war, "Mend Piece" is yet another interactive element of Imagine Peace. Here the artist invites us to lend a hand in mending two broken ceramic globes (produced by Myers School of Art Ceramics faculty and students) while we "meditate on the physical action of healing and peace within the world."
We were informed that in observing the globes being reconstructed, a woman pulled out a band-aid and placed it on the finished piece (pictured) in an act to further strengthen the world's healing process.
Finally, a setlist of 24 solo and collaborative songs by John and Yoko, as well as Yoko herself with the Plastic Ono Band, can be enjoyed throughout the exhibition via portable headphones.
On the drive back north, it was hard not to imagine peace and to engage others in this poignant exhibition. As the artist states, "A dream we dream alone is just a dream; a dream we dream together is reality."
Collaboration is the key word for.Students who opt for French in First Year undertake the three- year Junior Certificate course. This syllabus aims at developing the student’s ability to understand both oral and written French while developing her appreciation of cultural differences between France and Ireland as well as other French-speaking areas of the world. The foundations of grammar are laid down in these first few years too, so that by the end of the course, a student should be able to write letters and postcards with ease as well as express herself in simple conversational French.
Junior Certificate classes are mixed in ability with the vast majority of our students sitting the Higher Level paper in the examination. We use a class text book and supplement our teaching with language games, CDs, films and computer-based activities.
The exam, like that of the other Modern Languages, is comprised of three components:
Listening (worth 44%) The student is required to extract specific information from a range of recorded material. Responses are to be given in English.
Reading (31%) The student is asked to identify and extract specific information from timetables, menus, magazine articles, advertisements and interviews. They are required to demonstrate their understanding by answering in English.
Writing (25%). The student must complete written tasks of varying length. She is required to demonstrate the use of an appropriate range of vocabulary, grammatical structures and tenses.
Transition Year
The activities in French class in Transition Year allow students to consolidate their knowledge of the language, while further increasing their awareness of life in other French-speaking countries. Students benefit from this year free from the constraints of a State examination syllabus to develop their competencies in the language by undertaking project work, reading short stories or magazine articles, watching and discussing French films and enjoying ICT language activities.
All these activities, in addition to a series of French conversation classes throughout the year, ensure that Transition Year students are in a better position to approach the much more demanding Leaving Certificate course.
Leaving Certificate
At Leaving Certificate level our classes are organised on ability level with all but one class sitting Higher Level. As far as possible classes are carried out through French and we are fortunate to have some native French teachers in the department. We currently use Mosaique as well as newspaper articles, film reviews and other reports of topical interest harvested largely from the Internet.
In the Leaving Certificate examination 25% of the marks are given for oral proficiency and so time is given to developing conversational French and the ability to discuss topics of general concern to young people. The student is required not only to express opinions orally but also in writing so time is given to preparing a wide variety of issues facing young people today such as exam pressure, life after school, drink and drug related problems, environmental concerns and her hopes and dreams for the future.
Students who study French at Leaving Certificate level develop further their language skills and their understanding of the culture and contemporary society of the countries where French is an official language. They have access to the Internet and are encouraged to read French newspapers and periodicals.
The Leaving Certificate Examination
Compréhension Auditive (20%) Students have to extract specific information, identify points of view and emotions and draw conclusions from a range of recorded material. Answers are to be given in English .
Compréhension Ecrite (30%) Students are asked to identify and extract specific information from written material, to recognise points of view, draw conclusions and interpret attitudes. They are required to demonstrate their understanding by answering largely through French
Writing (25%) Students are asked to complete written tasks of varying length and function. They must demonstrate the use of an appropriate range of vocabulary, grammatical structures and tenses through writing a diary entry, a formal letter, a fax or e-mail and an opinion passage in French.
Speaking (25%) Students are required to sustain a conversation with an oral examiner for approximately 12 minutes on a range of topics such as daily routine, pastimes, visits to France, life as an eighteen year old, hopes for the future etc.

Brooks. The video was given to NBC News by 24-year-old Daniel Rider, who said he has only lived in the Milwaukee suburb—about half a mile from the parade route—since March of 2020.
According to the time stamp on Rider’s video, the footage was taken only minutes after Brooks intentionally drove his red SUV into the crowded parade route killing five people and injuring at least 48 others.
In the video, Brooks knocks on Rider’s front door saying he is homeless and needs help calling an Uber. “Hey, I called an Uber and I’m supposed to be waiting for it over here but I don’t know when it’s coming. Can you call it for me please?” Brooks asks.

Rider, who had just returned from a weekend hunting trip, said he was at home watching a football game when Brooks knocked on his door. He was unaware of what had happened in town just 20 minutes earlier.
Brooks “didn’t have any shoes on” and he was only “wearing a t-shirt and it’s freezing cold out” in November in Wisconsin. Eventually, Rider invited Brooks into his house, giving him a coat and a sandwich before Brooks also borrowed his phone. Rider said it was then he began to notice police cars driving around the neighborhood but he was still unaware of what had happened at the parade because he’d been watching football and Brooks was using his phone, which was now getting shelter-in-place alerts.
“So I still am oblivious to anything happening in Waukesha and all of a sudden I look outside my street and I see a few cop cars drive by and I’m getting extra nervous,” Rider told NBC News. “I was already nervous, to begin with with him being in the house. So I saw cop cars drive by and I tell him, ‘You gotta get out of my house now.’ And so he was actually pretty compliant. He said ‘Are you sure? Why what’s going on? What’s going on.’ I said, ‘You gotta leave. You gotta leave.'”
Brooks was arrested on Rider’s porch shortly after that. His Uber car arrived just as he was put in handcuffs. Thank goodness for slow service. Imagine if Brooks had gotten in that Uber–authorities might still be looking for him today.
BREAKING NEWS:
WAUKESHA: $5 million cash bail set for Darrell Brooks, Brooks is being charged with five counts of intentional homicide after running an SUV through a Christmas parade killing six. #Waukesha #Wisconsin #DarrellBrooks pic.twitter.com/mWY6DzyOTJ
— Revolution Sports (@RevoSports2021) November 23, 2021
The lone suspect in Sunday’s deadly parade rampage, Brooks made his first court appearance Tuesday. He will be charged with five counts of intentional first-degree homicide. Waukesha PD is continuing its investigation and prosecutors will most likely file an additional charge after the death of a sixth victim, 8-year-old Jackson Sparks, on Tuesday afternoon.

Oh, OK, it was more of a walk, but it was over a trail with changes in elevation, rough patches, and even a little mud. In other words, it was an effort beyond that cliche, a walk in the park.
My companions in this adventure were my sister Cheryl and niece Jenna. They do quite a bit of hiking in various parks around the area. I always think I am OK to go for a trail walk because of all the running I do. I confess that sometimes on a run or, more often on my cool-down walk, I say to myself, “My legs are magnificent instruments of propulsion!” Well, let me just say I do not need to feel so pleased with myself.
I did not take a lot of pictures. We were wishing there were some longer views, especially with the fall foliage reaching peak.
There are quite a few trails in Russell Park. We were on the Horseshoe Trail, I think. We had to choose which fork to take a couple of times. We saw a bridge we considered crossing, but I felt what we could see of the trail beyond it looked iffy. Cheryl went down for a photo op.
We ended up at the Soccer Field and followed the road back to where we had parked. We looked at the trail map, which I stupidly did not get a picture of. We talked about where we might walk next time but decided not to follow any other trails today.
It was a lot of fun. In addition to a challenging walk, we had a great visit with a lot of laughs. I hope to tag along on more of Cheryl and Jenna’s hikes.The following video shows how humans are destroying the environment and harming nature with their reckless behavior. Knowingly or unknowingly, we have been polluting our planet. Our waste and garbage end up as far as middle of the ocean and it is extremely damaging to marine life. Just look at the following clip if you need any further proof. It features the rescue of a sea turtle and the heart-breaking footage just might bring you to tears.
A research team found this male sea turtle during one their in-water research trips to Costa Rica. They thought it was infected by a parasitic worm at first, but they later realized what the thing in his nostril really was. They found out that the poor thing actually had a 10 to 12 cm plastic straw lodged in him! Just imagine one being stuck inside your nose! How they took it out is extremely difficult to watch. Wait till you check it out for yourself!
This research team wants to spread a simple message: “say no to plastic straws and any kind of one-time use plastic item”. When are we going to stop destroying what’s around us? Once its too late, we can never go back. We need to think about the generations that are going to come after us, and work to conserve our planet as fast as possible.

Store-bought baby food can be an important tool in the arsenal of busy moms and dads. After all, what parent doesn't love taking a shortcut in the kitchen? But what if you found out that making your own baby food might benefit your child for years to come? A new study found there are hidden advantages to whipping up those early meals yourself, and they might make you think twice about relying on store-bought baby food.
In a study published in the International Journal of Obesity, researchers at McGill University Health Center and the Montreal Children's Hospital collected data from the parents of 65 infants. They surveyed each child's parents when the children were 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, and 3 years old.
Looking at whether babies were fed homemade meals, store-bought food, or a mix of both, researchers examined how those early meals impacted each kid's weight, growth, and diet diversity by the time he or she reached the preschool years.
More from CafeMom: Why You Should Let Your Picky Eater Make a Great Big Mess
It turned out that babies who ate only homemade foods had more diverse diets earlier in life and lower body fat mass at 1 and 3 years of age.
"The results could have implications for preventing obesity and chronic diseases associated with poor food choices," lead study author Dr. Elise Mok told Reuters.
More from CafeMom: 15 Times Celeb Dads Got Real AF & Totally Made Us Laugh Out Loud
"Given that food preferences begin early in life, are likely to persist, and are difficult to change in adulthood, providing appropriate food choices during the complementary feeding period is of importance to facilitate food acceptance and ensure healthy growth and development," Mok continued.
As moms, we always feel like our kids should have the best -- especially if it means they'll be healthier and more willing to try new foods. But it's not always easy. (Seriously, who wants to clean a blender or a food processor after every meal? Um, not me!) But "homemade" food doesn't need to be as complicated as it sounds. You can always mash your own bananas, avocados, or sweet potatoes without needing to bust out your larger kitchen equipement.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends breastfeeding exclusively for the first six months of life. Beyond that, the WHO encourages parents to feed babies a varied diet, which includes meat, poultry, fish, and eggs in addition to a range of fruits and vegetables starting at age 6 months.

When you put it that way, it doesn't sound all that daunting, right? And it certainly makes sense that the more foods you're introduced to, the more you're likely to try -- and hopefully like. Getting in a range of tastes and textures right from the get-go is a good way to offer your child a wide range of foods.
Also, when you cook your own foods, you know exactly what's going in there, so it's an easy way to eliminate unnecessary sugars and chemicals that you can't even pronounce.
Of course, it's not always easy or convenient to make your own food, but even something as simple as a diced apple can offer babies a healthy start and crunchy texture while still letting you know exactly what you're getting.

Speaker: Tony Hendrick, Oleksandra Fedorova & Giacomo Guiulfo
For more blog posts from JavaOne, see the table of contents
42 Silicon Valley
- tuition free coding school
- no teachers
- no classes
- when start – can only communicate by Slack
- the application process starts with two logic games with no instructions. The first test involves memory. If you pass, you get an email with the next steps
- Then comes the piscine a 4 week crash course in C with daily peer reviewed exercises. Each weekend get an individual and group project. 10-15 hours a day for 28 days. Then whatever want; most students choose 8-10 hour days
- Staff doesn’t answer questions. They tell you to ask other students. 250-300 students
- 3-5 year program. Twenty one levels to go through. Self paced
- Start with writing a C library then can choose branch working with 4 other people
- high school diploma required only if under 18
- Supplement with other resources. ex: coursera
- Buiding open 24×7 so can work when want. Must be in person for tests, grading, etc. Want to build face to face skils for office
- Learn many languages
- Must do coding internship after a year. Can pause account if get offer or contract job (or family suitation)
- Funded by philanthropist
- Grading is pass/fail. If a tiny bit wrong, still fail
- Paris campus opened in 2013 and US campus opened in 2016. Also have satelitte campuses in a few countries
Branch choices
- unix – to become systems programmer – make unix commands, shell
- graphics – math heavy, fractals
- algorithms – rebuild common algorithms from scratch and then projects
Example Projects
- Reimplment printf
- C++ crash course (in a crash course a project is due every 2 days for 2 weeks
- Mock interviews – algorithms on whiteboard
Staff
10 full time staff
600 students
1024 computers
staff create opportunities – ex: book room for club
Learning Techniques
- Active learning – few instructions so figure it out
- Learning through explaining to others
- Ability to adapt, research ability, speed
- Randomized team vs choose a team depending on project
42 Embassadors
Volunteer – demos, registration desk at this conference, etc
My take: Interesting approach to learning and building a community of learners. This sounds way better than what the coding bootcamps are trying to do.View the Current Catalog View Foreign Rights Catalog

CHINA - North Korea border
Location - Asia; Capital - Beijing; Population - 1.3 billion; Currency - Yuan MORE CHINA
The Pyongyang-Beijing train stops for a few hours on either side of the Yalu River for border formalities. I got off on the Chinese side of the river at Dandong - February 2011.
Chairman Mao Zedong on the 5 Yuan note
Outside the train station stands an larger than life statue of Mao Zedong, though nowhere near as large as the Kim Il Sung statue in Pyongyang - Dandong
Chairman Mao is virtually pointing straight at my hotel room - Dandong
Chinese lanterns line are evident for Chinese New Year - Dandong
Lights, lights and more lights was the first thing I noticed in Dandong, having just crossed the border from North Korea
Hawkers sell perfume, biscuits, sweets and snacks outside the train station - Dandong
Lanterns adorn lampposts throughout the city to celebrate Chinese New Year, known in China as the Spring Festival - Dandong
Tesco supermarket is a bit of a British institution - Dandong
A monument in Yalujiang Park overlooks the Yalu River - Dandong
The Sino-Korean Friendship Bridge spans the Yalu River (or Amnok River in Korean) to connect China with Sinuiju in North Korea - Dandong
The Friendship Bridge looks most impressive at night when it's lit up and changes colour. Notice how dark it is on the North Korean side; it's virtual darkness in Sinuiju once the night draws in - Dandong
Running alongside the Friendship Bridge is the Yalu River Broken Bridge - Dandong
The Broken Bridge was destroyed by the US in the Korean War - Dandong
China repaired their section; North Korea didn't and so it now the Broken Bridge stands as a monument to the war - Dandong
Seats of a ferris wheel in Sinuiju can just about be made out on the North Korean side (photos of Sinuiju are on my North Korean pages) - Dandong
The Broken Bridge comes to an abrupt end halfway across the Yalu River - Dandong
The Sino-Korean Friendship Bridge on the left; the Broken Bridge on the right - Dandong
Good views of Dandong riverfront can be had from the Broken Bridge
I went to the top floor of one of the fancier hotels so I could look down on the river and catch a glimpse of Sinuiju - Dandong
A closer look at Sinuiju, North Korea's border town on the Yalu/Amnok River - Dandong
Fancy lights in Yalujiang Park - Dandong
Along the Dandong riverfront are the blue lights of a luxury hotel and an arched bridge which links to a small island also on the Chinese side - Dandong
The Yalu River is known as the Amnok River in North Korea - Dandong
A docked ship on the North Korean side of the Yalu River at Sinuiju - Dandong
A few chimney stacks in Sinuiju - Dandong
There didn't seem to be much activity on the North Korean side of the river - no people on the river banks, no smoke from the chimney stacks and none of the cranes in operation - Dandong
This industrial section had no signs of life either. But there's life at the train station and further inland (see my North Korea photos) - Dandong
And as far as I know the ferris wheel hasn't turned for a long time - Dandong
Peering across the river to Sinuiju, North Korea - Dandong
There's many souvenir stalls strung along Yalujiang Park, selling North Korea currency and traditional women's dresses. People also play the equivalent of hacky-sack with a large shuttlecock (called jaegi chagi in Korea) - Dandong
Ginseng roots which resemble the human form are apparently more expensive - Dandong
25km outside Dandong is a section of the Great Wall of China - Dandong
This section is known as Tiger Mountain Great Wall, built during the Ming dynasty - Dandong
Climbing the Wall affords great views of North Korea on the opposite side of the Yalu River and of a distant Dandong
This photo shows North Korea on the right of the Yalu River.
Yibukua - or 'one step across' - is visible (see later) - Dandong
A poster in the Great Wall's museum, located right on the North Korea border - Dandong
What not to do at the North Korea border - Dandong
Though this walking trail parallel to the border is always easy to follow, the actual border with North Korea becomes a bit vague at one point as the river dries up. Stick to the path! Dandong
Another reminder of where you are - Dandong
Keep following the border trail via a steep trail up and over the rockface - Dandong
When the ice melts it's possible to have a little boat ride along the Yalu River - Dandong
This is Yibukua - 'one step across' - which is a very narrow section of the river dividing North Korea from China - Dandong
A messy backstreet on the way to the US War Museum (at least it's 'on the way' if you're lost) - Dandong
A memorial outside the Museum to Commemorate US Aggression, which details the role of China and USA in the Korean War - Dandong
A close up of the memorial - Dandong
Peng Dehuai, leader of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, meets with Kim Il Sung, leader of North Korea during the war - Dandong
These girls each wanted a photo with me so I repaid the favour - Dandong
This guy doesn't need the bridge. Walking on ice in Dandong
Outside the War Museum in Dandong
On the move again, this time from Dandong to Harbin via Shenyang
..But first I'll throw in a couple of photos of Beijing.
I flew to the Chinese capital and had a few hours to kill before I headed to Pyongyang.
The Chinese New Year celebrated in February 2011 brought in the year of the rabbit -Beijing
A building entrance in a Beijing alley, known as a hutong (the alleys are known as hutongs, not the buildings)
The entrance to the Japanese Germ Warfare Experimental Base - 731 Division - Harbin
Unit 731 was used by the Japanese before and during WWII to carry out brutal medical experiments on Chinese and Koreans - Harbin
The Star of David remains on top of the former synagogue in Harbin
The pedestrian walkway through Stalin Park - Harbin
The Flood Control Monument, next to the Songhua River, is dedicated to those who have died in Harbin's floods
Zhongyang Dajie is Harbin's main shopping thoroughfare.
Note the trailers full of snow - if it doesn't melt sometimes you gotta move it!
There were a few makeshift bars just off Zhongyang Dajie and strangely the only one serving Chinese beer was the British 'pub'. It sold Newcastle Brown Ale as well - Harbin
The February daytime temperature in Harbin hovered around -20°C so a horse and cart on the frozen Songhua River is safe enough
Even cars drive on the river - Harbin
Parts of the river are turned into an ice skating rink - Harbin
And so to the reason I visited this area of the world in the depths of winter - Harbin's Snow & Ice Festival. This is a snow sculptured Buddha on the Songhua River - Harbin

Learning in Multi-agent System Zhai Yuqing [email protected] edu. cn
Outline • Agent Learning • Multi-agent learning • Reinforcement Learning & Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning
Agent Learning
Why Learning? • Learning is essential for unknown environments, – i. e. , when designer lacks omniscience • Learning is useful as a system construction method, – i. e. , expose the agent to reality rather than trying to write it down • Learning modifies the agent's decision mechanisms to improve performance
Why Learning? • It is difficult to hand-design behaviours that act optimally (or even close to it) • Agents can optimize themselves using reinforcement learning – Not learning new concepts (or behaviours), but given a set of states and actions it can find best policy – Is this just adaptive control? • Learning can be done on-line and continuously throughout lifetime of agent, adapting to (slowly) changing situations
Learning Rewards Observations, Sensations Learning Algorithm World, State Policy Actions
Learning to act in the world Rewards Other agents (possibly learning) Observations, Sensations ? Learning Algorithm Environment Policy Actions World
Learning Agent Architecture • A learning agent can be thought of as containing a performance element that decides what actions to take and a learning element that modifies the performance element so that it makes better decisions
Learning Agent Architecture
Multi-agent Learning
Learning in Multiagent Systems • Intersection of DAI and ML • Why bring them together? – There is a strong need to equip Multiagent systems with learning abilities – The extended view of ML as Multiagent learning is qualitatively different from traditional ML and can lead to novel ML techniques and algorithms
Multi-Agent Learning Problem: • Agent tries to solve its learning problem, while other agents in the environment also are trying to solve their own learning problems. challenging non-stationarity. • Main scenarios: (1) cooperative; (2) self-interest (many deep issues swept under the rug) • Agent may know very little about other agents: – payoffs may be unknown – learning algorithms unknown • Traditional method of solution: game theory (uses several questionable assumptions)
Multi-agent Learning Problem • Agent tries to solve its own learning problem, while other agents in the environment try to solve their own learning problems • Larger state space – Might have to include state of other robots in own state • Problems of Multi-Agent RL – All of problems from single agent – Other agents unpredictable or non-stationary – Should reinforcement be local or global? – Was robot trying to achieve goal or reacting to other robots when doing a good action?
Learning in Multi-Agent Systems • No Doubt learning is of great importance for MAS ! • Challenge: – Multi-Agent learning problem. The optimal policy changes. Other agents are learning too. – Can we have a unifying framework in which this learning can be understood. • Challenging MAS-domains: – – – Robotic soccer Traffic Robotic rescue Trading agents, e-commerce Automated Driving
General Characterization • Principal categories of learning • The features in which learning approaches may differ • The fundamental learning problem known as the credit-assignment problem
Principal Categories • Centralized Learning (isolated learning) – Learning executed by a single agent, no interaction with other agents – Several centralized learners may try to obtain different or identical goals at the same time
Principal Categories • Decentralized Learning (interactive learning) – Several agents are engaged in the same learning process – Several groups of agents may try to obtain different or identical learning goals at the same time • Single agent may be involved in several centralized/decentralized learning processes at the same time
Learning and Activity Coordination • Previous research on coordination focused on offline design of behavioral rules, negotiation protocols, etc… • Agents operating in open, dynamic environments must be able to adapt to changing demands and opportunities • How can agents learn to appropriately coordinate their activities?
Learning about and from Other Agents • Agents learn to improve their individual performance • Better capitalize on available opportunities by prediction the behavior of other agents (preferences, strategies, intentions, etc…)
Learning Organizational Roles • Assume agents have the capability of playing one of several roles in a situation • Agents need to learn role assignments to effectively complement each other
Learning Organizational Roles • The framework includes Utility, Probability and Cost (UPC) estimates of a role adopted at a particular situation – Utility – desired final state’s worth if the agent adopted the given role in the current situation – Probability – likelihood of reaching a successful final state (given role/situation) – Cost – associated computational cost incurred – Potential – usefulness of a role in discovering pertinent global information
Learning Organizational Roles: Theoretical Framework • sets of situations and roles for agent k • An agent maintains vectors of UPC • During the learning phase: • rates a role by combining the component measures
Learning Organizational Roles: Theoretical Framework • After the learning phase is over, the role to be played in situation s is: • UPC values are learned using reinforcement learning • UPC estimates after n updates:
Learning Organizational Roles: Updating the Utility • S – the situations encountered between the time of adopting role r in situation s and reaching a final state F with utility • The utility values for all roles chosen in each of the situation in S are updated:
Learning Organizational Roles: Updating the Probability • - returns 1 if the given state is successful • The update rule for probability:
Learning Organizational Roles: Updating the Potential • - returns 1 if in the path to the final state, conflicts are detected and resolved by information exchange • The update rule for potential:
Learning to Exploit an Opponent: Model-Based Approach • The most prominent approach in AI for developing playing strategies is the minimax algorithm – Assumes that the opponent will choose the worst move • An accurate model of the opponent can be used to develop better strategies
Learning to Exploit an Opponent Model-Based Approach • The main problem of RL is its slow convergence • Model based approach tries to reduce the number of interaction examples needed for learning • Perform deeper analysis of past interaction experience
Model Based Approach • The learning process is split into two separate stages: – Infer a model of the other agent based on past experience – Utilize the learned model for designing effective interaction strategy for the future
Reducing Communication by Learning • Learning is a method for reducing the load of communication among agents • Consider the contract-net approach: – Broadcasting of task announcement is assumed – Scalability problems when the number of managers/tasks increases
Reducing Communication in Contract-Net • A flexible learning-based mechanism called addressee learning • Enable agents to acquire knowledge about the other agents’ task solving abilities • Tasks may be assigned more directly
Reducing Communication in Contract-Net • Case-based reasoning is used for knowledge acquisition and refinement • Humans often solve problems using solutions that worked well for similar problems • Construct cases – problem-solution pairs
Case-Based Reasoning in Contract Net • Each agent maintains it own case base • A case consists of: – Task specification – Info about which agent already solved the task and the quality of the solution • Need a similarity measure for tasks
Case-Based Reasoning in Contract Net • Distance between two attributes domain-specific • Similarity between two tasks • For task is and : a set of similar tasks is:
Case-Based Reasoning in Contract Net • An agent has to assign task to another agent • Select the most appropriate agents by computing their suitability:
Improving Learning by Communication • Two forms of improving learning by communication are distinguished: – Learning based on low-level communication (e. g. exchanging missing information) – Learning based on high-level communication (e. g. mutual explanation)
Improving Learning by Communication • Example: Predator-Prey domain – Predators are Q-learners – Each predator has a limited visual perception – Exchange sensor data – low-level communication – Experiments show that it clearly leads to improved learning results
Knowledge exchange in MAS • More sophisticated implementations provide knowledge exchange capabilities – Exchange the strongest rules they have learned – Multi-agent Mutual Learning(MAML)
Some Open Questions… • What are the unique requirements and conditions for Multiagent learning? • Do centralized and decentralized learning qualitatively differ from each other? • Development of theoretical foundations of decentralized learning • Applications of Multiagent learning in complex real-world environments
Reinforcement Learning & Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning

Multi-agent RL • Basic idea – Combine the learning process in an unknown environment with the interactive decision process of multiple agents – There is no single utility function to optimize – Each agent has a different objective and its payoff is determined by the joint action of multiple agents
Challenges in Multi-agent RL • Curse of dimensionality – The number of parameters to be learned increases dramatically with the number of agents • Partial observability – states and actions of the other agents which are required for an agent to make decision are not fully observable – inter-agent communication is usually costly – Notes: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) have been used to model partial observability in probabilistic AI
The Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) Model • Multiple selfish agents in a stationary dynamic environment. • Environment modeled as a Stochastic (a. k. a Markov) Game (SG or MG). • Transition and Payoff are functions of all agents’ actions.
The MARL Model (cont. ) • Transition probabilities and payoffs are initially unknown to agent. • Agent’s goal – maximize return.
Typical Multi-agent RL methods • Value Iteration Learning [Sutton and Barto ] – Based on different concepts of equilibrium in game theory • Min-max solution-based learning algorithm in zerosum stochastic games [Littman] • Nash Equilibrium-based learning algorithm[Wellman] – Extending Littman’s algorithm to the general-sum games • Correlated Equilibrium based learning algorithm[Hall ]
Typical Multi-agent RL methods • Multiple-person decision theory-based – Assume that each agent plays a best-response against stationary opponents – Require the joint action of agents to converge to Nash Equilibrium in self-play – Learn quickly while losing and slowly while winning – Learn best response when opponents are stationary, otherwise move to equilibrium
Typical Multi-agent RL methods • Integrating RL with Coordination Learning – Joint action learner • Independent Learner – Ignore the existence of other agents – Just apply RL in the classic sense
Typical Multi-agent RL methods • Hierarchical Multi-agent RL – Each agent is given an initial hierarchical decomposition of the overall task – Define cooperative subtasks to be those subtasks in which coordination among agents has significant effect on the performance of the overall task – Cooperative subtasks are usually defined at highest level(s) of the hierarchy
MAL Foundation • The game theoretic concepts of stochastic games and Nash equilibria • Learning algorithms use stochastic games as a natural extension of Markov decision processes (MDPs) to multiple agents – Equilibria learners • Nash-Q , Minimax-Q • Friend-or-Foe-Q • gradient ascent learner – best-response learner
Multiagent Q-learning desiderata § “performs well” vs. arbitrarily adapting other agents § § best-response probably impossible Doesn’t need correct model of other agents’ learning algorithms § But modeling is fair game § Doesn’t need to know other agents’ payoffs § Estimate other agents’ strategies from observation § do not assume game-theoretic play § No assumption of stationary outcome: population may never reach eqm, agents may never stop adapting § Self-play: convergence to repeated Nash would be nice but not necessary. (unreasonable to seek convergence to a oneshot Nash)
Finding Nash equilibrium • Game theoretic approach which supposes the complete knowledge of the reward structure of the underlying game by all the agents – Each agent calculates an equilibrium, by using mathematical programming – Suppose that the other agents are rational

Appeal from the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia.
Before CLARK, Circuit Judge, RONEY*, Senior Circuit Judge, and ATKINS**, Senior District Judge.
CLARK, Circuit Judge.
Appellants, Jimmy Lee Jefferies and Betty Jane Jefferies were indicted in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia on December 10, 1987 in a multi-count multi-defendant indictment alleging multiple violations of the federal drug and tax laws. Included in the indictment were the Jefferies' two children, Sharon and Kenny. Both appellants pled guilty to count 20 of the indictment, alleging tax evasion in violation of 26 U.S.C. Sec. 7206(1). In addition, Jimmy Jefferies pled guilty to count 2 of the indictment, which alleged possession of cocaine with the intention to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(a)(1). As part of the plea agreement, the charges against the Jefferies' children were dropped. Both defendants were sentenced to three years on the tax count. Jimmy Jefferies was sentenced to a 10-year sentence on the drug count to run consecutively with the tax sentence and to be followed by a 5-year term of supervised release. In addition, the defendants were jointly and severely fined $100,000. They now appeal those sentences.
FACTS
Twice in December 1986, the government executed search warrants on the Jefferies' residence. On the first occasion, a package containing 13 grams of cocaine was seized from a toilet in the Jefferies' bathroom. At the time of the search, the bathroom was occupied by a painter. The Jefferies denied any knowledge of the cocaine. At this time and during a second search later that month, some of the family's business records were seized. The defendants sought to suppress the information on the grounds that the affidavit supporting the warrant was based on intentional misstatements. After the defendants filed a suppression motion, they entered into plea negotiations with the government.
Negotiations were held between the attorneys for the defendants, Victoria Little and Christopher Duncan, and Assistant United States Attorney Edward Lukemire. After some preliminary negotiations over the phone, the parties held a meeting to work out a final agreement. Lukemire brought a draft plea agreement to the meeting which was held in Macon, Georgia on October 10, 1988. At that meeting, the defendants and Lukemire worked out a final agreement which was signed by the defendants, their attorneys and Lukemire. Lukemire and the defendants presented the plea to the district court that same day.
The plea agreement provided that both Betty and Jimmy Jefferies would plead guilty to tax evasion and Jimmy Jefferies would plead guilty to possession of cocaine.1 The agreement was explicitly amended during the negotiations to stipulate that the quantity of cocaine involved in the drug offense was 13 grams. The plea also indicated that the parties had agreed that the sentence would be at most ten years on the drug count and left the sentence on the tax count to the court's discretion. In addition, a reference to allowing the court discretion to fine the defendants was also deleted. The defendants agreed to forfeit substantial assets, including their home. The government agreed to drop all the other charges against the Jefferies. The government also agreed not to bring charges against the Jefferies for any other offenses currently known to them. Sharon and Kenny Jefferies agreed to the forfeiture of their assets in exchange for the charges against them being dropped.
The sentencing hearing was held December 19-20, 1988. By that time Mr. Lukemire had left government service and the case was transferred to Assistant United States Attorney Miriam Duke. Ms. Duke interpreted the plea agreement as not requiring the government to "stand mute at sentencing." Government's Brief at 6. Consequently, the government provided the probation officer compiling the presentence investigation reports on the Jefferies with information indicating that the Jefferies had been involved in large scale drug trafficking. At the sentencing hearing the government presented this evidence to support the presentence reports over the objections of the defendants that the government was violating the plea agreement. Based upon this information, the district court found that the offense involved 15 kilograms of cocaine and applied this finding to both defendants. After accepting the pleas and the agreement, the court imposed sentence. In this appeal the defendants raise four objections to the sentence imposed by the district court. Only the claim relating to the plea agreement merits extended discussion.2
DISCUSSION
Both defendants point to several violations of the plea agreement both by the court and by the government. The government, in their response to these contentions, argues that the plea agreement was not violated. The government's arguments are based on interpretations of the plea agreement that are inconsistent with the agreement. The differing constructions are based on different theories of how a plea agreement should be interpreted. Therefore, we begin our analysis of this claim with an summary of the rules applicable to the construction of a plea agreement. We then proceed to examine the plea agreement to determine which interpretation of the agreement is correct, and conclude with an analysis of the consequences of our interpretation of the agreement.
A.
Plea agreements are interpreted and applied in a manner that is sometimes likened to contractual interpretation. This analogy, however, should not be taken too far. In In re Arnett, 804 F.2d 1200, 1203 (11th Cir.1986), this court summarized the standards applied to interpretation of plea agreements. First, the court noted that a "hyper-technical reading of the written agreement" and "a rigidly literal approach in the construction of language" should not be accepted. Id. Second, the written agreement should be viewed "against the background of the negotiations" and should not be interpreted to "directly contradic[t] [an] oral understanding." Id. Finally, a plea agreement that is ambiguous "must be read against the government." Id. (citing United States v. Harvey, 791 F.2d 294, 303 (4th Cir.1986)). The rational for this method of interpretation is that a plea agreement must be construed in light of the fact that it constitutes a waiver of "substantial constitutional rights" requiring that the defendant be adequately warned of the consequences of the plea. Arnett, 804 F.2d at 1203.
In this case the defendants challenge the government's interpretation of the plea agreement. The defendants allege that Ms. Duke's conduct at the sentencing proceeding was inconsistent with the agreement they worked out with Mr. Lukemire. The defendants base much of their arguments on oral understandings and the negotiating history of the agreement. To support these arguments, the defendants supplemented the record on appeal with the original draft of the plea agreement and affidavits from their attorneys who attended the plea negotiations. The affidavits submitted by the defendants relate to oral agreements and understandings made between Lukemire and the defendants' attorneys. The government has not denied these oral agreements and understandings. Rather, the government takes the position that the written plea agreement does not preclude either its conduct at sentencing or the actual sentences the defendants received. Therefore, in resolving this claim, we accept the allegations of the defendants contained in the affidavits filed in this court.3
B.
The first dispute concerns the issue of the five year term of supervised release imposed on Jimmy Jefferies. The plea agreement does not mention supervised release. In addition, the issue apparently was not discussed either during the plea negotiations or during any of the proceedings before the district court. Therefore, it cannot be said that the term of supervised release is an explicit part of the plea agreement. In paragraph 6(b) of the agreement, the government agreed that "any sentence of imprisonment" for count two "not exceed ten years." The defendant argues that this language limits the court's ability to impose a term of supervised release. The government, on the other hand, argues that since it was not mentioned, the question of supervised release was left to the judge's discretion.
We decline to decide whether the district court's imposition of this term violated the agreement because the defendant did not raise this issue in the district court. Generally, we do not consider arguments raised for the first time on appeal. Cf. Fed.R.Crim.P. 51 (party need not "except" to rulings, but must make "known to the court the action which that party desires the court to take or that party's objection to the action of the court and the grounds therefore"). plea agreement, he has waived the right to appeal this issue.4
We note that Jefferies had ample opportunity to raise this issue after his sentence was imposed. While the defendant did not object to the term of supervised release, he did object to other aspects of the sentence after it was imposed. Jefferies has not presented this court with a reason for his failure to object at that time. In addition, the record reflects that following the imposition of the sentence, the court took a recess, sentenced several of the co-defendants, and then received two motions from the Jefferies' attorneys. Jimmy Jefferies' attorney did not raise this issue at that time. Finally, no post trial motions were made even though the court had indicated a willingness to hear testimony on the meaning of the agreement. Jefferies had the opportunity to raise the issue of whether the term of supervised release violated the plea agreement; because he failed to do so, he has waived his appeal on this issue.5
The second dispute concerns the $100,000 fine imposed jointly and severally on both of the defendants. As to Jimmy Jefferies, the fine was imposed on the drug count, as to Betty Jefferies, the fine was imposed on the tax count. The affidavits establish that the issue of the fine was subject to negotiations by the government and the defendants. As noted in the Appendix, the original draft of the agreement explicitly left the issue of the fine to the "discretion of th[e] Court." See Plea Agreement at p 6(b). The affidavits filed by the defendants' attorneys explain that the reference to the fine was deleted after the government agreed that "no fine would be imposed." Duncan Affidavit at p 9; see also Little Affidavit at p 4 (intent of agreement was to allow the Jefferies to keep some of their property free from government claims). The defendants objected to the fine after it was entered. R6-215-216.
The record reflects that there was substantial negotiation over the financial implications of the plea. In addition, both versions of the agreement included an attached schedule of property that was to be retained by the defendants. We find this case indistinguishable from the situation in Arnett. In Arnett, this court construed a plea agreement in which the defendant assented to the forfeiture of the $3000 on his person at the time of the arrest as prohibiting the government from seeking forfeiture of the defendant's house and farm. During the course of the negotiations concerning the plea in Arnett, the government's attorney stated that the government had no interest in the farm. 804 F.2d at 1202. The court rejected the argument that the agreement did not restrict the government from seeking further forfeitures. In addition, the court refused to hold that the defendant's statement in open court that there were no other agreements with the government precluded him from challenging the forfeitures. Id. at 1203-04. We find, based on the uncontroverted evidence regarding the intent of the parties, that the plea agreement precluded the imposition of the $100,000 fine.
The final dispute concerns the stipulation in the plea agreement that "quantity involved ... is approximately 13 grams of cocaine." Plea Agreement at p 5(a). This term was added to the plea agreement during the negotiations. On the face of the agreement, the stipulation only applies to Jimmy Jefferies. During the sentencing hearing, AUSA Duke introduced evidence to show that the Jefferies were involved in a large scale cocaine operation. Based upon this information the court disregarded the stipulation and found that the quantity involved was 15 kilograms.6 The court applied this finding to both defendants.7 The defendants argue that this conclusion was prohibited by the plea agreement. In addition, they argue that the government's attempts to prove that more than 13 grams were involved violates the agreement. The defendants objected to this evidence and to the finding. R6-192-197.
The defendants base their argument that the finding was prohibited by the agreement on the plea negotiations. The appendix shows that the stipulation was added to the agreement during the negotiations. In addition, the affidavits establish that the 13 gram stipulation was intended to prevent precisely the type of finding that was made at sentencing. Little described the negotiations regarding this count in the following manner:
During the plea negotiations, affiant made calls to the United States Parole Commission and reported to Mr. Lukemire her findings therein. Affiant also conferred with Mrs. Sandra Popson, attorney for co-defendant Griggs, and discussed the terms of the plea agreement with both Mrs. Popson and Mr. Lukemire, including any parole considerations arising from the entry of the plea. Christopher W. Duncan, attorney for Betty Jefferies, was also consulted and took part in the discussions concerning the joint plea agreement. Affiant advised Mr. Lukemire that her client would be willing to enter a guilty plea to Count 2 of the indictment, provided that he could be assured that the offense severity category would be no higher than a Level 4 for parole purpose. Mr. Lukemire agreed to those terms and also agreed to stipulate, in writing, that the offense involved approximately 13 grams of cocaine. Mrs. Popson reached a similar agreement with Mr. Lukemire and the plea bargain entered into by her client also specified the amount of contraband involved in that case. Specifically, affiant advised Mr. Lukemire that the Parole Board had stated that the parole guidelines required service of 12 to 18 months imprisonment.
Little Affidavit at p 2. We conclude that the agreement precluded the finding that Jimmy Jefferies was involved in transactions other than the 13 grams stipulated to in the agreement.
Betty Jefferies' attorney also discussed the parole consequences of the agreement with the government. While the stipulation did not explicitly apply to her, the government agreed that based on the plea Betty Jefferies would serve a maximum of 12 months and could possibly receive probation. Duncan Affidavit at pp 7-8. Betty Jefferies argues that such an agreement implies that the court would not make the 15 kilogram finding. We agree. While the government and the defendant cannot stipulate the parole consequences of a particular sentence, they can agree that the defendant will admit to particular conduct and the government will not attempt to show that other conduct was involved. In this case, the parties made precisely that type of agreement. An agreement that Betty Jefferies would serve no more than 12 months by its very nature presumes that a finding that she was involved in a 15 kilogram cocaine offense would not be made. Therefore, we hold that the agreement precluded the 15 kilogram finding applied to Betty Jefferies.
The government argues that the plea agreement did not restrict them from producing evidence at sentencing. The affidavits describing the negotiations, however, explicitly contradict this contention. See Duncan Affidavit at p 8 (the government agreed that it "would make no attempt to influence the court or the parole board by 'packing' the pre-sentence report with prejudicial material"). The government also agreed to make no recommendation at all on the tax count or on the issue of whether Jimmy Jefferies would receive a concurrent or consecutive sentence. Little Affidavit at p 3; Duncan Affidavit at p 8. The plea agreement was changed to reflect this arrangement. See Appendix at p 6(b). In addition, the agreement stated that the government would not seek additional "prosecutions" for "offenses which are now known to the government." Plea Agreement at p 6(c).
We find that this case is controlled by our decision in United States v. Tobon-Hernandez, 845 F.2d 277 (11th Cir.1988). In that case the government and the defendant agreed to allow the defendant to plead guilty to cocaine possession and conspiracy counts and stipulated that the 14 kilograms found in the defendant's car at the time of his arrest was the amount of cocaine involved in the offense. The government agreed to drop the count alleging possession of some 432 kilograms found in a house the defendant had left just prior to his arrest. At sentencing, however, the government introduced the evidence pertaining to the 432 kilograms. On appeal the government argued that the evidence was properly considered in connection with the conspiracy count. On the basis of the Rule 11 hearing, however, this court found that the plea excluded the 432 kilograms from the conspiracy. The court described the Rule 11 hearing in that case in the following manner:
In order to clarify the scope of the conspiracy charge, defense counsel stated to the court at the rule 11 hearing, 'We agreed and stipulated that the conspiracy only pertains to Count II of the 14 kilos approximately found in the car.' (Emphasis added.) When the district court asked the prosecutor to confirm defense counsel's version of the stipulation which limited the conspiracy count to the 14 kilograms found in the automobile, the prosecutor replied, 'Your Honor, I would agree with that; ... so, I would agree with the statement as far as we are concerned with the conspiracy. We have no problem tying that in solely to Count II.' (Emphasis added.)
845 F.2d at 279. This court construed the agreement in that case as prohibiting the government from introducing evidence indicating that the defendant was connected to the 432 kilograms found in the house. Id. Similarly, based on the uncontradicted evidence of the agreements made in this case, we find that the government was prohibited from introducing evidence implicating the defendants in illegal drug offenses other than the 13 grams found in the defendants' house at the time of their arrest.
C.
Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(e)(3) provides:
Acceptance of a Plea Agreement. If the court accepts the plea agreement, the court shall inform the defendant that it will embody in the judgment and sentence the disposition provided for in the plea agreement.
The district court accepted the plea agreement. R6-196. When a plea agreement has not been followed by the government or the court, there are two possible remedies. The court can order specific performance of the agreement or afford the defendant the opportunity to withdraw the plea. Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 263, 92 S.Ct. 495, 499, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971). While the choice of a remedy is within the discretion of the court rather than the defendant, the remedy of withdrawal of the guilty plea has not been favored in this circuit. See Tobon-Hernandez, 845 F.2d at 281 (remanding for specific performance), United States v. Nelson, 837 F.2d 1519, 1525 (11th Cir.) (same), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 829, 109 S.Ct. 829, 102 L.Ed.2d 58 (1988); Arnett, 804 F.2d at 1204 (granting writ of mandamus and ordering specific performance). In this case, the defendant requests specific performance rather than a withdrawal of the plea.
We VACATE that part of the sentence that imposes a $100,000 fine against the two defendants. We MODIFY that part of the district court's finding that the quantity of cocaine was 15 kilograms and direct the entering of a finding that the quantity involved as to each defendant was 13 grams of cocaine. In all other respects, the sentence is AFFIRMED.8
VACATED in part, MODIFIED in part, and AFFIRMED in part.

SO AGREED, this 10th day of October, 1988.
Honorable C. Clyde Atkins, Senior U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of Florida, sitting by designation
The original version of the plea agreement drafted by Mr. Lukemire with the modifications made during the plea negotiations are attached to this opinion as an appendix
The defendants also argue that (1) Jimmy Jefferies's prior convictions were improperly considered by the district court; (2) the defendants were denied an adequate opportunity to present mitigating evidence; and (3) the information supporting the finding that the offense involved 15 kilograms of cocaine was unreliable. We affirm the district court's resolution of these issues based on 11th Circuit Rule 36-1
We note that, in addition to not contesting the allegations of the defendants, the government has not asked for this matter to be remanded to the district court for an evidentiary hearing. Given the fact that the government has made no effort to deny these allegations, "we must consider the record as we find it." United States v. Tobon-Hernandez, 845 F.2d 277, 280 n. * * (11th Cir.1988). As we noted in Tobon-Hernandez, it is the responsibility of the attorneys for both the government and the defendant to "clear up the confusion" concerning "the intent of the parties when entering into a plea agreement."
We also note that there is no evidence on the record regarding whether the term of supervised release violates the plea agreement. The trial record is silent, and unlike the other issues raised concerning the meaning of the agreement, the affidavits filed by the attorneys present at the plea negotiations do not address this issue
Jefferies also argues that the court violated Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1) when it failed to notify him of the mandatory term of supervised release that the court was required to impose under the terms of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b). Jimmy Jefferies was not notified either by the court or by his counsel of the possibility of this sentence, and he argues that this violation should be remedied by a reduction of his sentence to comply with his understanding. As with the claim that this term violated the plea agreement, Jefferies did not raise the Rule 11 error before the district court. We therefore find that any Rule 11 error with respect to this part of the sentence was also waived
The defendants explain that the finding that the offense involved 15 kilograms rather than the 13 grams agreed to in the stipulation is significant because it removes the possibility that the defendants will be paroled. See Little Affidavit at p 4; Duncan Affidavit at p 11. The government does not dispute this characterization
With respect to Jimmy Jefferies, the finding applied to the drug count. With respect to Betty Jefferies, the finding was applied to the tax count since Betty Jefferies had not pled guilty to a drug offense
In Tobon-Hernandez, the panel of our court remanded for resentencing. We find that this would merely add judicial labor to the district court in this case. Nevertheless, it is important that the United States Parole Commission be furnished with a copy of this opinion for the files on both defendants. This will insure that the Commission will use the "quantity involved in the offense" of 13 grams of cocaine rather than the quantity of 15 kilograms determined by the district court in contravention to the terms of the plea agreement. The importance of assigning the proper severity rating for purposes of parole is discussed in Tobon-Hernandez, 845 F.2d at 280
This appendix was created by comparing the first draft of the plea agreement authored by the government with the final draft of the agreement signed by the parties. The first draft of the agreement was included as an exhibit filed with the appellants' brief and made part of the record in this case by this court's order of August 2, 1989. Text appearing in standard type appears in both versions of the agreement. Text appearing in [DELETED: this type] appeared in the draft but was deleted from the final agreement. Text appearing in [DELETED: this type] did not appear in the draft but was added to the final agreementResearchers have found that common household noises may be making dogs anxious.

Ashoka students call off strike over professor's resignation, vow to continue to fight injustice across India
The students thanked the V-C for being receptive to their proposed changes in a public letter
Students during a sit-in protest | Pic (Sourced)
The students of Ashoka University have ended the strike started after the resignation of Pratap Bhanu Mehta. ", they said in the letter. "We sincerely appreciate your participation in the protest. With the Vice Chancellor's email today morning, we are officially closing the strike," they added. ", the students said.
"We would like to sincerely thank all the people on-campus for fighting in our stead, for challenging and questioning without fear, and most of all, for holding sit-ins, painting protest art, and working towards making Our Ashoka. For those of us who were online, we needed to find a way to show collective solidarity through a screen. You organised reading circles, club events, plays and so much more in a pandemic. We thank the alums for their continued support as well", they added.
"To the Vice-Chancellor, we thank you for being so receptive to our proposed changes and for your commitment to work with us to the best of your ability in building a more representative Ashoka. To our Professors, TAs and TFs, we have nothing but appreciation. You have supported us by cancelling classes or creating a space to discuss Prof. Mehta and Prof. Subramanian's resignations", the students said.
"We are at a critical juncture -- the university is growing and we must grow with it. The way we proceed going forward will leave an impact on the way Ashoka treats its own stakeholders as well as those outside of it. We were able to meet unprecedented demands after protesting for six days and boycotting classes for two. Public universities across the country strike for weeks and months on end, often to fulfill basic needs, and even then they are not always successful. We must forge deeper solidarities with student unions and collectives fighting against injustice throughout India", they added.

Nokia already confirmed the Nokia Lumia 800 UK release date and Nokia Lumia 800 Specs in the hope of raining on the parade of the HTC Titan to be one of the first and best Windows 7.5 smartphones in UK.
After running through our tests at T3 labs, we can tell you it is one of, if not the, best Microsoft Windows 7.5 smartphones on the market. It is also very competitively priced.
Nokia Lumia 800: OS
Microsoft's Windows Phone OS is fast becoming a decent competitor to the likes of Android or iOS, although it's still a way from being their equal.
We love the easy way you can link together contacts with a swish of a finger and the simple Live Tiles to help see information in a trice, but there are still some issues: having to convert any video you want to watch is tiresome.
But many will love the simplicity of Microsoft's OS - simply flicking the finger left and right will jump between the informative Live Tiles and the list of downloaded applications. It's apple-esque in its speed under the finger, and something newbies will warm to instantly.: Design
Using the design of the ill-fated Nokia N9, the Lumia 800 brings a curved polycarbonate chassis that's coloured the whole way through, making it light in the hand and very hard to damage.
The curved nature of the chassis also lends a neat design aesthetic to the handset, marking it out well from the reams of sharp looking behemothic handsets on the market right now.
Nokia Lumia 800: Screen
The ClearBlack OLED screen is also top notch, with the edge to edge display beneath the curved Gorilla Glass looking the part, especially impressing when taken out into blinding daylight and you don't have to simply guess at what you're prodding on the screen.
It's not as impressive when it comes to internet browsing, as despite packing in 800 x 480 pixels words still look a little rough around the edges when zoomed out.: Verdict
Nokia's CEO Stephen Elop called this the 'first.

I haven't had a big anxiety attack like this since probably February 2018, if this is even anxiety. Last week my middle finger started twitching on my left hand. I tried not to think anything of it, but it went on for about 3 days. Then my hand started feeling weak. I didn't drop anything but it didn't feel right, and I could tell. Then my chin started having random tremors. I started freaking out silently. Yesterday I came to work, and my left hand hurt, SO BAD! It was like major aching for at least 3-4 hours and then after lunch it just stopped! (thankfully, I have a desk job and type on a keyboard all day) But then the weakness came back. I was stupid and googled. I read an article from Cosmopolitan that talked about a 25 year old girl who developed ALS and yes, I read every single symptom she had like slurred speech, weakness, etc. I freaked out to my boyfriend, who helped calm me for the evening but then this morning I woke up and my speech feels slurred. I feel like my tongue is really big in my mouth and I'm talking funny. I also seem to be typing slower than normal and now BOTH my hands feel weak. I'm just a hot mess guys. I'm only 25. I don't want to die so quickly and especially from ALS. I was doing so good for so long and then this ALS fear hits me out of nowhere and now I can't tell what's anxiety and what isn't. HELP!

It put into words what I had always perceived to be true but had not yet ever tried to articulate.
During the very first nationally televised general-election debate in the United States—the showdown between Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy in 1960—it is said that Kennedy looked great and Nixon looked terrible, and that this visual difference had an unexpected electoral effect. Theodore H. White described in his hugely influential book The Making of the President 1960 that “sample surveys” after the debate found that people who had only heard Kennedy and Nixon talking, over the radio, thought that the debate had been a tie. But those who saw the debate on television were more likely to think that Kennedy—the handsome, tanned, non-sweaty, poised—had won.
This data can’t necessarily be proved, but from a modern perspective, the only surprising thing about his findings is that they came as a surprise. And to quote the author, “Today’s electorate has decades of televised politics behind it, from which one assumption is that of course images, and their emotional power, usually matter more than words and whatever logic they might try to convey.”
So hence a culminating observation: “The most accurate way to predict reaction to a debate is to watch it with the sound turned off.”
Amazing. We all know the pen is mightier than the sword. But who would have guessed what would rise up to be mightier than the pen? The camera. And the warrior who unassumingly stands behind it’s powerful influence on the minds of men in the world of politics.
Very thought provoking.
That’s very true. It’s amazing how the media effects our society.Whenever you are observing Japanese cartoon, it is perhaps not unusual that you observe the enormous spiders at such show that stroll round, do conflict using large firearms and missiles, ruining every thing for miles round? In the event you might have, then exactly what you watched was unquestionably mecha music! By today, a lot of the under-30 audience has viewed a lot of those excellent mecha anime, specially together with the development of this Voltes V and Gundam Wing generations วันพีชตอนล่าสุด. However, what’s the mecha style simply?
Really the expression’mecha anime’ can be an expression maybe not broadly utilized in Japan and is traditionally used chiefly by supporters of this genre across the globe. Even the mecha anime is still a arcade where the storyline is based on a robot, so commonly 20 ft tall or longer, outfitted using various weapons,” and it is typically tacky and
piloted
from the protagonist of this narrative (and almost certainly due to its own antagonist along with also other personalities too well).
The style commenced using Mitsuteru Yokoyama’s 1956 manga’Tetsujin 28-go’, whose arcade variant,’Gigantor’ premiered in 1963, even though addition with the anime is normally debated by pros as the system has been commanded by distant as opposed to by the cockpit within just the robot. The au thor, Move Nagai, manufactured probably one of their absolute most notable invention, the very first common Super Robot arcade show: Mazinger Z. This started out the revolution which dissipates in the increase of mecha anime into the particular day.One Week to Party Time!

In a straw poll conducted between 18 March and budget night (2 April) on the My Business site, readers were asked the question, “Regardless of who wins the federal election, what single thing could the next government do support your business?”, with six options to choose from.
The 208 respondents were split on which measure would best support their business, but three stood out as being the most crucial for either major party to win their support.
At the top of the wish list was business tax cuts, with 28.4 per cent stipulating this as their most desired form of government support.
But other types of support were not directly related to finances. Businesses are crying out for simplification of the regulations strangling them: 26 per cent called for simplification of the Fair Work Act, and a further 25.5 per cent want a reduction of red tape more generally.
Of the remaining respondents to the poll, almost one in 10 (9.6 per cent) want to see government support for new growth opportunities, 6.7 per cent want to see unfair contracts formally banned. Just 3.8 per cent said that standardising payment terms would be of most benefit to their business.
Did they get it?
For the most part, yes.
Tax cuts formed the centrepiece of Treasurer Josh Frydenberg’s first budget. The government committed to “fast-tracking” cuts to the rate at which small business tax is charged, taking it to 25 per cent by the 2022 financial year.
In the budget, it also promised to deliver both immediate and longer-term cuts to personal income tax rates, the latter to be achieved by structural reforms to tax bands.
Labor has already revealed that it, too, plans to introduce tax cuts, more details of which are expected in its impending budget reply.
Unfair contracts are also set to go. As revealed before the budget was handed down, both the government and the opposition have pledged to ban unfair contract terms in standard form contracts used between large businesses and SMEs, with hefty penalties attached for multinationals and large companies that fail to comply.
There was also growth assistance announced in the budget. The headline measure came in the form of an expanded instant asset write-off, which for the first time would be made eligible to businesses with annual turnover of up to $50 million (up from the current $10 million), for assets worth up to $30,000.
This measure will be available for all business assets purchased within a tax year up to that value.
And a further $60 million was pledged to support businesses seeking to export.
Regulation a sticking point
Arguably the biggest downside for SMEs to come out of the budget relates to red tape and regulation. Under the budget, additional regulatory requirements were announced, rather than the curbs to red tape SMEs had been desperately hoping for.
Likely to be a controversial change is the proposed reform to the ABN system, with the government wanting to scrap ABNs for life and introduce new reporting measures, whereby ABN holders would have to provide income tax figures and update their details to the ATO every year.
Fair Work compliance was also outlined in the budget, with the Fair Work Ombudsman to be given $2.3 million each year on an ongoing basis to fund investigations and prosecution of sham contracts by employers.
More funds — to the tune of $4.3 million over four years — were also given to the Fair Work Commission, to appoint additional staff.
Rather than cut red tape, the budget tended to focus more on boosting support for SMEs to navigate it, such as the creation of a Small Business Taxation Division within the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, extra funding for free legal advice on employment law and a Small Business Concierge Service to provide tax-related advice and support through the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman (ASBFEO).
Targeting skills shortages
Not included in the My Business poll was action to address chronic skills shortages, with the issue attracting significant investment within the budget.
The government said that it would direct $525 million to “upgrade and modernise” vocational education and training (VET).
Under this spending, employers were promised incentives worth an extra $4,000 — over and above the existing $4,000 incentives — to take on and complete new apprenticeships. Eligible occupations include carpentry, plumbing, hairdressing, airconditioning and refrigeration mechanics, bricklayers, plasterers, bakers and pastry cooks, vehicle painters, wall and floor tilers as well as arborists.
Some $62.4 million was allocated to boost language, literacy, numeracy and digital skills of adults and school leavers aged 15 to 44 years to boost their employability.
The government also announced that it would establish 10 training hubs, at a cost of $50.6 million, to facilitate better connections between employers and up to 3,000 school students over four years.
These, and other, measures would be overseen by a new National Skills Commission, which would work in conjunction with state and territory governments to develop a consistent national approach to VET.The government will pay allowance for unemployed youth but will use their services in one way or other. To counter this pensions and allowances, Opposition Leader YS Jagan Mohan Reddy announced a new pension scheme.
If voted to power, Jagan promised to give pension to everyone who is above 45 years ago. Currently, pensions are being given to those who are aged above 65 years. Giving pension to people above 45 years will be a game changer, Jagan feels.

We』ve been so fortunate to be able to offer you a very generous 5% cash back rate at one of your favorite online stores, Amazon.
As they say, all good things must come to an end. We』ve been notified by Amazon that we will no longer be able to offer 5% cash back, effectiveNovember 1 at 12:01am Pacific Time.
$#%&! We get it. It』s such a bummer.
The silver lining? You』ve still got time to shop. All qualifying purchases made at Amazon through October 31st will receive 5% cash back.
Amazon is almost the most frequently used shopping website in the United States for its wide variety of products, good customer service attitude as well as reassuring after-sales service. Naturally, it becomes one of the preferred online shopping websites for the international students in North America. In addition to the Amazon cash back generated by credit card, customers could get extra cash back through the Shopping Portals. Among them, the most awesome cash back website should be Giving Assistant, because it surpasses in all aspects other Amazon cash back websites. Although we have mentioned it in How to Save Money on Amazon, it is necessary for us to make special introduction to some details and skills.
- The cash back rate is 5% for all products without category limit.
- Cash back directly enters into the debit card without exchanging Gift Card.
- There is almost no limitation on the cash amount for exchange, even I dollar could exchange, while the starting point of many other shopping websites is 10 dollars.
- Giving Assistant closes the account daily while some other cash back websites settle the account every month or every three months.
- The most unbelievable part is that the cash back rate for Amazon Gift Card is also 5%. Assuming that you buy something that is $100, you can buy a $100 gift card through the Giving Assistant to earn 5% cash back, then buy things with this $100 gift card to earn another 5% cash back on the Giving Assistant. So in this way the total rate is 5%+5%=10%. If the above rate goes together with the Amazon cash back rate 5%*2 on $1500 on Discover It, the cash back rate is 20% for all products in Amazon.
Cash back on Giving Assistant is pretty awesome. However, there are somethings we need to pay attention to. Otherwise neglecting of them leads to the failure of cash back identification. The official website provides some guidance (as showed in the above figure) on Amazon Cask Back. We would like to summarize it again as follows:
- You can only earn cashback from stuff “sold by Amazon.com”
- Don』t put things you want to buy in the shopping cart in advance and then buy them through the Giving Assistant. You must enter into Amazon via Giving Assistant and then put things into the shopping cart. Save for Later goods can be added. You can click buy it again to buy goods you have brought before under my orders.
- Don』t disable cookies. For example, Chrome incognito mode and Safari private mode will lead to the failure of cookies』 normal use and get no cash back.
- Don』t disable Ads. For instance, Chrome』s AdBlock plugin needs to be disabled and then you can use Giving Assistant.
- After entering Amazon links via Giving Assistant you must complete the purchase within 24 hours or the tracking will fail.
- Discover is not available to the binding debit card. I tried three times and failed. BoA and Chase are ok.
It is time to show off my achievements. I have gained several cash back from Giving Assistant. Now I would like to display the biggest one in this month.
Last but not the least, if you direct register the website you cannot get $5 cash back. But If you register via refer you will get $5 cask back. Here is the link: Giving Assistant.
P.S. The original purpose of this website is to let you donate a portion of your cashback to people in hunger… You can go and set it up, donate to charity while earning cashback, so that make it a better world!Youth Symphony Orchestra names new music director
The Wichita Falls Youth Symphony Orchestra Board of Directors announced the approval of Dr. Matthew D. Luttrell as the new music director for the 2021-2022 season.
Luttrell will be the principal conductor of the symphonic orchestra, as well.
“He has already earned our respect, and we are excited to see his creativity, knowledge and dedication channeled in this new position,” said YSO Board Chair Dana Taylor. “With Dr. Luttrell, we expect the very highest level of education and experience for our students.”
Luttrell earned his doctorate in musical arts from the Arizona State University with an emphasis in wind conducting. His master’s in music education is from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and his bachelor of music education from the University of Colorado at Boulder.
Luttrell is taking over for Dr. Susan Harvey, who served as the YSO music director for eight years.
“We’ve been fortunate to have someone like Dr. Harvey with such a heart for our students and such skill,” said Jean Hall, YSO Executive Director, “And now we are delighted to have Dr. Luttrell stepping into the role. He will be a valuable asset to the organization and to the students. Providing value to the students is the core of our mission.”
The YSO is taking applications to fill the spot for the philharmonic orchestra conductor.

Mr. President,
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
On behalf of the Government of Japan, I would like to warmly welcome everyone and thank you all for travelling to Tokyo to attend the Fourth Conference of States Parties (CSP4) to Arms Trade Treaty (ATT). I would also like to express my sincere appreciation for the cooperation and support the stakeholders of this conference, including civil society, academia and industry, have extended to Japan.
The unregulated or illicit trade of conventional weapons has caused devastating human suffering and regional instability which undermines social and economic development. Japan has been actively engaged in the rule-making process with regard to conventional weapons. The ATT represents such efforts and its fulfillment as a treaty is undoubtedly a landmark achievement.
The Treaty aims to enhance regional and international peace and security through the appropriate control of the international trade and the prevention of illicit transfer of conventional weapons, including small arms and light weapons. Given such objectives, the ATT is now facing two imminent challenges, universalization of the Treaty and its effective implementation.
As the first country in Asia to serve as President, Japan has actively pursued the ATT's universalization in cooperation with the ATT Secretariat, co-chair of the Working Group on Universalization, Finland, and other like-minded countries. I welcome the news that the number of States Parties has increased by five, including one from Asia. To continue to increase the number of States Parties, we should work together to promote the value and role of ATT.
As for the steady and effective implementation, Japan has submitted two working papers we hope to be incorporated into the outcome of CSP4.
Japan has financially contributed to Voluntary Trust Fund (VTF) in March of this year to promote the treaty's effective and transparent implementation.
Japan provided support to countries in need for capacity building as well.
We believe we need to work with the Reporting to the UN Register of Conventional Arms (UNROCA) and the UN Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons (UNPOA) for the effective implementation. Both the UNPOA and ATT discussed diversion, which affects a number of stakeholders. I hope the thematic discussion on diversion planned in this conference will contribute to effectively addressing and countering the issue.
During the Third Review Conference of the UNPOA and the CSP4 preparatory process, we had active and fruitful
discussions regarding the close linkages between ATT and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We believe the implementation of the ATT promotes the achievement of the SDGs.
In closing, I would like to once again thank civil society, NGOs, the private sector, and the other various stakeholders for their contribution to the Treaty.
I hope you will have fruitful discussions in Tokyo. Thank you very much.
(END)We understand you’re here to get some clarity on your process. Yes, you recently started an agile way of managing your projects and riding a roller coaster ride. But, you still have the confidence of doing things better the next time. Appreciate your efforts and would like to share some suggestions to make it happen.
You guessed it right, this article will not beat around the bush talking about a sprint, the retrospectives, popular ways to achieve them etc. We are well aware that many blogs have a come up with all the following methods demonstrated in the infographics. Therefore, we will make you think differently to become a pro to make changes in your organization and achieve the goal. To understand more about sprint retrospective one should attend Scrum Master Certification.
Before that let’s not deviate from the topic and yes we will be discussing the sprint retrospective only. This is a discussion; no rather I call it a brainstorming session to not find the mistakes in the current sprint but to make changes proactively to not make mistakes in future sprints.
Change your approach this way to make changes
Every 4 weeks sprint will be followed by a retrospective to understand what went wrong and this last for more than 3 hours. So we will provide you with an innovative approach to handle the session in an effective way to implement changes immediately. After using these approaches, you can see the team coming forward with output and you need not chase them for results.
These are indeed effective and read more to agree with us.
1.Involve the Team
How can you arrive at results without the team? Do you think the PO, SM, and the PM does the job? Then you’re wrong. It is the team the developer and the tester who are the core for successful completion of the work. If you agree with this, then you will certainly include the team in your meeting. Involving alone will not help, but they must be empowered to talk.
Know what happens today in every meeting – The team is called for the SRM and bombarded with questions about what went wrong, why it happened etc. The team tries to explain but no one hears them out. This meeting conducted for hours will not produce any results.
Instead – do it this way – Call the team and ask them to share their views without any questions. Let them speak their mind. Allow them to explain why it went wrong. Make them think who is responsible for the same. This is the same as before but with the difference that they are empowered to speak and it is not a fault finding meeting. This small space given to them will let them take the ownership and they will run with the project next time.
2.Carefully choose the facilitator
The facilitator is as important as the team because this person holds the key to the meeting. The way the meeting is conducted relies on this person’s hands. So it is important that this person is rotated to breath fresh air every time. Yes, each individual will have a different innovative thought process and will help the team find new ways to work for the next sprint.
At the same time remember that the facilitator must not be an amateur person. Further, ensure he/she should be able to coach the team in the right direction. Therefore choose a facilitator wisely to progress upward during the next sprint.
3.Follow a simple process
Now, the team is empowered and the facilitator is ready to drive the team. What next, devise a process? But, make it simple. Leave the decision making of starting which module, stopping which one and continuing to the team. They are the batsman and let them have that liberty of deciding. Do not force them to complete the task based on a high-level need. The final goal is to deliver the product to the owner per specification. This is done by dividing the work into small chunks for every sprint. So let the team decide the first, second etc. Both way it won’t harm as the end result will be the same and that is the end product. So chill, and let the team run the show.
4.The novel approach to impact even the naïve team
Here, let me talk about an important concept called a novel approach. Nothing is technical here, but introduce some games to get work done. Wondering how come games help in a retrospective meeting? It will and find the explanation below with a couple of examples.
LEGO game – LEGO yes the same game which most of us loved to play when we were kids. Use the blocks and show your creativity. The same concept will be used here. Get all team members to form a circle and sit to play with the LEGO bricks. Keep the BGM on; yes let them have the party fun.
- Ask them to build the figure reflecting the sprint using the bricks.
- Let them have no restriction to use bricks and provide each guy sufficient time to complete.
- Upon completion ask them to explain about the figure. They will pour their concerns here forgetting that it is a sprint retrospective.
- Now, ask them to make a figure which will help them do better in the next sprint. Remind them to think of a model keeping the solution in mind and not the problem.
After this talk to them and freeze on a solid action point. You’re done!.
RETRO game – Here you can make use of cards with 3 basic questions and distribute individually to each team member. The questions are as follows. Note: You need not to use the same questions but in the same lines frame questions to make your team think. Make many questions for each category and arrange them.
- What is in your mind right now?
- What is required to succeed?
- How to reach the end result?
Give them the rule cards to explain the game rules. Use dice and ask each person to roll the dice. You can choose this order based on your convenience. When the dice display number 1, 2 or 3 choose one card from the category one, 4 means category two, and 5 or 6 categories 3. The person will read the question and share their answers with the team. Once they complete others can share their views as well. Likewise continue and get answers for all questions.
It is nothing different from a traditional meeting but when you say game, and then the team feels motivated and involve themselves to find a solution. Your next sprint will show positive results as you have geared up the team now.
In summary, use these tactics and bring the best out of your team to achieve the goal.

StairliftChicago.com is a company that understands these difficulties, and we are here to serve you with a product that can change your life by helping you gain your mobility back. A stairlift, also known as a chairlift or stair chair, is a type of lift that we offer here at StairliftChicago.com, and we know that installing one in your Naperville home or office will help you gain your independence back. If you are in the area and looking for a stairlift, read on to find out more about us and our quality stairlifts!
A Bruno Stairlifts Dealer
As a company that is known to be the best in the area, we have to have products that match. We have a great selection of stairlifts, allowing us to put one in any Naperville home. We have partnered with Bruno, a manufacturer of high quality stairlifts. After years of being in the accessibility industry, we have found that Bruno stairlifts are the best lifts available, allowing us to ensure quality and safety in all of our installations. Bruno lifts are made with high quality materials and are built to last.
Thanks to innovations from Bruno, we can get a stairlift installed into any home with no problems. We offer three basic lift types that covers every stairlift need. A straight stairlift is your basic stairlift that travels a straight path. This is made for regular stairs that go up and down in a straight line. We also offer custom curved stairlifts, which are custom made for homes that have a set of stairs that go around bends and curve in various ways that are unique to your home. Lastly, we offer outdoor stairlifts for lifts that are made for any set of stairs that are outdoors, such as porch stairs. These lifts provide the same smooth ride and comfort that an indoor stairlift provides, but is built with weather-resilient materials that allow it to stand up to the elements of the outdoors. Naperville weather is no match for a Bruno stairlift!
Our lifts are easily installed into the home without heavy, intrusive modifications. Without damaging your home’s walls, you can have a stairlift in your home to help you gain your mobility back with ease. These lifts get installed to the stairs themselves rather than the wall via a railing that the chair travels along. This railing is sturdy and durable, allowing you to reliably go between floors with ease multiple times safely and smoothly.
StairliftChicago.com is a Branch of the Access Family of Companies!
We are a branch of Access, a company local to Wisconsin that also operates in select parts of Illinois. We provide the same wonderful products and fantastic service to both areas, however. Naperville is a location that we serve with pride, and we look forward to helping you get a new stairlift. Please contact us today to get started and get yourself a stairlift for your Naperville home!Email and email terminology these days can be quite complicated, below you’ll find a list of the key terms you might come across or need:
Forwarder
A forwarder is a way to relay an email from one email account to another automatically as soon as the email is received. This can be useful if you have multiple email accounts and just want to be able to read all of the emails in one place. The only downside is that you can’t reply to an email received to another address and have the reply appear as though it came from the aforementioned account.
CC and BCC
CC (Carbon Copy) is a way to send an email to multiple addresses by copying them in, but not have their mail address in the main To field. Each recipient of the email will see the email addresses of people on the CC list.
BCC (Blind Carbon Copy) is another way to send multiple people emails, but putting an email address in the BCC field is a way to not have each recipient know the email addresses of other recipients.
Bounceback
A bounceback is somewhat similar to returning a physical letter to the sender. A bounceback message is received when the email fails to send. Potential reasons for this could be the recipient email account does not exist, the server is unavailable, the recipient’s inbox is full or perhaps your email address is being marked as spam.
Autoresponder
This is an automatic email response. It’s often used for Out-of-Office automatic replies.
Shared Mailbox
This is an inbox that can be used and accessed by multiple people, but with this the password for the account in question is not shared by the users.
Delegation
This allows somebody else to access and manage emails and calendar appointments for a user without giving them the password. This could be useful when you’re unavailable and need a colleague to manage emails and calendar appointments.
Groups
An email group is when an email address is created without a mailbox associated, any email sent to that email address will be received by any person (mailbox) associated with the group.
POP, IMAP, and SMTP
POP, IMAP, and SMTP are protocols for sending and receiving emails. Your email client (such as Outlook, Thunderbird, Mac Mail, and iPhone/iPad Mail etc) will likely use these protocols for connecting to the server. As a general rule, the login for the SMTP server will be the same as POP or IMAP (depending on your setup).
POP is useful if you wish to download emails from the email server and have them be removed from the server but still stored on your device as soon as your email client downloads them. This is not ideal if you have multiple devices (such as an iPad, iPhone, and laptop).
IMAP is a protocol that allows you to sync your email inbox with the server and any other devices. Generally when using IMAP, your emails stay on the server and your devices. When you read an email, the email will be marked as read on all of your devices too.
SMTP is the protocol used for sending emails.
This is (in essence) the machine that your emails are sent to and stored on. When you receive an email, the email is transported from the sender’s computer, to their email server, and then to our email servers, and then to your device.
Inbox Limit
An inbox limit is the amount of storage your inbox is capable of holding. Imagine it as though it’s a USB memory stick getting filled up when you create and save new documents. Emails these days tend to be quite small so it’s unlikely that you’ll ever reach your inbox limit, but if you do your account will be automatically suspended by our servers once you reach the limit.Well ~ at last my DH and I decided on a new color for the kitchen walls.
Gee, you'd think I was making decision with global implications for as long as it took me to choose a new color. There were paint color samples all over the place.
Here's the boring before..... yawn....of course this was after the ugly wallpaper came down.
here's the change in progress....
Anyway we decided to be brave and venture out of the comfort zone with this choice. It's not really aqua and not green either but somewhere in between. It's a little darker than the pics show.
It's a nice compliment to the terra cotta color of the floor and the straw colored countertops. The first couple of days when I walked around the corner into the kitchen it was like - WOW - but we like it. Now we just have to get some new wall art and decor to complete the new look. I came across a modern leaf print at the All Modern online store. I like that the print is only 12" tall so it would fit in the space under the cabinets.
I'll have to ponder on that a bit longer ~ LOLSiding Resources

About Real Cedar
Are you considering building a Western Red Cedar deck? Good call! Nothing looks, feels or smells quite like naturally beautiful Real Cedar. But it doesn’t only look great, it’s also an incredibly durable building material that is naturally resistant to rot, decay and insects. This means it’s a sound investment for your home and quality of life, as it’s going to last you many fun-filled years to come. Or maybe you recently purchased a home that already has a Real Cedar deck installed and you’re not sure how to finish cedar decking. Whether it’s a modest patio or an expansive wraparound deck, you need the lowdown on all the finishing options for your cedar deck.
But, where to begin? Below is a brief summary of how you can best enhance the performance of your deck with minimal maintenance. For a complete breakdown of best practices, download this free, comprehensive How to Finish Western Red Cedar guide.
Compared to siding applications, decks endure a lot more wear and tear. There’s foot traffic and furniture friction to contend with, as well as sunlight and rain beating directly down on the boards. So, rule number one is always use finishing products specially formulated for decks. Within this wide range of products, there are three major considerations to factor in. The first is what is the desired “look”? Do you simply want to maintain the wood’s original luster? Or do you want create drama by contrasting your deck with your home’s exterior? Or maybe you simply want the lowest maintenance option?
Next, you want to figure out how much time you’re prepared to spend on refinishing your deck. Some products have longer service lives than others. Some last as long as two or three years. Others need to be reapplied every year. And finally, you need to factor in your climatic conditions. Once you’ve considered all of the above, you can then choose from the following three finishing options for your cedar deck:
If you’re looking for the lowest maintenance option, you can always let your cedar deck weather naturally. Depending on the environment and design, your cedar deck will still enjoy a long service life. When left unfinished, a cedar deck will eventually turn a beautiful silvery patina.
An alternative would to be apply a transparent water repellent. These products only need to be reapplied every 2 to 4 to reinvigorate water repellency.
If you want cedar’s natural tonal range and texture to show through, then consider a transparent stain. These are essentially colorless, but still enhance the service life of your deck. Look for quality products that contain UV filters that help protect from sun damage. These formulas should also contain mold and mildew inhibitors. Keep in mind, they do require frequent reapplication. Note: transparents and water repellents should not be applied on top of other products. Also, solvent borne, oil-based formulas are preferred, as they are well absorbed by the wood.
Cedar boasts a beautiful spectrum of colors ranging from golden honeys to rich reds to warm browns. If you want to enrich those hues, consider a lightly tinted, semi-transparent stain. These will provide color, but still let the wood’s natural grain and texture show through. The pigments in tinted stains provide more protection against UV than UV filters do in transparent stains. Again, look for solvent-borne, oil-based formulas, as they are better absorbed by the wood and don’t form a film.
Note: The better products contain mildewcides or fungicides.

WASHINGTON — While the Biden administration continues to ignore the dangerous situation at our southern border, Congresswoman Yvette Herrell (R-N.M.) this week wrote a letter to Vice President Kamala Harris and introduced two bills to address the ongoing crisis.
Coinciding with her fourth visit to the border since she was elected to Congress, Congresswoman Herrell invited Vice President Harris to visit the border in New Mexico's Second Congressional District and asked the vice president to bring her and other border-district lawmakers on her upcoming trip to Mexico and Guatemala. Harris has not visited the U.S. border since she was appointed border czar by President Biden on March 24.
"This crisis can only be solved with bipartisan input and perspective from those who represent areas along the southern border," Herrell wrote.  full text of Herrell's letter to Harris can be found HERE.
Legislation
Herrell this week also introduced two bills to address illegal immigration and its economic impact on border communities.
The Protecting Americans from Foreign Criminals Act would require comprehensive background checks for all illegal aliens who are detained in the U.S., and would prevent the release of any alien prior to the completion of their immigration case if they have any criminal convictions, terrorism, cartel or gang ties, or cannot be properly vetted.
"Biden administration policies welcome thousands of people into our country while allowing little if any time to conduct an in-depth criminal and national security background check," Herrell said. "This poses a clear and present danger to our communities."
In a March 2 letter, Herrell questioned Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas regarding his department's inability to adequately vet the illegal immigrants they apprehend.
Congresswoman Herrell also introduced the Repaying the Rural Borderlands Act to reimburse ranchers, farmers, homeowners, small businesses, and other property owners for the cost of damage or personal harm caused by illegal immigrants on or to their property. The legislation would also compensate state and local governments for the cost of feeding, housing, and transporting aliens upon release from federal custody.
"During my visits to the border, I've heard from ranchers about how illegal immigrants have torn down fences, destroyed crops, broke irrigation pipes, killed cattle, stolen vehicles, and even kidnapped ranch employees as they traverse their property to enter the country," said Herrell.
"Likewise, local leaders have explained how the cost of caring for immigrants drains the treasury of the most impoverished communities along the border, many of which are still reeling from the economic effects of the COVID-19 lockdowns."

I've managed to stick to my guns, but I did make an exception a few weeks back.
So what was it about this pair that caused me to break my self-imposed Topps NOW ban? Well, this is the first time a Topps NOW card has been issued for a game that I actually attended!
My best friend of 25 years and his longtime girlfriend joined my wife and I for the game. The Angels were in town, but we did not get to see Mike Trout play as he was out with his thumb injury at the time. The Sox got up early and never looked back en route to a 9-4 trouncing of LA. Throw in some post-game celebrating around Boston, capped off with some really late-night pizza, and it was a night to remember for me. Thanks to Topps I will do just that any time I see these two cards...

Great shot man, ran into Big Papi at FanFest in Miami and he seemed like a cool dude. Awesome you got to be there.
Fenway is just classic! I love the background on Pappi's NOW card. Your seats were phenomenal!
Great shot! The old ballpark looks fantastic. Lucky guy, you.
That's awesome! Honestly... the only time I'd really consider buying a Topps Now card is if I actually attended the game. What better way to preserve such an awesome memory.
Such a cool thing to witness. Glad you were able to be there.

Lizz taylerThree-1-Three is situated, as befits its name, three blocks off the central roundabout in Belleville, whose downtown is a microcosmic version of the same forces that have been battering and reshaping downtowns in small and big cities alike. Although still clean and pleasant, many storefronts are now either for lease or relegated to purposes other than that for which they were originally designed, and the principal industry in the immediate area seems to be law firms.
Nonetheless, part of this evolution has involved opportunity for revitalization, and Three-1-Three represents a wonderful recycling of a classic early 20th-century storefront. It's a long and deep space, with a high-ceilinged diner-style dining space passing through to a long bar and finally a stage area to the rear. From the more distant past, the ceiling in the front room is pressed tin and copper, painted in red and white; a decorative element of more recent influence is the eclectic collection of poster art. These include a Japanese tour poster for the Beatles from 1966; a quick-print, very ungraphical black-and-white promotion of the movie Easy Rider; and more recent stuff for Fragile Porcelain Mice and Bob. Also not to be missed is an authentic tabletop Asteroids arcade game.
In terms of the menu, nothing is more than 10 bucks, and daily specials every day except Sunday cater to the most minimal of budgets, including stuff like 50-cent tacos and sloppy joes, and a burger, fries and a draft beer for $3.13 on Saturdays. Among the main entrees, the emphasis appears to be on main ingredients that are a step or two out of the ordinary, supplemented by huge portions of side dishes. It's an excellent approach for sending 'em away with both full stomachs and full pockets, and it fits in nicely with Belleville's working-class history.
Even the appetizers are basically meals unto themselves. We had hoped to test our mettle with the "just this side of hell" wings "so hot, you have to sign a "waiver of liability' to eat them" but they were unavailable when we visited, ostensibly because the key ingredient, sworn not to be habanero peppers, had become difficult to obtain from the restaurant's supplier. So we settled for the just plain "famous" wings, choosing the spicy-lime sauce option over the Cajun version, which essentially meant standard but well-prepared Buffalo-style wings with a little lime added to the sauce and a bunch of quartered, sliced limes spread on top. It was OK, but not as intriguing as the openly challenging hell version.
Another appetizer called "knot joe's" (say it out loud) was notable primarily for its sheer volume, a full-dinner-sized Mexican salad with lots of black olives and sour cream over lettuce and tomatoes, with the tortilla chips shoved underneath almost as an afterthought. "Triangles" (and it's not just me all the menu items are listed in quotes) were basically a pita pizza, with pieces of pita bread topped with melted mozzarella, jack and Parmesan cheeses, served with salsa and sour-cream dips.
By far the most interesting of the appetizers we tried was the "Santa Fe springsticks," eight cigar-shaped fried tortilla rolls filled with chicken, onions, cheese and peppers not overly spicy, but well balanced and tasty.
Penne rigate seems to be the pasta of choice at Three-1-Three, showing up on no fewer than four of the seven regular-menu entrees and used in great quantity on the two we tried. Both the "herb & lime roasted chicken with penne pasta" and the slightly malapropist "classic chili mac" (the "mac" of choice certainly wasn't "classic") made appropriate use of the pasta as a background texture, flavoring it in the one case with chicken that had significant evidence of the lime marinade and in the other with a full-bodied, slightly spicy but not at all salty red-and-black-bean chili.
The "chile (and it was good to see a restaurant that knows the difference between chili and chile) rubbed prime rib and grilled shrimp skewers" were the best of the bunch that we tried, an under-$10 feast that included a small but well-cooked thin piece of rib and seven medium-large shrimp with both citrus and spice overtones. The "Cajun roasted Alaskan white fish," on the other hand, just didn't work right, the mild fish completely overwhelmed by the drenching cayenne sauce.
There are about a half-dozen beers on draft, plus another couple of dozen in bottles, and an entire menu is devoted to specialty drinks. Belleville's heritage is celebrated with a neon "Stag Beer on Tap" sign, and plenty of other interesting memorabilia is scattered throughout the restaurant.
Service was perfect on both of our visits, coming each time from a pleasantly sarcastic guy who doubled as the barkeep at one point, he told us that our appetizers would be out in "three minutes and 47 seconds" but it should be noted that we ate early both times, and Three-1-Three doesn't draw its primary business until later hours. Most of the patrons on our first trip were clustered at the bar watching a live wrestling match on the TV.
Still, this merely added to the quite charming atmosphere, both from the old Main Street U.S.A. feel of the exterior and the "Nighthawks" diner feel of the interior. Three-1-Three isn't trying to be anything fancy just a little unexpected and a lot of fun. And at this, it succeeds admirably.

Evolution is the sort of film that doesn’t require you to “turn off” your mind, but does ask that you surrender certain expectations. Most of all, this is a vision that no other director would have imbued with such a potent amalgam of tender and twisted. It’s a pleasure to have her back. Read full review. Read full review
With its linear narrative and clear sense of a protagonist, Evolution is both more beautiful (thanks to gorgeous widescreen cinematography, including stunning underwater and nighttime footage, from “The Strange Color of Your Body’s Tears” d.p. Manu Dacosse) and accessible than “Innocence,” though the two films clearly function best as the twisted diptych that they are. Read full review

Essential LinksSPRING HILL, FL. – On Wednesday, Hernando County Sheriff’s deputies responded to a residence on Haverhill Drive in Spring Hill in reference to executing a Writ of Possession and Final Judgement of Eviction.
According to investigators, a 24-hour notice of eviction was posted on the front door of the residence on August 24, 2021.
When deputies arrived, they observed smoke coming from within the residence.
Due to the nature of the call, deputies set a perimeter around the residence and called in Hernando County Fire and Emergency Services to assist with the possible fire.
Neighboring residences were evacuated as a safety measure.
Deputies were unable to locate any movement within the house. However, deputies did observe suspicious items throughout the residence. In an abundance of caution, the SWAT team was then called in to clear the residence.
The SWAT team was accompanied by firefighters who assisted in extinguishing any active fires they encountered. The SWAT team located a deceased woman in the master bedroom. A deceased dog was also located in the same room.
The SWAT team discovered accelerants in the room. Investigation reveals the woman was possibly attempting to burn down the home.
The cause of death does not appear suspicious in nature, but related to the fire.
The woman’s body was transported to the medical examiner’s office in Leesburg for an autopsy and an official cause of death.
Deputies are currently working to notify the woman’s next of kin and we will update this story when more details are released.

Sign peptidase (SPase) cleaves the sign sequences (SSs) of secretory precursors. It incorporates an evolutionarily conserved membrane protein subunit, Spc1 that’s dispensable for the catalytic exercise of SPase, and its function stays unknown. Within the current research, we investigated the operate of yeast Spc1. First, we arrange an in vivo SPase cleavage assay utilizing secretory protein CPY variants with SSs modified within the n and h areas.
When evaluating the SS cleavage efficiencies of those variants in cells with or with out Spc1, we discovered that signal-anchored sequences grew to become extra prone to cleavage by SPase with out Spc1. Additional, SPase-mediated processing of mannequin membrane proteins was enhanced within the absence of however lowered upon overexpression of Spc1. Spc1 was co-immunoprecipitated with proteins carrying uncleaved signal-anchored or transmembrane (TM) segments.
Taken collectively, these outcomes counsel that Spc1 protects TM segments from SPase motion, thereby sharpening substrate choice for SPase and performing as a destructive regulator for the SPase-mediated processing of membrane proteins.
Interleukin 10 Performs an Necessary Position in Neonatal Rats with Hypoxic-Ischemia Related to B-Cell Lymphoma 2 and Endoplasmic Reticulum Protein 29
Interleukin 10 (IL-10) is an artificial inhibitor of human cytokines with immunomodulatory and anti inflammatory results. This research was designed to analyze the expression variation of IL-10 within the a number of websites together with cortex, hippocampus, and lung tissues of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) rats and discover the essential function of IL-10 in assuaging HI mind injury. On this research, neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats had been subjected to the correct widespread carotid artery ligation, adopted by 2 h of hypoxia.
The expression of IL-10 within the cortex, hippocampus, and lung tissues was measured with immunohistochemistry, real-time quantitative polymerase chain response (RT-qPCR), and western blot (WB). Immunofluorescence double staining was carried out to watch the localization of IL-10 in neurons and astrocytes. Furthermore, not-targeting and concentrating on IL-10 siRNA lentivirus vectors had been injected into the rats of the destructive management (NC) and IL-10 group, respectively, and the mRNA ranges of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and endoplasmic reticulum protein 29 (ERp29) had been detected by RT-qPCR following IL-10 silence.
The outcomes demonstrated that the IL-10 expression was markedly elevated after HI and IL-10 had been colocalized with neurons and astrocytes which had been badly injured by HI insult. As well as, Bcl-2 and ERp29 had been remarkably decreased following IL-10 mRNA interference in contrast with the NC group. Our findings revealed that IL-10 exerted its antiapoptotic and neuroprotective results by regulating the expression of Bcl-2 and ERp29, indicating that IL-10 could also be a promising molecule goal for HIE remedy.
Multiplexed and Excessive-Throughput Label-Free Detection of RNA/Spike Protein/IgG/IgM Biomarkers of SARS-CoV-2 An infection Using Nanoplasmonic Biosensors
To deal with the COVID-19 outbreak, which is attributable to extreme acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there may be an unmet want for extremely correct diagnostic exams in any respect phases of an infection with speedy outcomes and excessive specificity. Right here, we current a label-free nanoplasmonic biosensor-based, multiplex screening check for COVID-19 that may quantitatively detect 10 completely different biomarkers (6 viral nucleic acid genes, 2 spike protein subunits, and a couple of antibodies) with a restrict of detection within the aM vary, all inside one biosensor platform.
Our newly developed nanoplasmonic biosensors display excessive specificity, which is of the upmost significance to keep away from false responses. As a proof of idea, we present that our detection method has the potential to quantify each IgG and IgM antibodies immediately from COVID-19-positive affected person plasma samples in a single instrument run, demonstrating the high-throughput functionality of our detection method. Most significantly, our assay offers receiving working traits, areas below the curve of 0.997 and 0.999 for IgG and IgM, respectively. The calculated p-value decided by way of the Mann-Whitney nonparametric check is <0.0001 for each antibodies when the check of COVID-19-positive sufferers (n = 80) is in contrast with that of wholesome people (n = 72).
Moreover, the screening check offers a calculated sensitivity (true optimistic charge) of 100% (80/80), a specificity (true destructive charge) >96% (77/80), a optimistic predictive worth of 98% at 5% prevalence, and a destructive predictive worth of 100% at 5% prevalence. We consider that our very delicate, multiplex, high-throughput testing method has potential functions in COVID-19 diagnostics, notably in figuring out virus development and an infection severity for clinicians for an applicable remedy, and also will show to be a really efficient diagnostic check when utilized to illnesses past the COVID-19 pandemic.
Accuracy of Alternate Nonpolarizable Drive Fields for the Willpower of Protein-Ligand Binding Affinities Dominated by Cation-π Interactions
Modifying pair-specific Lennard-Jones parameters by way of the nonbonded FIX (NBFIX) function of the CHARMM36 power area has confirmed cost-effective for enhancing the outline of cation-π interactions in organic objects via pairwise additive potential power features. Right here, two units of newly optimized CHARMM36 force-field parameters together with NBFIX corrections, coined CHARMM36m-NBF and CHARMM36-WYF, and the unique power fields, specifically CHARMM36m and Amber ff14SB, are used to find out the usual binding free energies of seven protein-ligand complexes containing cation-π interactions.
In contrast with exact experimental measurements, our outcomes point out that the uncorrected, authentic power fields considerably underestimate the binding free energies, with a imply error of 5.Three kcal/mol, whereas the imply errors of CHARMM36m-NBF and CHARMM36-WYF quantity to 0.eight and a couple of.1 kcal/mol, respectively. The current research cogently demonstrates that the usage of modified parameters collectively with NBFIX corrections dramatically will increase the accuracy of the usual binding free power of protein-ligand complexes dominated by cation-π interactions, most notably with CHARMM36m-NBF.
Using Time-Resolved Protein-Induced Fluorescence Enhancement to Determine Steady Native Conformations One α-Synuclein Monomer at a Time
Utilizing spectroscopic rulers to trace a number of conformations of single biomolecules and their dynamics have revolutionized the understanding of structural dynamics and its contributions to biology. Whereas the FRET-based ruler stories on inter-dye distances within the 3-10 nm vary, different spectroscopic strategies, similar to protein-induced fluorescence enhancement (PIFE), report on the proximity between a dye and a protein floor within the shorter 0-Three nm vary. Whatever the technique of selection, its use in measuring freely-diffusing biomolecules separately retrieves histograms of the experimental parameter yielding separate centrally-distributed sub-populations of biomolecules, the place every sub-population represents both a single conformation that stayed unchanged inside milliseconds, or a number of conformations that interconvert a lot quicker than milliseconds, and therefore an averaged-out sub-population.
In single-molecule FRET, the place the reported parameter in histograms is the inter-dye FRET effectivity, an intrinsically disordered protein, such because the α-Synuclein monomer in buffer, was beforehand reported as exhibiting a single averaged-out sub-population of a number of conformations interconverting quickly. Whereas these previous findings rely upon the 3-10 nm vary of the FRET-based ruler, we sought to place this protein to the check utilizing single-molecule PIFE, the place we observe the fluorescence lifetime of site-specific sCy3-labeled α-Synuclein proteins separately. Apparently, utilizing this shorter vary spectroscopic proximity sensor, sCy3-labeled α-Synuclein displays a number of lifetime sub-populations with distinctly completely different imply lifetimes that interconvert in 10-100 ms. These outcomes present that whereas α-Synuclein may be disordered globally, it nonetheless attains secure native constructions. In abstract, on this work we spotlight the benefit of utilizing completely different spectroscopic proximity sensors that observe native or international structural modifications one biomolecule at a time.A clean and healthy environment is essential for supporting economic activity and well-being in the long-term.

The strange thing about the military is that it is more than just marching and saluting. You don’t actually march very often once you finish all your training requirements. And when I think about all the things I thought I knew before I went from ROTC to active duty I realize I didn’t actually know very much.
seven things I wish I would have known before I decided to join the military
1. The training environment isn’t like real life
The marching, the being yelled at, the made-up scenarios are great to help you learn how to lead and follow. And are mainly a part of the military because they are efficient. But they are not a part of your normal life once you begin to do your actual job. The military required me to use these tools I learned, but often in an outside the box type of way. The training prepares you for your job, but it can never actually be like your job. Real life is always different than the training environment.
2. You can do this
One thing that would have helped me at the start of my military career was the confidence I could do it. And guess what, you can do it. If you want to do something you may need to work hard. But you can do it. I wasted a lot of time doubting my abilities and thinking I wasn’t worthy. But I completed all my training requirements and became an officer in the United States Air Force. I could do it and I did it. You can too.
3. It will be hard, but it is worth it
The military requires a lot from you. Maybe it will be that you will deploy or maybe your job requires you to work long hours. It doesn’t matter what you will do in the military. There will be something hard about military life. But what you learn about yourself will be worth it. And if you are lucky you will get to work on something that will have a greater purpose and may even change the world.
4. Your friends will become your family
I didn’t realize how important the person sitting next to me would be. I didn’t realize being far away from my immediate family would mean the friends I made would often become lifelong friends. And when I became a mom the friends around me became more than just people I knew, they became part of my family. Looking back I wish I would have invested more of myself in my friends.
5. Your weakness may actually be your strength
I am on the side of quiet and shy because I am an introvert. This also means that instead of jumping right into something I am often watching and learning about what is happening. When I was in training this was a weakness because I wasn’t quick to jump in or speak up, but in the workplace, I was able to observe things and speak up when needed. This ended up being an asset that early on in my career I thought was a weakness.
6. Deployment is hard but good
I was terrified of deploying. I was really afraid of possibly deploying with the Army and having to go on combat missions. It turns out that what I was most afraid of was the deployment I was chosen to go on. And I really didn’t think I could do it, but the military prepared me with training and I had a team of people who went through the experience with me. And it wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be.
7. You are going to change when you join the military
Leaving the place where you grew up and meeting people unlike you will cause you to change. Living in a new place gives you a new perspective and you will change. The military will also give you tools and teach you about yourself as it pushes you in ways you never expected. This means that you might not relate to the people you used to know. You will be different and it isn’t a bad thing.

Following back-to-back defeats, Steve Watson’s side looked to bounce back from last week’s 4-0 defeat at Gloucester. He was handed a boost ahead of kick off, with several players returning to the squad from injury.
The York boss made three changes from the side that suffered defeat in Gloucestershire last weekend, as Michael Duckworth, Matty Brown and Clayton Donaldson all coming back into the starting eleven to replace Sean Newton, Michael Woods and Kurt Willoughby.
The visitors Brackley came into the game off the back of an unbeaten start in the league so far this campaign, following successive 1-0 victories over Chorley and Alfreton Town.
The home side started the game brightly, going close after seven minutes when Brackley goalkeeper Danny Lewis did brilliantly to tip a goal-bound header from Donaldson onto the bar and out for a corner.
Lowe tested Peter Jameson into an easy save with a shot from the edge of the area after 13 minutes, before Danny Lewis nearly gifted the home side the lead six minutes later with a mistake at the back, which couldn’t be capitalised on by Donaldson.
City took the lead after 22 minutes, when Akil Wright bundled the ball home from six yards out from a Mackenzie Heaney corner, a minute after they were kept out by an outstanding double-save by Lewis.
Heaney went close to doubling York’s lead, as his curling effort narrowly flew wide of Lewis’ left-hand post with the aid of a deflection just before the break.
The away side started to get on top in the early exchanges of the second half and as they went close to levelling the game. Lowe’s shot from effort was blocked by Matty Brown on the edge of the area, before Shep Murombedzi headed miles over from a free-kick from the right.
York struggled to break through against a tight Brackley defence in the second half, with the away side enjoying a large amount of possession.
Ndlovu put the ball out the ground as Brackley still went in search of an equaliser with fifteen minutes left on the clock, before the visitors found their equaliser with a stroke of luck.
Lowe equalised for the visitors with only five minutes of play left, as he guided a cross-shot from the right over the head of Jameson into the bottom left corner.
They continued pressuring the York defence and went close to taking the lead two minutes later when the bar was struck from a strong header, after a dangerous corner from the right.
Brackley would go on to win the game with two minutes to go when Ndlovu found a gap in the York defence to slot the ball low under Jameson into the bottom-right corner.
Brackley remain unbeaten in the league, whilst the Minstermen still remain searching for their first point this season.
York are back in action this coming Bank Holiday Monday, as the Minstermen travel to County Durham to take on Spennymoor Town at Brewery Field (3pm kick off).

1The area coverage of a point combustible or toxic gas detector is, quite simply, limited to the opening of the gas sensor housing. Point gas detectors do not provide an "area coverage" because they can only respond to gas that travels to the gas sensor and enters the sensor housing. Consequently, the quantity of point gas detectors and where they are located is absolutely key to the performance of your gas detection system.
How many gas detectors to install and where to install them is a complex question that is different for every application and DMS can assist you with that through the gas detector mapping services that we offer from Kenexis. However, one solution that has a tremendous impact on the performance of your hydrocarbon detection system is the Searchline Excel open path infrared hydrocarbon detector. Below is information that provides a "reality check" on the area coverage of point gas detectors and a comparison showing how open path hydrocarbon detection can bridge that gap.
The continuous infrared gas detection beam (projected up to 650' in length) helps to address the "area coverage" issue by enhancing the probability that the gas release will actually encounter a gas detector, significantly improving the likelihood of detection. In addition, because the Searchline Excel open path hydrocarbon detector monitors gas volume across a broad area (not gas concentration at a single point in space) it will respond and alarm to large clouds of very low concentration gas that a point hydrocarbon detector would never respond to with an alarm.
Combined use of point and open path hydrocarbon detectors will (a) usually reduce the quantity of point hydrocarbon detectors, (b) reduce the total quantity of gas detectors overall because of the significant quantity of point detectors that an open path hydrocarbon detector can replace, (c) reduce the quantity of gas detectors requiring maintenance and (d) result in a gas detection system that provides a dramatic increase in the likelihood of the detection of a hydrocarbon release.

TEACHER OF THE YEAR: Sara Russell, a 19-year veteran teacher, is the Iowa Department of Education’s 2022 Teacher of the Year, Gov. Kim Reynolds announced Friday at Pleasant Valley High School in Bettendorf.
“Outstanding educators like Sara ensure our students are well prepared for careers and education beyond high school,” Reynolds said. “Every day, she brings a positive and engaging approach to her students while helping them develop critical-thinking and team-building skills, which they’ll take with them far beyond the classroom throughout their lives.”
Russell, 43, is a social studies teacher who leads student-centered, hands-on learning.
“I believe in the idea that you will never truly understand a concept or idea until you can apply it to your own life or the world around you,” she said. “I structure as much of my class time as possible around student activities that demand students to make their own meaning of concepts or ideas. With all of the activities, I strive to have students discuss, defend, explain and apply their learning.”
Russell, her husband Ian, and their 13-year-old twin sons, Gavin and Aiden, live in Bettendorf.

HOMETOWN PRIDE: Iowa communities are being challenged to show off their hometown pride and win a one-of-a-kind water tower design by Iowa artist Laura Palmer.
The contest is sponsored by the Iowa Finance Authority and the Iowa Department of Natural Resources as part of an effort to recognize the importance of water quality and the State Revolving Fund that has assisted nearly 700 communities in financing water quality improvements.
To enter the contest, communities need to create a video, no longer than one minute, showcasing their hometown pride and features a water element. Video submissions will be accepted through the official contest entry page from Oct. 19 to Nov. 16.
A public voting period will be held from Nov. 17 to Nov. 24 to determine the winning video.
FREE TREE SEEDLINGS: Officials with the state Department of Natural Resources say Iowa communities impacted by emerald ash borer can receive free seedlings from the state forest nursery in Ames.
A federal Forest Service grant has made it possible for the state agency to offer up to 200 free seedlings in the 84 Iowa counties that have confirmed emerald ash borer infestations.
Any Iowa community within an emerald ash borer-confirmed county is eligible to apply for these free native hardwood and conifer seedlings, even if they have received seedlings through this grant in previous years.
According to the DNR, seedlings have been awarded to more than 200 Iowa communities since spring 2019, and next spring will be the last chance for any of the 800 eligible Iowa communities to apply to receive the free seedlings for public and private property planting.
DNR officials say cities with major tree damage or loss from the August 2020 derecho can take advantage of this opportunity to help repopulate the trees in the devastated communities, as long as the county is a confirmed emerald ash borer-infested county.
Any city or public organization interested in applying for the free seedlings should complete the grant application online at
HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR PHEASANT HUNTING: With Iowa crops harvested ahead of schedule this year, officials with the state Department of Natural Resources say Iowa should offer a good pheasant season when more than 55,000 hunters take to the fields on Oct. 30.
Todd Bogenschutz, DNR upland wildlife biologist, said the yearly August roadside survey found Iowa’s statewide pheasant population to be essentially unchanged from 2020 at 20 birds per 30-mile route with northwest, north-central and west-central regions offering the best hunting prospects.
,” he said. “Our final harvest will hinge upon hunter turnout.”
Iowa’s pheasant season is Oct. 30 to Jan. 10, 2022, with shooting hours between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. The daily bag limit is three rooster pheasants with a possession limit of 12.
Hunters must have a valid hunting license and habitat fee. Also, hunters are required to wear at least one article of external clothing with at least 50 percent of its surface area solid blaze orange: hat, cap, vest, coat, jacket, sweatshirt, shirt or coveralls.

Chapter 225: Love (2) (THE END)
Translator: Guy Gone Bad
Wang Ruirui had been living with Zhao Rui over the years. Her parents wanted her to star in more movies, but Zhao Rui used some means to make their idea abortion. When they found their daughter could not help them make more money, they entirely handed her over to Zhao Rui as if they had never given birth to this daughter.
Zhao Rui was a traditional man. He stopped all her commercial activities and sent her to school regardless of her acting talent.
Fascinated by the entertainment circle, few minor stars could settle down to study. However, Wang Ruirui was sensible and obedient. She was never absent from school and got first in every exam.
Therefore, Zhao Rui showed off in front of Yu Qinghuan in the group chat every day. In Zhao Qingyuan’s words, Zhao Rui was like her biological mother who gave birth to the girl.
Littles girls all liked beautiful jewelry. Wang Ruirui touched the hairpin on her head with joy, thanked Zhao Qingyuan and ran to the bathroom to look in the mirror.
Zhao Qingyuan waved at Sixteenth and looked up at Yu Qinghuan, “Why hasn’t Yu Xin come yet?”
“Sis Cheng goes abroad today. He went to the airport to see her off.”
After being single for 39 years, Yu Xin finally fell in love with Cheng Miao at the age of 40 and successfully entered the palace of marriage. Cheng Miao was the top broker in the circle, two years older than Yu Xin.
Thanks to Zhao Qingyuan’s agent, the two met each other.
Yu Xin, being afraid his qualifications would pull Qinghuan back, followed Zhao Qingyuan’s agent to learn. Over time, he and Cheng Miao had a crush on each other.
Zhao Qingyuan snorted, looked at Huo Qu, who was beside Yu Qinghuan, and said, “Another wife slave.”
Yu Qinghuan, “…”
Before Yu Qinghuan retorted, Sixteenth revenged for him:
Zhao Qingyuan held out his hands and bared his teeth in an attempt to attract the cat’s attention. Sixteenth, however, turned a blind eye to him, swaying its tails and putting its head on Qinghuan’s thigh after jumping onto the sofa.
Zhao Qingyuan was so angry that his nostrils smoked.
“Well done,” Yu Qinghuan touched Sixteenth’s head and rewarded his boy with a small dried fish.
The doorbell rang when they were talking. Huo Qu walked over to open the door and Yu Xin’s smiling fat face squeezed in through the crack of the door, “Sorry, I’m late. My wife won’t let me go.”
The people in the room all rolled their eyes at him. How was that possible? Cheng Miao, the iron lady, would be so clingy to Yu Xin? That was bullshit! The real situation must be Yu Xin tearing her sleeves and begging her not to go!
The dinner could finally begin since all expected guests were here.
They hurriedly served the food onto the table. Before having a bite of the food, they poured the wine first.
“Everybody, cheers!” Zhao Qingyuan stood up, holding the wine glass.
After a pause, he turned to Yu Qinghuan, “Congratulations to Qinghuan for starring in the supporting male in Hollywood movie.”
Over the years, Yu Qinghuan had enjoyed a sharp rise in fame in the entertainment circle. Huo Qu’s speech had once impressed many foreigners, unexpectedly paving the way for Qinghuan to open up foreign markets.
This year, thanks to the efforts of Cheng Miao and Yu Xin, Yu Qinghuan finally appeared as the male No.2 in a Hollywood movie. Such a grateful result was always worth celebrating. His close friends were all happy for him and drained their glasses. But Qinghuan could only filled his cup with tea, rather wine.
Since the last time he accidentally learned from Huo Qu what he had done when he was drunk, Yu Qinghuan had never touched wine again.
In recent years, these several people all ushered a peak in their careers. Thus, the time they could spend together had decreased. This time, they took many efforts, finding the chance to gather together and letting Zhao Qingyuan, their funny buddy, to be the main character. The carnival lasted until midnight. In the end, everyone was drunk and staggering.
Having been drunk like this, they could barely walk let alone go home. There were only two bedrooms, so Yu Qinghuan gave the other one to Wang Ruirui and let the remaining three huddled together. Anyway, the weather was not cold in the early autumn. Even if they slept on the floor, they would not catch a cold.
In the bedroom, Yu Qinghuan just finished taking a bath, wiping his hair and tucking Wang Ruirui’s quilt.
He was relieved to see the little girl sleeping comfortably and showing no signs of not getting used to it.
Just as he was about to straight-up, his towel was taken by Huo Qu. He pressed Yu Qinghuan’s shoulder to let him sit down on the bed, while he stood opposite and gently wiped Qinghuan’s hair. Having been lived together for so many years, Huo Qu was familiar with these things.
Sixteenth looked at Huo Qu, then at Qinghuan, who enjoyed himself with eyes narrowed, then it climbed onto Qinghuan’s legs, purring.
With Qinghuan’s hair almost dry, Huo Qu stopped his movements.
“Let’s sleep,” Yu Qinghuan said softly, helping him to put right the crooked pajamas button.
Huo Qu nodded, took Qinghuan to lie down on the bed, and pressed out the bedside lamp.
That year when they came out of the closet, they made the whole world as their witness.
But then, they kept a low profile, quietly focusing on their own life, and never showed it on Weibo.
Yu Qinghuan had never expressed his love for Huo Qu since then, but he knew that Huo Qu knew everything. Love could not be hidden. For the rest of his life, he just needed to love the man as much as he could.
Guy Gone Bad has something to say: When I decided to write something, I really didn’t know where to start. Actually it’s never been easy to say goodbye. There is a Chinese saying called “天下没有不散的筵席”, I don’t know how to put this in an exact meaning in English. It’s literally means “Every time of reunion has to end up with separation.” When I did this, actually I also feel how you feel with those two. They laugh, I laugh. They cry, I cry. Their love is one of a kind. It also touches the softest place in my heart like it does to you. I am always a positive person in life. So what I am trying to say is whether you are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered, we all have the right to love and to be loved. And I wish that everyone of you would find your true love in life and every love story could have a happy ending. Last but not least, thank you all for liking this novel. Wish you the best!

Gone is cable, although it is still present when browsing from the computer on some occasions. The speeds that we obtain today, the more excellent stability and quality of the connection makes it a very interesting alternative. However, wi-fi does not always work well. In this piece (article), we are going to give some keys so that the wi-fi works well.
Modern routers have wi-fi networks available. Most are, in fact, double-banded. This means that we can connect from any mobile device, through compatible laptops, in a fast and straightforward way.
We should take into account a number of factors that can help to increase the speed. The goal is to avoid problems and achieve the maximum possible speed. Some points are basic, but it is worth remembering them always to keep them in mind.
Something very important to always maintain the proper functioning of our equipment and systems is safety. On the one hand, it is vital to have safe computers and mobile devices that we use and our router.
In this sense, we have to recommend installing a good antivirus on our system. There are many security tools that we can use, and they are available for all types of platforms.
It is also vital that the wi-fi network, as well as access to the router, are protected by a password that is strong and complex. We will avoid intruders that may affect the speed and stability of the connection. That key must contain letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and other special symbols. In addition, the encryption that we use is also going to be important, so we must avoid those that are obsolete.
There are different parameters that we can configure in our router. Points such as the signal strength that we can change, enable both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands if necessary, use guest networks, etc.
There are certain factors within the router’s configuration that, in one way or another, can help us improve its performance.
As we say, modern routers have the ability to connect to the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. It is important that we choose properly which one we are going to use in order to achieve maximum speed.
If we are going to connect far from the router or if there are many walls and obstacles, it is best to use the 2.4 GHz band. On the other hand, if we are going to connect near the router and we want to achieve maximum speed, the 5 GHz band is the most indicated.
This point is basic. The closer we connect to the router, the better. Whenever possible and we will connect wirelessly from our device, we must try to make the device as close as possible so that the signal is stronger.
But this we mention is not always possible. For this reason, it will be obligatory to use amplifiers and repeaters. We have many devices at our disposal, which can help us improve the wireless signal quality.
We can use amplifiers, wi-fi Mesh systems, PLC devices and etc. In their own way, all of them can help the wireless network work as well as possible and have a quality signal with a good Internet speed.
The network card is a fundamental piece for our connections. It is what allows us to connect the device to the router and have access to the Internet. We need it to be in good condition, that it has the drivers correctly installed.
On the other hand, it is as well or also imperative to have the equipment correctly updated. Sometimes vulnerabilities appear that can be exploited by hackers to achieve their goals. Thanks for installing the security patches. We will be able to avoid these problems.
But it is also essential to achieve maximum performance. Normally, updates usually bring important improvements that help us on a day-to-day basis and improve the equipment’s functioning.
This is something that we must apply both in the router itself and in any device that we are using.
In short, by following these simple tips that we have mentioned, we can ensure that our wi-fi network works properly. The objective is that the Internet speed is as fast as possible, that stability is guaranteed and that no problems of any kind arise that affect our devices and day to day.

Cancel replyEx-console and game developer Atari late last week decided to sue three online game review sites that posted less than favorable reviews of its latest console game, Alone in the Dark for the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3. Norwegian review sites Gamereactor.no and Gamer.no as well German site 4gamers.de received letters from Atari to take down their reviews. Both Norwegian sites gave Atari’s latest game a ghastly 3 out of 10 rating and 4gamers.de slammed the game with a 68-percent conclusion.
Last we checked, our sister site Tom’s Games and other popular U.S. reviews sites did not have more than previews of the game, as Atari has yet to release Alone in the Dark for any console.
Atari’s lawyers demanded that the three sites remove their reviews of the its game due to the poor ratings and using a pre-release "press" copy of the game. The lawsuit also indicated that it was possible the three sites used illegally downloaded copies of the game. While we can understand the later point, using "press" copies of the game for reviews is a common practice.
The three sites also indicated that Atari pulled advertising due to the poorly rated game.
We took a look further into the situation and found that a "scene release" of Alone in the Dark was released for the Xbox 360 on June 17th, 2008 — two days prior to the release of the review on 4gamers.de and 3 days prior to the published review on gamer.no.

Here it's again, without using the tagsAlthough heart health and mental health are often viewed as distinct, they are very much related. The tight connection between the mind and heart can be good news – if you take steps to protect one, you may be protecting the other as well.
A two-way relationship
People with depression have an increased risk for developing heart disease. The reverse is also true. People with heart disease – such as those who have had a heart attack or developed heart failure – have an increased risk for developing depression.
One reason the two conditions often occur together is because they have an array of related risk factors. For example, having heart disease may cause someone to limit their activities, which may increase their risk of depression. Meanwhile, people who are depressed may be more likely to adopt unhealthy habits such as not exercising enough, drinking too much alcohol, smoking and eating poorly – all of which increase one’s risk for heart disease.
Depression impacts the heart
Although it’s sometimes considered “mental” and separate from the body, depression has a physical basis and a host of physical effects, many of which relate to heart function. These effects include:
- Inflammation that can damage the lining of blood vessels, paving the way for atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries)
- Increased tendency of blood to clot, which can accelerate atherosclerosis
- Nervous system changes that alter heart rate
These types of changes lead to a higher risk of heart attack and sudden cardiac arrest in patients with depression.
Meanwhile, experiencing a serious manifestation of heart disease, such as a heart attack, increases depression risk. Up to one in three people who have had a heart attack will have symptoms of depression.
The heart can influence depression
A heart attack survivor often has obvious reasons for feeling depression symptoms along with the physical responses. Such a profound event can change your perspective on life and cause unease about what comes next. Someone who has had a heart attack might look back with regret at behaviors he/she believe increased their risk. They might also see themselves differently and experience lost confidence or increased doubts about their ability to succeed at work or in personal relationships.
Although these feelings are natural following a life-threatening health event, they can snowball into something bigger – a mental health struggle that affects your ability to function. When that happens, getting the right intervention is crucial because depression cannot only be dangerous in its own right, it may also interfere with recovery from the heart attack.
In addition to starting a cardiac rehabilitation program to help rebuild physical stamina, counseling and medication support can help ease the symptoms of depression and get you on the path to recovery for mind and heart.
Knowing when feelings of worry and loss cross over into depression can be tough, but one key is to assess for zest: Do you feel the same enthusiasm about things that you enjoyed before? If not, an assessment for depression might be in order.
The stress effect
Depression isn’t the only mental health condition tied to heart disease. Emotional distress can also raise the odds of disease in the arteries that feed the heart. Although conventional wisdom has always linked stress and heart attacks, research more recently confirms that psychological stress increases risk for a heart attack or stroke. In fact, the greater the stress, the greater the risk.
What you can do
For people who already have heart disease and depression or anxiety, mental health treatment may help reduce the risk for heart-related death. In fact, many cardiac rehab programs include a mental health component.
Generally, patients tend to benefit from some combination of medicines that boost mood along with counseling from a therapist who can help change thought patterns, address unhealthy behaviors and suggest ways to relax.
Prevention strategies
Although you can’t control every factor that contributes to the risk for heart disease or depression, you can influence many of them. A healthy diet can help keep mind and heart in shape, as can regular exercise and avoiding smoking or drinking too much alcohol.
Because stress can contribute to heart disease and stroke risk, learning ways to relieve mental burdens can also be helpful.
There are many ways to relieve stress, and your choice will come down to what genuinely works for you. In addition to the recommended lifestyle adjustments that boost mind and heart health alike, some helpful stress-busters include deep-breathing exercises, meditation or mindfulness practices and working with a counselor to remove causes of stress where possible.
$webqFacilityNumberThis is brilliant. Legends of Echo is a new free Java mobile phone, massively multiplayer role playing, location based game put out by the people behind the Grid in South Africa (Vodacom).
“In the game, the Echo is a parallel virtual universe based on the South African map. Instead of cities and skyscrapers, however, players will find rolling green fields, rocky outcrops and valleys to explore and establish their base.”
The best overviews are found on the News24 Games blog, in an interview with co-creator Nic Haralambous, and on Nic’s own blog (you’ll also want to read what Vincent Maher had to say about it). From what I can tell, without having played it yet, is that it’s a turn-based card-type game. You find loot, do battle and win more loot. Leveling is there, but it’s not as large of a component as expected.
“There are lots of different kinds of weapons, powers and items that you can pick up by moving around the country from city to city, province to province. Each one gives you a slightly different edge in battle.”
On top of the normal game elements, and an indicator that makes me believe that LoE might be better thought-out than most other games, is the fact that they built an economic system into the game from the beginning. Nic states, “There is a currency model built in to the game that allows players to spend airtime in the Echo Marketplace.” That’s a big deal, and it’s not easy to pull off if done right.
Legend of Echo’s graphics and visual appeal can’t be understated. They spent a good deal of time to make this game look and feel like a World of Warcraft competitor, and it shows. Visually it reminds me of Arcanum meets World of Warcraft.
Specs
You’ll need to have a high-end Nokia or Sony Ericsson to play Legends of Echo. I’ve got an old Nokia N95 sitting around somewhere, so my plan is to dust that off and give the game a run when I’m in Cape Town next month.
It also appears that you actually have to be in South Africa to play it, but I’m checking with Nic to see if anyone living in a country that The Grid operates in can play it as well. This is doubtful, as it’s based also on the Afrigis system, which is fairly Southern-Africa specific.
The game is available for free as a Java download to cellphones. To play Legends of Echo, SMS â€˜ECHOâ€™ to 33313 (50c/SMS) or visit

Thoughts from a gamer…
- It seems that a web-based Java version of this game would be successful, if only because it would allow you to play on whichever device you have handy. Are there any plans for that?
- How much will LoE go the direction of Foursquare where they really use the location based systems to drive competition and increased game play?
- I’m impressed that they took the time to create a strong virtual economy.
- Will a real-world economy of people using real money to buy and sell goods develop online, as we’ve seen in other successful MMO games?
- You’re supposedly able to “Build special items with unique abilities”. I’d like to know more about the crafting system, as that can be one of the best ways to deepen interaction and make a game more unique.).

-Coronavirus in Mississippi: Issaquena County is the only MS county with no cases. Why?
Issaquena County remains the only county in Mississippi that does not have any reported cases of the coronavirus since the state's first case was reported March 11.
The county of less than 1,300 residents sits along the Mississippi River, north of Warren County, which as of Thursday had 68 cases and two deaths. To the north is Washington County, which has 77 cases and three deaths. To the east is Sharkey County, which has five cases and no deaths.
It also shares a sliver of a border with Yazoo County, which has 135 cases and one death.
Throughout the state there were 6,815 cases as of Thursday with 261 deaths. An estimated 3,413 people are presumed recovered from COVID-19, the Health Department said.
Health department officials say the reason for the lack of cases in the county could be for any number of reasons, but all would be speculation.
But Mayersville Mayor Linda Williams-Short said she believes she knows why Issaquena County is the only one of Mississippi's 82 counties with no reported coronavirus cases.
"Our county is mainly an agricultural area," she said. "Social distancing is a norm for us. We're spread out pretty good, anyway."
Sheriff Richard Jones said he also believes the relative isolation of residents has helped keep the coronavirus out of the county.
"We are a small community," he said. "We've just got one store. There's not a whole lot of gathering over at the church (at this time). We have one basketball court so we might have a few teenagers gathering there.
"Other than that you probably won't find no more than five or six people together other than church, but we're not having service now. Out in the county, we're miles and miles apart."
Is state counting all COVID-19 deaths? Mississippi coroners can't get tests for those who die at home
Jones makes sure those in his department have the needed safety equipment and make sure inmates in the jail are safe as well. There are relatively few inmates at the jail since felonies are few and far between in the county, he said.
In December, the Board of Supervisors voted to close the Issaquena County Regional Correctional Facility, a state-run prison, because of "financial trouble."
The county also was one of several devastated by massive backwater flooding last year.
"We have already been through a storm," Jones said. "We're just blessed."
Mississippi's top health official:'This thing's not over'
Williams-Short said she and her husband, Larry Short, who is Issaquena County's Emergency Management director, are telling residents that even though many live in remote areas they need to stay six feet apart, practice good hygiene, wash their hands and take other measures for their personal safety.
They also warn residents to take extra precautions when going to other counties for groceries and other supplies.
"My motto is, 'We are practicing peace over panic,'" Williams-Short said.
Coronavirus in Mississippi:11 deaths, 246 new cases reported on Thursday
Williams-Short has been mayor of the town of roughly 550 residents for 18 years. She also owns the only convenience store in the county, so she sees most of the people who come and go.
She said while she is glad the county doesn't have any COVID-19 cases, she is concerned about the well-being of those in neighboring counties.
"We're just grateful that we are the county that stands out in this state, that we are COVID-free," she said. "We just live by faith and trust and believe that this too shall pass."
She said people have expressed interest in coming to Issaquena County since the coronavirus has not been detected there.
"I've got a sense of humor," she said. "I told one guy (from another county), 'I don't how you got in here, but we're checking tags and temps if you're coming in here.'"
Did you know?
Issaquena County, founded in 1844, covers 413 square miles, most of which is agricultural lands.
Issaquena is a Choctaw word that roughly translates to "deer river."
Its most famous resident was Unita Blackwell, the state's first black female mayor, who also served as an adviser or appointee to six presidents.
The county has one of the lowest per capita incomes in the country at just under $19,000 per year. Its median household income is less than $26,000.
Its population is around 1,300, which is around 3.4 per square mile.
It has a 70% high school graduation rate and less than 7% have college degrees.

Also read: Local Motorcyclist Shares His Accident, Baffled At How His Slipper Turned Into An AnkThe Corporate Credit Team at Janus Henderson Investors explain the benefits of integrating Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors into investment decision-making. Key takeaways The concept of ESG analysis has evolved over the years and is becoming integral to fundamental credit research. The Corporate Credit Team believes that rigorous application of ESG analysis can improve risk-adjusted returns. Sound investment sense, growing client demand and efficient capital allocation underscore the importance and relevance of ESG analysis. ESG stands for Environmental, Social and Governance, and refers to three central factors in measuring the sustainability of an investment. It was derived from the ‘Triple Bottom Line’, also known as the ‘People, Planet and Profits’ (PPP), a concept introduced in the 1990s. It argued that businesses should focus on each of the three ‘P’s and not just on ‘Profits’, since they were equally important for any commercial enterprise to be sustainable. This concept evolved into the focus of ESG, which today is the bedrock of Sustainable and Responsible Investing (SRI). /> Environmental criteria examine how a business contributes to and performs on environmental challenges (e.g. waste, pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and climate change). Social criteria look at how the company treats people (e.g. human capital management, diversity and equal opportunities, work conditions, health & safety, and product misselling), while Governance criteria examine how a company is governed (e.g. executive remuneration, tax practices and strategy, corruption and bribery, and board diversity and structure). At the heart of ESG investing is the simple idea that companies are more likely to succeed and deliver strong returns1 if they create value for all their stakeholders – employees, customers, suppliers and wider society including the environment – and not just the company owners. Consequently, ESG analysis considers how companies serve society and how this impacts their current and future performance. ESG analysis is not just about what the company is doing today. Consideration of future trends is critically important and should inherently include disruptive change that can have significant implications for a company’s future profitability or its very existence. Our approach to ESG analysis We look at companies in-depth from E, S and G perspectives to evaluate their standing relative to peers. Our ESG philosophy is built on the belief that rigorous application of ESG analysis can improve risk-adjusted returns and company engagement is an integral part of successful investing. Just as with other credit metrics, we would expect improving ESG profiles to lead to a lower cost of capital. We believe companies that pursue meaningful ESG improvement should increase the potential to outperform as the cost of capital declines and credit spreads tighten. Conversely, if a company has material ESG risks and is not actively mitigating these risks and improving their ESG profile, it is very likely that its bond prices will suffer. Identifying and measuring ESG risks and opportunities has the benefit of simultaneously supporting environmental and social benefits. There are many ways to incorporate ESG into investment decisions. The main applications tend to be ethical/values-based investing, integrated ESG and sustainable/impact investing. In ethical investing managers employ a negative screen approach to generate ‘ethical or moral returns’ and screen out controversial ‘sin’ sectors. While negative screening is very straightforward to implement and has historically been used by early adopters of sustainability principles, a growing number of firms are now also aiming to apply ESG in order to take advantage of opportunities and select sectors and companies based on their positive ESG performance. This leads to a more holistic ESG integration that is better placed to maximise risk-adjusted returns. Impact managers go a step further in applying ESG considerations and aim to deliver positive impact via their investments in companies and governments that generate a measurable net positive impact for society and the environment alongside positive returns. There is no one way to apply ESG, so understanding how an investment manager applies ESG in their investment process in order to achieve the strategy’s objective is important for clients. Why do we care? Because it makes sound investment sense It is our fundamental belief that ESG considerations enhance risk-adjusted return potential by reducing investment risk and creating investment value. A well run and responsible company that cares about its people, customers and the environment, we believe, is more likely to exhibit a greater level of resilience and outperform its peers than one that does not. ESG analysis can provide valuable insights about factors that can have a significant impact on the financial metrics of a company and therefore better inform our investment decisions. ESG analysis can be complex. When taking ESG considerations into account, it is not just a case of evaluating the products and services provided by a company, but also its behaviour, conduct, supply chain and other considerations in running the business. ESG analysis must also consider the future, taking into account not only a company’s latest ESG disclosures, but also its strategy, overall impact and evidence that it is keeping to its commitments and standards. Hence we believe it is not advisable to formulate investment decisions based on purely backward looking historical data and believe a more forward-looking, dynamic approach is needed when considering ESG risks and opportunities. This is why our proprietary ESG analysis and ESG ratings are integrated into our credit research. While exclusion-based strategies adopt a negative approach to investing, our holistic approach to ESG takes a more positive stance and also looks for opportunities where companies are actively transitioning and improving their ESG profiles. The combination of improving credit stories and improvement on ESG grounds can help achieve positive outcomes for the environment and society. Because our clients care In our most recent survey of client attitudes, when asked about the importance of ESG integration in investment, 78% of clients said it was as or more important than five years ago.2 Furthermore, by 2025, the so-called ‘values-driven generation’ – millennials – will represent three-quarters of the global workforce.3 A Morgan Stanley study found that millennials are twice as likely as the general population to invest in companies with social or environmental goals.4 And in North America alone this generation, alongside Generation X, is set to share a wealth transfer in the region of $30 trillion from their baby boomer predecessors in coming years.5 The pressure from asset owners to invest responsibly and have a more sustainable mindset is therefore expected to grow significantly. Because we believe that facing up to sustainability challenges and strategically allocating capital can help make good long-term investment decisions The world faces major sustainability challenges – such as climate change, ageing population, and inequality – which require radical solutions that will bring huge yet hard to predict changes to the global financial system. By facing up to these challenges, recognising that capital allocation decisions have a real impact on the world, and holding bold visions of the future, investors can hope to make good long-term investment decisions. 1Various studies exist that demonstrate that incorporating ESG factors can have a beneficial influence on returns. For example, “Sustainable Investing and Bond Returns: Research study into the impact of ESG on credit portfolio performance”, Barclays 2016. 2Janus Henderson Customer Panel, October 2019. 3Big demands and high expectations, The Deloitte Millennial Survey, 2014. 4Sustainable Signals.

Debut game
v Halesowen Town (a) 18th January 1929
Final game for Gresley Rovers first team
v Market Harborough (h) 18th April 1930
Harold was the son of Jimmy Methven, Derby County's long serving player and manager.
After Gresley, he went on to play professionally for Portsmouth who he joined in 1930, Mansfield Town and Scunthorpe.
In season 1934-35 Harold signed for Tunbridge Wells Rangers in the Southern League. He made an immediate impact scoring three hat tricks in consecutive matches.It is believed Harold retired from football at the end of the season.
Harold sadly died in Ashby on 3rd May 1987

The new Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system is one such example of technology in action within football, but there are plenty of other areas it will impact during the tournament.
Read on as we look at the top three ways technology will be used at the 2018 World Cup.
Video assistant referee (VAR) technology
VAR will be used at the World Cup after the game’s lawmakers, the International Football Association Board (IFAB), unanimously approved the use of the technology in matches on a permanent basis.
The system has been used with varying degrees of success in numerous countries last season and it will be interesting to see it in operation during a major tournament. can recommend reviews, but the only person who can initiate one is the referee, who will then have the final say on whether their original decision should stand or be changed.
They have the option to review footage themselves on a pitch-side monitor before making a final decision.
Online streaming
Over 190 networks around the globe will have live coverage of the tournament and for the first time in history the World Cup will have extensive online streaming on rights holder websites and mobile apps.
FIFA has ensured that most of these are terrestrial (free-to-air) channels like for example in the UK, where ITV and BBC will share the World Cup coverage.
The event will be a huge attraction for advertisers on commercial broadcasting platforms, with messages such as ‘here at Party Casino’ and many others expected to be widely viewed by consumers.
Although access to most online coverage is free, users will require an IP address for the country’s content they are trying to access.
If you are on holiday in Spain and want English coverage, just buy a VPN (cost around $5) to get a UK IP address and you will be able to access both BBC and ITV online platforms.
Similar services are available with across the globe, ensuring that Russia 2018 will be one of the most watched tournaments in history.
Sports science
Sports science has become an integral part of football and this World Cup will be supported by the practice in a wide range of ways.
Tournament outsiders Australia are a great example of sports science in action, with the team using the Apple Watch to help maximise their performance.
Australia visited 22 different countries and travelled more than 250,000 kilometres during qualification, so being able to use technology to manage travel fatigue has become a crucial part how the players are monitored.
Dr Craig Duncan – one of Australia’s leading sports scientists – is aiming to take that a step further during the World Cup.
.”
Data analysts have become a crucial component in the modern game and their use could be the difference between winning and losing in Russia. the French. We hoped we would be able to get more information on where our roads were. What their status was. And check on the other project in the area. Due to security concerns we had to go on a route that took us around Kapisa and up through the Kabul to get to Tagab. Overall it was a great mission and not really anything like what I expected.
Another letter home during my deployment to Afghanistan in 2010:
I was able to go on a mission to South Tagab, one of the seven districts in Kapisa. Tagab is one of the two districts that are dominated by Pashtuns. It is a less friendly area than the North where we live. The mission was in coordination with a French operation, which is the first time that the PRT had done something like this. The Province of Kapisa is located in French Battle Space, so we have to work all our operations through the French, even though most often we operate on our own. We are the only PRT that is not operating in American Battle Space.
The Journey Begins
Anyway our journey began and it took a few days. Leaving at strange times and driving to different places to get to our final destination. When we got there we were ready to go. We started out our mission before the sun came up and seeing the Valley of Tagab as the sun came up was pretty cool.
Our main goal of the mission was to look at one of our road projects. We basically had a start and end point and no information on where the road was going in between. Luckily, we were able to see a lot of the road. We discoved that the contractor’s reports were not as accurate as we had been led to believe. Because of the location and limited resources available to the PRT we were not always able to see projects as often as we liked. And since the region was not safe we could not rely on our local national engineers to see the site either. In the end we discovered we have a lot of work that needed to be done to complete this road project.
The other project that we went to see was a bridge. This was a new project that had the ground breaking ceremony less than a month ago. The contractor had already accomplished a lot of work in the last month and we were impressed with the number of workers at the job site and the progress they have made.
Different Feel from the Villagers
This was an interesting village to visit. The villagers had not seen Americans in a long time. The children who had been friendly and interactive in other villages, didn’t want to have anything to do with us. Especially me, a female. Often times we would get mobbed by kids wanting pens or stickers or they just wanted to talk to us to show off their English. These children were not interested in anything we had. The village just slightly south of this village had a totally different reaction to Americans.
Sleeping Under the Stars in Afghanistan
By the time we got done with our mission there was a lot of chatter on the radio so we decided it would be safer to stay at a Combat Outpost (COP) we were at instead of the Forward Operating Base (FOB) we had planned on sleeping at. No one had expected us to stay there. And there were not any tents for us to stay in so we had to improvise and sleep, in, on, under and around our MRAPs (armored vehicles). My Master Sergeant made a hammock from an old HESCO bag and string. Others slept on the ground, or in or on the MRAPs.
I found a medevac cot and slept on it dressed in my uniform in a sleeping bag. And used my dirty clothes bag as a pillow. I actually slept pretty well. Except for when the helicopter landed in the middle of the night. Apparently, we had decided to camp out in the big open space. It was the landing pad for the helicopters. Dirt and rocks went everywhere. I covered my head with my sleeping bag and survived without getting too much dirt in my mouth.
And I won’t even mention the bathrooms, but every time people are grossed out by bathrooms, I always think it isn’t as bad as COP 42. The next day we got out on the road. We got to a different COP and stopped.. There was a lookout point on the top of a mountain near the COP. A select few of us climbed up the mountain (250 meter climb) to the top to take pictures of the surrounding area. Truthfully, we couldn’t see much when we got to the top of the hill, I mean mountain, but it was cool to see the surrounding area.
Going Home (back to the FOB)
This was the last day of our adventure and we made our way back, which was no small feat. Everyone wanted to be back at the FOB. We decided to head back that evening instead of waiting until the early morning. This meant we ended up in traffic, like super rush hour traffic. We ended up making a 3rd lane in between the two lanes of stopped traffic to get out of there safely. It was an adventure to be sure. The best part of getting back to Morales Frazier (my FOB) was getting to sleep in bed with my sheets and blanket. Instead of a sleeping bag and in clothes other than my uniform that I wore for way too long.Even in a digital age, well-crafted design for print still has an important place in business marketing.

With tensions high as 16 teams strove to advance and join the top seeds in the round of 16 in the PRO Chess League, the games delivered with plenty of high drama. Aggressive and decisive play from players throughout the league produced plenty of brilliancy prize candidates, but these highs were matched by significant lows as some nightmarish blunders and mouseslips knocked desiring teams out of the playoffs.
Eastern Division: Carlsen's Gnomes Power Through
Norway Gnomes vs Mumbai Movers: 9-7
The Norway Gnomes came to play with the most stacked lineup seen thus far in the league. Clearly GMs Magnus Carlsen, Jon Ludwig Hammer, and Simen Agdestein were a scary top three, but what about about board four, Tor Fredrik Kaasen? Well he is rated 2450! How does that lineup come under the 2500 average-rating cap? The secret is that Kaasen was only 1927 when lineups were submitted in fall.
Though the Movers fought hard, the Gnomes took an early lead, and Carlsen got his first 4-0 in the PRO Chess League. Carlsen took to Twitter to celebrate Belichek-style, and he also wrote a blog about the PRO Chess League.
On to the next one! @NorwayGnomes @PROChessLeague— Magnus Carlsen (@MagnusCarlsen) March 1, 2017
Gorky Stormbringers vs Riga Magicians: 8-8
In the second Eastern division match, things did not go the way of the rating favorite. Without GM Evgeny Shaposhnikov, the Gorky Stormbringers were ceding 100 rating points on average to their opponents, the Riga Magicians. Never underestimate a Russian CM though. The Stormbringers proved incredibly resilient, eventually managing an 8-8 tie and advancing because of their superior record in the regular season.
The weakest point for the magicians proved to be board one as GM Igor Kovalenko scored only 1/4, making these two ghastly blunders.

It may have been "in a losing effort," but IM Vitalijs Samolins got himself a move of the week nomination for his win on board three.
Central Division: English Heroics
In one of the more notable underdog stories in English history since Waterloo and Dunkirk (okay, less notable), both London teams advanced against their higher-seeded continental rivals with some crazed last-minute heroics.
Cannes Blockbusters vs London Lions: 7-9
The Lions have come back from some really unfortunate matches in the early weeks of the PRO Chess League and are looking quite strong. With finishes like the following, one understands why their manager would be emotional.
Mate just caught me legit crying with pride for the @lionschess winning the first playoff in @PROChessLeague! #chess #prochess #emotional pic.twitter.com/QxHgTlQs7k— Sabrina Chevannes (@SChevannes) March 1, 2017
Amsterdam Mosquitos vs London Towers: 7.5 - 8.5
Each of these teams drew strength from strong board one performances. First, GM Loek Van Wely won a pleasant game against GM Keith Arkell as his team raced to an early lead.
But in rounds three and four, it was GM Gawain Jones who downed GM Wouter Spoelman and then Van Wely in games where he was worse and even losing, but he managed to handle the chaos and time trouble better than his opponents.
Amazing #prochess match with @Lond0n_Towers squeezing home 8.5-7.5 vs @amspros with 3-1 final round. Mine even crazier than usual #jetlag?— Gawain Jones (@GMGawain) March 1, 2017
Atlantic Division: Time Trouble Mishaps
Toronto Dragons vs Miami Champions: 7.5-8.5
This match featured lots of tactical wizardry from both teams, and it could easily have gone either way as both teams saw time forfeitures in winning positions. There were two particularly striking moments to highlight. First, GM Razvan Preotu earned a move of the week nomination for this tactic.
Preotu was then defeated by young FM Nikhil Kumar who found some impressive moves of his own.
Montclair Sopranos vs Philadelphia inventors: 9-7
GM Robert Hess absolutely refused to let the commentators ignore his games in this match as he was constantly under a minute on the clock. The commentators were riveted both by this game which he heroically saved with seconds on his clock...
...and this one, in which seconds were not sufficient to save the game.
One that the Inventors would surely love to have back is this costly blunder from IM Thomas Bartell.
Pacific Division: California Defeats Texas
In a confrontation between the only two U.S. states with three cities that exceed a population of 1,000,000, California's two teams were victorious against the two Texas teams.
Dallas Destiny vs San Jose Hackers: 7.5-8.5
The Dallas Destiny have been very strong on boards one through three with GMs Jeffery Xiong, Ruifeng Li, and Conrad Holt. They performed admirably, but such top board strength left them vulnerable on board four where they only scored a half-point. Meanwhile, GM Shakhriyar Mamedyarov was again dominant as he scored 3.5/4.
What an unbelievable match. @SanJoseHackers win 8.5-7.5 to advance to the next round of #prochess playoffs!! #cindarellastory— Kostya Kavutskiy (@hellokostya) March 2, 2017
Despite what must have been heated emotions, these two teams demonstrated the best sportsmanship as GM Cristian Chirila hosted GM Jeffery Xiong to play in his apartment while Xiong was in California for a tournament.
San Diego Surfers vs Rio Grande Ospreys: 9.5-6.5
The San Diego Surfers were the only team to start with five match wins in the PRO Chess League, but in the incredibly strong Pacific division, that wasn't even quite enough to secure a first-round bye. That seems to have made them hungry as they came out strong and achieved the most dominant match victory in the playoffs opener with 9.5 points. GM Alexey Dreev showed that he deserves increased recognition as one of the most solid board ones in the league. He won this beautiful game as Black.
Dreev's prior opponent, the sharp GM Vladimir Belous, successfully castled in this game and pleased the spectators with a move of the week candidate.

It was 29th June 2016. Puglia was suffocating under a heatwave, but on Mount Spigno, the third highest peak of the Gargano peninsular, the beech trees offered some glorious shade and cool.
Luigi Palladino and Giovanni Russo were walking at around 800 metres above sea level, with all the gravity of William of Baskerville and Adso of Melk (from Umberto Eco’s The Name of the Rose), discoursing in the botanical lingo known only to a few. They were swapping roles, both variously playing master and apprentice. It was the work of a moment. Beneath “a bed of fallen beech leaves” the two of them glimpsed the incredible. An apparition like Our Lady of Fátima to St Bernadette; like a truffle-hunter finding a truffle weighing a kilo; like Captain Ahab spotting Moby Dick. Our two walkers came to a halt, their breath taken away, unable even to draw a gasp of amazement at the tiny, fragile creature that lay beneath their disbelieving eyes. An Epipogium aphyllum Sw., or rather, the rarest of the rare, the Ghost Orchid.
That’s how we’ll call it in this article, the Ghost orchid. It exists, but you never see it. It can complete its entire life cycle without ever once rearing its head from the soil. You’ll only ever catch sight of it when it’s blooming, which it does at intervals of years or even decades. It is impossible to imagine the shiver that ran down the spines of Russo and Palladino when they stumbled upon this bright, tiny, leafless flower, standing some ten centimetres high. No sighting of it had ever been recorded in Puglia. It was as beautiful as the Madonna; as vast, despite its smallness, as a leviathan. The events went straight into the annals of the Italian Botanical Society, which records around ninety species of orchids in the area between the Tremiti islands and the Dauni mountains, the highest orchid concentration in all Italy.
But then, strange things happen in the Gargano National Park, in the Umbra Forest. Mysteries, apparitions and disappearances, all entirely in keeping with the place’s name. For in Latin, umbra means two things, “shade/shadow” and “ghost”. On the one hand, it evokes the freshness of those woods which we can never know inside out, the home of “ancestral terrors and fears that must not be named”. The home of wolves, who, as trap-cameras confirmed, returned here at the start of the millennium to forage in the undergrowth, after more than half a century of persecution encouraged by the Kingdom of Italy (wolves’ heads fetched as much as those of outlaws in the Wild West) and by Perrault’s fables. Poor wolves. Or poor shepherds. It depends on your point of view regarding the intraspecific conflict, as the experts call it, between wolf and man – not to be confused with that other, more intransigent concept, homo homini lupus, “man is wolf to man”. Less scary, but no less ghostly, is the Italian roe deer, gliding serenely through the Umbra Forest, as elusive as the Ghost Orchid and the white lupin. It does not approach humans, of whom it remains intensely suspicious, despite its status as a protected species.
Same with the wild cat, Italy’s own Bagheera, stockier than its domestic cousin, with thicker fur. Its coat is a streaked grey, and its magnificent long tail tapers to a black point via a series of dark rings.
Wolves, deer, wild cats and wild orchids: they all rub shoulders with the other wildlife that spawns and snuffles in the shadow of the 50-metre tall beech trees, which since 2017 have stood within a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It’s a lesson in how best to approach Puglia’s little Amazon forest, which has finally been spared the worst that humanity can inflict. And the lesson is: leave no trace.

While at dinner with the Peters family, who have been looking after Charlie’s daughter Honoria, Charlie reflects that he believes that the “eternally valuable element” in life is character—which he seems to define as the quality of having moral integrity and strength. He expresses a desire to “jump back a whole generation and trust in character,” and observes that everything else seems to wear out, which suggests not only that he sees morality and integrity as essential ingredients for building a home and family, but that the absence of these qualities in him had led his own family to fall apart. In this way, Fitzgerald shows readers that Charlie doesn’t merely want to go back to how things were when he had a family and he was behaving recklessly. Rather, he wants to build a different kind of family, founded on this eternally valuable element: his newfound strength of character. Furthermore, after musing on character, Charlie wanders through the streets of the Montmartre neighborhood of Paris, where “all the catering to vice and waste was on an utterly childish scale.” In contrast to the warmth and stability of the Peters’ home where he was just at dinner, the emptiness and desperation of the abandoned bars and clubs lead Charlie to ruminate on the meaning of the word “dissipate,” which he understands now to mean “to make nothing out of something.” This underscores Charlie’s dawning revelation that, like character, the bond of family abides, while other relationships and pleasures dissipate.
Despite Charlie’s newfound commitment to character and family, Marion Peters remains skeptical that he is any less of an irresponsible drunk than he had been two years ago, and her opinion is significant, because she has the power to decide against allowing Charlie to complete his family by taking Honoria with him to Prague. Marion is an embittered character who threatens to destroy Charlie’s dream of having a family, and yet she is the character most concerned with doing what is right for her family, including Honoria. She therefore not only embodies the familial bonds of dedication, love, and responsibility, but she also represents the moral standard to which Charlie must prove he can rise. She shows that family is a prize that is not straightforward or unambiguously pleasant, implying that unlike the pleasures of the ‘20s, the things worth having in life do not come easily. Fitzgerald gives evidence that Charlie understands this difficult truth, as he accepts Marion’s decision not to allow him to take Honoria to Prague. While it’s deeply disappointing for Charlie, he recognizes that this punishment is fair (even though Marion’s change of heart was brought about by factors outside of his control), which demonstrates that he’s willing to accept responsibility for his past actions and be patient and humble before Marion in order to regain his family.
Charlie speaks several times throughout the story of his desire to make a home, a concept he associates with having a family. Pleading with Lincoln Peters, Charlie at one point expresses his fear that he’ll “lose Honoria's childhood,” and with it his “chance for a home.” At the story’s conclusion, after Marion has changed her mind about allowing Charlie to take charge of Honoria, Charlie reflects sadly that “he wanted his child, and nothing was much good now, beside that fact.” Without a home and a family, Charlie believes, he has nothing of value. Fitzgerald’s message, then, could hardly be clearer: having lived through the glitz and glamor of the roaring ‘20s himself—and having seen it fade—“Babylon Revisited” is his proclamation that the only things of lasting value are the relationships people build and commitments they make to their loved ones.

“My income last year was bigger than it was when I had money. You see, the Czechs—”
His boasting was for a specific purpose; but after a moment, seeing a faint restiveness in Lincoln’s eyes, he changed the subject:
“Those are fine children of yours, well brought up, good manners.”
A great wave of protectiveness went over him. He thought he knew what to do for her. He believed in character; he wanted to jump back a whole generation and trust in character again as the eternally valuable element. Everything wore out..

Description
The metamorphosis of the iconic Anaïs Anaïs
After revisiting herself as Anaïs Anaïs Premier Délice, Cacharel this time decided to transport us with her to an aerial and sunny region. Focus on the latest Anaïs Anaïs L’Eau Flamingo.
The metamorphosis of the iconic Anaïs Anaïs
When Cacharel decided to go into perfumery in 1978, the brand opted for a feminine fragrance synonymous with youth, spontaneity and optimism. His first juice then made a real hit! To give you an idea, it still elapsed around 35 million bottles during its first five years of marketing. This juice is now famous all over the planet and is called Anaïs Anaïs. Nevertheless, although it is still very popular, Cacharel decided to transform it, in 2014, to address a new generation of women. His successor is therefore called Anaïs Anaïs Premier Délice. Like its elder brother, this one is aimed at young women who are passionate about finding love and always wanting to see life from its best angle. Also, as if to illuminate this collection of fragrances with a sunnier glow, Cacharel decided to offer him a brand newcomer named Anaïs Anaïs Premier Délice L’Eau Flamingo. This clearly emphasizes the fresh, springtime liveliness of the Cacharel woman. The result is a very pleasant fragrance to wear, especially on a hot summer day.
Cacharel’s new L’Eau Flamingo recipe
Anaïs Anaïs L’Eau Flamingo immediately shows her belonging to this great family of fragrances. Indeed, this one kept the bottle of its predecessor, very inspired by a toilet kit of yesteryear. Thus, Anaïs Anaïs L’Eau Flamingo has a little retro side although it is a very contemporary version of this perfume of yesteryear. He reveals his soft and sensual curves in a very feminine pink color. Now with a frosted glass, it immediately suggests its refreshing appearance. Its name, L’Eau Flamingo, handwritten on its front, reveals all the spontaneity of this new fragrance. The recipe of Anaïs Anaïs L’Eau Flamingo begins with a fresh and fruity blend of bergamot, pear and grapefruit. This energizing bitterness is then relayed by a very feminine and floral heart. This one is bursting with white flowers. It combines the opulence of jasmine with the more airy aspect of lily of the valley and freesia. Finally, the whole is wrapped in more woody nuances. Cedar gives structure to the whole, while amber and musk make L’Eau Flamingo smoother and more sensual.As the Camwells know, I really really want them to do this with strings sometime, but this is the next best thing!

- Written by Janak Rogers, Associate Lecturer, Broadcast Journalism, RMIT University
- matters:
At the heart of the issue – and why it remains recurrent – is an unresolved contradiction: Australia is a multicultural society, but our media tells a very different story.
Australian diversity not represented in media
One in four of Australia’s 25 million people were born overseas, 46% have at least one parent who was born overseas and nearly 20% speak a language other than English at home.
Yet, in 2016, PriceWaterhouseCoopers released a now much-cited report that found 82.7% of the Australia’s media workers are monolingual and speak only English at home. Broadcast radio was even more homogeneous, with on-air talent being 75% male, white and over 35.
Because of the prevalence of media workers living in Sydney’s inner suburbs, PwC, an organisation not known for hyperbole (or, indeed, pop culture references), even compared them to those millennial stoners, the Bondi Hipsters.
The report concluded that a lack of diversity – in ethnicity, gender and age – is slowing the media industry’s growth.

Views on race have a long history
Perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised: it’s not that long ago that Australia was an openly racist country. The last vestiges of the White Australia policy remained in place until the 1970s.
For many Australians, the memory of a largely white, monocultural country (which necessarily excludes Indigenous experience) forms part of the nostalgic fabric of their childhoods.
It’s arguably only natural – even understandable – those ideas and structures would manifest in our media, both in the make-up of the workforce and in the ways otherness is depicted.
In the book Racism, Ethnicity and the Media, published by UTS academics in 1994 but clearly still relevant today, the authors write:
From the perennial all-white suburban streets of Neighbours, to the marginalised and threatening images of urban Aborigines, to the eroticised representation of ‘foreign women’, the media ‘work’ on reality, constructing narratives which play a vital role in how we see ourselves and others.
In short, Australia’s racism is wired in.
Diversity at ABC, by the numbers
These days, Australian media organisations are beginning to take the challenge of diversity and representation seriously – some more than others.
The ABC and SBS publish regular diversity reports, and arguably, the very existence of these reports shows some progress is being made.
In the ABC’s Diversity and Inclusion Plan 2019-2022, Managing Director David Anderson writes,
If we want our content to authentically reflect and appeal to all Australians, we need to ensure our people – both on-air and behind the scenes – are as diverse as the Australian community we serve.
The report highlights a range of initiatives at the ABC – including targeted hiring, working groups, mentoring and better auditing – that demonstrate its commitment to diversity.
It’s a cheery-looking document with, apparently, as many photos of the ABC’s diverse stars as could fit into 31 pages. (An unfortunate side-effect of concentrating so much diversity in one place is it inadvertently highlights how white the ABC normally is. It just doesn’t look like the ABC.)
Still, it’s good to have some stated values and accompanying statistics. In 2019, the report shows 2.7% of the ABC’s employees were Indigenous, 13.7% were from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds and 5.3% had disabilities. Among CALD employees, 9.8% were in executive roles and 9.2% were in content-maker roles.
Read more: Friday essay: diversity in the media is vital - but Australia has a long way to go
Are things then improving? In 2018, the ABC reported it had 13.5% employees from non-English speaking backgrounds (NESB, as they were called back then - a 0.2% improvement this year); 2.8% Indigenous employees (0.1% worse off this year), 8.7% NESB employees in executive roles (a 1.1% improvement this year) and 9.4% NESB employees in content-maker roles (a 0.2% slide this year).
The recent $84 million in cuts to the ABC, which resulted in 250 job losses and the gutting of ABC Life, an outlet that housed many CALD journalists and celebrated their stories, is a further setback in the wider push for greater diversity.
So, on balance, some things have improved a little, some are a little worse, but basically not much has changed. (And more cuts may be on the way.)
But it’s unfair to single out the ABC; they are at least making an effort. Commercial networks seem to simply ignore the problem – or, often, compound it by fear mongering, peddling stereotypes and targeting prominent CALD voices.
Ways to bring more diversity to newsrooms
Diversity and inclusion are long-standing challenges in Australia, and there is admittedly no quick fix. It requires sustained, multi-pronged initiatives that provide practical pathways for diverse journalists and storytellers to get into the industry and, once in, to get ahead.
These are some steps media organisations can take, though, to start to change their cultures:
provide media training for CALD journalists, storytellers and communities to enable them greater ownership and agency to tell their own stories, and greater employment opportunities in the industry
establish better networks between the media industry and CALD representative bodies to better represent CALD experience and to facilitate opportunities for emerging CALD journalists
expand support for emerging CALD student journalists with scholarships, mentorships, cadetships, internships and other opportunities to help them get a foot in the door and gain experience
hold more events to bring CALD students together with media industry practitioners to recruit more of them into the profession and provide pathways into employment
improve cultural literacy training programs and audits for diversity to better understand the gaps in institutional knowledge and the make-up of staff
research best practices for amplifying CALD voices, both in Australia and overseas
actively seek out and hire CALD journalists and storytellers
and, perhaps most importantly, listen to culturally and linguistically diverse people on what the problems are and take seriously their ideas on how to fix them. Media executives, if you are reading this, you can start here.

Van Brianne is not going to talk about herself in the third person! Ha Ha!
Welcome! A bit about me... I began Modeling when I was a kid, turning it into a successful career that's lasted over a decade. I also became involved with other forms of art within the entertainment field. I enjoy acting as I find human behavior fascinating and complex, then sometimes I just love to make people laugh!
I always carried a camera around too, drawn to the "other side" of the creative process. So transitioning into professional Photography felt very natural to me. I love it all! And my varied experiences in the industry have not only been a thrill, but I've accumulated some pretty great knowledge and experience that only enhances my photography!
Now I'm supposed to sell myself, and convince you that I'm the woman for the job! My portfolio should do most of that (otherwise I shouldn't be taking headshots, lol). But I do genuinely enjoy shooting headshots specifically. I love the hard work that goes into creating "WOW" photos, and pulling forth each persons special individuality. There is nothing better than giving someone pride and excitement over having headshots that truly do them justice, and a client saying that their headshots helped them to be signed by a good agent, or that they landed an audition they badly wanted and especially helping someone get closer to their dreams.
I've been in the entertainment industry for most of my life, I know it well, its expectations, and I know what's needed to stand out. I also keep up to date on trends and what casting directors are seeking, while staying creative and unique. And with my plethora of posing knowledge (tooting my horn) I have plenty of tricks up my sleeve that can pull emotion and expression out of anyone!
It's also important to me that I'm not the only one having a great time at the shoot! Therefore we'll listen to some good music, I'll be cracking some jokes, and hopefully for your sake some of them are funny, ha! I'm laid back, fun, and you won't be able to help but relax and have a good time, which will shine through in your photos!
Now, let's get this sh*t going, because I'm excited to shoot your face! ;)RSIS Seminar by Lord John Alderdice, House of Lords; Former Speaker of Northern Ireland Assembly; and Leader of Alliance Party of Northern Ireland
The Psychology Behind Brexit: Implications for National Security Practitioners
Seminar Abstract
This talk goes behind the headlines to examine the deeper psychological drivers for the UK’s ongoing and increasingly polarized Brexit debate. It examines the social psychological underpinnings of the Leave campaign, showing how such a collective mindset emerges from deep-rooted thoughts and feelings associated with threats to the identity of the large group. The talk will show how this still not well understood but very powerful field of large group psychology has implications that go beyond the economic considerations behind Brexit, to include wider demographic, political, security and geopolitical concerns as well, and how it is part of wider disruption of thinking and political developments across the globe. The talk will finally suggest some possible ways to mitigate the negative effects of an existentially threatened large group identity, as exemplified in current events such as the Brexit affair.
About the Speaker
Professor, the Lord Alderdice, MB BCh BAO FRCPsych
As Leader of the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland (1987-1998), Lord Alderdice played a significant role in the negotiation of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.

He was Deputy President and then President of Liberal International (the world-wide network of more than 100 liberal political parties) from 2000-2009, and during the UK Conservative/Liberal Coalition Government was Chairman of the Liberal Democrat Parliamentary Party in the House of Lords (2010-2014). PM David Cameron also appointed him to the UK Committee on Standards in Public Life (2010-2016).

VINA had to be grateful for the use of the clit pump while the electronic breast training machine worked to enlarge her nipples to five times their current size. AMAZING that VINA made very little noise during this painful session. Would like to see KATARINA HARTLOVA secured to the metal milking frame in the barn with her legs spread apart and the clit pump used along with the red cow milker to give her the most intense milking session of her HuCow life.

Vina is getting nice and fat. Does she eat her meals willingly, or does she have to be force-fed?

Just my opinion, but I’ve always thought Vina has had it a bit too easy…up until now. A little harsher treatment seems to make her more productive (when she was spanked). Looking forward to more aggressive methods for her.St Clare’s Nursery is thrilled to have just won a Daynurseries UK Top 20 Day Nursery (Wales) 2021 Award.

Hey! This is my first visit to your blog! We are a group of volunteers and starting a new project in a community in the same niche. Your blog provided us beneficial information to work on. You have done a outstanding job!(Crain's) — Two top executives at Advanced Equities Inc., a Chicago venture capital and investment banking firm, disclosed that they received a notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission that they are under investigation and charges may be brought.
Keith Daubenspeck, chairman and co-founder of parent firm Advanced Equities Financial Corp., according to the firm's website, and Dwight Badger, a co-founder and CEO, each disclosed in a broker registration filing that they received “Wells notices” from the SEC in January.
The two men, in identical disclosures on the matter, said that the notice informed them that staff in the SEC's regional Chicago office are considering recommending to the SEC that an administrative proceeding be brought against the pair "in connection with a private offering in 2009.” Neither provided details about the offering.
“It's confidential and we're not going to discuss it,” said Amal Amin, the firm's in-house attorney. “We're aware of the allegations and we're going to defend ourselves.”
“I am addressing the staff's concerns and I am prepared to aggressively defend myself should it become necessary,” the men said in their disclosures.
SEC spokesman John Nester declined to comment on the case.
A Wells notice lets the recipient know that the SEC enforcement division staff intends to recommend to the commission that charges be brought against the individual, but it gives the respondent about 30 days to persuade the staff not to take action, Mr. Nester said. The recipients will often request more time to respond to the notice and may receive that additional period, he said.
If the SEC staff recommends charges to the commission, it will include any response to the Wells notice.
Advanced Equities says on its site that it is a “source of late-stage private equity to technology companies" financed by venture capital firms and that it provides investment banking services. It also offers investment strategy advice to institutions and high net-worth individuals, according to the site. The firm also has offices in New York, San Francisco and London, the site says.Track 1: Privacy and Security for Cloud and Big Data

A soybean crushing industry executive told Reuters this week that China will almost entirely replace its soybean imports from the United States with Brazilian beans and other origins in the upcoming season. The latest forecast from China predicts Imports from the United States will plunge to just 700,000 metric tons, down from 27.8 million metric tons in the most recent marketing year. The drop in imports of U.S. soy by China stems from the tit-for-tat trade war between the U.S. and China.
In July, China imposed a 25 percent tariff on U.S. soybeans, sending purchases lower. The U.S. and China met last month in Washington, DC, but no formal talks are expected to take place soon, prolonging the trade war.
Source: National Association of Farm Broadcasting News Service.Tania had a challenging start to the year, relocating back to Melbourne with her husband and son, after a decade in Sweden. She joined the Press Play program a few months later and found it gave her new tools to improve her own wellbeing.
“Thanks to Make Shift, we have legitimately learnt new tools in our vital tool kit to survive and thrive doing what we are born to be and do.”
Working in the music industry can be a really hard gig sometimes and it poses a unique set of challenges to maintaining our mental wellbeing; whether on tour, on the road, creating something new, recording in the studio or back at home. Tania Doko is no stranger to these challenges, having had a successful 29 year career in the music industry, and collaborating with the likes of The Veronicas, Tina Arena, Jessica Mauboy and Delta Goodrem. Tania found that being a participant in the Press Play program was a hugely beneficial experience
“If this was offered more regularly to the music industry it would make such a difference to our somewhat broken industry.”
Despite juggling being a busy artist and songwriter, Tania found the Press Play Program worthwhile and a safe place “to sincerely 'play' and grow my creative side (journaling, drawing, doodle-ing..stretching my inner artiste!), not to mention practical tools/knowledge to keep my mental health in check during these topsy turvy times.”
The Press Play program is a 4 week course centred around Creative practice as a vital tool for mental health and wellbeing. Experiential in it’s delivery, each week is a combination of mental health content, guided and shared by MakeShift Co-Founder and educator Caitlin Marshall, and hands on creative practice, facilitated by a guest artist. Across Australia, people from the music industry, in their homes, explored creative writing with award winning novelist, Helena Fox, drew their inner critic with Marvel illustrator Marcelo Baez, worked on a collaborative photography project with visual artist and photographer Joshua Heath, and dived into creative mindless/mindful journaling with artist Mel Young.
The program is one of many offerings funded and made available by Support Act as they rally around the thousands of people in the sector tremendously impacted by Covid-19.
Connecting with diverse people across the music industry and normalising challenges faced by those in the music industry was a highlight for Tania. “Group sharing was brilliant and validated what we often all feel. We could casually share more vulnerabilities, lessons, in that rare, safe space.”
"Our passion for making music connects us - as does our vulnerabilities - inside of a recovering music industry right now. There's a path forward when we come together and normalise our challenges."
Tania loved that the facilitators weren’t musicians and encouraged creativity outside of her usual comfort zones. She found that the time with the creative facilitators was not only productive but also inspired. “All (were) very new practices or an extension of existing practices I would not have in my tool box if I had not taken up the offer to do this course.”
Press Play participants receive a Creative First Aid Kit, including all the materials they need to participate ahead of the program (journal, collage book and paper, POSCA pens). “I loved that we received all those pens and notebooks too”.
MakeShift have designed a range of programs and courses intended to skill up people with tools to understand, support and maintain their own mental health, with play at the centre. The hands-on creative experiences woven into each workshop give people a 'real-time, real-life' moment to see the difference it makes when we stop and get into the zone of creativity, release our brains from overthinking and restore our nervous system with sensory play. This approach of 'creative prescribing' is at the heart of MakeShift programs.
Press Play for the Music Industry is designed and delivered by MakeShift, an education and support agency committed to creativity and mental health.
The next Press Play for the Music Industry program starts Wednesday 11th August, in partnership with Support Act, with thanks to Australian Government funding.

Plan & Practice
Employees should always know what to do in the event of a fire. There should be designated meeting places for employees when the fire alarm goes off. It should also be determined what are the quickest routes for employees to safely exit the building. In addition, there needs to be maps and signage throughout the building that mark where you need to go. Routine fire drills are the best way to ensure everyone knows where they are supposed to go.
Fire Prevention
Do whatever it takes to prevent a fire from occurring in your office. There are probably all sorts of fire hazards littered throughout your office. There should be a set of rules in place that prevents employees from bringing in additional fire hazards into the office. For example, there should be no scented oils or candles brought into your office building. There also should be routine inspection for possible fire hazards. You may find there are overly hot appliances, frayed power cords, and too many power strips being used in one area.
Fire Safety Items
If a fire does occur, you want the office to have the proper fire safety equipment. There should be adequate fire alarms and sprinklers throughout your office. These fire safety items should be routinely inspected to ensure they are up to the proper standard. It is in your office’s best interest to have routine inspections done by a professional. In addition, there should also be extinguishers and first aid kits..Bethesda’s spooky PlayStation 5 exclusive, Ghostwire: Tokyo, has been delayed until early 2022 to give Tango Gameworks “the time to bring the world of Ghostwire to life.”
The first-person action-adventure game, which pits players against a series of spirits haunting Tokyo, was due to be released on PS5 and PC at some point this year. However, fans haven’t seen much of the game since its announcement at E3 2019, and it’s now been confirmed we won’t be getting our hands on it until 2022 at least.
“We’ve made the decision to delay the launch of Ghostwire: Tokyo to early 2022,” Tango Gameworks says in a statement, which you can read in full below. .”
While this might be frustrating for some fans – especially those on Xbox who will have to wait even longer to pick up the game – Tango is clearly taking development seriously and wants to deliver the best possible experience for all.

Here’s the full story direct from Shimano:
SHIMANO UNVEILS S-PHYRE CYCLING KIT
Harnessing its heritage of innovation, engineering and technology, Shimano has expanded the S-PHYRE concept with the creation of performance cycling apparel. First introducing the S-PHYRE concept with performance footwear in 2016, the new high-performance product line now also includes a racing skin suit, short sleeve jersey, bib shorts, gloves and socks.
According to Shimano, the S-PHYRE concept has one goal: to maximize power transmission by delivering more performance per gram, cheating the air and applying linkage and movement principles in a complete system between the bike, the body and the motion of muscles. Utilizing proprietary knowledge gained from Shimano’s acquisition of Bikefitting.com and performance studies with hundreds of professional riders, each S-PHYRE product is meticulously engineered to deliver numerically-proven results.
Every material sourced represents the highest quality, lightest weight options available; all in service of creating the most efficient system possible. The only Shimano apparel crafted in Japan, the skin suit, short sleeve jersey and bib shorts are manufactured to the highest standards to ensure unparalleled performance.
S-PHYRE RACING SKIN SUIT
The Racing Skin Suit’s single-unit construction using second skin fabric and a variable- density weaving structure delivers better fit, better aerodynamics, less weight, fewer seams, and improved moisture management. Improving aerodynamics without sacrificing rider comfort, the skin suit features a fit more
comparable to a traditional jersey and bib short combination. Additionally, the one-piece design minimizes material overlap, providing better temperature management on hot days.
The all-new chamois features a winged design and advanced construction techniques, moving naturally with the body while delivering excellent ventilation and targeted support in the saddle.
The S-PHYRE skin suit was engineered in Shimano’s innovation lab and tested in the wind tunnel to provide maximum wind resistance reduction in the riding position—saving 93-seconds over 40-kilometers when compared to a traditional jersey and bib short combination.
Sizes: S-XL | Color: Black | MSRP: $349.99
S-PHYRE SHORT SLEEVE JERSEY AND BIB SHORTS
The Short Sleeve Jersey features seamless shoulders with a 3D construction to reduce shoulder wrinkles. Anatomically placed pockets provide easy access to stashed items. A full-length zipper aids temperature regulation and discrete logos complete the look.
The Bib Shorts utilize a 100-percent engineered knit construction with an S-PHYRE graphic knit integrated into the thigh, providing an incredible second skin fit. They feature the new shock- absorbing winged chamois, integrated woven leg grippers to hold the leg more securely and inner-thigh high-thread count weave patterns for a zero-loss interface between the saddle and the garment.
Short Sleeve Jersey
S-PHYRE SOCKS
Initially released in 2016 with S-PHYRE footwear, the socks were designed to enhance the performance of the RC9 and XC9 shoes. The technical features providing cushioning in pressure areas as well as ventilation and slip resistance on the sole while the woven in ankle guides ensure efficient pedaling rotation.The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)‘s complaint, filed in the Southern District of New York on Dec. 22, 2020, charges..59mpg in a plain old Accord… beat that, punk
While I’m not a ‘hypermiler’, I do usually get better mileage than most people do with the same model car. It’s a game to me to mesh smoothly with traffic, and drive all the way through town without ever tapping the brake. But this guy totally has me beat:
Drafting 18-wheelers with the engine off, taking death turns at 52 miles an hour, and other lessons learned while riding shotgun with the king of the hypermilers……
- Mother Jones: “This guy can get 59mpg in a plain old Accord. Beat that, punk.”
Wayne’s probably pretty extreme in traffic – there’s something to learn from him but it would be maddening to drive behind him as he coasts to a stop. One suggestion if you want better gas mileage is; ride a bicycle. When you are the engine, you become conscious of energy usage relative to acceleration. You learn that braking is the enemy. You learn to plan ahead, which you can apply in your car.
There’s a general principle here; no machine is better than its user, and an attentive user can get the most out of any machine. Want a faster computer? Learn a few keyboard shortcuts, you’ll save way more time than a new processor will. Tired of giving your money to the Ay-rabs? Put down your cell phone and drive. Think you need a better camera? Read a book on composition and lighting. No matter how good our gadgets get, it still comes down to the human.
But don’t draft semi trucks; leave that to Wayne.A quick reminder that these life-enriching courses start next week!

You may ask - What are “Off Highway” Vehicle Safety Barriers? In general terms, safety barriers used in car parks, logistics yards, warehouses, inside and outside factories, retail parks, loading bays, etc, can all be described as ‘Off Highway’ vehicle safety barriers. Their objective is the protection of people, plant and buildings. Most people are familiar with the appearance of highway barriers - the ubiquitous Armco. But it would be a mistake to think that if a barrier can cope with a high speed motorway crash they must be able to cope with the low speeds in a car park or logistic yard? Off highway barriers are quite different and different standards, regulations and operating requirements apply.

So being in college means freedom. Well, more freedom than you’ve probably ever had. You aren’t living under your parents’ roof and you can sort of do whatever you want. If you decide to skip class (which you really shouldn’t because that’s like wasting money…) no one is going to yell at you. If you sleep until noon or later on the weekends, so what? You can just live like you want. I mean, you still have to live within that “pick two triangle” of good grades, a social life, and getting enough sleep but yeah, you are free. And that means getting around and off campus sometimes and having fun!
The Best of On Campus Fun:
Campus has a lot to offer. Between the different organizations and knowing the right people, you can find something to do just about every day of the week. Here are some of the highlights from some of the most popular or well-known orgs on campus.
Campus Activities Board (CAB): This student organization does a variety things that a generally free or, at the most, five dollars or so. CAB gives us wildcats plenty to do with monthly bingo nights (they’re on Thursdays) that have different themes like sex, adventure, and Halloween! During bingo there will be different contests and such and always free goodies on your table. Along with bring out our inner elderly citizen, CAB helps to showcase the talented members of our campus. Events like The Grind (a monthly coffee house with live music and free food), Campus’ Funniest Person, and Pumpkin Stroll give students a chance to show off their musical, comical, or artistic talents. CAB then tickles our funny bone by bringing different comedians to campus. This student org is also in charge of the huge tasks of planning Homecoming in October (check out this blog about homecoming at UNH!) and May Day at the end of the spring semester. Both events are amazing and a lot of fun for all who attend.
Memorial Student Union Organization (MUSO): This org is in charge of bringing bands and lecture series to campus. This past year they brought in tons of local (or, generally, New England based bands) and author of World War Z, Max Brooks. MUSO also brings the latest blockbuster movies to campus every weekend and, occasionally, works with HBO to do big screenings of popular shows like Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad.
Improv Anonymous: This student org is “UNH’s one and only improve comedy group!” Every Thursday night down in the MUB entertainment center, this comedy group makes their packed space erupt in laughter as they take audience suggestions for scenes and games. This event is free and everyone should check it out just once.
And then just at the end of campus is Downtown Durham. There you can get groceries, UNH gear from Hayden’s or Town and Campus, or just chat with friends over coffee at Breaking New Grounds (BNG) or grab a slice of pizza at Durham House of Pizza (DHOP)!
The Best of Off Campus:
UNH is nicely nestled right between Dover, Newmarket, and Portsmouth. And lucky for us, we have free buses that go to all of these places. And even luckier, we have an Amtrak station on campus that runs daily between Boston and Portland. So, let’s focus on the best of the locally off campus because we all know that Boston is awesome!
The “best of the best” off campus has to be Portsmouth, hands down. There’s so much to do. Just hop on the 4A or 4B bus and you can do some shopping at The Mall at Fox Run and The Crossings, hit a movie at Regal Cinemas, or hop off at Market Square and walk around, check out the shops in Downtown, or just relax at Prescott Park.
Never been to Portsmouth before and want some recommendations of shops? Here are some student favorites:
Portsmouth is, by far, one of the best places to hang out off campus—especially when it’s warm and sunny out! And it’s one of those places you can go and not spend a lot of money. The bus is free and if you just bring a lunch (like a to-go box from HoCo maybe?) you can relax by the water and save your bank account from shrinking!
Dover the next in our best of… Again, hop on a bus (the 3A or B) and you can bum around downtown for an afternoon. Need to get to certain stores that Wildcat Transit doesn’t go by in Dover? You can hop on the Coast bus for free!
And finally, Newmarket. This town is quaint with some restaurants and small shops. This is where the most off campus housing is… so check out their apartments if you’re interested. Like Portsmouth and Dover, there’s a bus that heads right through and around Newmarket.
So there’s the basics of what you should know about things to go around campus. Want more? Check out Wildcat Link, the MUB, or visit these places for yourself. Chances are you’ll find something new and interesting to try!Healthy St. Mary’s partnership to host healthy food drive

More than 1.52 billion people were reported to use Facebook every day as of December 2018. This came up to a 9 percent increase in the number of users per year.
Active users every month were also up 9 percent year over year, with 2.32 billion as of December 31st.
This quarter, Facebook users rise in both Europe and the US, regions where numbers were either flat or went down last quarter. It was particularly strong in Asian countries including India, Indonesia, and the Philippines.
Also, Facebook announced that a new high of 2.7 billion people use either Facebook, and its fa”family” of services, including Instagram, WhatsApp, or Messenger each month, with 2 billion of those people using at least one of those four services once a day.
The rise was steady despite Facebook’s involvement in last year’s high-profile privacy and safety issues. One faced by the tech giant was the Cambridge Analytica scandal, a data breach where hackers stole logins for 50 million people and accusations that it has been used as a political tool.
CEO and Founder Mark Zuckerberg said “We’ve put most of our energy into security over the past 18 months, so that building new experiences wasn’t the priority over that period.”
“So this year, I think we’re going to deliver several of these new experiences.”
“The firm had fundamentally changed how we run the company to focus on the biggest social issues,” he added.
A total profit of $22.1bn (£16.9bn) was gained by Facebook for 2018, 39% higher to that of the previous year.
Evidently with the numbers, advertisers continue to be on board with the platform and in result may win investors in believing the stock can regain more value.
In defense of the social network’s business, 34-year old billionaire Zuckerberg argued that targeting ads based on interests was different from selling people’s data.
“If we’re committed to serving everyone, then we need a service that is affordable to everyone,” Zuckerberg wrote in The Wall Street Journal.
One research analyst concluded “The bottom line is that with more than a quarter of the world using FB every day, we think advertisers have no choice but to follow their customers.”
Although the user growth did not specifically mention of Singapore among other Southeast Asian countries, the number could not be taken for granted. Singaporeans are one of the most active social media consumers in the world.
In a global mapping of social networks in 2017, Facebook is the top social network in 119 out of 149 countries. As a matter of fact, 22% of the world’s population is on Facebook.
Two in 3 Singaporeans admit that they have a social networking and internet addiction, an AIA survey revealed.
According to the statistics portal Statista, in 2017, 3.55 million Singaporeans accessed the internet through their mobile phone. The number from Facebook Ad Manager gives 4.8 million as the total number of Facebook users in Singapore in 2018.
One in 4 Singaporeans on Facebook browse the platform even while watching television, spending 17 minutes out of a whole TV hour on their Newsfeed.
While Facebook is still the most popular social media channel in Singapore, it seems to be following the global trend of losing its younger users.
Cloudrock Asia, a digital marketing agency, explained that Facebook stops becoming fun for younger users once the parents get on their friends list. Younger Singaporeans are instead found flocking to Instagram.It’s a powerful moment for Jussie Smollett…

Speaking during the unveiling of the GAC Motor’s GS4 car in Lagos on Monday 12th December, he said that he was especially proud of the Nigeria’s creative industry.
“I’m very proud to be here today especially knowing the contribution of the GAC Motors in the area of culture, especially in the area of the creative industry and I wish them many more years of collaboration,” he said.
Alhaji Mohammed lauded GAC Motor for their innovation and creativity, adding that he admired the company’s commitment to the development of the creative industry in Nigeria.

Absurdity from Bavaria comes in many forms these days. Be it the new BMW M3’s wild looks, or the outstanding driving capabilities of the BMW M2. However, if you’re truly looking for the wildest BMW made today, you’ll be finding yourself in the driver’s seat of the $142,000 2022 BMW M5 CS.
It’s not a bad place to be, to say the least. That’s especially true once you’ve seen one on the road, sticking out like a 627 hp sore thumb.
The M5 CS is how much?!
RELATED: Watch a 2022 BMW M3 Take an Audi RS5 to Gapplebee’s in This Drag Race
Unfortunately, you did read that right. The M5 CS is no bargain performance sedan you can daily drive. It is however, going to be a great deal when no one is willing to fix one in ten years time. See you on Bring A Trailer. Regardless, the CS is the perfect illustration of what BMW is capable of in the here and now.
Sure, a world of electric sedans and Mustang SUVs is the future, but the 2022 BMW M5 CS shows that the Bavarians aren’t letting go so easily. While the CS may not be a bargain performance sedan you can daily, it is a prohibitively expensive and stylish rocket ship that looks like nothing else on the road. And for that, we love it.
An M5 CS is faster than an 800 hp Hellcat
It would appear we aren’t the only ones, either. Both Thomas and James from ThrottleHouse ranked the M5 above the Hellcat after Dodge’s drag race king was dethroned by it (money no object, of course). Then again, how could the M5 not take the Hellcat in a straight line? It’s both lighter, at 4,016 lbs, and has AWD. Yes, that’s heavy, but James did credit the M5 with driving “almost like an M2,” which, being BMW’s best-driving car in decades, comes as high praise.
Unfortunately, there’s no manual transmission in the new M5. That got the axe back in 2016. However, the 8-speed ZF automatic gearbox does the job perfectly well. Honestly, a lot of that win against the Hellcat comes from the speedy gear changes offered by the automatic gearbox. All the performance is well and good, but it’s useless if you can’t use the thing.
Is the 2022 BMW M5 CS worth the money?
Thankfully, the 2022 BMW M5 CS is a perfectly usable car, as Thomas and James point out. It is a sedan after all. The trunk is perfectly usable, and so too are the back seats. The M5 also gets seats that are suspiciously similar to those in the M3 and M4. Happily, those are perfectly comfortable. Finally, there’s the obvious key to year-round usability: AWD. In short, the 2022 BMW M5 CS will be a hell of a performance bargain after depreciation has had its way with it. We can’t wait.

I.e. if you pack a trailer with boxes of batteries, you’ll hit the weight limit way before you actually fill the trailer, so there’ll be this cavernous space left empty in the trailer; contrariwise, if you fill a trailer with pillows you’ve just blown most of your weight capacity. So what would be the optimum mix of pillows and batteries such that you hit the weight limit just as you fill the trailer? Easy enough to figure out when it’s just pillows and batteries, but think about how many different kinds of items Target carries and it gives you some idea of the complexity of the problem. ↑/File Photo the case had nothing to do with freedom of expression or the press.

Anesthesia and analgesia · Aug 1997Randomized Controlled Trial Clinical Trial
The dose-response pharmacology of intrathecal sufentanil in female volunteers.
The pharmacologic effects of intrathecal sufentanil (ITS) beyond what is clinically administered (10 microg) are not known. We observed 18 healthy, young, adult female volunteers who received 12.5, 25, or 50 microg of ITS in a randomized, double-blind fashion for 11 h. Analgesia was assessed by pressure algometry at the tibia. ⋯ Serum sufentanil concentrations were related to ITS dose in a statistically significant manner, reached clinically significant concentrations, and followed a time course similar to analgesia and measures of respiratory depression. However, there was no significant increase in measured analgesia associated with the increases in serum sufentanil concentrations. We conclude that in our volunteer model of lower extremity pain, administering ITS in doses larger than 12.5 microg does not improve the speed of onset, magnitude, or duration of analgesia and only causes dose-related increases in serum sufentanil concentrations, which may augment respiratory depression.

Anesthesia and analgesia · Aug 1997Randomized Controlled Trial Comparative Study Clinical Trial
A randomized, double-blind, dose-response comparison of epidural fentanyl versus sufentanil analgesia after cesarean section.
This study was designed to determine and compare the dose-response characteristics, speed of onset, and relative potency of single-dose epidural fentanyl (F) and sufentanil (S) for postoperative pain relief. Eighty women undergoing cesarean section (C/S) with epidural 2% lidocaine with epinephrine (1:200,000) were randomly assigned to receive double-blind epidural administration of F (25, 50, 100, or 200 microg) or S (5, 10, 20, or 30 microg) (n = 10 per group) upon complaint of pain postoperatively. Visual analog scales (VAS, 0-100 mm) were used to assess pain and sedation at baseline; at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45, and 60 min; and every 30 min until further analgesia was requested. ⋯ The 50% and 95% effective dose values for each opioid to achieve a VAS score <10 mm were F 33 microg and 92 microg and S 6.7 microg and 17.5 microg. There were no differences among groups in sedation scores or side effects. Our data suggest that the relative analgesic potency of epidural S:F is approximately 5 and that there are no differences between the opioids in the onset, duration, and effectiveness of analgesia when equianalgesic doses are administered postoperatively after lidocaine anesthesia for C/S.
- Randomized Controlled Trial Comparative Study Clinical Trial
Extradural clonidine combined with sufentanil and 0.0625% bupivacaine for analgesia in labour.
We have studied the use of clonidine combined with low doses of sufentanil and bupivacaine in 45 parturients requiring extradural analgesia for the first stage of labour, in a double-blind, randomized study. We gave 0.0625% bupivacaine 10 ml containing 1:200,000 adrenaline and sufentanil 10 micrograms (1 ml) to which was added 0.9% saline, or clonidine 100 or 150 micrograms (1 ml). We compared the quality (VAS scores) and duration of analgesia, motor block, maternal haemodynamic state (mean arterial pressure and heart rate) and fetal and maternal side effects. ⋯ Analgesia was associated with a reduction in mean arterial pressure with clonidine. However, these adverse side effects were of minor clinical importance regardless of the extradural clonidine dose, except for a high incidence of fetal heart tracing abnormalities when clonidine 150 micrograms was used. These effects associated with a limited effect on analgesia may curtail the widespread use of clonidine as an adjunct to extradural 0.0625% bupivacaine with sufentanil 10 micrograms during labour.American Express transfer it comes to earning travel rewards with a credit card, there are plenty of strategies to consider.

*The information about the American Express® Green Card, Amex EveryDay Credit Card and the Amex EveryDay Preferred Credit Card has been collected independently by Bankrate.com. The card details have not been reviewed or approved by the card issuer.
To redeem your American Express Membership Rewards points, all you have to do is log into your account at americanexpress.com. From there, you can click on “Explore Rewards” and see all the options available to you.
Non-travel redemption options include covering charges on your credit card or redeeming for gift cards or merchandise through American Express. You can also pay with points at checkout with retailers like Amazon.com and Grubhub. Generally speaking, you’ll get less than 1 cent per point in value for each of these options, although exact redemption amounts vary depending on the retailer.
If you want to cash in your points for travel, you can do so through AmexTravel.com. This travel website works similarly to Expedia.com since it lets you compare all kinds of travel—airfare, hotels, travel packages, rental cars and cruises—in one place.
You can pay with American Express Membership Rewards points and get 1 cent per point in value for airfare (and slightly less for hotels and other travel), but you can also book travel through this portal with cash. If you’re short on points for the redemption you want, you can also pay with a combination of points and cash. Just keep in mind that you need a minimum of 5,000 American Express Membership Rewards points in our account in order to pay with points.
American Express transfer partners—how to get the most value
All American Express credit cards that let you earn American Express Membership Rewards points let you transfer those points to airline and hotel partners if you choose. Transfer ratios vary, although most partners let you transfer at a 1,000:1,000 ratio.
With that in mind, some partners may work better than others for you, but it all depends on your travel goals and preferences. Here’s a rundown of each of the Amex transfer partners, what points are worth in each program based on valuations from The Points Guy, and a few ways to use them.
*Disclaimer: Listed airline loyalty program reward redemption costs may vary since the time of writing.
Aer Lingus
Amex Membership Rewards points transfer to Aer Lingus at a 1,000:1,000 ratio, and they’re typically worth around 1.5 cents each. Redemptions vary, but many people use this partner to fly from the East Coast of the U.S. to Europe, with off-peak flights from Boston to Dublin for 13,000 Avios and no fuel surcharges.
Also note that Aer Lingus is a Chase Ultimate Rewards transfer partner, so you can earn points in that program, too.
AeroMexico
You can turn 1,000 American Express Membership Rewards points into 1,600 miles with AeroMexico, and you can use these rewards in more ways than you think. For example, you could fly round-trip economy to or from Mexico to Asia for 124,000 miles during low season, or from Mexico to the United States in Premier Class (business class) for 104,000 miles round-trip during low season.
Air Canada (Aeroplan)
Air Canada is part of the Star Alliance, and they publish an award chart that makes it easy to know how many miles you’ll need for a flight. Some of the highlights in their award chart include round-trip economy flights from Canada or the continental United States to Europe for 60,000 to 75,000 miles depending on the zone, and you can fly short-haul flights within Canada and the U.S. for as little as 15,000 miles round-trip in economy.
Aeroplan miles are worth approximately 1.5 cents each and have a 1,000:1,000 transfer ratio with Amex.
Air France / Flying Blue
Air France doesn’t have an award chart, but this partner frequently offers round-trip flights from the U.S. to various European destinations for less than 25,000 miles one-way. Since Air France is a SkyTeam Alliance partner with Delta Air Lines, you can often cash in your Flying Blue miles to fly on Delta metal for a lot fewer miles than you would fork over within the Delta SkyMiles program.
Miles in this program are typically worth around 1.2 cents each, but it depends on how you redeem them.
Alitalia
While Alitalia recently announced its entry into bankruptcy protection, they’re still an Amex transfer partner for now. They’re also a good option for flights within Italy, with one-way economy fares costing just 10,000 miles. You can also fly from the continental United States, Canada, Cuba, India or Mexico in economy for 30,000 miles one-way or 60,000 miles round-trip.
All Nippin Airways (ANA)
Miles within the ANA Mileage Club are worth approximately 1.4 cents each, and they’re best for a wide range of itineraries that start or end in Japan. Some highlights in the ANA award chart include low season flights from Japan to Hawaii starting at just 35,000 miles round-trip, as well as round-trip low season flights to North America starting at just 40,000 miles.
Asia Miles
Asia Miles are worth approximately 1.3 cents each, and their distance-based award chart means you’ll fork over more miles when you travel further from home. While you can get creative with this program and fly all around the world if you want, many people save up these miles in order to fly Cathay Pacific from the U.S. to Asia in First Class for just 110,000 miles one-way, provided the distance is 5,001 to 7,500 miles.
Options within this range could include Hong Kong to Seattle or San Francisco, for example.
Avianca
Avianca LifeMiles are worth approximately 1.7 cents each, and this partner doesn’t charge any fuel surcharges on their flights, which is a major plus. Some of the popular ways to redeem miles in this program include flying Lufthansa First Class to Europe for 87,000 miles, or flying First Class on United Airlines across the United States for 25,000 miles.
British Airways
British Airways avios are worth around 1.5 cents each, but the value you’ll receive for your redemption depends on the exact flight you book. This partner does have off-peak and peak rates that can help you save avios by flying outside of peak travel times.
Many frequent flyers use these miles to fly short distances on American Airlines, a oneworld alliance partner. Flights to the Caribbean from the U.S. are also a popular option considering you could fly from Miami to Nassau in the Bahamas or Montego Bay, Jamaica for just 7,500 avios one-way.
Delta SkyMiles
Delta SkyMiles is a popular frequent flyer program, yet it’s another one where you don’t know how many miles you’ll need for a flight. However, Delta SkyMiles are normally worth around 1.2 cents each.
You can frequently find round-trip domestic flights for less than 25,000 miles, however, and round-trip economy flights to Europe from many U.S. cities can often be found for less than 60,000 miles. Since Delta has their own co-branded airline credit cards, many consumers also pair Amex credit cards with Delta credit cards in order to rack up more miles over time.
Emirates
Emirates Skywards miles are worth approximately 1.2 cents each, and this is another popular Chase Ultimate Rewards transfer partner as of last year. While flights can cost a ton of miles, Emirates is well known for being one of the most luxurious airlines in the world.
As an example of how many miles you’ll need for a flight, you can redeem 72,500 miles to fly in economy from New York to Dubai, or as little as 217,500 miles to fly the same route in First Class.
Etihad Airways
Etihad Guest miles are worth around 1.4 cents each, and you can use them for flights on various partners to most major destinations around the world. In terms of how many miles you’ll need, you could fly from Abu Dhabi to New York for 115,363 miles in economy round-trip, or in First Class for 272,180 miles.
Hawaiian Airlines
HawaiianMiles are currently worth around 0.9 cents each, but they can represent significant value for flights from the U.S. to Hawaii or within the islands themselves. Neighbor island flights start at just 7,500 miles one-way in economy or 15,000 miles in First Class. You can also fly from North America to Hawaiian destinations like Maui or Kauai in First Class for as little as 40,000 miles one-way.
Iberia Plus
Iberia Avios are worth 1.5 cents each, any many people maximize them for flights within or to Europe, and particularly to Spain. You can frequently fly from cities like New York to Madrid for 34,000 Avios one-way, or from New York to Barcelona for as little as 37,000 miles one-way.
JetBlue Airways
When you transfer points to JetBlue you’ll get 200 miles for every 250 Membership Rewards points you transfer over. These miles are worth around 1.3 cents each, and although JetBlue doesn’t offer an award chart, they do offer excellent redemption options for the destinations they visit within the U.S., the Caribbean and Mexico and Central America.
One-way flights within the U.S. frequently come in at less than 10,000 miles, and you can also find one-way flights to the Caribbean (or home) for less than 15,000 miles one-way.
Qantas
Qantas is the main airline of Australia, and their award flights are priced by zone. This means that you’ll pay a specific number of miles based on the zone you’re flying into and out of, and these zones are largely determined based on distance and the number of miles flown.
As an example of how many miles you’ll need for an award, a one-way flight from Los Angeles to Sydney, Australia might set you back 41,900 miles in economy or 108,400 miles in business class. A flight within Australia, such as Perth to Sydney, might cost as little as 18,000 miles in economy or 41,500 miles in business class one-way.
Singapore Airlines
The Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer program lets you visit a surprising number of destinations outside of Singapore, and miles are worth approximately 1.3 cents each. Highlights in their award chart include flights from Singapore to Europe or the west coast of the USA for 70,000 miles in economy. A one-way flight from Singapore to the west coast of the USA in Business Advantage class also starts at just 125,000 miles.
Virgin Atlantic
Virgin Atlantic miles are worth around 1.6 cents each, and you can use them to move from the United Kingdom to various destinations around the globe. An economy flight from the northeastern U.S. to the U.K. starts at just 20,000 miles in economy round-trip, but the same flight in Upper Class starts at just 95,000 miles.
Just beware of carrier-imposed fuel surcharges from this airline, which can be well over $1,000 for premium cabins and hundreds of dollars even for economy awards.
Choice Privileges Rewards
Choice Privileges points are only worth .6 cents each, but hotel loyalty points tend to be worth less than airline miles. Either way, you can turn 1,000 Membership Rewards points into 1,000 points in this program, and free nights start at just 8,000 points.
Hilton Honors
When you transfer American Express Membership Rewards points to the Hilton Honors program, you’ll get 2,000 Hilton points for every 1,000 Amex points you transfer. These points are also worth approximately 0.6 cents each on average, and you can use them to stay at more than 5,900 properties around the world.
Hilton no longer uses an award chart, but you can frequently find mid-tier hotels for 30,000 to 60,000 points per night, and their top-tier properties tend to cost around 95,000 points per night. This means that you could stay at a property like the Conrad Maldives Rangali Island for this rate, and don’t forget that Hilton offers their own co-branded credit cards with American Express that can help you enjoy elite status and other perks. Hilton also offers a fifth night free when you book four consecutive nights with points and you’re a Silver member or higher.
Marriott Bonvoy
Marriott Bonvoy points are worth slightly more at 0.8 cents each, and this brand does offer an award chart that makes it easy to know how many points you’ll need for a free stay. Off-peak awards start at just 5,000 points per night in Category 1 properties, yet you’ll need as many as 100,000 points for a peak night award in a Category 8 property. Also, remember that you’ll get a fifth night free when you redeem points for four consecutive nights.
How does this translate into the real world? This means you could redeem as little as 35,000 points per night to stay at the Renaissance Aruba Resort & Casino, which could mean staying five nights for just 140,000 points.Japanese Small Rock Garden Pool Patio Ideas 2153 Hostelgardennet Model 10

- Color :ON July 22, my husband, three-year-old son and I went to Dan Ryan's, in Pacific Place, for dinner, where he was given a balloon by staff. We then went to see a film, Beethoven's 2nd at UA Queensway, at 9.30pm. At the entrance, we were asked to leave the balloon at the door and have it collected after the movie on our way out, which was quite understandable, even though my son gave it quite reluctantly. After the film, we went to collect it, but to our dismay, the lady at the door just shrugged and said someone else had already taken it, and there was no other item left at the counter. If the theatre does not allow its patrons to bring in other foodstuffs or items, it should at least be responsible for its loss. There is a system a lot of stores use giving people a numbered tag, to differentiate their packets when they leave. Maybe to an adult a balloon may be of hardly any value, but to a child it means a great deal! DIANE MELWANI Mid-LevelsDark Web Forum Links| Dark Web Links To Access Forums at Deep Web

It’s a move that officials hope will preserve more affordable housing in the city, but may already face legal challenges.
If the ordinance passes a second vote at next week’s meeting and is signed by the mayor, owners would be required to first give qualified nonprofits — such as the Mission Economic Development Agency and Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation — the opportunity to purchase a building with three or more residential rental units that currently exists or is under construction, or a vacant lot where such a building could be built.Our final Day, with Snaefellsnes and Reykjavik on our schedule! Unfortunately, the sunshine of our first 5 days did not return, and the final day started like the previous day had ended: cloudy and rainy. But 5 sunny days out of 7 is probably already more than you can ask for. After all, we’re close to the Artic Cycle and not in the Sahara.
Anzeige*
Snaefellsnes
Our final day started like the previous day had ended: cloudy and rainy. We got a last glimpse at Kirkjufell, my favorite Icelandic Mountain:
Unfortunately, the bad weather ruined our travel plan of the day, as we had intended to try an “F road” (F stands probably for four wheel drive) no. 570, passing the Snaefellsjökul glacier. However, looking at the sky, it became pretty clear that we would not see anything. We decided to go straight to the south coast of Snaefellsnes and try the highly recommended coastal walk between Arnarstapi and Hellnar.
The Arnarstapi Coast
Well, the weather did not really improve during the drive, and when we arrived at Arnarstapi, it was still raining, combined with a gusty wind. Thus, we just went down the short walk to the cliffs and back.
As the view in both directions (to the east as well as to the west) looked the same (sad and grey)…
We decided to go straight to Reykjavik, where we arrived around noon.
Reykjavik – cute little Capital
Fortunately, we could get into our booked apartment right away and had the entire afternoon for sightseeing in the Icelandic capital. Starting with a nice coffee at a nice coffee shop called “Reykjavik Roasters” – they have several coffee shops all over Reykjavik:
Our first aim (after having enjoyed a great coffee) was the famous
Hallgrimskirkja
This Church is not really old, but quite special. Nordic-“sober” on the outside, but light and friendly inside.
The design is supposed to reflect the Icelandic nature: Guðjón Samúelsson (1887-1950), architect of the Hallgrimskirkja, got inspired by the famous Svartifoss waterfall. So, the central part of the facade reflects the watefall, the adjacent wings represent the basalt colums richt and left to Svartifoss.
Being one of the major tourist attractions in Reykjavik and a preferred picture motive…
…it was pretty crowded, and more so because of a nice organ concert:
Laugarvegur – the city’s shopping mile
Afterwards, we walked through the small roads around Laugarvegur street…
…tried delicious sweets like this one called “Kanilsnuda” (a sweet cinnamon roll)…
…passed the house of the Icelandic Prime Minister:
…and visited the famous
Harpa Concert Hall
Where we took hundreds of pictures of the magnificent hall:
And some more pictures of Reykjavik
From there, it’s just a stone’s throw to the old harbour,
and back to Laugarvegur.
Passing cute colorful houses…
…and areas that have everything: innovative facades, cute old houses and the average ugly backyard…
To tell the truth: Reykjavik is not exactly a “Metropole”, but rather a small city with a certain “provincial touch” (in a positive sense!):
Good Gastro Scene
However, there’s no lack of nice cafes, bars and restaurants! Finally we had a very nice dinner at a small restaurant off the tourist track called “Reykjavik Kitchen”:
After dinner, we visited the Hlemmur Square market close by, a place highly frequented by the natives (despite exorbitantly high prices…).
And that’s it – the next morning started with a very early drive to Keflavik airport (our flight back home was scheduled for around 7:30), the drop-off of our rental car at 6:00, and a final surprise at the airport: there are about 8-10 flights scheduled for this early morning departure, and the airport hall and particularly the Iceland Air counters were completely packed:
It took us 45 minutes to drop our baggage, and 30 minutes for the security check. So, if you flight should start between 6:30 and 8:00 a.m.: get there EARLY!!

Why...Why start AKPT right now?
Updated: Aug 25, 2018
One of us is at the relative beginning of her career and the other is farther to the end. But why start a cash based business now in this healthcare climate? AKPT was created to provide the highest level of one on one musculoskeletal care to our patients. We recognize the importance of spending time to identify and treat the underlying cause, rather than treating the symptoms, in order to restore each individual so they can meet their personal goals and return to an active lifestyle. Our promise is to continue to pursue the highest level of training in our field, a positive environment to heal, and a passion to help each patient reach their highest potential. We are Primary Care Musculoskeletal experts.
We want to be the first person you call when you are hurting after a weekend bike ride, a tennis match, or a torn ACL, meniscus or labrum. We want you to call us when your hip is pinching deep in your squat or your feet hurt every time you try to increase your mileage. We want to spend the time with our patients that is not possible in the traditional healthcare setting. We care about movement from the top down and bottom up. We want to look at the whole picture that is you. We want to give each person personal time and individualized care from a specialist every visit.
Most importantly we have created AKPT because we both want to make a difference and get people back to an active lifestyle quicker and with more resources than they came to us with. That is what fuels us and makes this adventure so special. Signing With Eagles – Bad For the Eagles?

Nov 6, 2020
Earlier this year, Food Engineering announced MycoTechnology as 2020 Sustainable Plant of the Year. The facility is featured on the cover of the magazine’s November 2020 issue.
2020 Sustainable Plant of the Year
As Food Engineering’s 2020 Sustainable Plant of the Year, MycoTechnology is recognized for placing an emphasis on sustainability from the very start of their project and carrying that commitment through to the way they operate the plant today.
Water efficiency
Water can be a big hit to the bottom line for food processors in Colorado. Not surprisingly, it was the number 1 concern for MycoTechnology. CRB’s team worked closely with MycoTechnology to identify unique ways to save water within the process. Running at peak production, the estimated water savings is 3,600 gallons per day or 1.26 million gallons per year. This equates to approximately 59% of total CIP water reclaimed.
Energy efficiency
The facility leverages Colorado’s climate by incorporating outside air whenever possible to reduce the overall energy needed for cooling. When the outside air temperature is lower than the return air temperature (and at an acceptable dew point to avoid high humidity indoors), it is used to reduce the cooling loads. When the outdoor air temperature drops below the air handler supply temperature, the outside air is modulated to provide maximum cooling but avoid re-heat needs.
The facility includes office, conference and lab space, in addition to production, packaging and warehouse space. The needs of each space were considered individually to design HVAC support.
Process efficiency
MycoTechnology’s process requires fermentation, drying and packaging, which come with high energy demand. The team looked carefully at every aspect of the process to identify opportunities to be more efficient. Heat recovery provided several sustainability wins for the facility, allowing the team to use heat from one area or part of the process in another.
Automation allows plant operators to keep a close eye on production trends, quickly making adjustments as needed from a central control room.
Culture of sustainability
MycoTechnology’s drive for sustainability reaches beyond facility design and operations. It’s a part of the culture, driven by employees and supported by leadership. The sustainability committee meets regularly to discuss and track on the company’s sustainability goals.
Learn more about the sustainable features of MychoTechnology’s new headquarters and production facility.ARLINGTON, Va.

Pope asks Italian bishops finally to implement tribunal reforms
VATICAN CITY (CNS) — Pope Francis told the bishops of Italy that he was disappointed that so many of their dioceses had yet to implement the reforms he ordered to make the marriage annulment process quicker, more pastoral and less expensive.
“I am saddened to note that the reform, after more than four years, remains far from being applied in most Italian dioceses,” Pope Francis, the bishop of Rome, told other members of the Italian bishops’ conference.
The bishops were holding their annual spring meeting May 20-23 at the Vatican, and Pope Francis opened the gathering. He gave a short speech focused on “synodality” and collegiality, marriage tribunals and the relationship of bishops to their priests.
He spent about 20 minutes reading his prepared text, then reporters were asked to leave and the livestream of the meeting was cut so that the pope and bishops could converse in private.
In September 2015, Pope Francis issued two — reforming sections of canon law dealing with requests for the declaration of the nullity of a marriage.
The reforms — which do away with an automatic appeal of all decisions, charge diocesan bishops with responsibility for handling some cases and institute an abbreviated process for cases where the evidence is especially clear and uncontested — were meant to streamline the process and help couples in need of healing, the pope said.
Pope Francis also insisted in the documents that the annulment process be free of charge or as close to free as possible.
“This procedural reform is based on proximity and gratuity,” the pope told the bishops. “Proximity to wounded families means that the judgment, as far as possible, takes place within the diocesan church without delay and unnecessary extensions. And gratuity refers back to the Gospel mandate which says, ‘Without cost you have received; without cost you are to give.'”
Pope Francis said he hoped the reforms ordered in 2015 would find “their full and immediate application in all the dioceses” of the country.
The reforms, he said, aim to help dioceses demonstrate that “the church is mother and has at heart the good of her children, who in this case are wounded by a love that has been shattered.”
On the matter on relations between bishops and priests, Pope Francis said that relationship is the “backbone” that supports all relationships within a diocese.
“Unfortunately, some bishops have difficulty establishing a relationship with their priests, thereby running the risk of ruining their mission and weakening the mission of the church,” the pope said.
Pope Francis urged bishops to make sure that if one of their priests calls, he returns the call immediately or by the next day at the latest. “This way the priest will know he has a bishop who is a father.”
A bishop has an obligation to be close to his priests “without discrimination and without preferences or favoritism,” the pope said. “A true shepherd lives among his flock and knows how to listen to and welcome all without prejudice. We must not fall into the temptation of welcoming only priests who are nice or are flatterers.”
A bishop also must take care not to give assignments only to the eager and the “climbers,” ignoring those who are “introverts, meek, shy or problematic,” he said.
Many times today, the pope said, priests are disrespected, made fun of or “even condemned because of the errors or crimes of some of their colleagues,” so they need to be able to find support, encouragement and consolation from their bishop.
On the issue of “synodality and collegiality,” Pope Francis insisted that the idea of everyone in the church walking together and working together to share the Gospel is the lifestyle God wants from people in the church.
Saying he had heard rumors of possible plans for a synod for Italy, Pope Francis said the first step would be to review the “medical records” of the Italian church to ensure that laypeople, priests and bishops all recognize they have a shared responsibility for the life of the church.Tendonitis
Tendonitis is all too common condition and includes tennis elbow, golfer’s elbow, Achilles tendinitis and rotator cuff lesions of the shoulder. Related conditions include bursitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, trigger finger and plantar fasciitis.
Treatment
To treat inflammation in ligaments and tendons we need to first take the strain off these tendons by not overusing them but also need to supply the building blocks for their repair.
Tendons are mainly composed from collagen. One remedy which helps here is a collagen supplement which are expensive (to be absorbed this needs to be hydrolysed collagen: 6000 -10,000 mg daily). But the rate of collagen formation in the body is controlled by Vitamin C so supplying this is an easier and cheaper way to make collagen. Aim for 4 to 10 grams daily. It needs to be spread throughout the day (as Vitamin C doesn’t stay in the body long). However another essential element is water. This allows the tendons to glide over surfaces and is a major component of connective tissue. Drinking enough water greatly helps the healing process. Avoid sugar. This produces by-products that damage the cross-linking of collagen (this is the way proteins bind together).
Another useful supplement is MSM (methylsufonylmethane). This is a sulphur-containing nutrient, naturally found in the body, which supports connective tissue and improves the cross-linking of collagen..
MSM can be taken as capsules, crystals or powder (the last two are more convenient for higher doses). Adding an MSM cream or gel will aid the healing process. Typically it takes between 5 days and 2 weeks to see improvement, (sometimes longer if it has become chronic).
Pycnogenol has a high affinity to collagen, binding to it, helping in the production of collagen and protecting it from damage (suggested doses 30 -60mg daily).
Occasionally other supplements such as vitamin B5 and B6 are needed or local treatments such as castor oil packs (see “Alternative Treatments for Arthritis” leaflet for more information on B5).
The dose of Vitamin B6 or pyridoxine is 100mg twice daily for twelve weeks. If used longer at this does there is a small risk of neuropathy with numbness & tingling. The active form of pyridoxine, pyridoxal-5-phosphate (P6P) often works better. Zinc is needed to convert pyridoxine into P6P. So either adding zinc (30mg daily) or using P6P which can be used at a lower dose, 100 to 150mg daily initially and then tapered down. The problem with higher doses of standard pyridoxine is that it can overwhelm the body’s ability to produce P6P and so get in the way (hence the numbness and tingling).
Muscles need magnesium and 40% of the body’s magnesium stores are in muscle. We need calcium to contract muscles and magnesium to relax them. If the ratio of calcium to magnesium is too high (this is typically as most people are magnesium deficient) the muscles get to tight and tense (see separate magnesium leaflet for more information).
Connective tissues and tendons also benefit from gentle stretching exercises so stretching needs to be part of the treatment (but be aware that overstretching can make them worse).
The Danger of Fluoride
Fluoride binds with magnesium producing an insoluble compound called sellaite which replaces magnesium in bone and cartilage causing it to become brittle and weak. Perhaps the most serious example of this comes from the fluoroquinolone antibiotics (such as ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin) which can trigger tendinitis and tendon rupture. These drugs now have a black box warnings for this reason. Other major sources of fluoride are toothpastes, dental procedures and drugs. Other drugs which contain fluoride include fluoxetine, atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, ezetimibe, lansoprazole and steroids.Color Options Thrive Themes WordPress Themes

Records: 5,276 · Complete: 100%
Approximately six and a half thousand Distinguished Flying Medals were awarded for the Second World War, but many were gazetted without citation. Even a substantial number of ‘immediate’ citations were often just abstracts from the actual Recommendation. The original Recommendations were deposited in the Public Record Office (PRO), but the random organisation of these voluminous manuscript files made it difficult or impossible to locate a particular record. Additionally a significant number of Recommendations are missing.

It was a bad year for video games. Not the games themselves, really—there were plenty of fine games released last year. No, it was a bad year for the culture of video games. Last year was, of course, the year of Gamergate. The year when everybody got to see the worst parts of that vast swath of people who call themselves “gamers.” The ones who ruined that word for the rest of us. The “movement’s” rampant misogyny hit the mainstream and hit it hard.Gamergate is still around. The petulant children who threatened female video game developers and personalities for daring to, um, have an opinion are still there. But no one is talking about them. No one cares about them.And it seems that maybe, just maybe, we’re starting to learn from them.There have been more than a few instances where women lamented the lack of female protagonists in video games. The response was invariably something to the effect of, “If you don’t like it, go make your own games,” with some slurs and/or threats thrown in for good measure. And though there are dozens of things wrong with that line of thinking, the most practically obvious is the fact that the games they were asking about weren’t the sort of titles that a few people can just get together and make. They wanted (and want) games with $50+ million budgets that star interesting female characters. And let’s not pretend like this only goes one way. I want that too. I’m sick of playing as muscly men. I think the vast majority of us are.
And though this year’s Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) underwhelmed, there was a glimmer of light that maybe, just maybe, people working in the industry are too. It’s the largest gaming event of the year, where the industry’s companies tell the world what to expect from them in the year(s) to come. And more than a half-dozen new games were unveiled with female protagonists or generally playable female characters. The gender gap is still a chasm, to be sure, but these are significant first steps.
There’s a new Tomb Raider game coming out. Lara Croft is undoubtedly the most famous female video game protagonist, what with Angelina Jolie’s portrayal of her in some not-particularly-good film adaptations of the series. But for far too long, Lara Croft has been the exception to the rule. The Metroid series stars a badass female character, Samus, but she’s always suited up and the designs of her out of suit hit the same problematic stereotypes that have always plagued female characters, Lara Croft included. A character like Faith, the free-running protagonist from 2008’s Mirror’s Edge, breaks from that mold, but in this industry, properties can die for any number of reasons, and that one has been in development limbo for years. It wasn’t until this E3 where its sequel, Catalyst, was finally unveiled at EA’s press conference. And it looks awesome.
Two of the most interesting new titles announced at E3 this year were the terribly named Horizon: Zero Dawn, announced at Sony’s conference, and the not-much-better Recore, announced by Microsoft. Horizon, from the developers of the Killzone franchise, is about a tribe of humans struggling to survive long after humanity has been wiped out. It’s the far-flung future with a prehistoric twist (and fittingly features mecha-dinosaurs as enemies). Less is known about Recore, but it follows a woman and her AI dog companion as they fight off hordes of other dangerous AI. Both of these games are brand new properties being backed by major companies, and they star badass women. But not just badass women: badass women who aren’t sexualized.
Of the big games announced, only one, a sequel to the niche game Nier developed by the team behind the highly sexualized Bayonetta series, dressed its female character up in a skimpy outfit designed to get the audience’s imagination going. The rest looked like, well, just people, dressed the way you would expect a person to dress themselves rather than dressed by some third party with poor intentions. Considering that the first thing anyone could notice about Lara Croft in 1996 was how ridiculous her polygonal breasts looked, we had a long way to come. And when Rise of the Tomb Raider was shown off at E3, Croft spent the entire demo in a parka. A sequel to the stealth game Dishonored surprised everyone by featuring a female protagonist. Later, it was revealed that there are actually two main characters—one male and one female—but that Bethesda chose to highlight the female character during the game’s reveal speaks volumes. They also made a point to note that the upcoming Fallout sequel will also allow you to play as a woman, though that isn’t new for the series. But the Dishonored reveal makes a particularly notable counterpoint to the other reveal of a female character in a franchise sequel. If any company had to prove its commitment to equality this year, it was Ubisoft. It’s one of the largest video game publishers out there, but the 2014 entry in its flagship franchise, Assassin’s Creed: Unity, was marred both by technical failings and conceptual ones. The game featured a co-op mode where up to four players could go out assassinating together. But all of the playable options were male. When asked why there were no playable women, the response was jaw-dropping: Ubisoft creative director Alex Amancio said it was simply too much work: “It’s double the animations, it’s double the voices, all that stuff and double the visual assets. Especially because we have customizable assassins. It was really a lot of extra production work.” And the company’s other big release of the year, Far Cry 4, had the same problem, though that game’s developers at least seemed aware of why people were upset about it. But here’s the thing: What Amancio said wasn’t even really true. Sure, to really build a female playable character from the ground up would require that much work, but to get a decent approximation? Animator Jonathan Cooper took to Twitter to say, “In my educated opinion, I would estimate this to be a day or two’s work. Not a replacement of 8000 animations.” And who’s he to talk? Well, he was the animation director of Assassin’s Creed III. And he also worked with the team that animated Assassin’s Creed III: Liberation, a series spinoff that actually featured a female protagonist, using much of the work done for the main series entry. It’s a simple and obvious fact: Characters in games share animations all the time. To pretend as though each new character model requires a fresh start is a blatant lie. So the company had a lot to prove this year. And if you were to only watch their stage, you’d think they’d done it. Their lineup of speakers was by far the most diverse. They had Aisha Tyler as the host again, as they have since 2012, but she was not the only person of color on that stage, nor the only woman. But if you were to just see the games? You’d think nothing had changed. A man with a terrible British accent in Victorian England is Robin Hood or something. So what? It wasn’t until later that evening, when Sony showed off a different trailer, that I was interested. That trailer starred a woman named Evie, apparently the elder twin of that far-less-interesting guy. But Evie shows up and assassinates the hell out of some random guys in some particularly brutal ways. It was pretty awesome... except for the fact that Jacob narrated the trailer, not Evie. Two steps forward, one step back. But it’s progress. Real, tangible progress. And even though there is much more work to be done, we have to acknowledge that we’ve taken some steps forward and celebrate it. And, most crucially, we need to reward it. At the same time that we condemn companies that refuse to diversify their characters, we need to help those that do. We as a culture need to send a very clear message to game companies that this is the sort of thing we’ve been waiting for. If every female-fronted game is a sales flop, publishers will get spooked and we’ll be back to nothing but muscled marines for the next decade. We can’t let that happen. We won’t let it happen. The tides have begun to turn. It’s up to all of us to help make sure they never turn back.The sale of this item may be subject to regulation by the U.

I first started my pursuit of the homemade Alan from the Hangover costume with finding the T-Shirt. This is the ORIGINAL T-Shirt that Alan wore from the Hangover and you can find it at Urban Outfitters ($25). I then purchased a baby carrier from Wal-Mart ($20). After that, I had to try and find a baby that looked like baby Carlos and I bought one from Wal-Mart ($5). I then purchased tiny sunglasses for him from the Dollar Store ($1). I couldn’t find the sunglasses that Alan wore from the movie (BluBlockers), but I did find some great replica glasses ($5).
For my beard, I couldn’t find one that resembled that of Alan’s, so I bought a Jerry-Curl wig from a Halloween store and cut it and shaped it to be like a bear ($15). I then purchased my khaki pants from Goodwill ($6). For the final touch to the costume, I bought a pack of gauze to wrap around my right hand/arm just like Alan had during the movie after he slices his hand to make a toast on top of the hotel in Vegas ($3). I already had the boat shoes for the outfit so that was pretty good.
Overall, the outfit cost $80 and it was WELL worth it because everyone told me I had the best costume, and to this day I’m still hearing how my homemade Alan from the Hangover costume was the best costume that everyone had seen in a long time! I even wore the costume for my Fraternity Composite picture.

Undesirable parameter values, harmful external events, and unknown mechanical failures can render process equipment completely helpless. C2i™ Technology has the ability to remedy unacceptable conditions and tolerate certain mechanical failures to keep your process running safely and securely until the specified fault can be properly addressed.
Traditional linear-resistant electric heating elements employ Magnesium Oxide (MgO) to provide the necessary dielectric strength or electrical isolation from the heater coil to the outer sheath. The MgO however, is inherently hygroscopic, which means it naturally absorbs moisture. When excessive moisture contaminates the MgO the dielectric strength becomes compromised. During lengthy inactive periods, the moisture content may exceed a safe limit, allowing internal arcing to take place when the element is activated. Unless the moisture is removed, catastrophic heater failure can occur which can destroy equipment, shut down entire processes, and cause significant production losses.
The solution to this problem is to utilize controllers with sophisticated C2i™ parameter monitoring technology that sense when heating elements contain moisture and understand how to remedy the condition.
The dielectric strength of a heater can be monitored by the amount of leakage current within each circuit. As the dielectric strength deteriorates, the leakage current, which is measured in milliamps (mA), increases. High leakage current levels typically occur at system startup since the heater has been de-energized long enough for it to absorb moisture. In this instance, controllers with C2i™ Technology detect the elevated leakage current and enable one of several proprietary soft start algorithms, such as a current limiting output. This control method reduces the output power to a safe level so that no damage to the electric heater occurs until the moisture is driven out of the element. Both the output power and the duration of the soft start profile are programmable by the user.
In the event that the current leakage level exceeds the maximum allowable limit during normal operation, our industry exclusive C2i™ Technology controllers automatically reduce output power to 15% and switch the control firing mode from Zero Cross to Phase Angle. The controller will remain in this control mode until the leakage current parameter value returns to a safe level.
By utilizing controllers with C2i™ Technology in applications where moisture can be detrimental, heater life is greatly extended, system safety and process integrity is significantly improved and operational costs are reduced.
Events external to the process, such as sudden significant current or voltage surges, can damage electronic and mechanical components and be detrimental to process equipment resulting in an unplanned system shut down.
In applications susceptible to intermittent short-circuits and voltage overloads, Chromalox power controllers with C2i™ Technology are able to manage these events and can be programmed to restore power automatically or manually when the fault has cleared, preventing complete process shutdown and maintaining production. These controllers continuously monitor the load current and instantaneously isolate the power switching device if the load exceeds a pre-set threshold. The controller automatically enters into a soft-start control mode after current is restored. During this ramp-up time, the firmware tests for any permanent short circuits and once again cuts the power should any exist. This prevents further system damage in the event that the fault is not effectively cleared.
This patented C2i™ fault-protection feature eliminates the need for extra-rapid fuses, reduces machine downtime and the costs associated with replacing fuses. By reacting immediately and tolerating the harmful event, this C2i™ Technology also prevents increased operating costs associated with process equipment damage and product loss.
Without warning, critical system components such as temperature sensors, can fail or be inadvertently damaged. Excessive corrosion or vibration, exposure to extreme temperatures and even human error can contribute to unexpected sensor failures. In most control systems, the process controller does not know how to properly behave when the expected sensor input signal is not received. As a result, controllers resort to default output settings as a safety precaution. In many cases, alarms are enabled and the heater output is set to zero percent, which brings the process to a halt.
This unplanned downtime, production stoppage and potential loss of valuable material can be avoided with C2i™ Technology. Chromalox utilizes exclusive controller features and developed control technologies to efficiently manage sensor faults and failures.
Chromalox offers controllers that can be programmed with a default heater output from 0% to 100% when presented with a sensor fault condition. This permits an enhanced level of process reliability and allows the owner to maintain production at a compromised level of control until the sensor problem can be properly addressed.
In today’s sophisticated industrial systems it is impractical to have process heating equipment which may only be monitored locally.
To ensure complete system awareness and safety, all process equipment must efficiently communicate with centralized control centers and provide real-time system wide health status. To satisfy these needs, C2i™ Technology provides expert systemwide integration using a multitude of widely accepted industrial protocols and developed supervisory control technologies.
Industrial companies utilize a distributed control system (DCS) to remotely communicate with all significant process systems throughout their facilities. Chromalox offers several Fieldbus protocols, such as Profibus, ProfiNet, DeviceNet, Modbus, EtherCAT, and several others, which provide the necessary language and connectivity for proper remote equipment monitoring and parameter management. In addition, Chromalox has developed an industry exclusive wireless temperature sensing C2i™ Technology which permits Chromalox heat trace controllers to seamlessly integrate with existing WirelessHART protocol networks. This capability solves remote application challenges where wired temperature sensing becomes cost prohibitive.
Understanding equipment health status of multiple control systems requires an effective and comprehensive integrated central monitoring solution. Chromalox’s C2i™ supervisory control technology is just that. It efficiently provides remote monitoring and value management of each parameter on every heater circuit across all control systems.
However, monitoring a large volume of circuits can be difficult to manage. Such complexity can lead to missed alarm events as well as an overwhelming amount of nuisance alarm notifications. The Chromalox proprietary engineered software technology continuously provides instant alarm event visibility from five different resolution levels as well as selective alarm announcement control. As a result, this well-organized C2i™ supervisory control technology lowers operating costs and improves system reliability by efficiently providing total system health awareness and eliminating missed alarm events.Whether you are interested in carpet, laminate, vinyl, tile, LVT/LVP… We have it all!

It's still in draft, but I managed to sneak a few tidbits out for you.
Several studies reported that potatoes generally have medium to high GI, which has often adversely affected their consumption, but have overlooked the many nutritional and health benefits of potatoes.
Post moved to!
Love this post and very timely with what I have been doing lately. I read somewhere a while back that a group of German soldiers at the end of WWII found themselves in a situation where they had nothing but raw potatoes to eat for several weeks. It seems they were cured or greatly improved of several physical issues including digestive disorders. I also recall reading one of Norman Walkers juicing books wherein raw potato juice was proclaimed particularly healing in nature. Fast forward to a few days ago when I am catching up on your posts and those over at FTA and I decided to try something. I cut up a raw potato (red for now)put it in my Vitamix, add about 4oz water and voila instant potato smoothie. I don't find the taste objectionable and I do find it is particularly satisfying; it "feels" good though I know that is very subjective. I get the value of the raw potato juice, the RS and the fiber all in less than 2 minutes prep time. I wonder if anyone else has done this?
Raw potatoes and potato juice are superfoods, but more have the reputation of being poisonous. If there is any green, don't eat it, but otherwise they are fine. Perfect for supplemental fiber, but they would make a pretty unpopular dinner item, lol
Raw potato in a smoothie is a perfect idea, I've heard lots of people say they do it, and also raw potato starch. Just look at the charts! 100g of potato, a pretty small potato, has 50 grams of RS. When cooked/cooled, only 2-3%. This was the biggest problem I saw 5 years ago when I was looking at RS. The studies used RPS, the newspaper articles talked about potato salad. Big difference!
I have been promoting Raw Potato in Juice form for years! (since 2010). From my website:
The need for foods high in Fibre.
Thanks Ashwin! Sorry you had to write that out twice, it went into the spam folder. This is the kind of spam I like, though.
This is great stuff!
Tim
Ashwin, I bought a Squatty Potty several years ago. Thereare periods that I use it regularly and others I don't. I should make a more concerted effort, because I do notice that it helps. Sometimes I don't get the opportunity to use it as the stool comes out too fast.
I will try your potato juice and see if it helps, as my stool consistency differs greatly from loose to very hard.
Jo tB
I tried one this afternoon. I think I put in too much fresh ginger as it was VERY overpowering 2,5 cm). I think I need to halve the quantities as I had far too much juice.
But I couldn't taste the raw potato at all. So very nice. And I forgot the beetroot. It still tasted quite nice due to the carot and apple.
Jo tB
Tim,
Is there a difference between the RS in raw potatoes vs. cooked/cooled potatoes? I remember raw is rs2 and cooked/cooled is rs3, right? Is there any benefit of one over the other?
Sorry, obviously in need of a refresher, but the RPS (powder), that's rs2, correct? So is there benefit of the rs2 in the raw potato vs. taking the powder (w/ or w/o fibrous foods)?
It makes little difference to the bacteria in your gut, but they want/need lots of fiber. It's hard to get much (ie. 10 grams) in a day of eating cooked and cooled potatoes, unless you are eating JUST potatoes as in the potato hack. You can get 10grams from just a few bites of raw potato or a spoonful of potato starch.
But as others said, you can't really eat raw potatoes day in and day out. So, to play the system, cook and cool most of the potatoes you eat and have a slice or two of raw potato when you cook. Or, just have a couple spoonfuls of potato starch on the days when you really don't eat much fiber.
Tim,
it seems that the 50% ratio of RS in uncooked potatoes is based on dry matter. For a 100g potato, dry matter is only about 20%, that is 20g, and the rest is water. That would mean that such a potato only contains 10g of RS, not 50g. That's quite a difference. Am I mistaken here?
It would not be the first time I've gotten the math wrong! Let's see. I'm not sure what I said, but yes, you are correct. These graphs are based on DM. A 100g potato would have 20g DM (dry matter). The DM composed of ~70% RS2, or 14g per 100g potato. Does that look right?
I think in the book, I used a "1 pound" potato to come up with what I used there. A one-pounder having approx 60-70g of RS2.
And to show that 60-70g per pound is accurate, I have made potato starch in my Jack LaLanne juicer, and can easily get 50g out of a pound of potatoes.
So, now I have to search this blog for what I said and make corrections.
Thanks!
So, looking through the book...I see in the potato starch chapter, I said: "A raw potato is about 20% starch by weight. A regular-sized potato (~1/2 pound) will yield about 40 grams of potato starch."
I remember now this 20% starch per raw (wet) potato. If you look at websites and papers on potato starch manufacturing, you will find that potatoes straight from the field, have about 15-24% extractable starch. So, I always tried to use 20% of a raw potato being RS2.
Tim,
since the above study states that only 50% of starch is RS2 and starch amounts to 20% of a raw wet potato, then the correct number to use to estimate the amount of RS2 is 10% of a raw wet potato, only half the percentage you previously estimated. Unless, of course, the methodology used in the study is flawed and grossly understimates the amount of RS. What is your take on this? I am confused!
Your comments go straight to my spam folder. I assure you that is not intentional! If I had a macro that could spam any questions about my math, I already would have one!
I'm seeing some problems, I'll try to explain.
A raw fresh potato has 20% TS (total starch)
Potato starch is usually said to be 75% by weight of TS. But 50-80% is the normal range you see in papers.
So where does that put us?
50% of 20g would be 10g
75% of 20g would be 15g
So, 10-15g per 100g potato or 45-65g per pound (454g)
And notice, in the book passage I quoted above, I said, "A regular-sized potato (~1/2 pound) will yield about 40 grams of potato starch."
That was talking about the TS not the RS.
Great observations! I need to be able to explain this stuff, or make corrections.
If you get the book, you'll see a whole big section talking about how difficult it is to measure RS in foods!
And that proves what you are saying, an easy way to remember is 10% of the weight of a raw potato will be it's (lower end) RS2 weight.
Potatoes = sugar. See you in the morgue!
:)
hahahaha
Tim, I've been following you and Richard, on and off, for a couple of years. I have to say when Richard stopped posting interesting n=1 experiments, with the huge number of comments, I sort of lost interest. I'm glad you have taken up the baton, as it were, in your own blog. This article is very interesting. The one you posted previously summarizing the research on different potatoes was really interesting, too. Unfortunately, I don't see the specific varieties I buy listed. And, in fact, the bags of potatoes don't always say, either. My favorite for at least the last 5 years has been Yukon Golds or any other variety of yellow potato. The last article you posted, when I went to read some of your linked info, implied that people roast mainly russets. Ugh! I LOVE baked Golds! It's precisely because they are moister and not mealy, that I like them so much! I don't have to slather them in butter just to get them down. In fact, I can eat them just plain. I'm glad to see that the yellow potatoes compare favorably with other potatoes for resistant starch and total starch. I grew up eating mainly red potatoes. They were good, but not as good tasting to me as yellow potatoes. We also make our mashed potatoes out of yellow potatoes. They whip up nicely, IMHO. My sons make homemade baked without oil fries out of russets, but yellow potatoes work just as well. I know people will have their own preferences, and I respect that. But give me a bag of gold potatoes any day! I'm planning to do a few days of hacking next week. I love being able to get affordable organic potatoes at Trader Joe's, in yellow or russets.
Sally
I know what you mean. Only a few of these varieties are even in my seed catalog. I usually plant Yukon golds and Norland reds. Looking at these charts, Norland is a great performer in the RS category, so that made me feel good, lol.
I'd love to see where Yukon Golds stand. But you are on the right track. Make potatoes a solid part of your eating, stay away from French fries and chips. Eat a slice raw to make up for any small differences in fiber or RS.
Ditto. Around here there's bags of Yukon Gold, Russet, White potatoes, Red potatoes... then there's purple potatoes and 'organic' whatnot potatoes. But there's no 'names' to tell what'variety' they are. Basically, we have 'no name' potatoes. :(
The bags have origin, as in Prince Edward Island, Ontario, USA potatoes are mostly the loose ones, and the other day I bought a bag of 'Atlantic region Russets'... prolly New Brunswick and these ARE good!
Great stuff, thanks Tim. So, roughly 20 times the resistant starch and 10 times the fiber in raw vs. cooked. Any idea as to the how the GI compares in raw vs. cooked? Are there other known drawbacks or advantages to eating potatoes raw?
Thanks, Jeff. Is this the "Jeff" that sent me the paper? I'll put those charts in the main post now.
I have not seen any drawbacks except the chance of getting poisoned from a green potato. But even then, I've heard you'd have to eat like 2 full pounds of fully green potatoes before you were sick enough to require a trip to the hospital. Advantages are many: fiber, RS, and whatever else is lost through cooking i.e. vitamins and minerals. But, let's be honest, no one is going to eat a lot of raw potatoes.
Thanks again, Tim, I'm not the Jeff that sent the paper. Long time follower of your blog but first time posting, keep up the great work it is very appreciated.
No problem! The charts are in now. A slight drop when cooled. And a HUGE jump from raw to cooked/cooled.
You COULD eat a large amount of raw potatoes by liquefying them in a blender first...
Tim,
Raw Potato Juice is always an option,especially if other Raw vegetables are added as in my recipe.
Another option is to ask your Doc for ACARBOSE. Resistant Starch content of cooked potatoes is not important if you take ACARBOSE ! Lods of RS3 for your friendly Gut bugs!
Thanks for the great advice, as always. Is Acarbose by Rx only? Not a great deal written about it. I have not looked carefully into acarbose, but if you are a fan, maybe I should.
It doesn't hardly seem worth cooling the potatoes, does it?
I was thinking the same thing...then it dawned on me. There's a big problem with RS testing! A giant bag of Elodea to the first reader to identify the problem:
"One hundred grams of each of uncooked, cooked, and retrograded samples were freeze dried. The freeze dried samples were ground using a coffee grinder, passed through a 250μm sieve, and kept in air-tight plastic bags at room temperature until use for various analyses. These samples were then used for all analyses."
This comment has been removed by the author.
The cooked potatoes had a chance to retrograde during the testing?
ding, ding, ding!
Look back at the charts, the "cooked" potatoes are actually cooked and cooled, the "cooled" potatoes are actually cooked, cooled, re-cooled.
I think in actuality, the cooked potatoes would have an RS content of less than 1% across the board. Every cycle of cooling causes more retrogradation and more RS3 to form.
Using standard testing that involves freeze-drying the sample will never tell you how much RS is in a hot sample, freshly cooked.
ACARBOSE is Rx only. Need to be under Doctors supervision. I have been "experimenting" for the last 3 years. It's worh a study! I have my British Gut (American Gut) results. I'll send you the details for your view on them.
I'd love to see them! We can stick the raw data in MG-Rast if you like to get a really good look. akman2014 @ live.com
For newcomers there is a discussion on ACARBOSE here:
Curious as you say you have been experimenting for 3 years. Do you mean doing the potato hack alongside with acarbose? Did taking it lessen the effects of the hack? I take Metformin and I'm not sure if that will have impact on effectiveness of the hack. I wouldn't have a problem getting an rx for acarbose but as a LCer I've never had a need to. So much to ponder on....
ACARBOSE blocks the action of Enzymes responsible for digestion of Starch in the small intestine. Cooked potatoes contain Digestible Starch and RS3. If you prevent the digestion of Starch, more of it arrives in the large intestine where it is Fermented into Short Chain Fatty acids. This is what the potato hack is all about. ACARBOSE enhances the Potato Hack.
Thanks Ashwin, I will see Dr and discuss. I was a fat pre-diab with MetSyn and strong family history; watched my mum decline for many years; horrible. I lost a shedload of weight and went LC but am finding my BS wonky and a slight rise in my A1c; normal but at the upper end (physiological IR?). I battle with hunger and constant weight regain and I am hoping the potatoes can help with this. I don’t really need Metformin and probably don’t take enough of it for any therapeutic value; I just like the robust studies behind the anti-cancer effects but I will replace the Met with Acarb for the purpose of the hack maybe, if Dr is ok, although heck he’s not much help at all.
Tim, I will get your book for sure..it’s on my list along with Stephan and Lyle’s upcoming books, but I’m too impatient to wait for book to start the PH. I’m psyched up for and will start next week. I went to the farmers market today and got some nice fresh red royals, Nicolas and dutch creams; I didn’t get many and heck it was $20; I thought taters were cheap, it will be the supermarket ones from now on. I don’t plan on eating the skins anyway. I plan on going for a week but may throw some meat in on the last weekend for lunch; keeping a good few hours between the taters and meat. Will report back next week. Thank you Tim. I grew up on potatoes; haven’t had them in years. My favourite meal would be hot fried double chips English style with crispy potato cakes if I could eat anything.
Rose
"I grew up on potatoes; haven’t had them in years."
I fell into the same trap. A big problem is that the potato is an easily identified "carb." Potatoes are good food, and need not be avoided, except for French Fries and potato chips. But even these can be prepared in a way to make them healthier than what you get from McDonald's or Lay's.
Ashwin and Tim, I wrote the original reply about raw potato smoothies above (and this is my only other comment. I know there are several Anonymous here). If I am reading this converation correctly, the purpose of Acarbose is necessitated only by the digestible starch found in cooked potatoes. If one eats raw potatoes instead of cooked, is Acarbose of any other use? Or am I missing something?
Charles
Charles - You are mostly correct in your assumptions. Acarbose blocks a starch digesting enzyme in humans. This same "carb blocker" is found in white beans and some other plants.
If you have issues with blood sugar stability, acarbose works by turning your diet into one of high "net" fiber, lowering the glycemic impact of meals. It would essentially be the same as eating all your starches as raw potatoes.
There are probably some drawbacks to eating nothing but raw potatoes, and some advantages to taking a starch blocker such as acarbose. The biggest advantage is that you will get more nutrition from a cooked potato. You'd probably starve to death if all you ate was raw potatoes.
Acarbose is more similar to eating nothing but cooked and cooled potatoes with a slice or two raw, just as I have been advocating for years now. Or eating overall less starchy food and taking a couple spoonfuls of raw potato starch.
I think that the starch blockers have a negative impact if they make people eat more starchy junk food like potato chips and white bread than they normally would.
Won't it be nice when there are abundant tables put together for RS in foods? You'll look at all the old tables you pieced together from dozens of sources, and just shake your head, remembering all the tedious work you did on those!
Yes it will! There is a big problem though. The test method for testing RS in cooked foods involves freeze-drying a sample. This retrogrades the sample. Testing RS in freshly cooked foods is only possible through ileostomy studies.
That is a problem. I think you pointed that out above but I was speed-reading. Well, maybe they'll find a different way some day.
Thought you might like to read this report!! It extols the benefits of our spud...
Jo tB
Yep! Starches are credited with making us big-brained critters. Tiger Nuts and Yams, particularly. Did the authors of this not realize that potatoes have only been part of the human diet for approx 8000 years?
"The human brain is unique - no other animal possesses such a large brain relative to the size of its body.
It has been argued that an increase in meat consumption could have triggered the increase in size, but now scientists believe that we may have another food to thank: the humble potato.
Researchers suggest carbohydrate consumption, particularly in the form of starch, was critical for the extraordinary development of the brain over the past million years."
It's a mystery because chimps that eat mostly plant based diet with the odd monkey thrown in for variety, have large canines. Large canines direct the movement of the mandible to a chopping motion as opposed to a grinding motion (as evidenced in cows, sheep, etc.) Humans and their alleged ancestors lost their large canines rather early in evolution. Chimps therefore are not dentally adapted to eating vegetation since they are not grinding. They are chopping. Maybe that's why they spend hours and hours every day chewing. Chopping movements on vegetation is not terribly efficient.
Chopping or cutting up food is prevalent in carnivores. Dogs are omnivores and retain their 'canine guidance'... Their molars (as in cats) intercuspate in such a way that they can tear up meat.
Tim, the humble potato was only available in South America. Other root tubers were available in Africa. Root tubers in the form of Sagittaria were available to riparious populations. Lotus root etc. was available in Asia. But by the time these people got there, there was already a change. I.e. Homo as opposed to other options.
Probably it's both starch and meat that helped to eventually select for individuals with larger brains, smaller jaws, and etc.
What makes me wonder about genetics and dentition is both my parents had 4 wisdom teeth. My brother had 4. I have zero. The father of my children had all 4. One of my kids had zero and one had one. Somehow there's a genetically dominant trait to 'lose' teeth. So as jaw size decreased with evolution, even though it may seem 'how the heck did the ones with smaller jaws survive'? Possibly it is a genetically dominant situation.
Michael Pollan says cooking is what turned us into humans. His series "Cooked" is on Netflix, it's pretty interesting.
Interesting timing. I've recently starting treating my spuds like a vegetable... minimally stir frying in butter or lard, so they are only slightly cooked and mostly raw and still pretty crunchy. I use a slicer to cut them in thin strips. I like the texture and chewy-ness and feel good that undercooking also preserves more of the nutrients like Vitamin-C which is heat sensitive.
Btw, I think this works well for people who opt to eating low carb while not starving gut bugs of prebiotics.
I agree. My next blog post will be about the Acarbose that Ashwin was talking about. In a paper he shared, they discuss simply eating undercooked starches to mimic the effect of a drug.
I made some hash browns the other day, shredded a potato, cooked one side pretty hot until it started to brown, flipped and just cooked the other side a minute or two. When I ate them, the inside of the pile was still raw, it was actually a better texture than my normal method of letting them cook until soft and gummy all the way through.
Tim, We ran into Dale at Krogers yesterday. This is the guy who grew up eating potatoes fried in bacon grease. He is looking healthy these days...probably a result of all those potatoes!
Are you including anything about potato starch in your book?
And one more question Have you heard of Ezekiel 4.9 bread? It's available here now in the frozen healthfood case at Krogers. Tried the 7 Sprouted Grain loaf. No flour in it. Not sure about it--- maybe it's an acquired taste!
Chilly and rainy in Ohio today.
Me thinks someone should be calling their mum more often! Shame on you, Tim. Shame.
Hi, Mum!
A whole chapter on potato starch. I've tried the Ezekial Bread and really like it. We also get Dave's Killer Bread sometimes.
But I have been making my own bread lately from a sourdough starter I keep in the fridge. I use Whole Grain Spelt Flour, it turns out really nice. Even makes good sandwiches and awesome pizza dough.
I think Ezekiel Bread is an acquired taste. I wanted to like it, but I never got beyond that first piece. Irish soda bread disappears quickly.
I do NOT miss the weather in Ohio.
Barney
haha, I moved to frikkin' Alaska to get away from those brutal Ohio winters! Of course when I grew up, they kept the house about 40 degrees and never gave us blankets.
Bet you had to walk to school in bare feet, too - up hill both ways!
with baked potatoes in his pockets to keep his hands warm. And then he'd eat them for breakfast once he got to school.
I got hooked on raw potatoes after my second or third, now I look forward to the next one! One small with lunch, one with dinner. Almond potatoes are the best imho.
sparris, what on earth are 'almond potatoes'?
Gabriella-sorry, I just translated 'mandelpotatis' straight from Swedish. They're a type of fingerling from what I can gather, mostly grown in the northern parts of the country and considered a delicacy.
I come from an Eastern European background. The elders ate potatoes, potatoes and potatoes as main dish with fresh veggies, beans and meat on the side. Lots of lard and bacon (schmaltz). I barely remember a healthy one, all were overweight, some had early heart disease ie literally dropped dead, fatty livers etc, but not much cancer. They also drank and smoked heavily, so who knows. Anyway I guess that's why I have spent many years fearing the humble old tater. Rose
Fear the booze, not the spuds.
Tim,
I found a fantastic way to add raw potatoes in is to cube them up and throw them in a mason jar with apple cider vinegar. (The second time I added salt and garlic.)
Not sure if it affects starches or fibers but it sure ends up tasty! You get a nice crunch and a salty tanginess that is nice when you're in the mood for a salty snack.
Sure! Why not? Sounds great. I've never heard of raw potato pickles, but I see no reason they would not be very popular. There are dozens of dill pickle flavored potato chips. These look like pickles made of raw potatoes, but simply soaking in vinegar is a great way to make small batches of pickles. Good idea! I will try.
Here ya go: Almost exactly what you describe -
Yep, that's exactly it! I need to put in another batch of these and maybe play with some different spices.
Tim, I hope that I'm the first to alert you to this. This is funny -" the stupidest idea ever" - Potato Parcel.
I just came across a video with German sub titels, so I looked up the original on You Tube. There are 2.
He ate 20 potatoes a day for 60 days !! Our favourite food in the title role.
Jo tB
Sure! Chris Voigt was one of the initial reasons for me trying the potato diet.
The irony is Voigt was not eating 20 potatoes a day. He was eating Russets which are about 250 grams each, give or take 50 grams. Which means he was eating about 5 per day at the beginning (1600 kcal) and losing weight too fast. Then he forced himself to eat more (2200 kcal) and was still losing but slower. So he lost 21 pounds in 60 days. Potato is 1 kcal per gram. Add on the approx. 100 kcal of oil/butter he used.
Of course with cooked and cooled and retrograded starch, there's a percentage of resistant starch and bacteria digest that but we benefit through absorption of fatty acids. But I think it makes sense to just ignore whatever number of kcal the bacteria use up in metabolism/reproduction and assume that a 300 gram potato = 300 kcal.
He was eating about 4 pounds +/- 0.5 pound per day after he started to force himself to eat past fullness.
Oh yes, potatos cause extreme tiredness for me. That's why I really avoid eating them!
Going to IKEA gives me extreme tiredness. Potatoes are fine. ;)
Most people never really eat potatoes, they eat butter, sour cream and bacon on a bed of potato. Try eating a big, plain potato.
Does this make some people sick?
Resistant starch? "Sick" can be objective. If by "sick" you mean really awesome and cool, like my sick new tennis shoes, then yes...it makes people sick.
OK, bad joke.
Resistant Starch can lead to flatulence and bloating, but that's a reaction of gut bacteria and is easily managed by starting slow. I have never heard of anyone getting sick from RS.
LOL... By sick I mean a dry mouth and funny taste. Also, absolutely no appetite. This happened after consuming cooked and cooled five pounds of mashed potatoes over a three day period. I had the same reaction to potatoe starch last year.
I just saw your response over at FTA. Any suggestions for how to manage this? The somewhat chemical taste is really strong. I don't remember these reactions from LC ketosis 20 years ago. Guess I should grab some keto stix.
5 pounds over 3 days, is that correct? Like less than 1.5 pounds per day? That's not much to eat! But if you can do it, why not? People fast for longer with nothing to eat.
What was the end result of 5 pounds over 3 days? I think sometimes these shorter, more hardcore hacks are better than long, drawn out affairs where you try to eat just potatoes for weeks on end and see diminishing returns as you start to cheat a bit.
If you have trouble maintaining your weight, or are trying to lose 10 pounds or so, a 3 day hack at the start of every month usually aids tremendously. Look at it as a "reset" for the month.
The first day and a half I was very hungry but then it was almost like it began to work too well. I was even eating a tablespoon of grass-fed butter in each bowl of potatoes. Nothing has eliminated hunger to this extent. I just wanted to make sure that what I experienced was not related to bad bacteria die-off or something.
I've heard so many times, "For the first time in my life, I was not hungry..."
I think there are a huge number of people who start each day with good intentions to eat only whole, real foods and in limited quantities. This effort stops as soon as they eat their first bite of food. Brain waves take over and you are led down a path of seeking food and failing to be full all day long. Around noon, they say, "Screw it, I'll do better tomorrow," but never do.
With the potato hack, there is no give and take. You eat potatoes. Full stop. Period.
Well, some people add a 'spoonful of butter.' What's that all about? That was your inner demon trying to sabotage the plan, lol.
The first rule of Potato Hack Club: If you put something in your mouth that's not a potato, you are doing it wrong!
Tim, what are your thoughts on these new low carb low GI potatoes that are appearing in stores? Would they work or is the HC High GI part of the effectiveness of the PH?
Rose
Low carb potatoes? What a world...
Gemma, Whole Foods (aka whole paycheque) is selling pre-peeled oranges and peeled avocados. Among other things. So low carb potatoes don't surprise me. What's the point eh?
Rose, what a great question! I have not looked into low carb potatoes at all, I assumed they were a GMO breed designed to have more of a certain starch or something, but it turns out they are just a product of breeding.
I added two new charts to the blog post above (last 2 charts) "Available Carbs in Potato" You'll notice that the range in the first chart goes from 68% to 82%. These "low carb" potatoes you have been seeing are just potatoes that have lower natural carb content.
But also notice the second chart. Cooling your potatoes overnight before eating them (reheating is OK), will reduce the carb content even more. The range is now 55-82%.
I suspect that simply by pre-cooking most of the potatoes you eat, you will be getting less carbs than what "low carb" potatoes provide. The added bonus is more resistant starch.
One thing that perplexes me, a couple of the potato breeds shown in the chart actually increased carb content by cooling. The very first one, "Adora," for instance.
This tells me that it will be very hard to know exactly what you are getting at the supermarket when you buy potatoes. That said, all potatoes supply a good dose of fiber and RS, so there really are no "bad" choices.
As to "low carb" potatoes, they are undoubtedly not worth the extra money they cost, but if they are the same price, I'd buy them if you like the way they taste.
You can make just about any potato "low carb" by cooling it overnight. And you definitely can make any potato Very Low Carb if you only cook it partially, leaving the center still raw.
This way of cooking is described as "with a stone in the middle" and was preferred in Europe in the 1600s.
Gabriella
I was a produce department manager some 30 years ago. Things like pre peeled oranges or peeled avocados are fruits gone bad. Half an orange is moldy? Half an avocado got squished in the box? Sell the other half AT A PREMIUM as convenience food.
Not a real issue I guess, but realize it's probably not washed. And it is usually sold at a premium.
Here's a Low Carb Potato called Carisma from Australia.
How do they recommend you cook it?
- Wash potatoes. Do not remove skins.
- Chop potatoes into 1 cm thick slices.
- Place sliced potatoes into hot (not boiling) water. Then bring water to the boil.
- Cook potatoes until 'al dente'.
- Potatoes should be firm but cooked through.
Sound familiar?
Sure does - I wonder if there is a small footnote saying "best suited for cooled potato salads to get full benefit of the lower carbs"
Rose
Wilbur, thanks. I don't shop at Whole Foods. Just heard about this on the radio. I guess they are 'smart'. Customers are foolish and lazy.
Gabriella - It is also sad that people will not buy produce with blemishes, whether superficial or not. It's crazy. So deviations from perfect - the slightly odd bend of a carrot - will rot on the shelf. Even knowing this, I tend to look for the perfect produce - I feel ripped off if I don't get perfection, even if it doesn't matter. That's where all those beautiful party trays of veggies or prepared raw vegetables come from. The ugly parts get cut out. They are always more expensive than if you made them yourself. But it's win-win - convenience and margin protection.
Oh, and anything packaged by the produce department, like okra in shrink-wrap, will have the blemishes strategically hidden.
Wilbur - those perfectly straight organic carrots we get in the major stores scare the hell out of me. 30 years ago (when organic produce was something you only found at Saturday food co-ops in the parking lot of the Waldorf school) all carrots were crooked, all cabbages had holes, the beans were all different sizes. Ah, the good old days!
Oh my goodness, just tried some Midnight something potatoes, small with purple skins and deep purple flesh..so delicious and the texture is floury. I only bought a few to try so I rang the organic store that I bought them from and to save me a whole pile for pick-up tomorrow and I will be extending my hack.
Rose
Remember "weeding, seeding, feeding?" Just wondering how important all three steps are.
Weeding - Tim, did you do any intentional weeding? Or, in retrospect, can you pinpoint any foods, herbs, etc. that you were incorporating in your diet that would have accomplished this function even if unintentional at the time? (Thinking Wilbur and his garlic, Ashwin and his comments about neem, amla, turmeric, etc.)
Seeding - Still think this plays a necessary role for most people?
Feeding - Is it possible to just start very slowly adding resistant starch/fiber and push through any uncomfortable issues? Is it possible that the good microbes could begin to increase in number and overwhelm the bad over time? Or is it still the best idea to incorporate some kind of foods/herbs that are antimicrobial on a regular basis? Just wondering your thoughts after the last few years of you looking into all of this. Insights would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Fay
Fay, I'm jumping in here, sorry. Last time I took an antibiotic was 2010 (whooping cough, very persistent). Whatever is in the gut now is in the gut. No problemo with spuds.
What made me fart the light fantastic recently was some weird Polish sauerkraut mixture that contained carrot, onion, black pepper, SUGAR (disgusting), and sunflower oil. It's some combo thing the make so it's directly applied to some sort of stew. YUK! It was the damn sugar. I can eat sauerkraut stew (with pork) or soup or whatever, but it was the damn sugar that made it dirigible time. That was lunch. For supper I had a pork and kimchi stew with potato: no gas.
Came home from work now. Cooked and cooled spuds in the fridge. Am 'roasting' wedges in minimal oil. I thought, I must really be nuts. Historically, I don't even like potatoes all that much but hey, it's easy. Had breakfast at 6:30 a.m. and now it's after 5 p.m. Go figure. Spuds for breakfast (with a few other unmentionables) after 15 hours since last meal and now more damn spuds.
Fay, me too, jumping in when you asked Tim, sorry. I'm curious, what do you believe needs to be weeded out?
I used to read that site (which shall not be named) that promoted weeding, seeding and feeding and as an herbalist I was horrified - not too strong a word, I really was - by the so called 'botanicals' that woman was suggesting for 'weeding'. I shall say no more lest I begin to rant ..
If you eat onions and garlic and some spices every day there's probably little need to worry about nasties in your gut. If you do feel you have reason to be worried, you'd actually be safer discussing this with a doc than messing about with any of the 'antimicrobial' herbal concoctions that are currently out there.
Thanks for the feedback. Not trying to bring up bad blood, just using the wording as a quick way to get across what I was asking. My history includes extensive antibiotic use throughout my lifetime, and now health issues are appearing. Know better now than to go to a doctor and get yet more prescriptions for these new issues. Trying to read and study and figure a better way. I know my gut health needs to be addressed, and just wanting opinions on if a short course of antimicrobials would be helpful. Or if probiotics are necessary. Or if starting with fibers would be enough.
Fay
Actually what I have learned mostly over the last couple years is that everybody is different and there are no one-size-fits-all fixes.
Weeding. Real food, including those that are known to be antimicrobial should be a daily part of everyone's diet. But not everyone can eat garlic, onions, and some of the other more powerful plants. There's all kinds of herbal teas as well that are known to displace pathogens. I'd rather see people learn to incorporate this type of food rather than mega-dosing some type of powerful medicinal plant. Dark chocolate, blueberries, honey...all good "weeders."
Seeding, I feel is unnecessary for the most part. I am convinced that most people can grow their own set of gut bugs by eating a real food diet with plenty of fiber. Maybe when starting the journey, it's wise to use some probiotic supplements, but the idea is not that these new species will become your new gut flora, but more that they will help set up a chain reaction involving your immune system and the bacteria present in and around you. Ph is super important for gut health, the gut microbes (yeast and bacteria) will create an environment that is most suitable to the most populous species, even building impenetrable biofilms. These are the really poor guts and they are hard to change over to a more friendly type. I think even that too much weeding just drives them deeper into the biofilms and gives them more resolve to cling on.
Same thing with fermented foods. They are great and should be a part of your life, but only for their health benefits, not that they will contribute much to your gut flora in way of new species.
Feeding...I'm all about that! I think people need to eat lots more fiber than they are comfortable with. 50-100g/day. Most people who think they are eating lots of fiber are only eating 20-30g per day. It's almost impossible to get enough fiber without supplementing, but it can be done if you really load up on the plants, again, eating way more than most people are comfortable with. Green bananas, raw potatoes, whole garlic cloves, bowls of beans, will help get you to a meaningful limit. A leafy salad and a piece of fruit will not.
So, what to do about the people who can't tolerate most foods, get hooked on PPIs, and have generally poor digestion? I do not know. My main goal is prevention of this, not a cure. I feel bad for those that can't tolerate the very things that will help them most. Some people have valid medical conditions that prevent them from every being "normal." Some people will always need purple pills. But some people just need to ditch the junk food and start eating real food.
Thanks for the great question!
Tim, you know this PPI business? And now that fatty pancreas business? Fatty liver business. Right now pancreatitis cat is getting a drug cocktail so she'll eat. I give her PPI among other things. Makes me wonder if some people have a low grade pancreas unhappiness and that's why they need the PPIs. Lose the pancreas fat and reassess.
But I totally disagree about the amount of fibre a person needs to eat. I get probably someplace between 20 and 30 grams a day and guts function just fine. Plus I'm not a fermented food a holic either. Unless sour cream counts.
Is it really necessary to produce nice Bristols every day? Oftentimes, especially now with the potato business, I go two days of 'token offerings' and then clearout. I'm just not making that much end stage product on the potato diet. If I make a meal with lots of green stuff and other veg along with the spuds, then of course there's lots of ahem, tmi stuff. Otherwise not. No problemo as far as I'm concerned.
"Hi. My name is Rudy and I'm a fermented food a colic."
Today I fermented five quarts of what I hope will be a lacto fermented relish made from minced cauliflower, broccoli, carrots, cabbage, garlic, onion, and parsley. I did use a packet of Caldwell's starter.
Today, I also transferred six quarts of my favorite ferment, plain red cabbage kraut, to the refrigerator after three weeks at room temperature.
Next time I can get to the store I will get a few pounds of jalapeño peppers. My wife's favorite. I usually use peppers from our garden but it will be summer before I can harvest those.
This year I planted extra shallots and leeks to start the gardening season. Yep. Some will end up in a ferment.
Last year I planted a couple of rows of potatoes. They were fine but also easily purchased so this year leeks and shallots. I elect to not ferment potatoes.
I will use the space in the garden taken up by potatoes last year to plant more cushaws. I'm looking to corner the local cushaw market in 2016. A few cushaw culls will be fermented... :)
Wild cucumber,
Appreciate your comments. Was thinking about a short course of neem, then using garlic, turmeric, ginger, amla -things that are food. Does neem fall under the category of dangerous botanical? Would love to know what you, as an herbalist, consider safe.
Tim,
Thanks for the detailed response. Without going into too much detail, I do feel that my gut ph is off, because of some recurring fungal issues. I am afraid I may have one of those difficult guts that is hard to change over. So, I assumed that a difficult gut would need stronger antimicrobials. Big guns. Maybe a gentler approach is what I need. I hope it will be enough. Can't hurt to try. Really appreciate your thoughtful reply.

Fay - don't do neem. IF you had neem in your own garden and could gather and dry your own leaves, thus ensuring safe, clean product, maybe a weak tea. But commercial sources of most herbs in capsules are iffy so I never recommend them, and the oil and tincture of neem are flat out dangerous. Also avoid any of the berberines, they're very hard on the gut lining.
If your issue is fungal, try calendula(marigold) tea, not just a short course, but consistently. Or a tincture of that is safe, too. Eat plain live cultured yoghurt. Drink a little wine and eat funky cheeses and lots of mushrooms. All these things help balance out the one 'fungal issue' that has had a chance to take hold. Take a little apple cider vinegar in water before meals and bathe in it, too.
A "short course" of anything is more likely to do as Tim says, drive the baddies into hiding and they'll just come back. It's a matter of good diet, learning not to stress about it (hard sometimes) and consistency.
You can do this!
Fay - I wish I had better advice. Even doctors don't know what to do with people like you. They have an arsenal of drugs, but rarely do they work. There is no end of internet guru with a protocol "guaranteed" to work. I see people jumping from plan to plan and never getting better.
The couple of people who seem to really have fixed a bad gut did so by eating lots and lots of high fiber foods, including onions and garlic.
Wild cucumber,
Never thought about a short course making things worse. Assumed it would be the better way. Consistently using safer things sounds like a great plan! Thanks.
Fay
About 11 months ago, my doctor recommended a low carb diet to treat insulin resistance. She suggested that I read The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Living and I used that as my guide to adopt a low carb lifestyle. I have faithfully stayed on track and rarely “cheat” except on a glass of wine or other adult beverage here and there. I really enjoy eating LC and find that it’s not hard at all for me to avoid grains and sugars.
When I went in for my 6 month check, I was wasn’t too upset that my cholesterol went from 192 to 241 as the authors of the aforementioned book reported this as a possibility. That combined with the fact that my triglycerides dropped by 20 points and my HDL increased by 20 led me to believe this was just an indication that my body was adjusting. I was disturbed though to see that my insulin went from 5mL to 12mL. However, I was determined to stay the course as I had seen a stabilization of weight (I am not overweight but constantly have to stay diligent to keep from gaining) and a reduction in body fat.
Now, within the last 6 weeks, I developed acid reflux. I was pretty sure that it was caused from a disruption of my gut bacteria due to an over-consumption of Splenda but was also open to the idea that my low carb diet was a contributing factor. When I first went low carb, I had read about resistant starches but like a lot in the LC community, I immediately got scared off by the dreaded “s” word and dismissed it immediately. This time around, I did more research and was definitely intrigued by potato starch as a way to feed the gut bacteria. The Free the Animal site was a huge fountain of information that I have been reading through slowly and I am so grateful to you and Richard!
So I am about week 5 into supplementing about 4 TBS a day of PS. I have mostly noticed improved regularity but I also seem to be able to process alcohol better (anything over 3 beverages in 12 hours use to leave me feeling weak and shaky with a terrible stomach for at least a day afterwards but the last time I drank more than that, I hardly had any symptoms) and, something I don’t think I’ve seen mentioned, clearer skin.
I am just starting to experiment with increasing probiotics in the form of kombucha, kefir, sauerkraut, etc. and will also be buying a supplemental form that I can open and add to my daily PS drink. Now I would like to add in some potato and white rice but I am really having to fight my LC indoctrination! Your research and experimentation seem to suggest that doing so can help with physiological insulin resistance, which may explain my last blood work results. However, thinking about eating starches almost makes me break out in a cold sweat.
I did order a blood glucose meter (up to this point, I have not checked my BG levels) as I think I can relieve some of my anxiety by being able to monitor what these “safe starches” do to me personally.
Anyway, this is a long book just to ask your opinion about how to go from LC to more of a PHD type diet. From your experiments, it seems that a VLC/LC/Ketogenic eater is going to see less of a blunting affect from RS so adding potatoes and rice (even if they are cooked, cooled, reheated) could make me see a fairly big spike in BG. So is it best to slowly add in small amounts and work up or jump right in with a potato hack?
Thanks for all you have done and shared! I am popping over to Amazon to buy your book right now :)
Oops, see that your book isn't quite available yet, but I am on the list to be notified when it is!
You should upload this comment to Amazon and sell it yourself, lol.
No, this is a common question, and pretty much exactly how I evolved from SAD to LC to VLC to PHD to Potato Hack.
It's hard to give advice, but I'd recommend just adding a potato a day, and also adding beans and rice to your menus for the long haul. Try a day or two of the potato hack and track your blood sugar as you go along. You will undoubtedly see a hefty spike after the meal, but your long term A1C and fasting BG should start to normalize a few weeks after you start adding starches back in.
People that regularly track FBG find that it can drop 10-30 points while they are potato hacking. But the long-term eating plan is most important.
Splenda? Alcohol? tsk, tsk
Use Stevia and drink less.
The book won't be on Amazon until next week sometime, but at CreateSpace now, if you don't mind paying extra for shipping.
Thanks, Tim! Yes, I've completely switched to Stevia, monkfruit, and erythritol. As for the alcohol, I brew my own beer and wine and I've already given up the beer...can't bring myself to do so with wine yet! I usually limit myself to a glass or two during the week and then a couple other low carb choices on the weekend. I've always (semi) joked that I save my carb calories for a glass of wine...lol. I have noticed (I think other people have reported the same) that my desire for alcohol has gone down since starting the PS though.
As for the food recommendations, I appreciate your advice and it is in line with what I did for lunch...I stirred PS into some cold leftover mashed potatoes and topped it with homemade sauerkraut. Hopefully the additions will help mitigate a huge spike and by next week I will have the BG meter to get a better look at things.
Thanks again and best of luck with your book sales. I will definitely give a review on Amazon once it's available!
Sorry...one more thing! I noticed that in your shopping section, you have an air popcorn popper. Popcorn has been one of the few things I have missed going LC. Does it have any resistant starch? I would love to have an excuse to eat it again...lol.
Popcorn is good food! Enjoy.
As to my advice to stop drinking, well, homemade beer and wine is a different story, especially unfiltered as most home brews are. Keep on brewing and enjoying beer and wine. A couple glasses a week is definitely not the worst thing you could be having, and quite possibly has many health benefits due to the yeasts involved in fermentation.
Thanks for the link and the good news. Time to dig out the ol' air popper. I have always love melted coconut oil on popcorn so it looks like a win win!
If I actually enjoy raw potato (always have, but thought it was bad for you!), is there any reason why I shouldn't start adding them to my diet as a substitute for something else as snack etc? I assume starting small and building up is sensible. Thanks
There is nothing wrong with eating raw potatoes. I don't believe it would be wise to eat them as a large source of daily calories, as they are almost completely undigested. But a raw potato a day would make a good, healthy snack.
Dr. Davis, author of Wheat Belly quickly realized that by avoiding wheat and eating low carb, most people were very deficient in fiber. One of his workarounds? Raw potatoes!
"..."
Wow, that was quick - thanks :) Reading the book as we 'speak'.
Is it essential to drink a lot of water when supplementing with raw potato starch? I've read that it's important to stay extra hydrated when consuming more soluble fiber. I've been drinking a lot of water lately because the digestive tract has gotten a bit sluggish lately. I usually take in 2-4 tbsp of bob's rs2/day. Maybe the extra water makes it worse?
I think the warnings were issued in conjunction with fiber that gels and expands like guar gum, psyllium husk, etc. Potato starch just stays granulated in water, so no problem. It's technically an insoluble fiber because it does not dissolve in water.
Not sure where to ask this, but how come you dont have a link in your store to glass noodles as a source of RS? Would these work? Jan 2004

The drought, fires and fears of running out of water are pushing regional NSW close to breaking point, Deputy Premier John Barilaro said.
The Nationals leader, whose electorate of Monaro takes in Queanbeyan and Cooma, was speaking at a Regions Rising event organised by think tank Regional Institute Australia.
Mr Barilaro said the triple whammy of drought, fire and water supply was taking its toll on those in regional NSW.
"People talk about how regional people are resilient," he said.
"The truth is that resilience is running out. It is one of the toughest times in the regions."
He said, since the election, more than $200 million had been spent on water infrastructure.
"We're seeing something like 175 projects to ensure that regional communities do not run out of water," Mr Barilaro said.
However, he added that NSW shouldn't allow the drought to "talk ourselves out of market", stating there was still international demand for NSW agricultural produce.
"Yes, the drought is impacting but some of our farmers are smart farmers; they're innovative, they know how to deal with drought and they're still producing."
Also speaking at the conference was NSW Rural Doctors Network CEO Richard Colbran, on the issues around recruiting and retaining doctors and nurses in regional NSW.
Mr Colbran said the urban-centric component of health professionals' training - which drew them to Sydney, the Illawarra or Newcastle - worked against getting them into regional NSW.
They may have every intention of heading back there at the end of their training period, but life just got in the way.
"A lot of the training for health professionals must take place at some point in the city," Mr Colbran said.
"If you're in your 30s and you're setting up families, those two or three years [in the city] are critical. If you've put down your roots in the city during the training period, it's very unlikely you'll come back."
Mr Colbran said every day there were more than 300 practices outside Sydney trying to recruit a GP.
The solution to this regional draining is looking at ways doctors and nurses can get that training in regional NSW rather than in Sydney, Wollongong or Newcastle, which have been drawing the bulk of the state's health professionals.
"So much effort now goes into what we call 'end to end career planning and management'," Mr Colbran said.
"We try to make sure they don't have to go back to the city at any point through their training pipeline."
Mr Colbran said the result of a shortfall in medical professionals in regional NSW led to a drop in life expectancy.
Living in Sydney, he said a man could expect to live around 80 years, for those out beyond the "sandstone curtain", that dropped by a decade.
And for Aboriginal people in regional NSW Mr Cobran said life expectancy fell further.Yellowstone was the first place I wanted to write about when I started this blog. The National Park had been the setting for the road trip that my husband and I went on for our first anniversary back in 2008, and so it seemed fitting that it should be the subject of my first post on my travel blog.
However, I quickly realized that Yellowstone is a BIG topic. Even though I'd been to the park three times (and later one more time) I felt completely unqualified to write about the park. There was just so much to see and do in the park. How could I even begin to offer advise about how to have a great visit?
One of the many reasons I wanted to work/live in Yellowstone this summer is so I could learn more about this amazing place. Maybe, just maybe, by the end of the summer I'll feel more qualified to write about the park.
Until then I plan to just do little updates on how the summer is going. Six people living in a 25 foot RV is an interesting story in itself. Add in the fact that we are in Yellowstone makes this summer pretty unforgettable. So watch for updates throughout the summer. I don't have access to reliable Wi-Fi so I can't promise any consistency in the frequency of my posts, but I do promise to update as often as I can.
So how are we doing? Well I can honestly say that we are doing great. Everything has been just about perfect. So far this has been my best visit to Yellowstone ever. Since we'll be here for over 60 days we can really take our time and explore the park. Instead of rushing around the park trying to see as many things as possible in 48 hours we just take our time. We've also discovered that the park is amazing after about 6:00 pm. The crowds disappear and we have the place to ourselves.
As far as living in an RV goes, it's been pretty great too. Obviously it's been crampt, but that hasn't been that much of a problem yet. I'm actually surprised at how normal it feels. Both my husband and I had only ever camped in tents before buying the RV. So the fact that we have a working fridge, oven microwave, toilet, and electric lights feels palatial. Heck, just having cupboards is amazing. The small space has been good for our family in some ways. For example, We only brought a few dishes so we've become really good at washing, drying, and putting away dishes after every meal. I even made a little chart so we can keep track of which kid is responsible for clearing the table, washing, rinsing, or drying.
I'm happy to say that my job is really great. I'm still in a training phase, but everything is very similar to a position I had over the winter so I don't anticipate too many problems. Quite frankly, this is pretty much my dream job.
So what have we seen in the park so far? If I had the time I would load this post up with a hundred pictures. But we don't have that kind of time or bandwidth. So here are 8 highlights in no particular order.
We've been to the Lower Falls of the Yellowstone River twice since we got here. My son loves this waterfall and has been carrying a picture of it around for several days. This view from Artist Point matched the picture on his brochure. He was so excited to see it in person.
Here is our home for the next few months. We have water, sewer, and electric hookups so we are pretty set there. Our stove and our heater run off propane. When we arrived our fire pit was still covered in snow. The snow has been melting for the past few days and so hopefully we'll have a dry campsite soon. Most of our neighbors are retired and so far I think we have the only kids in the place. If my kids play their cards right they might end up with 50 or so surrogate grandparents.
On my first day of work I had to check in at Gardener, Montana which is just north of the Mammoth Hot Springs area. When I was done with check in we stopped off at Mammoth and explored the area a little bit. This was the best visit I've ever had at Mammoth. The weather has been a little chilly which is perfect for viewing hotsprings. Everything was steamy and amazing looking.
Well that's all for now. Basically we are happy, healthy, and having the best summer of our lives. I'm so glad that my husband and I decided to take this risk. It's already paying off immensely.
I would love to hear what you think. Did I get it right, or was I dead wrong? What was your experience like?Southbound.

The premise for this book captured my interest right away. I knew it was going to be a refreshing read because of it's original storyline. I was not disappointed!
There are books that are great because of the plot, or their are books that have a good balance of both. However, for me, I loved this book because of it's character cast. Carol Oates created such riveting characters, that it made the book nearly impossible to put down. The first half of the book is the character development, but it was tastefully done, not overwhelming at all. The way characters were introduced and developed held my interest throughout. Triona's character was so entertaining. She starts off as your average teenager, but her transformation throughout the book is dramatic. It was a wonderful experience to read.
Caleb seems to be another typical character, the hot new guy in town, that is mysterious and secretive. But that's all I will say about him. I feel he is a character that should be discovered on your own.
As the storyline unravels and the plot thickens, I began to devour the book. This book followed me everywhere because I just could not put it down. Any moment, that I had a spare time in between reading, I would pick it up and read a page or two. Carol Oates takes you on a wild adventure. The twist and turns in this book drove me nuts!(in a good way, of course). The writing style is simple and just right. The author doesn't overwhelm you with unnecessary details or descriptions.
Shades of Atlantis was a fantastic read! One full of jaw-dropping twist and turns, romance and passion.
What I liked: The original plot. Character development
What I disliked: I thought the ending was a little rushed.

The music is deep, dramatic, and beautiful.” In Theatre Three’s current production of Lost in the Stars, set main stage in the round at the Quadrangle, the entire ensemble struggles on occasion to master the near operatic challenge the complex score presents. No matter. The soaring eloquence of the music and its sincere expression of the collective human soul’s heart-felt desire for universal acceptance and transcendence allow Theatre Three’s talented, diverse acting ensemble to reach a superb performance level in spite of any vocal technique shortcomings. Their rawness adds veracity to the score’s richness and contemporary potency to the production. The audience exults in the hauntingly expressive music, while treading every anguished step alongside the main character Stephen Kumalo in his Orpheus-like descent to Hell and back. It’s transformative, enriching theatre in an accessible modern vernacular.
Cedric Neal, Akin Babatunde, Liz Mikel
Talk about hope-filled audacity. Some vision composer Kurt Weill and lyricist Maxwell Anderson must have had in 1949 to create and mount a musical stage adaptation of Alan Paton’s disturbingly realistic 1948 apartheid novel Cry, the Beloved Country. What musical swept the Tony awards in 1949? Cole Porter’s Kiss Me Kate, hardly in the same league as far as provocative social commentary goes. How could Weill/Anderson have expected their show to go on tour in 1949? Where could they have fed and housed a bi-racial cast in segregated America, the land of separate but equal drinking fountains, hotels and restaurants? What race-related roadblocks must they have faced even in mounting the show in the “enlightened” New York of that day? And where at that time would they find a substantial number of African-American singers versed in operatic-dimensioned expression to fully realize the major roles? Weill must have planned carefully. As his lead Stephen Kumalo, he cast the incomparable operatic baritone and actor Todd Duncan, the first African-American to sing with a major opera company (1945), and the first black person to sing in an opera with an otherwise white cast (the New York City Opera). Duncan was quite the outspoken desegregation advocate. While playing Porgy in Gershwin’s Porgy and Bess during the show’s 1936 Washington run at the National Theatre, he led the cast in a protest of the theatre’s policy of segregation. Duncan declared that he “would never play in a theater which barred him from purchasing tickets to certain seats because of his race.” Management succumbed to his demands and allowed the first integrated performance at the National Theatre. No one on earth could have better brought the plight of Stephen Kumalo to life both vocally and experientially for that first production. Todd Duncan had walked that walk, fought that battle, himself.
How does a modern company cast that pivotal role? Theatre Three features multiple award-winning Akin Babatunde as Stephen Kumalo. Babatunde brings phenomenal stage presence, reverential compassion and ferocious dignity to his portrayal. Trained at the National Black Theatre in Harlem, he has acted, directed, coached and taught extensively nation-wide and abroad. His co-written play Blind Lemon Blues, has earned national acclaim, with his performance as Blind lemon receiving glowing praise. Accordingly, he brings a gravelly blues sensibility to his song interpretations that makes Kumalo a vivid Everyman dealing with life’s unspeakable horrors. This musical isn’t mounted very often, possibly because it’s hard to cast. With Babatunde as lead, Theatre Three not only bypasses the inherent casting challenge, it transforms the show to reach today’s audience head on. Could Theatre Three have found a stronger African-American operatic singer for the Kumalo role today? Undoubtedly. Would he have brought the show as effectively to life in the era of “Yes, We Can” as Babatunde with his soulful blues intonations and common man demeanor? Probably not.
The rest of the ensemble creates unforgettable, transformational moments as well. Liz Mikel’s raunchy fun “Who’ll Buy” kicks Act I into high gear, while her stirring, heartfelt rendition of “Cry, the Beloved Country” in Act II warrants an extended encore. TeCo Theatrical Productions’ trained young artist Raliegh “Tre” Jones delights the audience in his cameo solo “Big Mole”. The tragic role of Stephen Kumalo’s son Absolom seems tailor-made for Dallas Theater Center resident actor/singer Cedric Neal. His soaring rendition of “The Wild Justice “ in Act II expresses such vivid contrast in bright and dark tones that it shines a poignant light on the relentless determination of his father Stephen Kumalo to find resolution and salvation as much as it reveals his character’s inner conflict. Neal’s Absolom never begs for mercy; his honesty brings on his death while providing redemptive inspiration for all lives he touches. The father’s single-minded dignity is mirrored in the son, although their life paths carry them far apart. Through Absolom’s committed resolve the audience, along with Stephen Kumalo, is no longer “lost in the stars.” Through Weill’s music all are transported to that grace-filled magical place.
Lost in the Stars, dealing with the most serious subject matter of any show currently running in the region, delivers its message of reconciliation through loss with a powerful musical wallop. It matches our times of hope and challenge, warrants attendance by all who believe that great theater can inspire transformation as well as provide exquisite entertainment.
Theatre Three’s production of Kurt Weill’s Lost in the Stars runs through June 14.

Our Top PicksClaire (Brooke Langton) and Joe (Colin Egglesfield) go fishing for something special in "Beautiful Dreamer."
They were so in love…
But when Joe looks at Claire, his wife, without recognition none at all it’s one of those heart-wrenching moments, so romantically, tortuously painful. What makes such cinematic moments so exquisite is the knowledge that love will, somehow, conquer all. That deep down, this man’s love for this woman can never die. That deep down, this woman has the inner strength to help him heal.
We know all this because Beautiful Dreamer’s tag line proclaims it an unabashedly romantic film: “Love will bring you home.” For Claire, played by Brooke Langton (The Replacements), and Joe, played by Colin Egglesfield (All My Children), home is indeed where the heart is even under the disconnection of war-induced amnesia.
Cynics may scoff at these kinds of sentiments, but there is nothing trivial about romance. Romances, which appeal predominantly to women, allow the woman to be at least the man’s equal protagonist (sometimes more so). But more than that, a romance like Beautiful Dreamer is, as director Terri Farley-Teruel suggests, a hopeful movie for the whole family about the power of love. And the setting is, as Colin Egglesfield suggests, the romantic and classy 1940s. I recently had the opportunity to speak with Farley-Teruel and Egglesfield about their work on this film (with links to those interviews below).
Beautiful Dreamer was written by Terry Chase Chenowith (associate producer of The Devil and Daniel Webster). And he and Jack Robinson (location manager and stuntman on Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery) produced the film. Although this is Farley-Teruel’s feature directing debut, she has directed a number of short films, including two award-winning shorts. And Beautiful Dreamer has now won several festival awards.
Colin Egglesfield, who was one of People magazine’s “Sexiest Men Alive” in 2005, brings Joe Kelly to life in a sensitive portrayal of vulnerable masculinity a man who has been deeply affected by the horrors of war and needs his wife more than ever. Egglesfield’s other film work includes Vampires: The Turning, S.W.A.T., and Must Love Dogs. While Egglesfield has done several TV projects, he is probably best known for his current role on All My Children.
Beautiful Dreamer is a film that harkens back to classic Hollywood romances like An Affair to Remember, It’s a Wonderful Life, and The Best Years of Our Lives. And it is nostalgically romantic as well, setting the love story in the “romantic” past of the World War II era which also conjures associations with “the golden age” of 1940s Hollywood. Not many contemporary films do this. Thus, Beautiful Dreamer seems perfect for moviegoers who feel ignored by blockbuster-Hollywood’s obsessive quest for 13- to 25-year-old males as well as the postmodern cynicism or moral ambiguity of edgy independents.
When I saw this film at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, I loved it. Some viewers next to me retired folk, no doubt had only good things to say about the film as the lights came up. This is the older audience segment that the filmmakers consider part of their target audience: older viewers with a closer connection to the 1940s, and with firsthand experience watching classic Hollywood movies.
Beautiful Dreamer’s story follows Claire and Joe Kelly, young sweethearts and then blissfully married newlyweds. But World War II interrupts their life together. As a pilot, Joe’s plane is shot down over enemy territory; death, destruction, and the butt of a gun lead to amnesia. He is declared missing in action, and then presumed dead.
But he’s not at least his body is not. He does not remember who he is and has started a new life in another town. Claire discovers him, and she must struggle to gently help the man she loves even at the risk of selflessly walking away. Love has to be given breathing space, and it will bloom again. Barry Corbin (Northern Exposure) co-stars as Joe’s grandfather, James Denton (Desperate Housewives) is the doctor who specializes in war-related trauma, and Rusty Schwimmer (North Country) is a wise-cracking secretary at the local airstrip.
A limited theatrical release in Atlanta is in the works for this summer, with a possible wider release later.Open-Hours:10 am to 7pm

Research output: Chapter in Book/Report/Conference proceeding › Conference contribution
IMPACT 6: International Multidisciplinary Printmaking Conference 2009
Abstract
The paper studies the nature of artistic collaboration, concentrating on Fine Art Printmaking and the notions of illustration, visualisation and interpretation. The paper also explores the visual transformation of printmaking through the use of digital technology and the impact that digital technologies have had upon the nature of collaboration. Classically painters and sculptors have worked with collaborative printmakers in order to make graphic reproductions of their work. The collaborative printmakers used their technical craft and skills to create corresponding images to the given briefs, producing editions of prints. Alongside this type of collaborative printmaking there are other ways in which collaborative printmaking has been undertaken, for instance illustration of written narratives, novels and poetry. Examples of printmaking that illustrate an idea are numerous throughout the history of art (and science) and have had a bearing on technological innovation. The paper explores the boundaries of such collaboration and recognises that the role has always been multi-faceted, ambiguous in terms of issues of authorship and due recognition.. The latter involves the area of visualisation, which amongst other things attempts to convey complex scientific data, phenomena, ideas, and insights that may stretch beyond the still print into digital animation. The paper also proposes that it is possible to show that the techniques applied in the emergence of digital technologies are generally an emulation or development of the traditional techniques used to create the printed image. The printed image, is everywhere in contemporary culture and is frequently mediated by computer technology.Ward County Ag Improvement Association Annual Meeting

Property Description
If I could describe a piece of property that I receive calls, time and time again from clients looking for a specific type of land, here's what it would look like. Hey Buddy, FIND ME: "Somewhere between 10-20 acres, not in town but not too far out, must have trees, a great place for the kids to roam around, hunt and camp, needs an Ag exemption for taxes, a nice place for a garden, may want to add a few horses or head of cattle, must have a beautiful building site if we decide on that later, not a lot of restrictions, access to utilities and it must be affordable." Now, if that sounds like what you're looking for then this 11 acre tract just N of Waco in West ISD is a must see. It hits all of the hot buttons and then some. Additional acreage available next door (75 acres total).

Starring Domhnall Gleeson, Margot Robbie, Will Tilston, Kelly Macdonald, Alex Lawther
This might be a film about the origins of Winnie the Pooh, but it’s ultimately about the failures of parenthood. Goodbye Christopher Robin depicts the accidental creation of one of the greatest children’s book characters. Make-up caked performances by Gleeson (Ex Machina, The Revenant) and 2017 it girl Margot Robbie (I Tonya, Suicide Squad) don’t add much to this tale, that banks on sweetness but can’t quite corral the right level of emotion. You could look at this as true story about child neglect, and that’s heartbreaking on its own, or the psychological repercussions of early childhood fame. The first hour of the film is the most enchanting, when father and son are inventing these characters with personalities we all know. It’s the second half where the audience will feel guilty for enjoying a Pooh book or cartoon when they how this child suffered.
Following his service in The Great War, writer Alan Milne (Gleeson) suffered tremendous PTSD, which resulted in relocating his family from London into the countryside. His wife Daphne (Robbie), a socialite, only birthing their child to distract her husband from a mental breakdown finds Sussex woods uninviting. She spends her time in London, leaving their son Christopher (Tilston) with the live-in nanny Olive (Macdonald). Yet for two weeks when Christopher and his father were along together, they played in the woods with stuffed animals creating characters and scenarios that gave Alan the ideas he needed for a new book. Pooh became the gateway to happiness for a nation suffering the after effects of war. The cost of everyone else enjoying Christopher’s world meant sharing everything he loved, including his childhood.
An often misguided and mishandled story of sacrificing childhood for fame and art.
Director Simon Curtis softens the reality of the mother, and doesn’t quite allow the audience to hate these parents, although we want to. Eight-year-old Christopher Robin speaks in a way that doesn’t feel very realistic at times. Will Tilston is almost doll like with his dimples, bowl cut and dresses his mother leaves for him to wear. Robbie is in out and out the film, but her warmness as an actress was perhaps not the best choice to portray someone who is documented as being so cold. Macdonald is delightful as the nanny and the ignored voice of reason within a family that doesn’t understand the irreversible and devastating effect they are causing their child.
The countryside locations and vast wooded landscapes are as welcoming to the viewer as the stuffed animals are to Christopher. In the two weeks where Alan is actually a father, understanding where and how Tigger, Eeyore and Piglet were created are the highlights of the film. I don’t understand the need for the porcelain looking makeup on all the characters that make them look like heightened versions of reality. The transition from young Christopher to older, is quite jarring, and actor Alex Lawther (The Imitation Game) isn’t what anyone might imagine that chubby cheeked dimpled kid would evolve into. Yet it’s the final moments of the movie that tap into the forecast resentment we’ve suspected (and the Nanny predicted) all along that finally has a chance to produce waterworks.
Final Thought
An often misguided and mishandled story of sacrificing childhood for fame and art.

Poland is all set to introduce the deepest pool in the world later this year, which reportedly has depth of 45 metres.
DeepSpot – in the central Polish town of Mszczonów, which is about 40 kilometres(25 miles) from the capital Warsaw – will open its doors to the public in autumn, with a water volume equivalent to 27 normal swimming pools.
The pool will be 45 metres (148 feet) deep, which means five metres deeper than the current record holder, which is located in the northern Italian town of Montegrotto Terme.
Eight thousand cubic metres of water will be used to fill up DeepSpot, which is the equivalent of 27 normal – i.e. 25-metre-long – swimming pools.
As per reports, it is built by the same company that built the popular indoor skydiving simulator FlySpot in Poland’s Warsaw West County. The pool will have an underwater tunnel, hotel rooms overlooking the pool, as well as restaurants and conference rooms.
And it won’t just be for scuba divers, either, as DeepSpot will be accessible to everyone. Well, anyone who’s not too afraid of deep water, that is.
Unfortunately, it will apparently hold the record for just six months. That’s because the Blue Abyss, currently under construction in Colchester in the UK, will open with a 50-metre-deep (164-foot-deep) pool to dethrone it.
The brainchild of ex-forces diving instructor and technology consultant John Vickers, planning for the project began back in September 2014.
Vickers commented: .”
According to the Blue Abyss website, the ‘unique’ aquatic centre will house the largest and deepest indoor pool of its kind globally.
“The pool will have several entrance points and feature multi-stepped depths to accommodate for a variety of activities and simultaneous use, leading down to the 50m shaft,” the website explains.
“On one side of the pool, a large table-like area at 12m will be able to house, for example, a mock section of the International Space Station for commercial astronaut training.”Why Dash Could Be the Top Performing Altcoin in 2021
Dash (DASH) is a cryptocurrency targeting the digital cash use case designed to offer everyone financial freedom. The payments-focused coin continues to see increased adoption as it facilitates the sending and receiving of payments swiftly and securely with near-zero fees.
Since it launched in 2014, the crypto has seen steady growth in value, hitting an all-time high of $ 1540 in Dec 2017 according to CoinMarketCap.
Dash developers built this coin based on the blockchain tech deployed by Bitcoin. However, it offers advanced functionality such as much higher transaction speeds than Bitcoin because it leverages a unique model that involves masternodes, incentivized nodes which perform special functions for the network.
Another improvement on Bitcoin is that Dash transactions can optionally be mixed making all coins equal and fungible and more difficult to trace, making them safe for consumers to use to purchase goods and services without sensitive data exposure.
The popular payments coin boasts a self-funding model that enables the network to fund any necessary improvements on the Dash technology. It also has a self-governing model that makes for a truly decentralized experience for users who can vote on any upgrades/alterations to the network’s core functionality, as well as funding projects and initiatives.
Dash has introduced a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) mechanism that allows users to vote on critical decisions that determine the project’s direction.
Dash Has the Edge Over Other Cryptocurrencies
Dash integrates a host of powerful features that give it an edge over other crypto assets such as Bitcoin and Litecoin.
For one, the Dash cryptocurrency blockchain builds on the bitcoin system to introduce masternodes that complement miners’ work. The growing team of Dash masternodes is primarily responsible for enhancing the network’s security and facilitating transaction mixing (PrivateSend).
This PrivateSend service enhances privacy in the Dash ecosystem, making it difficult to track transactions or find out users’ identities and balances, protecting them from risk of becoming a target for criminal activity such as theft and extortion. This feature is built into network infrastructure itself and is a massive advantage that Dash offers over the completely public Bitcoin ecosystem, which must rely on third-party services to protect consumers.
The network also rewards masternodes for ensuring that Dash transactions are as instant as cash transactions (InstantSend). Masternodes are also in charge of the governance and treasury system.
Dash solves the inherent problem of wide consumer adoption of Bitcoin with its InstantSend feature. It takes about 10 minutes for a BTC transaction to get confirmed under ideal circumstances, an issue that threatens to derail the mass adoption of the top crypto for everyday payments.
On the other hand, Dash transactions are almost instant; on average, a transaction is confirmed by the masternode network in under 2 seconds using InstantSend, with a transaction becoming entirely permanent and irreversible within about 2.5 minutes thanks to the ChainLocks advanced security feature
Therefore, Dash improves on the Bitcoin network’s scalability by prioritizing on-chain scaling facilitated by a seamless and fully-incentivized infrastructure, with university research conducted specially for Dash showing that the network can handle transaction loads comparable to what modern payment networks such as VISA can handle today.
Why You Should Invest in the Dash Cryptocurrency
The price of Dash has skyrocketed by almost 40% in the last week, making it one of the best performing crypto assets at the moment.
As a result of that surge, Dash currently has a market cap of over $ 1.6 billion as per data from CoinMarketCap. At the time of writing, the top payments-focused coin is up 11.3% to trade at $ 232.
DASH/USD Chart By TradingView
The recent spike in the DASH/USD pair has excited the crypto community on Twitter, with one user calling for the price to soar as high as $ 1,000.
Per the latest report from the Dash Core Group, the Dash cryptocurrency posted impressive growth in 2020. The blockchain network saw the total volume of payments reach $ 916 million, up 80% from 2019.
The Q4 2020 results highlighted a massive growth in average trade volumes from $ 9.8M to $ 37.4M, representing a 282% year-over-year jump. Commercial payment values on the Dash network also saw a tremendous increase, soaring 37.3% year-over-year and surpassing 22,000 transactions per day.
Dash Core Group also revealed that Dash adoption as a digital payment method across retail stores was rising. They noted that the payments coin outperformed BTC in terms of the number of retailers accepting digital payments in the US in January.
Enhanced merchant adoption, along with the current strong market and technical fundamentals, make Dash one of the most lucrative crypto investments to keep an eye on in 2021.

Want to make the internet angry? Try something on our checklist:☐ Write a poem about Chinese food☐ Be a woman☐ Consider letting millennials use their cellphones at the moviesAMC Entertainment CEO Adam Aron told Variety that his movie theater chain, currently the second largest chain in the country, would consider relaxing rules around cell phones, specifically in order to appeal to millennials. "When you tell a 22-year-old to turn off the phone, don’t ruin a movie," he said, "they hear please cut off your left arm above the elbow. You can’t tell a 22-year-old to turn off their cellphone. That’s now how they live their life." And of course, the internet went crazy — just read the comments on this article where the author suggests that Aron might actually have a great idea.
First of all, it’s cute that Aron thinks that anyone listens to those warnings. AMC is nowhere as strict as Alamo Drafthouse, for example, a super-small theater chain that will kick you out if you text or talk during a movie. Second, it’s concerning that that’s what Aron thinks is keeping millennials away from movie theaters.So let’s get one thing straight: the reason young people (and all people, actually) are staying away from movie theaters is that it’s really freakin’ expensive. If the internet is going to get angry about anything, it should be about this!I just checked my local AMC theater to see how much a ticket to see the new Jungle Book movie is. The cheapest adult ticket — no IMAX, no 3D — at an AMC theater in New York City is $15.09. That’s five dollars and ten cents more than a monthly Netflix subscription, which has around 13,000 movies available to stream at literally any moment.But if you’re going to go to a movie theater, you might as well spring for an IMAX or 3D ticket, since that’s an experience you’re unlikely to be able to experience at home. An adult ticket for The Jungle Book in IMAX 3D at AMC in NYC (wow that’s a lot of acronyms) costs $21.09. A child ticket nets you a $3 discount at $18.09 per ticket. Let’s say two parents want to take their two perfect kids out the movies. It’s going to cost them $78.36 just for the tickets. And God help them if the rugrats want popcorn.
Tickets are expensive outside of the big cities, too: a movie ticket in my hometown in Vermont costs $8.75 (add $1.50 for 3D features). Add in the cheaper kids tickets and you’re looking at $37 total to see The Jungle Book in 3D, sans IMAX. Sure, it’s about half the price of a night out in New York, but it’s still really expensive, and a lot of families don’t have $40 to throw around every time there’s a somewhat interesting movie in theaters.That’s another problem: while audiences have shown that they’ll show up in droves for proven properties like Star Wars or pretty much any Marvel movie, they’re less like to pay $15 to $20 per ticket for something that might be just okay. Take the latest Melissa McCarthy movie, The Boss, for example. I’d love to go see The Boss! I like Melissa McCarthy! But I’ve read some middling reviews, and I’d rather not spend $15 when I could just re-watch Gilmore Girls or rent Bridesmaids for $4 on iTunes.I’d love to see Adam Aron put his money where his mouth is. If he really wants to get millennials back in movie theaters "with the same degree of intensity as baby boomers," he should lower prices across the board. Changing the environment of the theater can help — creating "family only" screenings, for example, and marking some showings as safe for texting teens — but that doesn’t change the environment at the box office.

Verse 1
Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongeth to Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.
Gathered, … —
And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.
Six cubits — At least, nine feet, nine inches high. And this is not strange; for besides the giants mentioned in Scripture, Herodotus, Diodorus Siculus, and Pliny, make mention of persons seven cubits high.
Verse 5
And he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass.
Coat of mail — Made of brass plates laid over one another, like the scales of a fish.
The weight, … —
And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders.
Greaves — Boots.
Verse 7
And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him.
Beam —.
Come down — That the battle may be decided by us two alone.
Verse 11
When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.
Afraid —
Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul.
Old man — Therefore he went not himself to the camp.
Verse 15
But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem.
Went — From Saul's court: where having relieved Saul, he was permitted to go to his father's house, to be sent for again upon occasion.
Verse 18
And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge.
Pledge — That is, bring me some token of their welfare.
Verse 19
Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.
Fighting — That is, in a posture and readiness to fight with them; as it is explained, verse20,21.
Verse 20
And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle.
Went, … — Jesse little thought of sending his son to the camp, just at that critical juncture. But the wise God orders the time and all the circumstances of affairs, so as to serve the designs of his own glory.
Verse 24
And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid.
Fled — One Philistine could never have thus put ten thousand Israelites to flight, unless their rock, being forsaken by them, had justly sold them and shut them up.
Verse.
Free — Free from all those tributes and charges which either the court or the camp required.
Verse.
Naughtiness — Thy false-confidence, and vain gloried curiosity. See the folly and wickedness of envy! How groundless its jealousies are, how unjust its censures, how unfair it representations? God preserve us from such a spirit!
Verse 29
And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?
A
And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.
He tarried — For being secretly moved by God's spirit to undertake the combat. He speaks with divers persons about it, that it might come to the king's ear.
Verse 32
And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.
Let no man's heart, … —
And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.
A youth — Not above20 years old; and a novice, a raw and unexperienced soldier.
Verse Lord, … — The lion and the bear were only enemies to me and my sheep, and it was in defence of them I attacked them. But this Philistine is an enemy to my God and his people, and it is for their honour that I attack him.
Verse 38
And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.
Armour — With armour taken out of his armoury. He seems to speak of some military vestments which were then used in war, and were contrived for defence; such as buff-coats are now.
Verse 39
And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.
Proved them — I have no skill or experience in the managements of this kind of arms.
Verse.
Staff —
And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him.
Drew near — Probably a signal was made, that his challenge was accepted.
Verse 42
And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance.
Fair — Not having so much as the countenance of a martial person.
Verse 43
And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
Dog — Dost thou think to beat me as easily as thou wouldst thy dog?
Verse.
A
And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD's, and he will give you into our hands.
Saveth — That is, that he can save without these arms, and with the most contemptible weapons.
The battle — That is, the events of war are wholly in his power.
He will — David speaks thus confidently, because he was assured of it by a particular inspiration.
Verse 48
And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.
Drew nigh — Like a stalking mountain.
Ran — So far was he from fear!
Verse 49
And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.
Forehead — Probably the proud giant had lift up that part of his helmet which covered his fore-head; in contempt of David and his weapons, and by the singular direction of providence.
Verse 51
Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled.
David
And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.
Whose.

If crop is lost due to unfavorable growth conditions following application of Nortron SC herbicide or tank mixes, do not replant with crops other than sugar beets, table beets, carrots, dry bulb onions, shallots, or ryegrass in treated land during the same year.
Site of action Group 16: unknown (but there is strong evidence that it interferes with biosynthesis of fatty acids and lipids in the newly developing shoot).
Chemical family Benzofuran
oxyfluorfen (GoalTender, Goal 2XL, or Galigan 2E, Galigan H2O, Collide)
Dry bulb onion, green onions (via sprinkler application)
Rate 0.12 to 0.25 lb ai/a (0.25 to 0.5 pint/a GoalTender and Galigan H2O) in direct-seeded and transplanted onions. The rate for Goal 2XL and Galigan 2E use 0.125 to 0.25 lb ai/a (0.5 to 1 pint/a).
Time Apply postemergence to onions with two fully developed true leaves, while broadleaf weeds have fewer than four true leaves. Goal applications are allowed on green onions through sprinkler irrigation systems (Special local needs label OR-020027). Read and precisely follow label instructions regarding irrigation interval and all chemigation specifications to minimize environmental hazards.
Remarks Multiple treatments may be required as new weeds emerge, but do not exceed 0.5 lb ai/a (maximum of 2.5 pints/a per use season). Use a clean sprayer and do not mix with oils, surfactants, or other agricultural chemicals. Apply when susceptible weeds are in the two- to four-leaf stage and actively growing. Acts as a selective contact herbicide that disrupts cell membranes.
Caution Do not apply to onions that are under any stress. Leaves may curl slightly, and young plants sometimes become prostrate on the soil surface for 1 to 2 days, but yields have not been reduced. Preharvest interval is 45 days. Goal damages some onion varieties more easily than others; "Walla Walla" sweet onions are very sensitive. Check with your seed supplier for information regarding the variety you wish to plant.
Site of action Group 14: protoporphyrinogen oxidase inhibitor
Chemical family Diphenylether
pendimethalin (Prowl H2O or Satellite HydroCap, Framework 3.3EC and various generic names)
Dry bulb onions and shallots only, direct-seeded or transplanted
Rate 0.475 to 1.42 lb ai/a (1 to 3 pints/a Prowl H2O) depending on soil texture.
Time Delayed preemergence for dry bulb onion only (after onion seed germinates but before it emerges); and after onions emerge (two- to nine-true-leaf stage). Delayed preemergence: apply Prowl H2O when 75% of dry bulb onion seed radicals have emerged. Determine radical status by digging onion seedlings at random locations in a field, and noting radical length. Plant onions at least 1 inch deep to mitigate risk of injury. Apply Prowl H2O as a broadcast treatment when dry bulb onions or dry bulb shallots are between the flag leaf to 9th true-leaf stage. Prowl H2O may be used at 3.0 to 4.0 pints per acre for dodder control on medium-texture and fine-texture soils. DO NOT apply Prowl H2O using chemigation at the dodder control rate. See restrictions and limitations on the label.
Remarks Prowl H2O is a selective delayed preemergence herbicide for controlling most annual grass weeds and certain broadleaf weeds as they germinate. Prowl H2O will not control established weeds. SLN labels are available for delayed preemergence for Prowl H2O (OR-060008, WA-070004, and ID-060009) from several grower associations in western and eastern Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. Adjust rates according to soil texture. Rain or overhead irrigation is needed within 10 days for activation. Inhibits mitosis, both in shoots and roots.
Caution Adjust rates according to soil texture. Do not apply preplant incorporated, or preplant. For use under SLN labels in OR, WA, and ID. Do not apply delayed preemergence through any type of irrigation system or by air. Be aware of crop-rotation restrictions, including for sugar beets, winter wheat, and winter barley. Do not exceed the maximum rate per acre, per crop season regardless of application timing.
Site of action Group 3: microtubule assembly inhibitor
Chemical family Dinitroaniline
pendimethalin (Prowl H2O or Framework 3.3EC, Satellite HydroCap and various generic names)
Green onion crop subgroup: chives (fresh leaves), leeks, spring onions, scallions, Japanese bunching onions, green shallots, and green eschalots
Rate 0.95 lb ai/a (2 pints/a)
Time Preemergence, postemergence at two- to three-leaf stage, or as a split application.
Remarks Apply 2 pints/a per application. Two applications per season are allowed with 30 days between applications. Preharvest interval is 30 days.
Caution Onion seed must be covered with soil to prevent injury. Do not apply to soils with less than 3% organic matter.
Site of action Group 3: microtubule assembly inhibitor
Chemical family Dinitroaniline
S-metolachlor (Dual Magnum and other trade names)
Early postemergence for yellow nutsedge control in dry bulb onion; Oregon, Idaho, and Washington
Rate and Time Apply at two true-leaf stage of onions at 0.67 to 1.33 pints/a (0.64 to 1.27 lb ai/a). Another application of 0.67 to 1.33 pints/a may be made 21 or more days after the first, if needed, provided Dual Magnum was not applied preplant in fall.
Remarks Indemnified special local need labels OR-040009 and ID-9900016 are available at farmassist.com. The Washington SLN label (WA-990023) is distributed only by the Walla Walla Sweet Onion Growers Association. Excessive rain or cold, wet conditions after application may reduce plant stand and cause stunting and yield loss. Onion tolerance to Dual Magnum increases with increasing onion size.
Caution A restricted-use herbicide in Washington. 1. Do not apply within 60 days of harvest. 2. Do not harvest green onions. 3. Do not apply this product through any type of irrigation system. 4. Do not graze animals on green forage or stubble. If a fall preplant application of Dual Magnum was used for nutsedge, only one postemergence application at a maximum rate of 1.33 pints/a is allowed. Do not apply more than 2.68 pints/a to dry bulb onions as a combined total across all application timings and use patterns to produce that crop.

Chemical family ChloroacetamideAs a metal stampings manufacturer, you are always considering ways to increase productivity and cut costs, while still creating the best products possible. At PFA, Inc., we believe that ensuring you have the equipment needed to safely and efficiently implement quick die changeovers is the easiest way to improve productivity and ensure your staff is safely meeting production improvement goals. In this article, we will look at some of the ways a Quick Die Change (QDC) system can help ensure you are working smarter and safer when handling dies.
Manufacturing Productivity
One of the most apparent reasons die stampers install Quick Die Change systems is the ability to drastically increase productivity. By eliminating the downtime associated with traditional changeovers you can ensure the manufacturing process never stalls for extended periods, while also reducing operator overtime that may occur. In fact, this cut in costs is one of the most common reasons that manufacturers invest in quick die change systems.
Lean Manufacturing
Tooling can often have increased wear or damage during die changes, when they are not exchanged in a methodical way. Unfortunately, this can lead to increased costs as worn tooling needs to be replaced more frequently. Lean Manufacturing places an emphasis on controlled processes and procedures to track process improvements and impact on key performance indicators over time. With a dedicated Quick Die Change system, dies are consistently clamped with equal forces on all clamps and handled the same way each changeover. With easier die movement and enhanced handling, dies can more easily be registered to the press with less time to ensure optimal setup to defined processes.
Employee Safety
Another obvious benefit of converting your existing manufacturing equipment to include a quick die change system is the ability to increase employee safety by utilizing equipment that has been developed specifically for moving dies. Over 25% of workplace injuries are caused by overexertion1,2 (lifting, pulling, pushing, turning…) and overexertion is listed as one of the top 10 causes of workplace injuries along with Physical and Mental Fatigue/Exhaustion, which results in “impaired judgment, slower reflexes in operating machinery….. a delayed response to emergency situations, and inattention to details and instructions.”3 With new QDC systems in place, not only will your employees be less likely to be involved in an injury, but you could also see a morale boost and increased productivity in other areas as employees are able to more easily complete their designated tasks with lower stress and risk.
Implement Quick Die Change Now
If you are ready to implement a Quick Die Change system in your facilities today, PFA, Inc. is here to help ensure you have the products you need. If you are unsure how to get started, we encourage you to call us now and allow us to walk you through the steps personally. If you prefer read more about how to implement QDC please see our article “How to Implement Quick Die Change: 8 Easy steps to increased stamping productivity & profits”, read about a real SMED implementation “Trio of New Presses Gets SMED Upgrades”, or browse the products available on our designated Quick Die Change page.

November 2011
Large farm pig Judee is injured in the field with severe damage to her right rear leg. She is moved to intensive medical care and given emergency medications. The veterinarian's diagnosis and prognosis is grim. A large pig cannot be repaired as easily as a dog or cat. This is horrible. Judee does her best by getting up on three legs to eat, drink and give pig kisses. If she won't give up we won't. Her best pig friend Clara visits and watches as Judee struggles with ambulation.
Visitors bring pumpkins - a huge treat. Frequent calls come regarding aggressive pigs. We help with advice. Young mini pig Charlie Brown here for behavior help. Our large people-friendly group of pigs will help him with his human-focused aggression.

April 2011
Numerous calls come from several states with requests for us to take pigs and chickens. We are limited in who we can help and it is sad and frustrating. Too many people continue to buy from breeders without doing the research on the 20 year commitment that a pig requires. We absolutely cannot take all that need help and we have no place to recommend as there are many bad 'sanctuaries'.
Judy goes to Montana 'sanctuary' to bring back the pig who was injured in January and is still suffering. She is horrified to see the conditions of the animals. All pigs are underfed and skinny, have mange and have no bedding in the Montana winter cold. Two sows are pregnant due to accidental breeding. Judy takes Tony with the very damaged leg and his sister Daisy to Pigs Peace Sanctuary. Transport arrangements are made to go back a week later for pregnant Betsy.
This was a stressful rescue from a 'sanctuary' that had gone downhill fast. We had to transport pigs across three treacherous mountain passes in winter conditions.
Tony is started on intensive care for his leg. Prognosis is extremely poor and doubtful due to the extensive damage and duration of injury. Within two weeks of arrival, pregnant pig Betsy delivers five dead babies after a difficult labor. It was a horrible experience.

She is extremely timid and must have intensive care for weeks. Senior potbellied pig Pearl is put in with Betty Lou as a friend to provide support during the entire ordeal.
TV station calls for feature show about Pigs Peace Sanctuary. We receive a call requesting to borrow a pig for a joke on a man's wife, we say no.
The month is cold and wet. Judy assists with consult calls regarding the rescue and care of a piglet in dire condition in Africa. The piglet survives and thrives thanks to someone caring. Judy consults with feral piglet in Hawaii. He thrives with loving care.
January 2011
Month starts with call from Animal Control three counties away. We accept young potbellied piglet from them. In one week we place him in a wonderful new home with a couple who had pig friends for years until they died as seniors. These people know the 20-year commitment that a piglet truly is.
Potbellied pig Posh to the Vet for abscess care. Potbellied pig Bradley to Vet for tusk trim.
We take advantage of a deep freeze with tractor work to turn the compost pile and have loads of gravel delivered. Typically the ground is too soft from October to May for tractor work. Our compost pile must be turned frequently.
Our dear pig friend Chester dies. We are all saddened.
We are contacted by the Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries to take seven potbellied pigs from a Montana animal sanctuary that is being shut down. All animals need to be relocated. Seven old, fat and unsocial potbellied pigs are difficult to place. We say yes and make arrangements to transport the pigs in the winter through three mountain passes. All are shy and timid, but happy to be here with green grass! One pig has limited mobility and cannot walk. Sadly she died six days after arrival in a warm bed of hay with her friends. All pigs are scheduled for veterinary care.
Sanctuary fire extinguishers serviced and certified. Our many fruit trees are pruned. Calls continue to take in pigs. We are limited in how much we can help. It is sad and frustrating.

Anyway, so the first night we went out on a date, he took me out on this boat ride, and then we took a cab back,."It absolutely was the difference between putting a bra on and remaining in, peeps.
Danny* and I also. Ended up being it a flag that is red we destroyed my phone charger? Did he hate saloons? Had been we too pushy because of the location suggestion? Iâ€ â€œchemistry check. that we couldâ€™ve prevented this flaky behavior hadâ€
â€œThe chemistry you have got from the phone will likely be much like everything you encounter in individual,â€ Anthony explained. â€œAll it will require is 3 to 5 moments to understand if you will find vibes here.â€
Now, you must know the final time we hopped in the phone with some body would be to schedule a dental practitioner appointmentâ€”and even which was pretty anxiety-inducing. Therefore calling up a random tinder match seemed like a stretch.
But Anthony guaranteed me personally that the point that is main of call ought to be to see if thereâ€™s a spark and also to keep it playful: â€œWhatever you are doing, donâ€™t enter into interview mode. Keep consitently the much much deeper concerns for whenever you choose to satisfy in person,â€ he said.
â€œThink of it as an enjoyable part of getting to understand your date by saying something such as â€˜My fingers are fed up with texting. Letâ€™s talk regarding the phone,â€™â€ states Recenello.
So hey, we figured Iâ€™d check it out since I have had absolutely nothing to loseâ€”I became currently *quite literally* losing dates, so 3 minutes in the phone wouldnâ€™t harm me. Hereâ€™s exactly exactly how it went:
Mobile Date number 1
We attempted it first with Leonardo*, whom We matched with on Bumble an ago month. I became game to generally meet he looked exactly like my typeâ€nâ€™t be back in its history to meet in the end. We proposed he phone me personally as he had enough time this week. Flash ahead to and Iâ€™m still waiting on that phone call today. Any now dayâ€ Iâ€™d call him after to solidify a planâ€”which actually felt super casual rather than forced.
We called him, palms sweaty, knees poor, arms hefty, experiencing like I became going to toss my momâ€™s spaghetti up (simply kidding) and. voicemail. Anthony didnâ€ Iâ€™m assuming he didnâ€™t mind my whispers of vocal fry from located in L.A. for too much time. We made 7 p.m. wine and pizza plans that same night.
Ordinarily whenever I meet any date that is first Iâ€â€”oops!
Mobile Date number 3
I tried this hack again with another Bumble match, Jeff*. I became in the fence with Jeff from the beginning.
I possibly couldnâ€™t think about an opening line to state to him since there wasnâ€™t any such thing on their profile that inspired a comme personallynt that is witty me personally. Then the match was extended by him, thus I literally stated â€œWow! many thanks! Hi!â€ Because Iâ€ â€ Iâ€™m planning to decide away from an IRL date, which saves me personally from being forced to put a bra on.
My Conclusions
Yes, chatting regarding the phone is chances that are awkwardâ€”and truly the only individuals you speak to in the phone are your moms and dads
if youâ€â€™ve been on in which you recognized the chemistry is not here in individual very nearly straight away? Itâ€™s a waste of everyoneâ€™s time, energy, and Sephora that is expensive foundation currently operating low on.

We’ve taken notice of RNVA as the stock has been gaining steam in both price action and volatility as well as volume over the past few sessions, after a difficult start to 2018.
That dip in share price persisted through even good news roughly a month ago, as Rennova Health Inc (OTCMKTS: RNVA) entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire a new facility; an acute care hospital in Jamestown, Tennessee. The hospital known as Tennova Healthcare – Jamestown, and its associated assets are being acquired from Community Health Systems, Inc. (NYSE: CYH). The company expects the transaction to close in the second quarter of 2018, subject to the customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions.
Tennova Healthcare – Jamestown is a fully operational 85-bed facility including a 24/7 emergency department, radiology department, surgical center, and a wound care & hyperbaric center. The purchase includes a 90,000 sq. ft. hospital building on approximately 8 acres.
“This acquisition further demonstrates our commitment to expanding Rennova’s rural hospital model to provide necessary services to patients while securing more predictable recurring revenues,” said Seamus Lagan, CEO of Rennova. “This.” (Source: Marketwired).
In other news, the company this week has announced that it has entered into an additional issuance agreement with certain existing institutional investors of the Company. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company has agreed to issue a further $2,480,000 aggregate principal amount of the September 1, 2017 Senior Secured Original Issue Discount Convertible Debentures due September 19, 2019. Gross proceeds from the Agreement are expected to be $2,000,000.
Additionally, CEO Seamus Lagan was recently featured on Uptick Newswire’s “Stock Day” podcast with Everett Jolly, where he offered comment on the recent purchases and more:
“Our hospital in Oneida is benefiting from increasing numbers of patients and billing each month since opening,” said Lagan. “The purchase of a second much larger hospital within one hour’s drive from Oneida will create opportunity for numerous efficiencies between the two facilities and allow us to further treat a large number of the patients that Oneida sends to other hospitals each month for operations and other treatments.”
We’ll continue to track RNVA’s progress with its rural healthcare facilities and other business activities, but for now our primary interest is tracking its behavior on the chart moving forward, as the stock is long overdue for a reversal of fortune. We’ll stay up on any further developments with RNVANVA stock, short or long.Asian shares looked set to open lower on Tuesday as investors shifted focus to upcoming data and bank that is central although positive developments around possible COVID-19 vaccines and increased deal task are more likely to stem losses.

Hello IC Community, PORTAL has an exciting announcement to share. For the past month, we’ve been working hard behind the scenes testing live streaming running completely on the ICP blockchain; a first of its kind! Now it’s time to share some of that hard work with the people who will make PORTAL what it truly is, you! PORTAL will be holding an alpha test later this month and we’ll need the entire community to really push it.
Refresher – What is PORTAL
PORTAL is a decentralized live streaming service on the blockchain powered by the Internet Computer. The blockchain provides us with breakthrough technology to provide a more unique live streaming service centered around the users; for both creators and viewers. Current competitors in this industry say they focus on the users first, but ultimately this gets lost in all the red tape. What you end up finding, is a curated list of content being pushed by a few people in power. A service which depends on the creativity of its users should never be handled this way. Thanks to the blockchain and tokenization, we give the power back to the users.
Alpha Test
The Alpha test will be open to all eager streamers and viewers. Running during the week of September 20th. Please follow our social media for up to date information. We want as much feedback as possible. Have a decent PC rig and familiar with OBS software? Perfect, PORTAL will support this software out of the gate. Prefer to stream in the palm of your hands? PORTAL supports streaming from your phone too. We will constantly tinker with ways to stream; however, for the alpha, these will be the main two ways. A write up on how to stream through a PC and through phones will be shared before the alpha test. If streaming isn’t your thing, but you love to watch your favorite content creators, then this alpha needs you as well. Come help us test our tokenomics.
Tokens will serve several use cases during our official launch. For the alpha, we will test how users earn tokens. Streamers will receive PORTAL tokens based on time streamed and viewers watching. Meanwhile you, the viewer, will get rewarded based on time watched and your activity in chat. By the end of the alpha, we will have a leaderboard for the most tokens earned by streamers and most tokens earned by the viewers. One winner from each side will win a prize. There will also be a 3rd prize which will go to one random participant. The third prize symbolizes PORTALS commitment to not only the most popular streamers but to every user of the platform. So even if you aren’t at the top of the leaderboard, you have a chance to win!
Prizes
So now that we know what the mission is, let’s talk about the prizes. I would like to start off with saying, the ICP community has been so helpful in extending a helping hand. We are currently talking to multiple ICP projects and people in the ICP space and they have been nothing but kind with collaborating with us. With the help of a couple projects we will be offering NFTs as prizes. NFTs are one of the cornerstones of blockchain technology and will be a big part of PORTAL. We would like to show our commitment to the NFT space by offering them as prizes for the lucky winners. It’s our way of thanking the community for helping us get PORTAL just right.
Final Thoughts
What we've shared with you here is just the tip of the iceberg for PORTAL. We have so many things to share but we believe in thoroughly testing in increments so we can deliver on our promises. The alpha test will provide just a glimpse of the features we have planned for PORTAL, but it is necessary to test these basic features to get us to where we truly want to go. We hope you are as excited about PORTAL as we are. The blockchain and decentralization has given us a new take on creator driven content. It has given the power back to the user and we cannot wait for you to harness a little bit of that power with PORTAL!

tripping on art in Ostend City
tripping on art in Ostend, prologue ~ the city
Ostend is the largest city on the Belgian Coast and its only truly year-round destination. along its wide white-sand beach is a spacious promenade surveyed by an interesting mix of midrise architecture atop cosy seafront cafes with glassed-in terraces. always an important strategic port, Ostend has a rich history of fame, fortune, famine and hardship. Ostend has a wealth of beautiful belle époque and art deco architecture scattered around its residential streets.
arty-farty.fun's opinion: *
in the "Belle Epoque", Ostend was the queen of our seaside resorts. nowerdays the city lost most of its splendour, despite its potential for resurection. but politicians in the past seemed not to understand the why or the how. long ago, our second king, Leopold II, created a glorious place to chill. today, despite all its potential, Ostend is a terminal city with a rotten thermal palace.
tripping on art in Ostend, act 1 ~ the Mu.ZEE museum
Mu.ZEE exhibits, collects, manages, digitises and studies visual arts from the 19th century to the present day. the museum affiliates its unique collection of exclusive Belgian art with the international arts sector and reveals the links between modern and contemporary art.
arty-farty.fun's opinion: **
a promise to discover Ensor and Spillaert in a museum with a nice permanent collection. sadly enough, the building is not at the level of a modern museum
tripping on art in Ostend, act 2 ~ Raoul Servais wing @ Mu.ZEE
Raoul Servais' permanent wing @ Mu.ZEE: he is called the magician of Ostend. Raoul Servais is a visual artist, designer, draughtsman and above all a film-maker. his world is akin to a cinema full of poetry and mystery, a place where stories and legends find their way through the imagined time. Servais remains close to himself and shows us the world. the heroes in his films are street lamps, sirens or moths.
arty-farty.fun's opinion: ***
Servais painted and drew, and was very active in graphics too, but from the beginning his heart was always in animation films. he developed the first animated film course in Europe. you feel his curiosity for new and hitherto unknown ways of creating imagery and atmosphere. a true star of the film industry.
tripping on art in Ostend, act 3 ~ Ensor & Spilliaert wing @ Mu.ZEE
TWO GREAT OSTEND MASTERS: James Ensor (1860–1949) grew up in a small coastal garrison town with a fishing port at its beating heart. a few decades later, Léon Spilliaert (1881-1946) was born in a fashionable seaside resort to which the beau monde came from inland to be entertained at the Casino and to stroll along the broad seafront promenade. Ostend, home to two great masters. Although Ensor and Spilliaert paintings are as different as 'night and day', both their oeuvres display a deep fascination with Ostend's light, its fishermen, its beach life and the rhythm of the sea.
arty-farty.fun's opinion: **
a promise to discover Ensor and Spillaert in a museum with a nice permanent collection. sadly enough, the building is not at the level of a modern museum, and the exhibition turned out to be rather poor in exhibiting top paintings of both their hometown painters.
tripping on art in Ostend, act 4 ~ the permanent collection @ Mu.ZEE
Since its establishment in 2008, Mu.ZEE vzw has managed the collections of the province of West Flanders important works of art from contemporary artists.
arty-farty.fun's opinion: **
the museum has a nice permanent collection. sadly enough, the building is not at the level of a modern museum.
tripping on art in Ostend, entracte ~ lunch @ brasserie Rubens
HOTEL - BRASSERIE RUBENS ~ all info @ : cozy two star family hotel with authentic brasserie, and 24 rooms with beautiful views of the marina. central location, only 10 min. from the train station, just in front of the marina and the beach.
arty-farty.fun's opinion: ****
Brasserie Rubens: a brasserie with a unique character, reviving the DNA of good ol' Ostend. their CEO & cook, Marcel Desander, see fisherman in his previous life, offers a fresh, honest kitchen in a great & original atmosphere. for a Rodenbach and great Ostend shrimp croquettes or fish & chips with real mayonnaise. trust the boss.
tripping on art in Ostend, epilogue ~ causerie with the king of Ostend ~ Herr Seele
our visit to Herr Seele in his studio, and the following "causerie" made such an impression on the arty-farty collective that we dedicated a seperate page with the integral 45' causerie with the artist.
visit the Herr Seele page
arty-farty.fun's opinion: ****
a painter artist, the Flemish godfather of the underground, together with Kamagurka. the draftsman of cowboy Henk: a picaresque surrealistic figure relating to an episodic style of fiction, dealing with the adventures of a rough and dishonest but appealing hero.Center For New Beginnings

The Tribeca Film Festival beefed up its already hefty music programming on Wednesday, announcing the addition of documentaries about R&B legend James Brown and quirky Icelandic pop princess Bjork.
The Brown film is a work in progress screening under the name “Untitled James Brown Documentary.” It is written and directed by the tireless filmmaker Alex Gibney, who has directed 10 feature films since 2010 alone, including last year’s “The Armstrong Lie” and “We Steal Secrets: The Story of WikiLeaks.”
The film’s April 27 screening will be followed by a conversation with Gibney.
See video: Chadwick Boseman Plays James Brown in Funky First Trailer for Biopic ‘Get On Up’ (Video)
The Bjork film, “Bjork: Biophilia Live” is a concert film from Nick Fenton (the editor of “Submarine” and “The Selfish Giant”) and Peter Strickland (director of “Berberian Sound Studio”), interspersed with animation from apps created by designers.
The result, according to the Tribeca release, explores “the relationship between musical structures and natural phenomena – atomic, cellular and cosmic,” which sounds about right for Bjork.
Tribeca also announced that its opening night film, the music documentary “Time Is Illmatic,” will take place at the Beacon Theatre in New York City, and will be followed by a performance by its subject, rapper Nas. Tickets will be available to the public at the festival website, beginning on March 27 for American Express cardholders, and April 1 for the general public.
This year’s festival will also include films about Alice Cooper, Bob Weir, jazz trumpeter Clark Terry and rock manager Shep Gordon, many with post-screening performances.
Its closing-night film, “Once” director John Carney‘s “Begin Again” (formerly titled “Can a Song Save Your Life?”) is also set in the world of music and features a number of original songs.

Oshiomhole had in a press briefing in Abuja accused the Dickson administration of building an Airport at N100billion with a runway that is flooded.
Dickson who conducted journalists on a facility tour of the Airport on Friday accused the leaders of the APC of being envious of the achievements of his administration.
The governor accompanied by cabinet members, traditional rulers led by the Chairman of the Traditional Ruler Council, King Alfred Diete- Spiff denied that N100billion has been spent on the Airport.
Dickson who allowed the project contractor, Dantata and Sawoe and the Managing Director of the Airport, Capt Williams Yeri to brief journalists on the technical aspect and the up to date facilities at the Airport insisted that APC is desperate to de-market the PDP led government in the state.
According to him APC as party has been ruling Nigeria with deceit and propaganda and afraid that Bayelsans seeing the achievement of the PDP led government would reject the APC at the polls on November 16 since the APC led Federal Government has not been able to build a facility like the Bayelsa Airport anywhere in the country since it came to power in 2015.
He disclosed that the total amount of money expended on the Airport project including acquisition of land and every other facility in the Airport is more than N70billion.
“I make bold to say our Airport is one of the best in the Federal Republic of Nigeria. And the cost of the Airport as at now even with the difficult terrain and with all that we have to do is about N70billion. It is not more than that yet. So I don’t know where the leaders of the APC in Bayelsa and its national chairman got their figure of N100billion from. We don’t do what they do in Edo State. The entirety of this Airport we have not spent more than N70billion. They should stop playing politics with our development. If the Federal Government of Nigeria builds an Airport in Benin City and former governor of Edo does not know what it means to construct an Airport from the scratch he should leave us alone with our woes. If any other leader of the APC from other part of our country is fortunate that the Federal Government has built Airport, Seaports and roads for them, they should leave Bayelsa and Ijaw people alone to our woes. You have seen the mischief. If they are ruling our country with propaganda and wickedness, I called on the people of Baylesa State and the Ijaw nation to know who their true enemies are and to once again reject them at the polls on the 16th of November . These are people who are experts in propaganda and deceit. This project is a project the Federal Government has not been able to execute in any part of the country. So I can see the envy on the part of APC leaders and their desperation to de-market our government”You get the right angle and that filter that gives your picture the right lighting; you even create some creative hashtag to make it pop.

In publishing book categories when selling books, up until fairly recently, anything with gay content was considered “adult material.” It didn’t have to be sexual either. It just had to be gay content of any kind. It could have been a story about two gay men falling in love and living happily ever after…no sex at all…and that would have been considered adult content not suitable for children. And still, even today, in many cases that backward idiotic mindset is still around. Even with regard to plain old-fashioned kissing. It used to be that these people were just not very sophisticated, but now I think they’re just dumb.
This is what recently happened with a Cadbury Egg advertisement.
The petition labels the egg-sharing scene as a “highly-charged sexually provocative act”, and accuses Cadbury of “selling sex to children”.
Here’s More. I think the interesting point to be made here is whether or not anyone would complain if the couple in the ad had been straight. I highly doubt anyone would have even noticed straights kissing. And why should we? We are so conditioned to this straight white world kissing is commonplace.Managing Cyber Risk and the application of Cyber Insurance
Ahead of the next meeting of the ISO Technical Committee for Information Security responsible for the development of the international standard for Cyber Insurance (27102) in Tel Aviv in April a meeting was held in London on 8th February to discuss the concerns and possible solutions as part of the Public Consultation phase of the standards development.
Those attending the session represented a diverse group of stakeholders from across the Insurance Sector and included a number of significant endusers. Ahead of this meeting over 50 other stakeholders, representing a more diverse base of stakeholders, also provided feedback on the proposal for a cyber insurance standard.
During these discussions the overwhelming majority felt that the standard was currently not appropriate and rather duplicated guidance already available in the market. Further, the consensus was that the structure of the documents did not help either the user or the insurance sector. The group also strongly felt that there was too little practical advice for users on the insurance aspects that need to be considered and how best to engage and align their operations to optimise the benefits insurance can bring.
However, as the meeting developed it become clear that there was a way forward that could, if adopted by ISO, address the concerns and provide a powerful tool for users and the insurance sector to enhance and improve the efficiency of the process, improving the value for all.
In the next week or so the UK will be submitting comments and our recommendations to ISO for consideration in Tel Aviv.
We are hopeful that the recommendations will be received positively, as they directly address the needs of the market and support the wider work of the ISO Committee responsible for Information Security.
Critically, the recommendations to be submitted also directly address the concerns of the insurance sector and have garnered strong support from those active across the sector. By altering some aspects of the scope, revising certain sections and focusing on a more evolved set of outcomes this standard could end up driving considerable growth in the sector while also improving the quality and capabilities of Cyber Risk Management.

During the spring of 1995, Lars von Trier was invited to participate in an international symposium in Paris organized by the French Ministry of Culture. The subject of the symposium was ’Le cinéma vers son deuxième siècle’. At about the same time, celebrations were underway to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of film. Although December 28, 1895 is normally regarded as the official birthday of film – the date the Lumière brothers held their first public film show in the Grand Café in Paris – the brothers had in fact shown their first film to a select audience as early as March 22, 1895.
DOGME 95. Trier usually turns down such invitations as a matter of course, but in this case, he decided to accept the offer. He saw it as an opportunity to present a number of new ideas that he had been developing along with his young colleague Thomas Vinterberg after finishing the television series The Kingdom (1994). At a public debate in the Odéon – Théatre de l’Europe on March 20, 1995, Trier stepped to the front of the stage to deliver his contribution. He started by asking permission to speak on a topic outside the ambit of the debate. He then announced that he represented the Dogma 95 group, read their manifesto aloud and after he had finished, he cast red pamphlets featuring the manifesto text into the audience. He then left the theatre. Later on, when he was contacted by journalists eager to hear more, he declared – in the style of the youth section of the Danish Communist Party – that he had the group’s permission to present the text but not to discuss it.
The dogma text is presented as a ’rescue bid’ (in a clear if unstated reference to Truffaut’s famous article from 1954 “Une certaine tendence du cinéma français”), which aims to counteract ’certain tendencies’ in modern film. Dogma 95 rejects both the bourgeois theory of auteur (i.e., the notion that the film director is the prime creator), as well as the concept of film as a work of illusion. According to the manifesto, film art can be saved by adopting two strategies: 1) by making films with directors who reject the role of artist and remain anonymous, and 2) by following 10 rules of production. The goal of the latter strategy, also known as the Vow of Chastity, is to combat predictable plots, superficial action and cosmetic technological trickery, in other words all the illusionary razzmatazz that is so dominant in film today. The purpose of the Dogma’s Ten Commandments is to show us the way to an alternative film art by promoting certain technical/aesthetic procedures, thus guaranteeing suitable resistance to conventional production processes in a number of fundamental areas.
Since that time, the rule that everything must be filmed on Academy 35mm format has been lifted (both Dogma 1, The Celebration, and Dogma 2, The Idiots, were recorded on video). Subsequently, however, it was decided that all films should be distributed on 35mm, with the rather curious postscript that the director’s name must not appear in the credits (conforming to the last stipulation of the Vow of Chastity, i.e. ’I am no longer an artist’). The latter rule is more of a self-ironic joke than anything else. The important thing is still to find artistic liberation in cinematic/technical asceticism and rebel against dominant mainstream film making (especially Hollywood) with its preoccupation with genres and special effects and its worshipping of the golden calf of commercialism. In a Dogma film, no one can hide behind special effects. The truth will out: ’My highest goal is to compel the truth from both my characters and settings.’
The Dogma manifesto, signed by Trier and Thomas Vinterberg (but mostly based on Trier’s ideas), as well as the happening in the Odéon theatre, were received as a humorous provocation, an ironic event á la Trier. But the best part of the joke was that Trier and Vinterberg were in earnest. The basis of the manifesto was that film was celebrating its 100th anniversary and that there had not been a collective, manifesto-like declaration from the film world since the 1960s. (Trier however had introduced his Europa trilogy with manifestos.) If one looks carefully at the intellectual ballast of the Dogma movement, one can clearly discern connections to a number of earlier proposals that also featured a series of rules and principles. The first practical attempt to bind film production to a series of hard and fast rules came about in the 1920s when Dziga Vertov, one of the major figures in Russian revolutionary film, during the silent period, began producing an endless stream of manifestos. In a series of short energetic texts, he wrote off all film drama as bourgeois and old-fashioned and promoted instead the sort of political, non-narrative propaganda films that he was producing himself: ’Film drama is the opium of the people. Down with the immortal kings and queens of the big screen! Long live ordinary mortals who are occupied with their normal jobs! Down with kitchen sink dramas: film us in unexpected ways just as we are,’ is how he put it in his Preliminary Guide to the Kinoglaz Circle (1926). In addition, his manifestos encouraged filmmakers to use ’fast transport, film with a high light-sensitivity, light hand-held cameras and appropriate lighting equipment’. During the post-war period, Italian neo-realism also turned its back on the Hollywood style. Instead of glamour, its devotees created a cinema based on amateur actors, authentic locations and stories based on examining the banalities of everyday life as presented in screenwriter Cesare Zavattini’s program ’Alcune idee sul cinema’ (Some Ideas on the Art of Film, 1952).
A few years later, a number of young French filmmakers began to develop their own alternative to Hollywood, in what by 1959-60 became known as ’la nouvelle vague’. This new wave – led by François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard and Claude Chabrol – never produced an independent manifesto. Nonetheless, they were heavily influenced by a famous manifesto written by Alexandre Astrucs called the ’Naissance d’une nouvelle avant-garde: La caméra-Stylo’ (The Birth of a new Avant-Garde: The Camera as Pen, 1948), in which Astrucs argued ’that film must become the most comprehensive and most accessible language imaginable’. But the practical application of New Wave techniques was in itself a declaration and broke with the previous generations’ acceptance of a literary and conformist approach to cinema. The New Wave directors created spontaneous informal films that broke with all the old conventions about editing and traditional acting. Of these, Godard’s A bout de souffle (Breathless, 1960) stands out as the central masterpiece. However, this process of rejuvenation was not confined to France. In West Germany, a group of young directors broke with tradition by publishing the so-called Oberhausen manifesto in 1962. Ironically, the 26 directors who created this manifesto (including Alexander Kluge and Edgar Reitz) would not be the ones to fully realize the concepts put forward in the document. Instead, a group of new more talented directors would emerge during the 1970s, for example, Fassbinder, Herzog and Wenders: ’This new cinema needs to develop new forms of freedom: freedom from industrial conventions and from the commercial interference of the establishment…The old cinema is dead. We believe in the new.’
BACK TO LUMIÈRE. Much of the thinking behind Dogma 95 is owes a debt to previous movements. It can be roughly described as an anti-establishment reaction (similar to Vertov, la nouvelle vague and Oberhausen), as well as an initiative to counter the ’bourgeois’ entertainment film and the superficial action film (Vertov and the Oberhausen Group). Dogma aims to pursue reality, the unembellished truth, the genuine and the real (Neo-realism, the New Wave). Dogma 95 can in fact be regarded as a kind of cinematic fundamentalism, a back-to-nature movement, an attempt to return to the cinematic innocence and simplicity of the Lumières, a time when the gardener got sprayed with water and workers simply left their factory. It is all about liberation through renunciation.
This explanation only stretches so far, however, especially when one considers the work of that other great film pioneer, Méliès. His films prove that trickery and special effects are just as original and just as fundamental a part of film art as the realism of the Lumières. But the most telling philosophical weakness in the argument is the fact that the most logical but paradoxical consequence of Dogma’s initiative to spurn technology would involve elimination of the camera itself. In other words, if we are intent on getting rid of all the technical aids which are employed to make films, why should we spare the most dominant? The camera is the object that is most contrary to the natural order! And what about the actors? Why should the locations and the props be authentic when the people – i.e., the actors – are not? No explanation is forthcoming. Since Dogma is designed to be taken as religious doctrine, a set of rules that one follows but does not question, this aspect of the argument remains teasingly hidden within Dogma 95 – because there is in fact a direct conflict between the dogmatic and the innovatory sides of the movement.
It is obvious that if the quest for a ’true’ picture of reality is carried to its conclusion, then logically not only would the actors need to be dropped, but also the entire fictional process of film making, in the spirit of Vertov, documentarism à la French cinéma vérité, the English Free Cinema and the American Direct Cinema. Alternatively, one could pursue a method similar to that employed in the television series An American Family (1973), where cameras followed the lives of a Californian family for a whole year. In other words, this would be akin to an early version of the reality show or reality soap, which was so prevalent on television during the 1990s. The Idiots owes a debt to this type of authentic reporting, which can be described as a kind of sociological documentarism focused on human behavior. One could even go so far as to compare the film’s visual style – its grainy hand-held video recordings, its lack of aesthetic quality with lamps and camera barely out of sight or occasionally on screen – with Ed Powers’ home video documentary-style sex films.
However, the whole point of Dogma 95 is not to emulate documentarism, since this would make it appear conventional rather than innovative. Dogma aims instead to challenge the conventions of the fiction film in order to create a dialectic relationship between fiction and the search for truth. In this respect, it is expressing the same tendencies evident as far back as neo-realism, a movement that also sought to banish the art of illusion and replace it with a truthful portrayal of reality within the bounds of fiction.
WHO DARES TO SPAZZ? The greatest success of Dogma 95 – and the movement really has enjoyed a surprising degree of recognition – is that it managed to force the film world to take its quasi-religious set of rules seriously as a new innovative artistic method. Not only that, it also caught the imagination of the general public. This is surprising, because there is no shortage of low-budget films which do not look much different from Dogma films. Recent Danish examples include Nicolas Winding Refn’s Pusher (1996), Anders Rønnow-Klarlund’s Den Attende (The Eighteenth, 1996) and Jonas Elmer’s Let’s get lost (1997). Not since Cassavete’s Shadows (1960) and Husbands (1970) and Jarmusch’s Stranger Than Paradise (1984), have low-budget films been considered to be groundbreaking examples of film art. Nor can one say that the public has ever expressed much interest in the technical details of low-budget movies. There cannot be too many ordinary cinema-goers who deliberately seek out a film because it has been made with a hand-held camera without the use of artificial light. Nonetheless, the dogma rules have received a lot of attention from both the public and the film industry – so much so that Zentropa has had to set up a special Dogma office to handle inquiries. A number of non-Danes have also opted to make Dogma films, e.g. Jean-Marc Barr with Lovers (1999) and Harmony Korine with Julien Donkey-Boy (1999), although without attracting any great critical success.
There have been a number of international articles and even conferences on the subject. Perhaps this is because Dogma has suggested how films can be made outside the Hollywood tradition and all its big-budget machinery. Dogma offers a new more optimistic model that is particularly relevant for small film nations and especially stimulating to young artists. In Denmark, meanwhile, the word ’dogma’ has become a part of ordinary people’s vocabulary. Apart from anything else, this has been a wonderful piece of marketing. Usually it takes an enormous amount of effort and large sums of money to establish a marketing slogan as a household word. But now, the word seems to have taken on a life of its own. We now hear debates featuring new hybrids such as dogma architecture, dogma theatre and dogma literature. One is forced to ask the question: how has Dogma managed to achieve such phenomenal success without actually offering methods that are either particularly new or original. A number of factors have contributed to this success. One of them is Trier’s standing as a pioneer in European avant-garde cinema and his undoubted ability to attract publicity. Another factor is the inherent challenge contained in the Dogma manifesto itself. It throws down the gauntlet to all filmmakers who read it, challenging them to follow the examples provided by the Dogma group. This is analogous to the typical schoolboy game of daring others to follow one’s example.
The Dogma manifesto demands aesthetic purification, as well as a production-side heavily influenced by ascetic criteria, in other words, an approach that lends itself to the making of low-budget films, even though this is never expressly stated. The Dogma movement is an invitation to play a game that has some pretty strange rules. Dogma is enjoyable in the same way that children’s games such as blindman’s buff or bobbing for apples are enjoyable. The fun is produced by restraining the participants. Dogma rules dictate that the filmmaker abandon using a large part of film’s technological arsenal. This can be compared to spending a holiday in the reconstructed Iron-age village at Lejre near Copenhagen. Try surviving a week without the modern conveniences of the last thousand years and see what happens!
Then of course there is the packaging. The whole Dogma concept has been deliberately clothed in ironic, quasi-religious imagery. Of course, the word dogma is itself a religious term and the Vow of Chastity is a clear reference to the vows taken by members of religious orders. In fact, all the ideas behind the Dogma rules are inspired by religion. Even the way it proscribes Hollywood techniques – technical miracles and trickery contra the ascetic fundamentalism of the Dogma films – is like a faint echo of the old battle between Protestant starkness and Catholic ornament.
PRODUCTION. The Dogma 95 movement is a direct result of the 1995 manifesto. Besides Trier and Vinterberg, its membership list includes: Søren Kragh-Jacobsen, best known for gentle, warm-hearted films for children and young people (including the 1981 masterpiece, Gummi Tarzan); Kristian Levring, who makes TV commercials; and documentary filmmaker Anne Wivel, who left the group soon after joining. The initial Dogma project, which included the production of four films, received personal assurances of support from the former Danish Minister of Culture, Jytte Hilden. Her ministerial high-handedness – she had sidestepped official procedures by promising Dogma funding – created opposition in the Danish Film Institute. Shortly after these promises of support, Hilden was replaced as Minister of Culture – though for other reasons – and the ministry did not feel it was duty-bound to respect any personal commitments she had made. The project, however, was saved by the Danish national broadcasting service (DR TV) and its director, Bjørn Erichsen. Without even being allowed to read the screenplays, he provided the funding the films needed in exchange for their broadcasting rights. The Idiots, which was more expensive than the other two Dogma films, cost around 14 million Danish crowns, one million of which came from the Danish Film Institute and 3.7 million from DR TV. The Dogma brethren kept in touch with each other during the next few years as their projects developed. They discussed in particular the difficulties of keeping to the strict demands laid down by the Dogma rules. Celibacy in theory and celibacy in practice are two quite different things. By 1998 however, the first two films had been completed. Certificates were issued and signed by the members of the group. They were proof that Dogma 1 (The Celebration) and Dogma 2 (The Idiots) had been ’produced in compliance with the rules and intentions set forth in the Dogma 95 Manifesto’. In 1999, Dogma 3 (Mifune) was premiered. In 2000, Dogma 4 (The King Is Alive) was released. These four films, according to rumor, were directed by Thomas Vinterberg, Lars von Trier, Søren Kragh-Jacobsen and Kristian Levring, in that order. Of course, in keeping with the tenets of the Vow of Chastity, the directors have never been specified.
DOGMA 1: THE CELEBRATION. Already as a very young man Vinterberg showed remarkable talent and sensitivity with films such as Sidste Omgang (Last Round) from 1993, Drengen der gik baglæns (The Boy who Walked Backwards, 1994) as well as, to a lesser degree, his first feature-length film De største helte (The Greatest Heroes, 1996). Vinterberg proved that he was able to adapt and develop what has been called the Danish realist tradition. All the same, The Celebration was such a huge and unexpected success that it must have come as rather a shock for the young filmmaker. After winning at Cannes, accolades have rained down on the young director. In Danish film, which has not always enjoyed so much success abroad, a period of soul-searching usually follows the big flops, when everyone asks what went wrong. In the case of The Celebration, one has to ask, what on earth was it that went so right. The answer must have something to do with the film’s unique combination of plot, casting and virtuoso cinematography. The story is about a son’s unmasking of his demonic father at a birthday celebration in his honor. It is told as a classic Aristotelian drama with strict observance of the unity of time, place and action, producing a powerful cinematic experience. The film is in fact based on an allegedly true story stemming from a radio broadcast in 1996. A young man suffering from AIDS had told guests in a speech he made at his father’s birthday party how his father has sexually abused both him and his twin sister when they were children (the sister had later committed suicide). The film starts with the main character wandering down a country road. It is summertime and the Danish landscape looks idyllic. But then the celebration starts. Of course, the screenplay could have been written as a classical piece of theatrical film art. Even though the subject matter – a family dispute – lends itself to theatrical treatment in the tradition of Swedish playwrights such as Strindberg and Norén, Vinterberg does not take this approach. Instead, we are treated to a continuous flow of visual imagery created by the inquiring, all-intrusive camera; a camera which tirelessly peels back all the hypocrisy to reveal the family’s terrible secret. In accordance with the tenets of Dogma 95, the truth is finally revealed despite all the obstacles. In this respect, the film’s cinematographic form matches the narrative project. It is also worth mentioning the performance of the actors: they are given the opportunity to ’become’ their characters to a degree which normal film making usually prevents. At the end of the day, it is really the actors’ film. They all shine as Natural Born Actors under the indiscernible control of their anonymous director.
DOGMA 2: THE IDIOTS. Dogma 95 acknowledges its connection to the French New Wave, even though it criticizes the faults of the French movement in its attempts to revolutionize film at the beginning of the 1960s. One of the favorite themes of the French New Wave was the examination of individuals – or often a group – who have set themselves apart from normal middle-class conventions. This applies to Godard’s anarchistic anti-hero in A bout de souffle, and it applies to the unconventional love affair in Une femme est une femme (1961) and in Bande à part (1964), and it also encompasses – with an increasing political awareness – the couple in Pierrot le fou (1965). This theme is also apparent in Truffaut’s film oeuvre, regarding the gang of young boys in his short film Les mistons (1957), the two boys who skip school in Les quatre cents coups (1959), and the menage à trois in Jules et Jim (1961). As for Chabrol, this theme appears with the young people in Les cousins (1959) and Les bonnes femmes (1960). This is pretty close to the theme that The Idiots has returned to, i.e. an anarchistic gang of bums who run around, play games and experiment more or less for the fun of it. The Idiots is an experiment about people’s need for freedom and restrictions. Although the film is bound by the tenets of the Dogma rules, the same rules release it from the conventions of normal film making.. The aesthetic methodology is reflected in the plot, which includes a parallel experiment with social norms. The game the ’Idiots’ play is both anarchistic and rule-bound. They abandon their own normality, but only in accordance with established rules. Once the old order has been eliminated, the new order begins to appear. In this respect, The Idiots has become the prototypical Dogma film. In The Celebration the Dogma technique is primarily a way to expand the actors’ range through the use of a continuous flow of imagery. In Kragh-Jacobsen’s Mifune, an energetic, moving story about the triumph of love, the Dogma technique is employed to liberate both the actors and the director. Dogma encourages the director to concentrate on the story and gives the actors a greater opportunity to develop their roles. The same could also be said about Levring’s The King Is Alive, which is about a bunch of tourists trapped in the Kalahari Desert, who spend their time rehearsing Shakespeare’s King Lear while waiting for rescue or death. This film, incidentally, facilitated the director’s return to film after a long career making commercials. It is only in The Idiots that we find consistency between the technical and the aesthetic basis of the film. The Idiots is the only film that has taken up the Dogma challenge. Does the teacher dare to spazz out in the art class? Does the returned wife dare to spazz out in the family home? Does Trier dare to spazz out with the language of film? In The Idiots, the group attempts to reach back to their original state, back to the original idiot that lies in all of us, just as Trier is attempting to rediscover film’s original art form. When the film explores and transgresses middle-class conventions regarding nudity and sex, it is an indicative expression of this theme. This matches the film’s transgression of norms and conventions regarding the art of film making itself.
Trier commented on this sense of doubleness in his diary, complaining about ’those damn Dogma rules’, while gushing enthusiastically: ’Hold on, you do this shit, you can set these things free. You can damn well do it.’ This is also the key to understanding the importance of the hand-held camera. Since the 1960s, the hand-held camera – as a stylistic feature – has usually been confined either to expressing intense feeling in a character (subjective camera) or to reporting demonstrations or rioting (political documentarism). In Dogma films, its role has been expanded to become an all-intrusive tool, untiringly seeking out the truth, which despite all the odds must be revealed. This is in accordance with the vows taken by the members of Dogma and The Celebration is the best example of this method. However, it is also used to mark a conscious abandonment of formalist control over the image and image composition (framing). Instead, the camera can be pointed directly at the action itself, the characters’ interactions and the location (The Idiots). ’Composition – that’s when you are interested in the framing of the images, but if all you do is point the camera, this means you are interested in the content. (…) When you compose a picture, this usually means you want to take control. But if you are able to forget this for a second and try to work yourself into the image and figure out what’s going on in the center of it, then you should be able to sense where the action is and point directly at it…’
However, it is important to bear in mind that although Dogma shares ideas with a number of earlier movements and initiatives, and represents a turning point of sorts in Trier’s own production, it is primarily rooted in Trier’s own work. His previous films were also made under sets of rules – especially internal ones – and he has produced a number of manifestos, some more cryptic than others. As far back as Epidemic, Trier has experimented with his own brand of cinematic ascetics, dictated by the ascetics of a tight budget. (Epidemic is also an early example of Trier’s attempt to wrest control over the entire process of filmmaking: he was director, writer, actor and photographer.) The film was also shot on authentic locations by the director himself. It is worth mentioning too the bizarre restrictions that applied to the making of Dimension and the theatre performance called Verdensuret (The World Clock). In The Kingdom, Trier discarded lighting and conventional editing in most scenes to simplify film production. He filmed Breaking the Waves with hand-held cameras and there were occasional blurred images even though it was a major international production. With The Idiots, these stylistic features became elevated to the status of dogma under the auspices of the Vow of Chastity. These restrictions have also marked the Dogma brethren’s single collective project, D dag (D Day, 2000). Furthermore, this stylistic influence is also apparent in Dancer in the Dark (2000). Even though it is definitely not a Dogma film and breaks nearly all the Dogma rules, Dogma is everywhere apparent in the intense acting and the use of hand-held cameras, two of Dogma’s chief stylistic characteristics.
The development of Trier’s work can be regarded as the development of cinematic expression via artistic and technical liberation. It corresponds to his efforts to demystify film production for ordinary people (initiatives such as Film Town, armybase.com and 101 StormTroopers). In contrast to his image as an egocentric loner in Danish cinema, Trier has also become a personality who generously inspires others and rallies other artists to a cause.
IDIOCY AND CONTROL. Thematically, The Idiots can be divided into two dominant tendencies, a satirical tendency and a sentimental tendency. The satirical tendency is expressed in the racy comedy that, in true classical fashion, makes fun of the hypocrisy and snobbery of the middle-class. The sentimental tendency is apparent in the romantic premise that there is such a thing as positive primitiveness – to which ’idiots’ and sensitive women seem to have affinity. The most attractive qualities of The Idiots are its boldness, energy and cheekiness, which combine to give the project the form of a personal statement. The mature Trier has returned to the Danish suburb (Lyngby) of his youth, without losing any of his anarchism or his satirical thirst for revenge. Just as the film reminds us of the social and political experiments of the 1970s, it can also be seen as Trier’s ironical return to the persona of his youth. The decadent pathos of the earlier period has been replaced by artistic maturity but – as the diary reveals – the lonely and tortured youth has not disappeared: ’And there’s some game or other that little Lars from some class or other has staged, and it won’t ever come to anything because deep deep deep down you know that you are one hundred and ninety thousand per cent lonely in your own itsy-bitsy, stupid, idiotic, humiliating world.’
Trier regards The Idiots as ’the truest and most genuine thing (he has) made’. The film also flirts ironically with documentarism with its documentary style interviews of the characters that are included in the narrative. ’It is wonderful how the Dogma rules have managed to chuck out aesthetics,’ comments Trier at one point, but he also remarks that aesthetic considerations return more or less automatically. This paradoxical situation also applies to artistic control. Trier has described Dogma 95 and The Idiots as an attempt to relinquish control. Nevertheless, artistic control is an unavoidable factor in Trier’s universe. In effect however, despite all its apparently improvised scenes and camerawork – much of which resembles out-takes from a home movie – the film is, at heart, just as formalistic as Europa, where every shot was planned down to the last detail. If this proves anything, it is that Trier cannot completely break free of his own nature. Trier apparently acknowledges this fact himself when he writes in his diary that: ’It is of course a film that is not nearly as calculated as ’Breaking’ but nonetheless much, much, much more calculated.’
The screenplay was written before filming started. Hardly any of the improvised scenes made it into the final film and Trier personally carried out 90 per cent of the video filming. All this despite the fact that Dogma’s tough restrictions emanated from Trier himself. In the end, artistic control was never relinquished, regardless of whether the ‘official’ director was Lars von Trier or a person not credited at all.
DOGMA 3: MIFUNE’S LAST SONG. In the diary he kept while making The Idiots, Trier speculated that Søren Kragh-Jacobsen would be the one who had the hardest time ’swallowing the whole concept.’ The strange thing is that without diverging from the Dogma restrictions, Søren Kragh-Jacobsen has managed to make a film that is unmistakably his own work. Mifune is his second film for adults and resembles in many ways his first, Isfugle (Kingfishers, 1983). Between these two films, he has made some of the best (including the best) Danish films for children and young people, i.e. Gummi Tarzan (Rubber Tarzan, 1981), Skyggen af Emma (Emma’s Shadow, 1988), and Drengene fra Sankt Petri (The Boys of St. Peter’s, 1991). Mifune’s two brothers, the city slicker (Anders W. Berthelsen) and his retarded brother (Jesper Asholt), closely resemble the odd couple in Kingfisher, i.e. a smart guy and a dumb guy. Kingfisher was a beautiful film, which – along with films such as Malmros’ Aarhus trilogy with Kundskabens Træ (The Tree of Knowledge, 1981) as the main work; Bille August’s Honning Måne (Honey Moon, 1978) and Maj (May, 1982); and Morten Arnfred’s Mig og Charly (Me and Charly, 1978) and Johnny Larsen (1979) – represents the core of the sensitive humanistic cinema which has characterized Danish cinema since the 1970s. These films are full of morose Danish characters suffering from a sort of all-pervasive sense of doom and despair. The cinematography is meticulous, the colors are muted, and the acting is very low key. Today’s films call for more vitality and Mifune certainly delivers this. In terms of its plot, it includes, oddly enough, many of the same elements as The Celebration and The Idiots. Like them, it has a prodigal son returning to his father’s house, where a variety of skeletons can be heard rattling in the cupboard. The film even features a genuine idiot as well as a female figure of redemption. Just like in the old days, female contact is still considered to provide resolution to male obsessions. Fortunately, some sort of equality exists today. The woman too has her traumas and they also need to be resolved. In this case, mutual redemption is the solution for both characters and this makes for excellent melodrama. And Mifune is an unashamedly melodramatic film. The film’s main location, on the island of Lolland, represents in many ways a perverse caricature of the idealized Danish farm immortalized in the books of Morten Korch (1876-1954). Korch was a popular writer whose novels, which were set in the Danish countryside, were turned into a number of successful films. For many, his books represent all that is worst in popular taste. Interestingly enough, Trier was executive producer for a tongue-in-cheek TV series based on these sentimental stories (Morten Korch, 1999-2000).
Nevertheless, Kragh-Jacobsen’s treatment of Korch’s typical rural settings is not especially sarcastic. And Mifune ends up trumpeting a number of good old-fashioned truisms, i.e. that city life is false and unfulfilling, orgasms are scary and a little impersonal, and of course the oldest chestnut of them all, that happiness comes from a commitment to the family, the land, true love and maintaining the family farm.
It is interesting that the Dogma method can also produce a film that is so traditional. There is, of course, nothing in Dogma 95 that actually insists on a shaky picture. The hand-held camera may just as easily be held by someone who has arms as steady as a rock. This is the general impression one gets from Mifune. The cinematography is beautiful, almost classical. The influence of Dogma rules are only apparent in the occasional high-contrast shot, where the lack of adequate lighting has made itself felt. All the same, it seems as if Dogma has forced Kragh-Jacobsen to abandon his tendency to produce pretty pictures and play it safe. In Mifune, the diabolical is given free rein and naked emotion is center stage.
D DAY. The original plan was that Thomas Vinterberg would make a film about life in Denmark with Bo Erhardt from Nimbus as producer. Trier was persuaded to join the project and it developed into a joint TV production called D dag (D Day 2000), aimed at marking the new millennium and involving all the Dogma brethren. It was Trier’s idea to turn it into a kind of TV play in real life, broadcast live with actors directed via earpieces. Vinterberg thought up the idea of creating an interactive film, which allowed the audience to zap between the different narrative threads as presented by the announcer. As the public were told, the film ’tells the story of four people who meet up at the dawn of the new millennium to carry out a plan they have worked on. This is where you come into the picture. If you have a remote control you can produce your own film. This is what you have to do: You can follow each of these characters on their own channel (…), so you can decide yourself what you would like to watch and when. One thing is certain: no one will watch exactly the same film.’
All four interconnected films were recorded and directed live on New Year’s Eve (between 11:05 pm and 12:15 am). The four Dogma members were located in the control room (Kragh-Jacobsen, Vinterberg, Levring in Tivoli, Trier in the Open Film Town), each directing their own main character/actor and film crew by remote control as they made their way around downtown Copenhagen on the last night of the millennium. Even though the screenplay was sketchy and the dress rehearsal had been a disaster, the actors bravely threw themselves into the project, which they played as part improvisation, part party game. Each main character represented a narrative string (and one long unedited shot), which was woven together to create a single story about a bank heist. Thomas Vinterberg directed the part about the neurotic explosives expert, Niels-Henning (Nikolaj Kopernikus). Lars von Trier was responsible for the storyline centered on the vengeful wife, Lise (Charlotte Sachs Bostrup), who joins the heist to uncover her husband’s infidelity (the husband is played by Stellan Skarsgård). Søren Kragh-Jacobsen followed the banker, Boris (Dejan Cukic), whose pushy friend (Jesper Asholt) ends up with all the money. Finally, Kristian Levring directed Niels-Henning’s friend Carl (Bjarne Henriksen), who has to send his girlfriend (Helle Dolleris) away as well as calm down a potential suicide victim. The four films – each of which lasts 70 minutes after minimal editing – were broadcast during prime time by seven different Danish channels on January 1, 2000. The distribution was as follows: Kragh-Jacobsen on DR1, Vinterberg on TV2, Levring on TV3 and Trier hidden away on the low-budget channel, TvDanmark 1. In addition, all four films appeared in split-screen format on TV3+. Two further channels, DR2 and TvDanmark 2, showed footage from the control room filmed by Jesper Jargil, who was responsible for video recording the project from start to finish. Trier would have preferred a technique that allowed more improvisation. He visualized something like an experimental puppet show, where the directors – like a team of multi-players in a computer café – could compete against each other and the puppets could turn against their masters. However, a more organized system was chosen, which meant that most scenes were pre-arranged. Nonetheless, there were a number of unexpected developments during filming, including Bjarne Henriksen’s decision to chain Charlotte Sachs Bostrup to a filing cabinet during the bank raid. After several desperate orders (not least from the director, Levring), she was released. It was not in the screenplay and would have undermined another part of the story, as Sachs Bostrup was scheduled to play a big confrontational scene with Stellan Skarsgård only a few minutes later at another address. This episode suggested how chaotic things could get if the ’puppets’ really decided to revolt. There were also technical and communication glitches. Trier was unable to inform Sachs Bostrup that she was to slap her sister for instance. The sister escaped unscathed and this made it more difficult for the audience to make any sense out of the mysterious letter ’D’ in the calendar (the sister’s name was Dorte, but this is mentioned nowhere in the film).
COMPLEMENTARITY. There a number of earlier examples of such a complimentary narrative in the history of fiction, where a narrative is split into different points of view that the reader/viewer must sort out in order to produce a complete story. In literature, there is Lawrence Durrell’s The Alexandria Quartet (1957-60) and Jan Kjærstad’s trilogy about Jonas Wergeland, which starts with Forføreren (The Seducer, 1993). In the theatre, Alan Ayckbourn’s The Norman Conquests (1973, TV-version 1977), offers another good example. It is also a trilogy and explores the story of a disastrous family weekend from the point of view of the people in the dining room, the living room and the garden. In cinema, there is André Cayatte’s La vie conjugale (1963), which tells the story of a marriage from the point of view of the two spouses. This is also the case in Warris Hussein’s two TV films, Divorce His/Divorce Hers (1973), which present a divorce from each partner’s point of view. The actors, Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, probably did not have to do much background research. However, all the examples mentioned so far concern the filming of alternative variations of a story that the viewer can compare and eventually combine. This also holds true for Kurosawa’s classic Rashomon (1950), which presents four different and conflicting versions of a story. Since then, other attempts have been made i.e. Kieslowski’s Przypadek (1987), Peter Howitt’s Sliding Doors (1998), and Tom Tykwer’s Lola rennt (Run Lola Run, 1998). Each of these films presents several hypothetical variations of a storyline.
The advent of interactivity, however, produced a revolutionary change in complementarity. Now the audience can also participate. The first film to use this new technique was a German production called Mörderische Entscheidung (Murderous Decision, 1991), a sensational crime thriller by Oliver Hirschbiegel. It took the form of two parallel TV movies, one of which told the female lead’s story while the other concentrated on the male lead’s narrative. The two TV movies were broadcast simultaneously on two German channels, ARD and ZDF, allowing the viewer to skip back and forth between the two: ’Umschalten erwünscht’ or ’Skip channel?’ as the subtitle put it. Similar developments have occurred in other media. Julio Cortázar’s 1963 novel Rayuela is a noteworthy forerunner. It advises readers to read the chapters in two different sequences. Then there is Svend Åge Madsen’s Tilføjelser (Appendices, 1967), a novel consisting of a cassette tape and five small volumes, which the reader can arrange and combine at will. Besides this, there are also previous experiments mentioned earlier in this article i.e. John Krizanc’s play Tamara and Trier’s own theatrical experiment Verdensuret.
THE PROBLEM OF INTERACTIVITY. Around 1.5 million Danes watched D dag, putting it on a par with other big successes in Danish television. On the other hand, there were no real alternatives to the film during the 70 minutes it was aired. There was no shortage of pre-publicity either. Trier’s film crew was met by a crowd in Copenhagen’s Central Station chanting ’Dogma film! Dogma film!’ But, the general feeling afterwards was that the experiment had been more of a curiosity than a success. Some of the problems had to do with the films’ technical and aesthetic construction. There were too many long boring shots of empty streets and too many scenes where nothing much happened. For instance, people were shown running back and forth beside the bank without any apparent motivation. Gaps between the entertaining scenes were simply too long. However, there were a number of watchable scenes, e.g. when Kopernikus enters the hotel room just as a couple are trying to produce a baby or when Bjarne Henriksen, after being informed that Mr. Trier is not to be disturbed, has comical problems with the man who has decided to kill himself unless Bjarne can immediately find him a woman. And Tommy Kenter is good as the unhappy drunk who has lost hope of getting laid on New Year’s Eve. The most effective scene was Trier’s closing scene, but then again it had been carefully worked out beforehand in the screenplay.
The main problem however had to do with the use of interactivity as an artistic method. Viewers can only watch one thing at a time and that choice limits their enjoyment of the rest. When you choose to see one scene, you are simultaneously opting out of watching three others without really knowing what it is you are missing. You cannot judge what is significant and what is irrelevant. And this is fatal because the whole drama is based on a strict chronological order of events, that makes all choices definitive (unless of course you tape all four movies and review them later). If Hamlet were narrated in this way, you might easily miss out on the ghost scene and end up watching Ophelia filing her nails instead. One possible defense of the method would be to point out how much it resembles the way events occur in real life. In the real world, we usually make choices for keeps and we often have to make decisions without knowledge of any alternatives or even knowing what the consequences might be. In real life, decisions are often repented (divorce figures testify to that), but no one has yet found a way to turn the clock back and relive events. That is how reality is put together, but art does not have to confine itself to reflecting this. One of the chief attractions of fiction is that it allows us to experience continuity and significance liberated from the trivialities, the tedium and the bad choices of real life. There is a significant difference between choices made in the real world and choices in the world of art. Perhaps D dag indicated that interactivity is little more than a cinematic dead end, but it was an interesting experiment and one that explored the use of new production methods. With Dimension, Trier shot the slowest recording in film history (approx. 90 minutes in 30 years). In contrast, D dag must hold the record for the fastest film ever made, i.e. roughly four and a half hours of low-budget TV, which – thanks to new logistic, administrative and technical methods – was broadcast live for 70 minutes.
Dogma 95 started as a Trier extravaganza, an ironic experiment aimed at being a sort of glorious spoof. Then, thanks to their innovative and stimulating approach to cinema, the first Danish Dogma films began to achieve success – way beyond initial expectations. Trier’s spoof was suddenly reassessed as a trailblazing new concept in film art. Its new goal was to explore new creative possibilities based on a method built upon tough technical restrictions, the liberation found in arbitrariness, and most of all the demystification of the cinematic process itself. This was not intended to apply only to Trier’s own personal methods, but was regarded as a contribution to the community of filmmakers across the globe. Dogma became a movement of liberation – with all the artfulness that implies!

The short answer is probably that the shop can’t operate and perhaps with this in mind German supermarket giant Rewe has just revealed one of its ‘City’ stores in Cologne that allows shoppers to shop ‘seamlessly’ or to head for a checkout: the store offer both options.
As such, this is a hybrid store and could well be the way of the future. It also means that this is a store that is not just about early adopters, offering something for, more-or-less, all comers. Convenience retail continues to be one of the hotspots as far as developing new ways of shopping is concerned and others will be watching this one closely.

Speed is one thing that will come along with the new netbooks that will ship with the all new Intel Cedar Trail silicon.
More precisely, there will be an 18 percent better overall performance, including a two-fold increase in graphics speed while maintaining long battery life, according to Intel.
As you know, high-end productivity has not really been the USP (Unique Selling Point) of netbooks. They are known for power efficiency, not speed or the ability to support tasks like photo editing or demanding games. Windows 7 based Netbooks that are priced below $400 generally come with 10-inch screens, weigh under three pounds, and boast up to ten hours of battery life.
But despite all the pros, market demand for netbooks is on a downward slope, at least in the US, much because of Apple’s iPad and of course the latest Kindle Fire from Amazon.
These tablets, iPad in particular, offer a solid Web browsing and media consumption experience. So customers do not need a netbook when something smaller does the job even better.
Although there is a decline in netbook sales in the U.S., Western Europe, and Japan, the netbook is gaining traction in emerging countries, according to Mark Miller, a marketing executive for netbook processors at Intel. He added that there is a long-term sustainable business driven primarily by these emerging markets.
Hewlett-Packard, Asus, Lenovo, Samsung, and Toshiba are all slated to ship new netbook models in January or early next year. We are trying to show that netbooks have pockets of interest and momentum, Miller said.
Intel has more in store, including a single core Medfield chip for Android tablets and smartphones, plus Clovertrail, which according to Miller is a vehicle for Windows 8 tablets and hybrids.Over the years, our client base has changed to be broader in scope which has brought along equally diverse demands for special claims handling to meet individual needs - a challenge that our members understand, accept and have easily adapted to.

World’s largest gold specimen discovered – Holtermann Specimen
“The story of the Hill End-Tambaroora Goldfield is one of triumph and tragedy, of sudden riches and grinding poverty, of humour and sadness, of hopes deferred and the realisation of dreams. It is one of selfless service and grasping avarice, with much that is sordid and much that is splendid in human nature, coming to the surface in 1872 when the fame of Hill End’s gold-encrusted reefs extended throughout the world…”
- Harry Hodge, The Hill End Story
The historic village of Hill End and the surrounding region has a history as rich as the gold that was first discovered there over 150 years ago. The 19th century gold rush saw Hill End, and the nearby Tambaroora, boom.
Alluvial gold was first discovered in Tambaroora (5 km north of present-day Hill End) in 1851, and there were 150 miners on the site within a month. The first stamper battery in Australia was set up around 1856 by the ‘Old Company’ which employed Cornish equipment and miners. This stamper battery was located near the township of Tambaroora, reinforcing Tambaroora’s position as the major gold settlement. By the early 1860s it had a population of some 2000 people, and Hill End’s boom was yet to follow.
In 1872 photographer Beaufoy Merlin was commissioned by wealthy mine owner, Bernard Holtermann, to photograph Hill End at the peak of its prosperity. The ‘Holtermann Collection’ of some 637 images is held by the State Library of NSW;, (from ‘select a collection’ choose ‘Holtermann Collection’ and then type in ‘Hill End’). Merlin’s works can also be found on signs located throughout the village itself.

It uses a new technique I developed for projects using woolfelt and felted wool.
I call it a making a "Wool Smoothie" The (almost) free pattern is a modern table runner pattern and you can find the link for the download below.If you work with woolfelt or felted wool, you know that the seams can be quite bulky due to the thickness of the material. While that is not always an issue, it can be at times.
Now there is a fun and easy way around that.
By using my Whisperlite tracer/foundation as an ultra lightweight base you can "seam" the wool without the bulk. Whisperlite is NOT a fusible product. Ask your local quilt shop if they have it. If not, you can order it with this link, or this link. It's 42" wide and is sold by the yard. You'll love it.
This (almost) free pattern is for a modern table runner and you can go here to download the PDF pattern.
Here are the basics of the Wool Smoothie™ technique.Cut a piece of Whisperlite 1" larger than the finished project size.
With a #2 pencil, draw a line 1/2" from the edge on all four sides.
Tape the Whisperlite to a flat work surface. * A cutting mat, or cardboard is great. If using a table with a finished surface protect it with cardboard first.
Using quilter's basting spray (DO NOT use spray adhesive) and working in a well ventilated area with newspaper protecting your work surface, spray one side of the wool piece.
Place the spray basted wool pieces onto the Whisperlite foundation as directed in the pattern instructions. Hand press in place. Add several pieces at a time and make sure they are tight up against each other with no spacing inbetween. Make sure you have it lined up properly.
After applying about 1/3 of the pieces allow to dry about 10-15 minutes.
Now either by hand, or machine, stitch along the seams with decorative stitches, such as a fly stitch, a ladder stitch, or any bridging stitch that jumps back and forth between the two pieces. If you are stitching by hand the whisperlite is super easy to stitch through. Of course it's no problem by machine either. The Whisperlite stabilizes the seamless seams without adding bulk or stiffness. How great is that!
Continue adding pieces and stitching them in place. TA-DA.... Now you have a nice flat, smooth woolfelt table runner, or placemat, or candle mat, etc. because you don't have lumpy, bumpy seams.
The Wool Smoothie™ technique is also great for crazy quilting, and for making miniature wool quilts too.
In fact, I'll be sharing more free projects using this technique soon.
I hope you have fun making your Wool Smoothie™ modern table runner.
Stitch on....stay happy
LindaHello beautiful family & friends!
I wanted to send you some pictures of the newest addition to our family! Asher Benjamin Testa, born yesterday (March 23rd, his actual due date) at 20,25 after about 3-1/2 hours of labor, is sleeping peacefully. In fact, he was born sleeping peacefully. In fact, we don't know if he does anything else other than sleeping peacefully. He is pure joy.
The name Asher actually means joy & fortress. We chose the names Asher and Gioia (italian for joy) because many of you while praying over our child prayed that he/she would be a joy for us. We took that as something special from the Spirit to our hearts. Nehemiah 8.10 has become a prayer for us and for Ash, "the joy of the Lord is your strength." Please pray that Asher would be a reminder to us and to the world as to just how much raw strength comes from focusing on Jesus as our primary source of joy!
To all who prayed for Mommy & Ash, we truly want to thank you. We had asked to be able to give birth at home, during the day, with the kids present, quickly and with minimal pain & tearing, to be able to testify to the nurses (we had a chance to share our testimony & the gospel with them), that mom would regain her strength quickly and that we could do it while Nikki's mom, who is visiting, was present. God answered each of these prayers categorically. Siena and Sammy went to bed at 19,30 and then reemerged after the birth from their room. They really wanted to meet there new sibling. They were a little confused, they desired a "baby girl" and since baby girls don't have "pee pee's," as Samurai says, they think we may have gotten the wrong kid.
Please continue to pray for Nik! She is healing nicely. This home birth was truly remarkable. She had tremendous care from Giovanna and Lorella, our obgyn nurses. Additionally, she had about 3 or so strong contractions after her water broke while on the toilet, and then began to push while on the bidet. After just two pushes, out came the head, I almost missed it as I was sending you all a brief request for prayer!
Enjoy these pictures. We will upload these pictures to Anthony's facebook account in case you would like larger ones.
Much grace, love & peace,
Anthony, Nikki, Siena, Sammy & AshCreate binge-worthy content to help learners master their skills.

***
Eugenia Sheppard, writing in the New York Herald Tribune, in November 1951 called Simonetta the "youngest, liveliest member of the up and coming Italian Couture,"commending the breadth of her collection from a two-part playsuit with cummerbund and bloomer shorts to a silk shantung dress-suit with tiered collar to her short and long eveningwear. By 1951, with ardent advocacy from American Vogue and Bergdorf Goodman, Simonetta was one of the best-known names in America for the new Italian postwar fashion.
Simonetta had presented her first collection in Rome in 1946, two years after her marriage to Count Galaezzo Visconti and a year before the birth of their daughter, Verde. An aristocrat, Simonetta had been interned by the Mussolini government for antifascist activities. The further pluckiness of starting up her couture business so immediately after the war was a sign of Simonetta's dauntless determination. A press release for her 1946 collection read in part: ." It was a humble beginning for an aristocrat dreaming of a high style.
But Simonetta was not alone. Other aristocratic Italian couturiers joined her, including her future second husband, Alberto Fabiani, as well as Roberto Capucci, Marquis Emilio Pucci, Princess Marcella Borghese, Federico Forquet, Ognibene and Zendman. They turned the attention of the international fashion world away from Paris, where they had been rebuffed, to Rome, with their elegant yet comfortable ensembles, created from new and innovative textiles and set in striking color combinations. The glamor of a politically correct aristocrat improvising an Italian postwar renaissance was of hypnotic charm to the American market. Moreover, Simonetta's youthful style held a special appeal, especially in the buoyant silk cocktail dresses, elegant debutante dresses, and ball gowns she created in the 1950s, with their emphasis on the bust.
Equally popular were the daywear and sportswear lines, as well as Simonetta's coats, with the coats in particular providing a favored inspiration for Seventh Avenue copying. She could rival Balanciaga in creating coats and suits made in robust materials, cut with precision and minimal detailing to draw attention to one salient feature. Like Balenciaga, she favored capelike sleeve treatments that gave the coats a dramatic sense of volume, especially in photographs. Further, she shared with Balenciaga a preference for the seven-eighths sleeve in coats, allowing for the display of gloves and jewelry. For the American market, these popular attributes constituted an idea of ease and mobility, but they also lent themselves to facile imitation and copying.
Famed Italian filmmaker Federico Fellini helped the fledgling Italian designers by making their clothing visible in his La Dolce Vita (1960), and other films, like Joseph Mankiewicz's Barefoot Contessa (1954), also featured Italian style. Suddenly, Simonetta, Fabiani, Pucci, Armani, Jole Veneziani, Marucelli, and Emilio Schubert were enjoying international attention, though France still snubbed these Italians. In fact, in 1962, when Simonetta and Fabiani moved to Paris and established Simonetta et Fabiani, the enterprise was less successful. But for a time, Rome was a locus of fashion.
Simonetta's distinguished international clientéle included the likes of Audrey Hepburn, Clare Booth Luce, Eleanor Lambert, Lauren Bacall, and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. As Aurora Fiorentini Capitani and Stefania Ricci observed in the Sala Bianca (Milan, 1992), "The collections by Simonetta were invariably met with success, in terms of the public and in terms of sales, because they translated the image of a naturally chic woman, with essential lines, elevated by one simple feature, a knot or a raised neck, and corresponded in every way to the personality of the Roman designer."
Modern Italian designers have paid homage to Simonetta and her husband, describing the two of them, along with the Fontana sisters,
Simonetta was often photographed in her clothing and served in some ways as her own best model. She lived the life Americans dreamed of as portrayed in such movies as William Wyler's Roman Holiday (1953). If Simonetta was the ideal model for her clothing in the 1940s and 1950s, exemplifying practicality and young elegance, and a famous designer of clothing in the 1950s and 1960s, she later epitomized another cultural transformation as she forsook fashion to devote herself to philanthropy and spirituality, working with lepers in India in the 1970s and 1980s. Eventually, she moved to the Himalayas, where she studied Eastern spirituality and mysticism. In the 1990s, she returned to Rome, interested in reviewing and collecting her fashion work for a museum, and her works influenced those of future designers like Anna Municchi.
Simonetta's life seems to have been, more than most, culturally keyed. If it was in any way a destiny granted with privilege, it was also a destiny seized. Her fashion recognized the possibility of renewed elegance in postwar Italian and American life as well as the practicality of designing for distinctly modern women.

Bonnie Wyper, New York 1/18/08Hey there Flatwoods family,
I pray your week has been filled with the realization that God is in charge no matter the circumstance. Not only is He in charge, but he is a good Father! His love is a firm foundation and we can put our trust in Him knowing that he will never be shaken.
Last Sunday was so good! I am thankful for our worship team and Justin Cook who leads our church each week to make high the name of Jesus. Our worship gatherings are a weekly reminder of who God is, what he has done, and what he has called us to.
Continuing in our series WE ARE FLATWOODS, we tackled almost two topics in one sermon. First, we looked at who we are as Flatwoods. It is my desire for us to have a statement we can hang our hat on, and live by.
Here is that statement…
I truly believe Stone County needs Jesus more than any other need. I truly believe Jesus is the answer to life transformation, and his story reshapes our story. Pray with me that Stone County will be transformed by Jesus as we gather and scattered for His name and His glory.
We then tackled our first essential element, We Gather. It is my prayer that we will continue to be a really good gathered church. That means when we gather we must always be Christ-centered. As Colossians 3:17 makes clear, “And whatever you do, in word or did, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.” We are for His name, His glory, and His renown.
May God be gracious to us and bless us, and cause His face to shine on us, that your way may be known on earth, your salvation among that nations!
Grace be with you,
Jonathan Johnson
NEXT STEPS
- Commit to gathering consistently with Flatwoods.
- Commit to a Christ-centered attitude over entertainment, preference, religion, and culture.
- Pray the prayer for Flatwoods – Psalm 67:1-2To obtain documents, log on:

“You can only do your bit. But that’s enough” says serial volunteer Mira Howard. She has been supporting VSO for 18 years, having set off on her first placement at the age of 63.
Although she ‘retired’ from volunteering five years ago she is today, aged 81, still supporting the communities she met as a volunteer.
Mira working with members of the Himba tribe in Namibia, sometime between 1998-2002
Mira supports two schools and an orphanage in Thailand and Namibia. She even financed a dormitory and classroom – both named after her.
She is active as ever, swimming 50 lengths a week and visiting the projects she helps each year. Today Mira has five children, eleven grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
She shares some of the lessons learned along the course of her extraordinary life – and why she’s not ready to stop yet.
1. Sometimes change happens to you when you least expect it. It’s how you cope with it that matters.
“I was 62 years old when I lost my husband. It made me look at life in a new way. For the first time in my life I was free. No one was dependent on me. I knew I wanted to do something different with my life.
“I always wanted to help people and was always looking for opportunities to do so. So I applied for VSO. I was accepted despite my artificial hips and worked continuously with VSO for almost 14 years in three continents”
2. The skills and experience you take for granted could really help someone else.
“I was a special needs teacher in Britain. When I was in my first job with VSO in Namibia, I was promoted about 17 ranks!!
“I had a Master’s degree in the psychology of learning for children with special needs. That meant I was able to take a role in the Ministry of Education in Namibia and was in charge of special education for a few years. I had to take my parking space next to the permanent secretary and pretend I was important!”
Mira working with adults with autism. She has contributed to increased understanding of special educational needs in three countries, impacting many thousands of people
3. Keep smiling
“I wasn’t scared when I set out to volunteer. But when I landed in Namibia I was a little bit lonely and frightened. But it passes. Things weren’t always easy. There was terrible racism in the country and you had to be very careful.
“You have to keep smiling. You have to keep calm. You have to take each day as it comes and do what good you can, when you can.”
4. There’s always a time to start and a time to leave
“It’s no good hanging on when you’ve done your bit. After working in Thailand on autism understanding and inclusion for special educational needs I knew I had done what I could.”
“So I took a new role in Guyana. I worked as a lecturer – it was fascinating! There was only one university, and one teacher training college in the country. I loved my diverse students – first nation people as well as peoples of Indian and African descent.”
“I was able to continue my raising of autism awareness in my final year which VSO arranged for me and it was very needed and successful.”
5. Volunteering and travel broaden the mind
“I’ve lived and worked in Asia, Africa and South America. It has broadened my understanding of other cultures immensely. I have a better understanding of other people and where they’re coming from. What poverty can do to people. You learn to be much less judgemental.”
Mira visiting a primary school in Namibia, where she has built a classroom. She visits each year with donations of clothes.
6. You can only do your little bit. But that’s enough.
“With VSO, you can do your little bit. You can do your millimetre. That’s all. But if everyone did millimetres it would make the world different.
“You can’t go out there and expect to change the world. But sometimes you can find that you have made a difference. That is very surprising and gratifying."
7. Turn your ‘weaknesses’ into strengths
“I was a little bit of a failure at school. I was 17 when my adopted mother died. My adopted father didn’t really want to know. I remember feeling pretty insecure, living in London as an out-of-work actress in the 1950s. We all got jobs in Harrods”
“I’m still insecure now – I’m just doing my best. Your insecurity can be a positive. It makes you more sensitive to things.”
Today 81-year-old great-grandmother Mira is still supporting the communities she met whilst volunteering with VSO
8. You really are only as old as you feel.
“I was 63 when I first volunteered with VSO. Working with younger people was a great experience. I forgot my age.
“I’m 81 now. I work with a social work organisation and in a library. I volunteer in the local school. I also act and do bar work for my local amateur theatre.
“I want to be active. I don’t want to stop. Some I know have become old people, moaning about their ailments. I don’t want to be like that.”
9. You’ve only got one life - it's your responsibility to make it count
“You only live once - so go for it and make the best of it. If you decide to volunteer you’ll be rewarded more than you expect. You’ll gain more than you give, almost, in the end.”
People of all ages achieve amazing things volunteering with VSO. You could join them.

While others were waiting for Spring, Michigan Jaguars enjoyed an experience of a lifetime over February break 2017 with an 8 night trip to Spain. As well as playing 3 games against well match local opposition, MI Jags also watched Real Madrid play in La Liga, had Master Class training sessions with Academy clinicians from both Atletico Madrid and RCD Espanyol, and toured the cathedrals of soccer that are FC Barcelona’s Nou Camp and Real Madrid’s Bernebeu Stadiums.
With access to the top teams in the world’s best league this was possibly the ultimate tour for any soccer crazy youth team.
As well as the joy of seeing their boys train and play in Spain, family members on the tour also enjoyed guided tours of Madrid and Barcelona, as well as sightseeing in both ancient Toledo, Zaragoza and the remarkable mountain top monastery at MontserratList Of Ministries

I like that I can keep in touch with many of my friends that live off in the far corners of the world, but I am annoyed with the amount of tracking that Facebook is doing. Heck, most companies do it, but these guys don't even do it that well.
Well in the same spirit as one of my favorite Firefox add-on (flashblock), we now have Facebook Disconnect. It only works on the Chrome browser, but I suspect someone will copy it soon to other browsers. Get it quick before Facebook sues the developer.63 Modern Farmhouse Kitchen Design Ideas

Saints fans are a unique lot. I’m not suggesting they’re either more or less dedicated than any other fan base. Let’s just say, they’re different.

My flight was 30 minutes late - landed 19:20 instead of 18:50. There was no one waiting for me and I had to pay three times as much for a local taxi - there were no taxis there at all.
Also, there were no communications whatsoever, no text message or email as for the reason for a no-show.

Based on auto theft survey results of 17 major Ohio city police departments and data from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports, OII estimates that statewide auto thefts decreased 2.3 percent between 2003-2004.
This follows a decrease of 4.1 percent between 2002-2003, when US auto thefts actually increased 1.1 percent. Ohio realized a 1.3 percent increase between 2001-2002. Prior to 2000, national figures showed an eight-year period of auto theft decreases (1992-1999), followed by a 1.2 percent increase between 1999-2000, according to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports.
OII findings suggest Cleveland is where you’ll experience the greatest chance of becoming an auto theft statistic in the Buckeye state. There was one theft for every 56 registered vehicles in Cleveland, creating an even greater risk than its 2003 ratio of one in 63 vehicles. Auto theft-wise, Cleveland’s ratio is similar to Dayton’s — 1 in 61 — and Cincinnati’s — 1 in 63. Dayton averaged one theft for every 62 registered vehicles in 2003; Cincinnati averaged one for every 52 vehicles — the worst in the state that year.
Between 2003-2004 auto theft activity in Ohio’s major cities ranged from a decrease of 23 percent in Springfield, to an increase of 56.2 percent in Euclid. Based on survey results, OII estimates statewide auto thefts were 40,039 in 2004. FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports shows statewide thefts were 40,996 in 2003 and 42,767 in 2002.
The FBI reports that the average value per vehicle stolen in 2003 was $6,797, up from the 2002 figure of $6,701. According to OII calculations, the value of unrecovered vehicles in 2004 remained at $101 million ($101.3 million in 2003). The nation’s vehicle recovery rate dropped slightly from 63.1% in 2002 to 62.9% in 2003.
Based on OII’s analysis, eight cities reported decreases between 2003-2004 ranging from 3 percent to 23 percent. Of the cities reporting decreases, Springfield had the greatest percentage drop — down 23 percent — reducing thefts from 661 in 2003 to 509 in 2004. Four other cities experienced double-digit auto theft decreases – Cincinnati (22.4 percent), Youngstown (18.1 percent), Lorain (11 percent) and Toledo (10.3 percent).

Intro
Hello my dears! My name is Johanna, and I welcome you to the Johanna Draconis - The Deconstruction Of C-PTSD podcast.
In this episode we will talk about finding yourself at the bottom again where you never wanted to be again and the shame that is usually part of it and the reluctance to get help in that moment.
Since it is so important to break the silence - let us talk about it. Though first I would like to apologize for the extreme delay and the rather unstable release schedule lately - sadly my health hasn’t been too good lately. I hope things get better soon.
Prelude
We have all been there before - even though most would not like to admit it. That moment when you realize - you slided back and now are in the place again you really didn’t want to be again.
Be it getting something of the substance you tried to get away from or the old habit you tried to stop or - fitting for this podcast - getting strong symptoms again despite doing so great. There are so many examples of this.
The kind of dark spot we end up varies greatly between those examples. Slipping back into an old habit is for sure way more harmless and less severe than ending up with the addicted substance again.
The thing they have in common is the incredible shame. The shame we feel and that makes us likely to lie and not ask for help - because we feel so embarrassed and feel that no one should hear about it or see us like this. We are better than this. This is not us.
It is so hard - so incredible hard to pull yourself out of this spot. So I try to help today to make it a bit easier. That is why we first talk about why it is so hard and then things that might help to get out of there.
Why it is so hard
So, why is it so hard? I hope no one of you is in this dark spot - where everything seems hopeless and you feel like your efforts were for nothing. You might even have doubts if success is even possible - for you at least. The hope that we might made it - is shattered.
Which is sadly all a symptom of us not being well - we don’t see it balanced. We see it as the proof or the indicator for what we fear deep down inside - that we are doomed. But that is the view of fear that we let cloud our judgment.
If all was going rather well so far and made progress - isn’t it the proof that we are succeeding? That it is nothing more than a setback? Maybe it is an indication we took the wrong turn and need to change how we went on solving the issue.
But that doesn’t make the case hopeless nor dooms us. Yet even if we know this rationally it is hard to find in these thoughts comfort. It is likely because this is a purely existential fear and deep rooted survival instincts.
Also the deep rooted fear of being cast out.Be a disgrace and an outcast. That if others knew of it, they would be disgusted and leave us - even if we deep down know this won’t be the case. It is very hard to reason with any of that.
What can be done
So what can be done instead? First off, this has - most likely - nothing to do with your intelligence, moral, discipline, self worth and the like. It really happens to everyone. ESPECIALLY during your healing journey from PTSD. It happened to me a few times.
And I know of others it happens to. This comes from our desire to find happiness and peace and be finally healthy again. We all just want to get home, kick off the shoes and relax on a comfortable chair in the warmth. The good place.
Not the harsh cold wilderness of getting better. So sometimes we are a bit premature - we feel the slight warmth and kick our shoes away - despite still being in the cold outside. Which naturally leads to you getting worse again.
So one of the most important advice is, that if you feel better than you should just keep the pace. But that is more of a precaution. That doesn’t help you when you are in the thick of it.
In the thick of it
Then the most important step is to forgive yourself. That might come as a surprise, but it is truly one of the most helpful steps you can take. And it is one of the hardest. Forgiving yourself is hard.
You took a wrong step, that can happen to everyone - beating yourself up about it won’t help nor is it not normal. The more you accept that and let go of the self punishment - the faster you move on from this.
Second is to let go of the things you think you should and shouldn’t do and go about doing the things you CAN do. It is best to slow it down and try taking it step by step. As you are once again caught in the storm - so it is best to pace yourself and tread carefully.
Third - reach out. I know you most likely won’t feel like talking in this situation. But social interactions are important to us - especially in situations like these. Doesn’t have to be about the situation… maybe just exchange a few jokes. Whatever helps.
Fourth - find a place to recover. That can be a game, a book, movies, music or whatever. Somewhere you can forget your situation for a bit and regain your strength and energy. You are not a machine after all..VMware Workstation is one of the best Virtualization tool used at windows and Linux desktop level.

Bill Evans: tenor, soprano saxophone
Gary Grainger: bass
Dennis Chambers: drums
Mike Stern and Bill Evans have a history that goes back to 1981 with Miles Davis.
Miles asked Bill, who was playing with Davis at the time, to recommend another guitar player for the band and Bills suggestion was Stern. They toured and recorded together with Davis until Bill left the band in 1984 to join John McLaughlins’ new Mahavishnu Orchestra.
Stern went on to play and tour with his own groups and Bill started touring with his own groups beginning in 1989. It wasn’t until 2013, thirty-two years later, that Stern and Evans decided to take to the stage together again to form the Mike Stern / Bill Evans Band. Since 2013, they have toured together all over the world.
It is an explosive combination of like- minded musicians who have an energy and history together that create a very exciting show. Between both of them, there are almost fifty solo recordings.
One reviewer stated "this is cutting edge music that defies boundaries. They have a special chemistry between them. Whether its jazz, rock or soul , these guys can do it all at the highest level. Outstanding. "Sanax Wordpress Theme - Rating, Reviews, Preview, Demo & Download

I feel that I am just a woman doing business, it’s too early to call as a successful business woman. Maybe because of rough life in the past, I have to try hard and gained more experiences than others who start-up a business at the same age. I always feel that I have to try harder because I still have many targets that need to be met. – What is the secret behind your success? With just a few achievements that I have until now, the secret behind is that I never give up. Whatever I want, I always try to get it and no obstacle can stop me.
– Why did you choose business as your Profession ?
From the beginning for me business was just a means to survive. I studied Economic Law and had been thinking that being a lawyer would be my whole life profession. But I realized that I have experienced many interesting challenges when doing business, and I like that kind of experiences, hence I decided to stay with business as a profession.
– Behind your success you may have faced various obstacles in your progress, how do you cope with those obstacles ?
Obstacles are a part of life, I’m always ready to face and overcome them. At my age, many people think that I am too young for them to trust and I have had to try harder many times to overcome those unfair judgments, preconceptions, even rumours. I have been thinking sometimes that I have to show the proof to others about my abilities, but now I am used to how to keep calm when facing all problems. I live the life for myself, I try very hard in work and it’s not necessary to show that proof to anyone.
– What differences did you find in the behaviour of society to you as normal Tue Nghi and as successful business women Tue Nghi ?
Normally, I’m a humorous and romantic person. I love writing books, and one of the books has been published, and it will be made into a movie. I like drinking afternoon tea, noisy and crowded places are not suitable for me. In business, I am a bit different, I’m very decisive and a stronger character.
– Do you have any inspirational business person that influences you ?
I admire very much a woman politician, Madam Hillary Clinton. I like those women who are smart, powerful, have a warm heart and a glacial mind. They’re very beautiful, a beauty of power and intelligence.
– Is it easy for everyone to achieve success like you ?
I don’t think the point is about easy or difficult, but the most important thing is that you want to achieve it or not. If you really want to, nothing can stop you. All obstacles are just challenges to help your success become more meaningful.
– What advice do you have for youth who are interested in making their career in the business sector ?
The same way that I have advised the youth of my country, business is never easy, this life is not either. The important thing is that when you choose business to be your profession, you should not be afraid to start up with something small. Let the dream build from the root, not from the top. However if you only have dream, that is not enough. You have to put your hands down and take action seriously to make your dream come true, then you will get what you deserve.
– What kind of contribution have you made in your society ?
Beside some charity activities, helping children and unfortunate women, I always try to use my little voice and effort to give inspiration and passion to the youth; let them see that a little woman like me dares to live, dares to do what I’ve dreamed, why don’t they?
– And last, do you have anything else to say to Nepal Parikrama Fortnightly ?
I would like to give special thanks to Nepal Parikrama Fortnightly for this interview. I hope that it will bring a little inspiration to the youth and women of your country.

How to Watch the Frisco Bowl Online without Cable
It used to be that you couldn’t find much sports at all online. Instead, you had to pay an arm and a leg for a cable package to see the best football, or anything else for that matter. But luckily in the last year or two, streaming services like Hulu and Sling TV have really come into their own. These services, also known as live streaming services, let you stream cable channels via the internet. And best of all:
- They don’t have contracts so you can cancel at any time
- You pay month to month… again, cancel at any time
- There are no hidden fees
- You can watch on your phone, PC, or on your TV with the right streaming device
With the game being on ESPN2, you can get a Frisco Bowl live stream on either Hulu with Live TV or Sling TV–both will do the trick. They’re also great options to watch all the other Bowl games as well.
And if you want to save all the action for later, both Sling TV and Hulu have DVR functions to record and stream later. So whether you want to watch the Friso Bowl online live, or stream it later, well, you can do either.
make sure to catch the game Friday night – live stream the Frisco Bowl without cable!

Looking at this platform from an app entrepreneurial point of view, this is the right time to explore and dive more into the app creation strategies, which are targeted more by the blackberry lovers.
Do not think of Blackberry as a lost cause – there is still juice to it. The over 10 million downloads of the BBM app in the Android platform and its success in the iOS platform has just taught us that people still love the company (and its messenger).
With the latest addition of android app support in the Blackberry platform, app entrepreneurs have more to look on. When creating apps, one should have a clear idea about the type of customers he is targeting. Testing the app with a special set of customers as a preliminary measure needs to be done before offering it to the public (Google is doing it with its Glasses, and why shouldn’t you?)
What apps do Blackberry users want? And how can app entrepreneurs make it more compelling?
Here is a Look:
- Messaging and Communication Apps: People like Blackberry more for its user-friendliness in the area of instant messaging and communication like the E- Mail applications etc. Concentrating on the creation of new and innovative apps will make the currently available applications more compatible to the present trends. It will fetch good ratings for the app that will be profitable for the app entrepreneurs.
- Applications with Comparatively Lower Cost or Free Apps: In app markets of other competing platforms, one of the major issues on hand is the high pricing. We have stressed on the freemium model in many of our previous blog posts. While with the limited number of users, a freemium model for the Blackberry store might not seem feasible, you need to make sure that apps are priced reasonably if not free. High ratings are a sure bet for the apps which are good, affordable or free cost. The ratings will generate good revenue for the entrepreneurs and allow them to get a wider audience for the future projects.
- New Genre of Apps: Blackberry still doesn’t have a great number of apps. Consider this – there is no Skype on the Blackberry store! Considering the fact, a good video sharing app can help. There is a plethora of apps that you can make for Blackberry – as there is still a considerable less number of apps in the Blackberry marketplace.
- Android Applications: The newly introduced Android application compatibility in Blackberry should be correctly utilized, as the conventional Blackberry users will be more interested in trying out the trendy Android applications (and this can be a great asset for you as an app developer). Applications that are convenient for using on both the platforms should be created as it attracts potential customers.San Felipe is located 186 miles away from the city of Tijuana (about 4 hours of road to the east and then south), and it stands out thanks to its beautiful desert landscapes and for their peaceful and warm waters.

I consider, training is a kind of issues that are being taken and adopted with lots of the wrong ideas. The essence of education and being educated is being nearly vanished from the hearts of the lecturers and from the minds of the students. The idea has been taken wrong, flawed enough to dilute the thoughts of students and mix it with the material issues like ‘solely good grades’ (with no logic in any respect & even by the way cheating and copying) or the goals of that top-paying job even when you must do the fallacious issues (like tax evasion and so forth).

The latest news release by CIMCA on January 28, 2009 revealed that the CSC along with other impartial British Columbia medical clinics have launched a lawsuit in the Supreme Court docket of BC to have authorized restrictions on entry to independent clinics struck down as a result of they deprive patients of rights assured by part 7 of the Canadian Constitution of Rights and Freedoms.

What to Drink This Week: Apfelkorn
The autumn is a season of compromises. It’s a nice prelude to the unwavering absolutism of winter, which is determined to be cold and then just gets colder; it’s a relief from the unrelenting affability of summer, which is like a party guest who only has one really good joke and spends all night running it into the ground.
Yeah, the fall is a time of give-and-take, like:
- TAKEN: The mornings get cool, and evenings crisp.
- GIVEN: But the afternoons are still scorching, hooray! This wool sweater was the perfect choice!
- TAKEN: Cooler weather means don’t have to mow your lawn any more…
- GIVEN: …opening up the hours you’ll need to rake the hundreds and thousands of leaves that fall on your lawn from your neighbor’s yard.
- TAKEN: Patios
- GIVEN: Drinking on the couch, trying to find something that isn’t Major League Baseball or wedding shows
- TAKEN: An hour of your life, thanks very much Daylight Savings Time
- GIVEN: NOTHING IT IS A RIPOFF
And so on. Sure, when you’re wiping sleep out of your eyes and noticing that it’s pitch black at 7AM, you may feel like the fall isn’t particularly interested in your happiness — and for the most part, you’re right — but occasionally true balance is achieved.
Witness apples. Yeah, you can get them all year-round at the grocery store, but there are few insane thrills as complete as the first seasonal, local apples of the season. They are for some reason so much better, so much fruitier, so much apple-y-er than the ones that cruised in on a freight liner from Chile. It’s impossible to quantify, they just are.
For me, apples are as synonymous with October as clementines are with Christmas. The smell and the taste of them immediately bring memories crashing in from childhood (for good or ill), in my case of rolling around Price Edward County in my parents’ station wagon and buying bushels of apples for the coming winter. Because my grandparents were with us, there were never enough seats for everyone in the car proper, so someone always had to lie down in the tailgate and hope no cops would notice.
As strenuously as my sister would volunteer (this was in a time when it was still considered okay for four adults to smoke in a closed car with two children), I always got to be in the back, tucked in with gargantuan bags of apples and a boxer who loved to bounce more vigorously than Tigger. I can vividly remember being surrounded on all sides by apples that looked as big as my head, the scent of them creeping through the increasing number of holes our dog was poking in the bags as he explored the limits of his enthusiasm.
Moments like that come back to me every year, and this makes me a total sucker for all things autumnally-themed and apple-flavored. So it is that this is my favorite time to go digging into the back of our liquor cupboard and pull out the Apfelkorn.
As the name may have led you to conclude, Apfelkorn is a German liqueur, a wheat spirit that’s been blended with sweet, ripe apple. It has the flavor of apple juice that’s been in your fridge for maybe a little bit too long, in that both the sweetness and underlying fruity funk are both amplified.
As a liquor, though, it’s actually very light. Though the production and the composition would probably rank it as a Schnapps, it’s actually more dilute and nowhere near as strong. At 20% ABV, it’s very much a liqueur that you’d want to use as a contributor, because it does two things very well: taste like apples, and add just a little warmth.
Apfelkorn plays very well with warm cider to which you want to add a little kick, but aren’t particularly interested in brandy. It’s what you add to a martini to make it actually taste like fruit, rather than Sourz, which tastes like apple-flavored Jolly Ranchers (though that flavor, whatever crime it may be against nature, has its place too). It’s a way to do something creative with white wine you don’t want to drink on its own, and it can be your secret weapon to a great apple pie filling.
Relative to a lot of the other mixers you’re going to see on the shelf, Apfelkorn hasn’t been around for that long. A product of the 1970s German cocktail culture (mark that among phrases I never thought I’d use in my life), its popularity has given rise to a line of fruit liqueurs — but for my money, none of them hit the mark quite as well as the original.
Perhaps it’s my nostalgia at work, but to me Apfelkorn will always represent that full, ripe apple flavor that I’ve permanently associated with the fall. At less than $20, it’s an easy purchase to justify, if for no other reason than to have an apple cocktail on hand to make me feel better about Daylight Savings Time.
For example, the Whackintosh:
- To a chilled shaker, add ice
- Over the ice, add 1 oz. of dark rum (I like Newfoundland Screech)
- To the rum, add 1 oz. of Apfelkorn
- Shake vigorously
- Pour the rum, Apfelkorn and ice into a rocks glass
- Finish the glass with your choice of sparkling hard apple cider (the scrumpier the better — loathe as I am to say it, Bulmer’s is a good choice)
Your reward? A light, fizzy, refreshing but still full-bodied cocktail to remind you about everything that’s great about apples — brightness, sweetness and the amazing ease with which they disguise heft amounts of alcohol.
There aren’t a whole lot of reasons to be excited about the end of summer, but in the spirit of compromise, the fall does what it can: cool evenings that are fun to walk in, bright harvest moons to gawk at, Thanksgiving dinners, and apples. Take advantage of them all, and you’ll be right in the spirit of the season.

5 Responsible Questions to Ask When Choosing an SEO Partner
Updated: Jun 2, 2020
SEO is a powerful and resilient marketing channel that holds great potential for many businesses. Like any marketing channel, however, it isn’t for everyone and it’s certainly not a magic bullet. You should be careful not to naively believe that you should be investing in SEO for your business without compelling rationale. Doing that will leave you vulnerable to a long, expensive road that may never lead to ROI and result in a negative perception of the channel that could have been positive if the right questions were asked and expectations set upfront.
The specific tactics and mechanics of SEO may be mysterious to you, but that doesn’t mean you can’t responsibly explore the channel by being clear about your goals and asking pointed questions to reveal whether or not your prospective partners are the right fit. Consider the following questions to inspire productive discussion between you and your prospective SEO partners and increase the likeliness this channel results in tangible value (😉) for your business.
1. Why is SEO an Opportunity for MY Business?
No two businesses are the same. Don’t put up with generic answers about how SEO is a must for every business. It isn’t. Winning is never impossible, but SEO is an established digital marketing channel and, like any marketing channel, should be assessed relative to your goals, your existing situation, and your competitive landscape. Your partner should be able to tell you what competition in this channel looks like for you and where and how they intend to help your business secure a valuable place in the market.
*Note that a comprehensive view of your competitive landscape takes significant effort and may not be part of a standard sales qualification process. Some partners may suggest an introductory engagement to explore the SEO opportunity for your business (we do). Still, an experienced partner should have some general thoughts about your market space.
2. How Will Results Be Measured?
You don’t care about implementing SEO best practices; you care about your specific business goals. Make it clear that the goal is not to check boxes or achieve a state of SEO best practices. An experienced SEO organization knows that their work and value is measured against business-driving results. That doesn’t mean just watching keyword rankings change. You always have the right to ask that your partner connect the dots (at very least in theory) from the work they are doing to the final impact to your business goals.
SEO Goal Metrics Should Be Sequentially Tracked Thus:
Keyword Ranking Improvement Mission #1 is to get keywords ranking in positions where people can see your content. Don’t look at traffic (except to baseline) until keywords are in traffic-driving positions. This is usually middle to upper page 1 of search results, sometimes lower page 1. Page 2 (position 11 or higher) doesn't yield clicks and thus isn't enough to move your focus from ranking position to the next metric, website visitors.
Incoming Organic (SEO) Traffic to Ranking Pages Once keywords are ranking in positions that are commonly seen by users, then you can expect users to find those rankings and click through to your website. Now it’s appropriate to consider website traffic from search a meaningful KPI.
Conversions Resulting from Organic Traffic Once you confirm that users are seeing your pages rank and then are clicking to visit those pages, you next want to know if the users are taking meaningful actions on your website. If you’re an eCommerce business, you can directly associate traffic with website transactions and revenue. If not, you’re likely looking at leads or signups. There may be partial conversions in between, like visits to a product detail page. What's important here is to follow the trail and see if the traffic you're driving is valuable.
Sales / Revenue Resulting from Organic Leads An experienced SEO partner should know that even #1 rankings and thousands of new visits and conversions from SEO doesn’t necessarily mean you’re closing new business. However, this metric is ultimately on you to communicate to your partner. If your partner doesn’t have visibility and collaboration here, they can’t adjust course to aim at the kind of traffic that drives quality leads.
3. What Defines an "SEO Strategy" at Your Organization?
The word “strategy” can be used casually in many marketing discussions and SEO can become particularly convoluted as to what comprises an SEO strategy. Implementing SEO best practices is not a strategy. A strategy should incorporate an understanding of your customers and identification of the keywords they use, an understanding of existing competition standing in your way, and a plan of necessary actions to overtake or avoid competition to drive results for your business. Results will vary but you’ll know a good answer when you hear it.
4. How Often Do You Assess the Efficacy of Your Strategy?
Strategies may prove to be ineffective; your partner may need to pivot. The early stages are all about learning the nuisances of your business. That takes time. However, it’s not permissible to run without a built-in system for stepping back from the existing strategy to put a critical eye on whether or not it is still the best path forward. Timelines can vary by partner but this is a healthy expectation to set for all parties.
5. Why Do You Believe in SEO?
SEO is a unique, esoteric universe of search engine know-how that also requires creativity and an understanding of consumer psychology. Why and how your partner got involved in this world is sure to unearth some interesting history lessons and the opportunity to bring the conversation to a personal level.
Some Expectation Setting
So as not to inadvertently throw my fellow ethical SEO practitioners under the bus and frame the channel unrealistically - a few expectations to set.
Be Reasonable with Goal Setting
Don’t expect specific guarantees or hard numbers on what kind of returns you should expect - especially early in an engagement. Any responsible partner knows that this channel - like any other - is subject to many variables, particularly the actions of your competition. This makes SEO goals a moving target. This is no different than any other marketing channel operating in a marginally-competitive market space. Holding your partner to inflexible numbers will discourage liberal conversation and the inevitable need to absorb a loss and pivot to more promising areas.
Be Patient and Flexible
SEO is an experiment, an inexact science, and an investment. The good news is that when you find a creative, ambitious partner you get a leg up on the competition who hopefully has become complacent, already achieved their goals, or just aren’t keeping up. Give your partner the flexibility to try, fail, and pivot. Again, stress the need to establish a time to step back and have a candid conversation about what’s working and what isn’t.
SEO Takes Time and Investment
As a developed channel, it’s nearly impossible to find an area of SEO where no one else has thought of using the channel. That means if you’re trying to break into SEO, you will have competitors to dislodge. They may have been investing for years to earn their place. You can overtake them and the upside is that defending the top of the hill is less arduous than climbing it, but you still have a hill to climb. Don’t expect SEO results to come easy or without sustained effort and investment. Whether the top of the hill is worth it to your business is for you and your partner to decide.

"The inmates and their vehicle have not been recovered", a post on the Oconee County Sheriff's Office Facebook page states.
Authorities say Rowe and inmate Ricky Dubose escaped after killing two prison guards during a bus transport in Georgia.
Both men are said to be highly risky.
'They just murdered two corrections officers in a brutal fashion, ' Sills said.
Hours later, authorities converged on the small city of Madison, about 25 miles to the north, where they determined the fugitives had ransacked a house around 10.30am on Tuesday. Both men worked as correctional officers at Baldwin State Prison, she said, and the department said they had an "unwavering commitment to their job" and their families. The Department of Corrections said Rowe has been serving life without parole since 2002, and Dubose began a 20-year sentence in 2015.
The names of the prison guards and inmates haven't been released.
The second inmate, Ricky Dubose, was being held on a single armed robbery conviction from 2014 in Elbert, along with convictions for credit card fraud, financial identity fraud, theft by taking, burglary, robbery and a single conviction for entering a vehicle.
Monica, 42, a sergeant, worked for the department for nearly eight years and leaves a wife. A reward of $60,000 is offered for information leading to the arrests of of the inmates. "I have their blood on my shoes", Sills said, adamantly noting that Rowe and Dubose need to surrender before they are found.
The prisoners breached a protective gate on the bus to reach the officers, before disarming and killing them both, the sheriff's office said.
Many local area businesses have reportedly been placed on lock down.
At the house, they ditched their prison garb and changed into street clothes, authorities said.
Authorities believe the escapees drove away from the crime scene toward Eatonton and then headed into Morgan County and eventually the Madison area, where the massive manhunt by local, state and federal law enforcement officers converged Tuesday afternoon and into the night, as well as all day Wednesday.".
The victims have been identified as 42 year-old Christopher Monica and 58 year-old Curtis Billue.
Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal pledged every state resource necessary to catch the pair, and vowed that the guards' selflessness and sacrifice will not be forgotten.
The state Department of Corrections is investigating what went wrong Tuesday.
Sills said the two men may be in the truck, but he did not rule out that they may have split up. Both are being sought by law enforcement. He also has a tattoo featuring large letters covering the entirety of the front of his neck.

What our customers say about pdfFiller!Deformities of the nose are often the result of an accident; however, ethnicity and heredity also play a role. When the nose is deformed it distracts attention away from other facial features because the face as a whole is not symmetrical. Ideally the nose should “fade” into the background to give your eyes and lips more attention. Deformities can be located in the upper third of the nose (the bony bridge of the nose), in the middle or lower third of the nose. Dr. Peter Abramson can correct nose deformities and give you the facial symmetry you have always wanted!
Types of Deformities
There are a variety of nose deformities that not only affect the outer appearance of a patient’s face, but also affect their ability to breath.

Or maybe you're only at a desk on certain days and for limited periods of time, but find you're sitting for long periods of time outside of work. In fact, our world today is designed so that we're on our rumps much of the time—from eating to driving to playing on the computer to working. Then we go to sleep and repeat it all again the next day.
This type of lifestyle—one of sitting and being sedentary for periods of more than an hour or two at a time—has a detrimental impact on our health and well-being. Unfortunately, there are dangers of sitting for long periods of time. But luckily, there are some office exercises and other initiatives you can take to combat it.
Your body needs to get up and regularly move to regenerate and stay stimulated.
Knowing how challenging life can be with health concerns, I'm all about promoting overall health and well-being, especially considering that a healthy life and happy life are typically not mutually exclusive. When I find out about possibilities to improve my health or heal my body, I do my research, and then give it a whirl if it feels right.
That's why I took it to heart when I was living in Maui and friend and fitness guru, Izaak Tyrrell, shared his thoughts on the "Chair Born Society," a term he coined as the title of his future book. Izaak shared, “The more lethargic and sedentary you are, the more your body begins to decompose and prepare for death. Your body needs to get up and regularly move with some form of progression so it can regenerate and stay stimulated. For every hour you are sitting, it's imperative you get up, walk around, and fully stretch out the body for at least 5 to 10 minutes.“
It might not be a surprise to some that sitting at your desk for long periods of time can cause a myriad of health issues, from fatigue to obesity to pain. For me, however, it was the extent to which it could be an issue that somewhat surprised me—it can literally take years off of your life.
Regular exercise does not counter the negative impact of sitting for long periods of time.
After Izaak first introduced me to the "Chair Born Society" in 2011, I began to see studies continually emerge to support his theory.
For example, a post on CNN, "Sitting for hours can shave years off your life," reported that studies conducted by the American College of Sports Medicine, the Centers for Disease Control, and the American Cancer Society all show similar results. The American Cancer Society study found that "women who sit for more than six hours a day were about 40 percent more likely to die during the course of the study than those who sat fewer than three hours per day. Men were about 20 percent more likely to die." The American Journal of Epidemiology published a study finding that "those who work a sedentary job have almost twice the risk of a specific type of colon cancer."
Even if you are active and exercise, these same studies, as well as a 2015 study by Annals of Internal Medicine, indicate that it does not compensate or equally counteract the damage done from sitting for long periods of time. This was a surprise to me. I would sit for long periods of time as a writer, getting caught up in the news or a good story; and in my early corporate days, I was practically attached to my desk and computer. But I thought I was OK because I was active and regularly exercised. Now that I know to be mindful of it, I do feel better the more breaks I take during the day. Another added benefit is the fact that I'm more efficient and productive when I take mini-breaks to refresh my mind and body every hour or two.
Take initiative to support your health and well-being.
To support your health while at work and beyond, consider the following tips and ideas to avoid sitting for long periods of time.
Get up every hour or two. This is the easiest and most obvious step you can take. Set your clock if you need to, and get up every hour or two and do something that requires standing. Take short walks around the block, up and down the stairs, or make a loop around the hallway office. Stretching is also a great choice. Get creative and find things to get you standing and moving that are easy to incorporate into your daily routine.
Request an adjustable desk. In some work environments, you might be able to request a desk that adjusts so you can alternate between standing and sitting. If you have a request from a doctor for such a desk, it could help. Further, if you do have health issues where having an adjustable desk would help minimize any difficulty in doing your work, then it might be considered a reasonable accommodation per the Americans with Disabilities Act and your employer will need to accommodate you.
Consider scheduling hiking or walking meetings. After understanding the effects of sitting for long periods of time, Author and Director Nilofer Merchant, began scheduling some of her meetings as walking meetings. This might or might not be an option for you, but you can always ask if it's a possibility, and hey, you can use this post as a reference! You can read more about Nilofer's approach to walking meetings in her post on Huffington Post: "Sitting is the Smoking of Our Generation."
Exercise during the day. If it's an option for you, consider doing part of your exercise regimen during the day, like lifting weights at the gym or walking on the treadmill. It's true that it might be a bit more inconvenient and require you to shower in the middle of your workday, but it could still be worth it to support your health by breaking up the length of time that you're sitting.
Exercise. Period. If you can't exercise during the day, then be sure you're exercising regularly throughout the week to maintain your health. Make exercise something you enjoy doing, too, like dancing, hiking, aerobics, walking your dog, or whatever might make you look forward to burning some calories and toning up the body. It doesn't have to be all grit and grime. It might not completely counteract long periods of sitting on you rump, but it does help improve health in general.
As reported in the same CNN post mentioned earlier, Mayo Clinic endocrinologist and researcher in Rochester, Minnesota, Dr. James Levine, points out in an issue of the journal Diabetes ."
Your health is more important than any paycheck. Without it, you might not have a paycheck at all. So please, be mindful of the length of time you're sedentary and sitting, no matter what you're doing, to support your overall health and longevity. Doing so can mean a long and healthy career for years to come.

In Walter Scott's ballad 'The Lord of the Isles' the poet describes the basaltic columns and cormorants of Staffa during his account of the voyage of the chieftains from Skye. He also contrasts the church on Iona with the cave of Staffa:
"Here, as to shame the temples deck'd
By skill of earthly architect,
Nature itself it seemed would raise
A Minster to hear her Maker's praise."
Stephen Thompson's photograph captures the grandeur of Staffa; a group of figures silhouetted at the mouth of the cave provide the scene with a sense of scale.

Janette Kerr - Artists Talk
Janette Kerr’s talk has stirred up some ideas that were forming in my own practice. Kerr explores the world through her art, she works in a huge variety of media; she has travelled to residencies from Norway to Iceland and often works collaboratively with other artists. The variety of work she produces has the central theme of place that ties it all together, a thread running through that ensures her work is cohesive. I was impressed by how hard she obviously works and how her own inquisitive nature keeps her art fresh and interesting. There is a passion in her work that seems (to me) to be an almost scientific questioning or searching - but not for solid or whole answers necessarily because it is the questions that are important. She has a drive to explore and creates art from her experiences. Working outside is very important to her and she seems to transfer the energy of the experience into her work. When looking at her seascapes the viewer can feel the movement of the sea and imagines the taste of salt spray.
“Janette Kerr is a painter deeply embedded in place. She works at the interface between land, sea and historical experience. She writes,, 2018)
A Sense of Place
She spoke about capturing a sense of what has happened in a place, which is something I feel connected to or something that I am naturally drawn towards in my work so hearing her describe it has made me think of the possibility of those musings as a foundation for creating art. I am so much part of these islands and these people that I cannot separate myself or my art from them and I would not want to but maybe if I look at it form another perspective I can make a comment on them without it becoming too personal, a comment on the power of the weather in the dark days or the sounds of wind or the old folks sucked in breathe like guisers.
Advice
Janette Kerr showed how she has taken risks in her work. Even if it does not work out it could be a catalyst for another piece of work.
I felt inspired by her use of a broad range of media; her experimenting and experiencing new things which keeps her work fresh. She also advised us that it is helpful to be flexible and open to ideas; that an artist often need to allow time for ideas to materialise.

Review: Toyota Camry TRD is left wanting for more
Toyota's ambitious Camry TRD is the best driving Camry ever, but other areas hold back this questionable Fast and the Furious prop car.
A Camry with a wing you say? Heresy! The Toyota faithful, lovers of the most anonymous and boring cars in existence would never want that atrocity. Except they did apparently. The Camry TRD, with its fixed rear wing and aggressive bodywork, has proved a hit for Toyota. It represents great value, and it offers a certifiably TRD sporting chassis underneath. But, there's a but. Unfortunately, there are many key areas that hold back this ambitious would-be sports sedan, and they do enough to undermine it and make it nothing more than a dressed prop car from a Fast and Furious movie.
What is it?
The Camry TRD. Basically, Toyota's TRD department, Toyota Racing Development, has fettled the Camry with a sports-minded suspension to make this the sharpest driving Camry ever. To go with it, Camry TRDs receive a shouty bit of bodywork, with a deep front fascia, side skirts, and a fixed rear wing. No, not a spoiler, a wing. Red highlights are sprinkled about, from the red TRD stitching on the head restraints, red seatbelts, and red pinstriping along other exterior pieces. The attractive wheels are matte black (wish they were gloss black) items also bearing the red TRD logo. It looks unlike any Camry ever before it: mean. Why a typical Camry owner would something mean is as good as anyone's guess, but it shows that Toyota has the cajones to try something ambitious with their best-selling sedan that always carried the excitement of cheap mild cheddar. However, there are lots of bits, rather integral bits mind you, that have not received the TRD treatment. This absence is what holds back the Camry TRD as a pretender rather than the bona fide Tillamook sharp variety.
What's hot
Veracity, that's what the Camry TRD steers with. While all new Camrys do drive surprisingly well, especially when compared to their boring ancestors, the TRD sets a new standard for Toyota's front-wheel drive family sedan. Weighting is natural and not too light, but also not tiringly heavy. Response is linear and true, with the Camry TRD changing directions nicely and with a vigor when asked. Approach a corner quickly and the front tires dig into the tarmac without fuss and whisks you right to your apex and onto the next. This, in a Camry? Yes. You will find understeer eventually, but the basic handling balance is that of a convincing neutrality and with a perfect amount of body roll for the street. What I really liked in this regard is just how organic it felt from the wheel. Right from the first get-go, I got the sense of feeling that "yeah, this is what a car should feel like."
TRD is responsible for stiffening the suspension in all the right places to give this level of control to the driver. Yet, despite these improvements, the ride quality is still everyday usable without feeling harsh in any way. This tuning is very akin to BMWs of old, you know, the good ones.
Under the hood is Toyota's familiar3.5L V6 with 301 horsepower, which is unchanged from the standard V6 Camry. This tried and true motor is wonderfully smooth, foregoing the coarseness that has plagued V6 engines of old. Delivery is like a graph with a slope of one, with an equal rise and run. Put your foot down and power gradually increases all the way up and builds to a steady crescendo of power up top. The V6 also sounds rather good, emitting a smooth growl with a restrained yowl at the top end. 0-60 MPH happens in 5.8 seconds, which is at least competitive with other mid-size competitors, but not class-leading. Gas mileage was great, though, with an average of 26 MPG overall and 35 MPG on the highway.
Minus the wing, I do like how the Camry TRD looks and with its two-tone paint. The appearance is sharp and definitely stands out among other transportation pods. Price concerned, the TRD does represent good value as this tester rang the as-tested price to $34,282. At under 35 grand, the TRD is far from the most expensive Camry you can buy, with that honor being reserved for the more luxurious XSE. Toyota definitely could have goofed and priced the 'sporty' be-winged model much higher, but have shown restraint and met this attractive price point. In actuality, it's one of the cheapest V6 Camrys you can buy, which must certainly have helped with how often I see the Camry TRDs on the road.
What's not
Like I said earlier, there are faults to consider with the Camry TRD. While the Camry TRD has a potent chassis underneath, there several factors that undermine this would-be sports sedan. For me, the most glaring issue is the eight-speed automatic transmission. Shifts are smooth if on the lazy side, but the real disappointment comes from the cheesy, plasticky paddle shifters behind the wheel, and not because of their material, but because they're actually worthless. What do I mean by that? Despite the gear lever having a +/- mode and the paddle shifters, there is zero way to have manual control over this transmission.
Slide the lever over to manual, start pulling paddles, and no matter what, the moment your right foot passes even just a third of throttle travel, the Camry TRD will override you and downshift. On a backroad, driving with an enthusiasm that a sport-minded car likes to be commanded with, this means you can never utilize the midrange power that this big V6 offers. So, try and select third gear at about 3 to 4,000 RPM, put your foot down and the car instead will kickdown to second on you. It's absolutely maddening, and I'd even go as far to say dangerous. Using the midrange in corners allows so much more adjustability with the throttle and to control the chassis, but the transmission logic decides to take control from you altogether. So I ask, what is the point of even having them? Every other new non-Toyota I've driven that has a manual way of shifting gives you real manual control, but I guess not for Toyota. What a shame.
The lacking commitment to fun continues with the traction and stability controls, which are intrusive to say the bare minimum. Can you turn them off? Sorta. To disable the nannies completely, you have to be completely stopped and hold down the button. If you're rolling, you can't do it at all. What you can do is disable traction control partially with a single click, but even then you have to be going under 30 MPH. But, the catch with that is the moment you're above 30, all the aides just come back on. So you can partially disable traction, but only when below 30...right. Oh, and the brakes felt rigid and wooden. You get used to it, but the first few uses were quite disconcerting.
The interior is a standard Camry affair, albeit with a few dressed up pieces that I find tacky. I'm fine with the red TRD logos stitched on the front seats, but the red seat belts are laughable. With an interior borrowed from the lower-tier SE model, there is a pronounced amount of hard plastics used throughout that do seem disappointing compared to rivals. The price is still good value technically because of the chassis and V6, but the interior quality does disappoint overall. What worried me were the rattles the driver's door produced on the motorway, as well as the metallic rattle and tininess when shutting the front doors at perfectly reasonable and even light forces. The rear doors made a distinctly different and more secure sound. The side skirts also rattled with each door close.
Other bits inside that annoyed me were no automatic front dome lights. Instead, only automated lights between the front and rear seats were present. And to go further with lighting, the door lock and window switches have an ambient lighting for nighttime use to decipher which are which. However, when you open the door to enter at night, those switches do not light up like they do in other cars, making them quite hard to see. Once you start the car, then they turn on, but considering how often one opens the door and then has to unlock the rest of the car for passengers using the inside switch, I found it annoying. I guess muscle memory would eventually take over.
Like most other Toyotas, the center display screen looks about ten years too old and it and the aesthetic of both the hardware and software needs a desperate update. It's fine to use, but it just isn't pretty. My biggest complaint on the inside, though, is with the seats. Sure, they're comfortable items, but they offer zero lateral support, being the same seat as other Camrys, just glammed up with fancy trimmings. So, when attacking turns or cloverleaf onramps, you're left having to brace yourself from falling out of the seats. Hyundai's Sonata N-Line has fantastic sport seats that are unique items from the standard model and provide gratuitous support for fun motoring.
So, it's no good then?
The principles are good, but it's the details that leave much to be desired. Toyota has done a bang-up job in making the Camry TRD a canyon-carving machine with its approachable, confident steering and handling. But, if it wants to have real sporting intentions, then why have they left an automatic transmission with zero logic in its programming? Seats that can't hold you in place worsen the experience further making for a car that can't realize its aspirations, rendering this attempt as a pretender. The lack of manual shifting and worrying about holding yourself in place just about completely zap any fun out of spirited driving.
The bones are there to make a compelling and legit TRD offering, a Camry sports sedan, but it has sadly been diluted and dumbed down with oversight and micro managing. If you all you want is a Camry that looks cool and sporty (granted you like the wing), then it's the perfect car for you. If what you want is a mid-size sedan with real sporting intentions, then you'd best look elsewhere.
2021 Camry TRD V6
As-tested price: $34,282
Pros: great steering and handling; smooth V6
Cons: Idiotic transmission programming; unsupportive seats
Verdict: Close to greatness, but watered down.Lifestyle Art Sessions

Those looking to buy Build-to-Order (BTO) flats will now have more time to plan ahead as the Housing and Development Board (HDB) will share information about upcoming BTO projects six months in advance.
HDB currently announces upcoming BTO projects three months in advance.
Can you afford an HDB flat? Check your affordability now.
“This means that for the upcoming BTO exercise in May, we will share the list of BTO sites for both the August and the November 2019 launches,” said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong on Thursday (7 Mar) during the Committee of Supply debate.
“I hope that this change will help flat buyers make more informed choices on their application.”
Starting from the May 2019 BTO exercise, the balloting time for BTO flats will also be reduced from six weeks to three weeks.
Welcoming the changes, Eugene Lim, key executive officer at ERA Realty Network, said the shorter balloting time will enable unsuccessful applicants to re-evaluate their housing choices without having to wait for more than a month.
To support lower-income families, the coverage of the Step-Up CPF Housing Grant (SUHG) of $15,000 will be extended to include three-room resale flats within non-mature estates.
The grant will also be extended to second-timer families living in public rental flats who intend to buy new or resale 2-room or 3-room flats in non-mature estates.
“The extension of the Step-Up CPF Housing Grant will certainly benefit those who have more urgent housing needs, as they now receive a subsidy for the purchase of a resale three-room flat,” noted Lim.
The grant is currently disbursed to the buyer prior to the signing of the Agreement for Lease. With the changes, HDB will now “disburse the grant before the key collection for their new flat”.
“This will help to ensure that the buyers are financially ready for home ownership,” explained HDB.
HDB will also set up the Home ownership Support Team (HST) that will advise rental tenants who are ready to purchase a flat on their housing budget and options, the schemes and grants available to them, as well as the flat-buying process.
Additionally, the Fresh Start Housing Scheme will also be enhanced.
To help Fresh Start Families, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) will appoint a service provider that will run the support programme. Flexibility will also be given to families that “may not qualify for Fresh Start but demonstrate good potential and motivation for it”.
“The age limit for the youngest child will now be increased to age 18 to benefit more families,” revealed HDB. It noted that the new age limit will also apply to the Parenthood Priority Scheme (PPS) and ASSIST, or the Assistance Scheme for Second-Timers (Divorced/ Widowed Parents).
Meanwhile, divorcing parties looking to apply for a flat “will no longer have to wait until they have obtained the Final Judgement of divorce”.
“Instead, starting from the May 2019 sales exercise, divorcing parties can apply for a new flat from HDB if they have obtained an Interim Judgement of divorce and have settled the ancillary matters on their matrimonial property, and the custody, care and control of their children,”Yesterday an article came out from CRN.com titled
My first reaction was ‘Satya praises RedBit’? Then I read the article and he was also ‘fascinated’ by what we did!
Imagine, I was having dinner with my family, while reading that the CEO of Microsoft, the leader of a $2T company was fascinated by what we at RedBit, a 20 person company, was able to do with technology! As a long time Microsoft technology user, a 15 year Microsoft MVP imagine the feeling when the CEO of Microsoft calls out the work your team at RedBit is doing!
So what was Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft fascinated about? To quote the article
“They went around and essentially created a system of connecting all of the food, solving the hard challenge in the pandemic: How can they scale a nationwide effort around food security?” Nadella said. “That was fascinating.”
This is the work we do with Second Harvest and the Food Rescue platform. The work that won RedBit the first ever Microsoft Partner of the Year for Community Response and finalist for Social Impact at a global level. At a country level in Canada we won Social Impact Award with Microsoft Canada.
Satya even presented our award for Partner of the Year. Even though it was virtual I still imagined being on stage!
If you want to read more about the story see Urgent tech overhaul speeds efforts to get surplus food to millions of people who need it.
A lot has happened since the award. To recap here are some of the stats from March 2020:
As of March 2021 here are some new stats
A 334% increase in the amount of food donated and provided to communities in need!
Did you notice the amount of greenhouse gasses averted? This is a by-product of redirecting food from landfills and into peoples plates! I recommend reading The Avoidable Crisis of Food Waste which is a report done by Second Harvest.
So how was this done? First and foremost it was the amazing people at Second Harvest who are driven by the vision of No Waste. No Hunger.
Second, the amazing people at RedBit from PMs to developers to designers who always find a way to do great things and to make the technology fit the people, not the people fit the technology!
We continue to work with Second Harvest and we also recently released the new version of Food Rescue platform and deprecated the legacy version (only about 2 years old). We re-launched mid-March 2021 and one comment was
It went so smooth we forgot to celebrate!
All of this built on top of Dynamics 365, Power Platform and Azure. Custom systems doing what the system needs to do which is help people. Not only help people in need during a pandemic (yes unfortunately we are still in a pandemic) but also help people running and managing the program.
And this is how technology should be. It should be seamless. It should be natural to peoples everyday processes and not get in the way of work. And this is how we build software at RedBit, keeping people in mind because it’s people that make things happen everyday. Technology is a tool to help facilitate what needs to happen.
It was a great way to end the day yesterday and start the day today! I have always agreed with Microsoft’s mission statement which is
To empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.
Microsoft provides the tools to allow partners like RedBit to deliver digital solutions that impact peoples lives.
Hopefully when the pandemic is under control and somewhat over, the entire RedBit team will have the opportunity to meet Satya ... maybe he or some of his people are reading this and will pencil us in 😊

I live with an aim that all people should be informed what is happening around in an age of information with the right to know as well. We should all work for the benefit of the mass for they too have the right to information and education is the main tool.
This is one of the guiding principles of Jigme Tshewang, a member of the audio podcasting project organized by the Bhutan Centre for Media and Democracy, a 2013 Rising Voices grantee. As a student at Royal University of Bhutan in the Media Studies Department, Jigme took part in one of the audio podcasting workshop at Sherubtse College, Kanglung, District-Tashigang, where he learned about the basics of developing a script, recording, and editing.
Originally from the Pemagatshel District, he now lives in the Southern part of Bhutan known as Samdrup Jongkhar which is an approximately one day journey from his college.
In an email interview with Rising Voices, Jigme said he found audio podcasting especially interesting because of one's ability to tell a story more effectively than in writing. Audio also has the potential to reach a larger audience because of its accessibility to those sectors of society that may be illiterate. These audio podcasts can also be distributed via local community radio stations and providing those without internet access the opportunity to hear different points of view.
Jigme Tshewang
Regarding some of the challenges that comes to podcasting, Jigme found that it was challenging finding people willing to share their views. He said, “Bhutanese people are not open minded when it comes to sharing their problems.” However, he did find enough people willing to use their voices to discuss matters important to Bhutan's democracy.
While podcasting remains Jigme's primary interest, he is also immersed in the world of blogging and social media. His blog covers some personal reflections, and he tweets at @jigmetshewang.
All of these new online experiences online are part of his belief that more people should know about his country, Bhutan. He said:
I want the world to know that Bhutan is known as the “Land of Happiness” with its intact time tested culture, pristine environment with the only Constitution in the World which commits to preserve and protect minimum of 60% of the total area under forest cover for all times to come.
Our Buddhist principle of simple living with contentment makes our people lead a happy life and we truly value the development philosophy of our Fourth King who said “Gross National Happiness is more important than Gross Domestic Product”. To us material and physical comfort is not everything and we value unity in living and peace in the community.

Wexner made the comments during L-Brands investor day in Columbus at the Hilton Hotel at Easton Towne Center in northeast Columbus.
Calling Epstein’s behavior “abhorrent” and “something that we would all condemn”, it was clear Wexner was focused on distancing himself from Epstein and the negative press that’s been following him since these recent allegations.
They’ve raised questions about what Wexner knew, if anything, and what connection Epstein did or didn’t have with L-Brands. Shares of the parent company of Victoria’s Secret and Bath and Body Works are down 35-percent compared to this time last year.
Before getting down to business, Wexner addressed shareholders and the questions about what he knew by referring to himself as a victim.
“Being taken advantage of by someone who was so sick, so cunning, so depraved, it’s something that I’m embarrassed that I was even close to,” said Wexner.
The 82-year-old is the longest serving C-E-O among Fortune 500 companies.
Epstein committed suicide in a New York jail cell facing federal charges of sex trafficking underage girls.Series: Coronavirus
The U.S. Response to COVID-19
Kurt Thigpen clenched his hands around the edge of the table because if he couldn’t feel the sharp edges digging into his palms, he would have to think about how hard his heart was beating. He was grateful that his mask hid his expression. He hoped that no one could see him sweat.
A woman approached the lectern in the center aisle, a thick American flag scarf looped around her neck.
“Do you realize the mask, the CDC said it’s only 2% effective?” she demanded. “You’re failing our children, you’re failing our country, you’re failing our students’ future ….”
Thigpen fixed his eyes on a spot in the back of the blue-and-green auditorium. He let the person speaking at the lectern fade. It will be over soon, he told himself.
A dark-haired woman in a red vest removed her face shield as she moved to take her turn at the mic. As she began to speak, the school board employee responsible for queuing up public commenters interrupted: “Ma’am, I’m gonna have to ask you to please keep your shield on —”
“No, you’re not the boss of me, you work for us, I can’t breathe with it on —”
“Ma’am —”
“Don’t you dare cut my microphone —”
The crowd cheered. Thigpen focused on his breathing.
It will end soon, he told himself. It must. His sweat turned cold under his suit.
“The science isn’t there, take the kids outta the masks and let’s move on.”
It was March 2021, Thigpen’s second month as a school board trustee in Washoe County, Nevada. He had planned his campaign around local issues like improving the district’s diversity and equity policies and fixing an intersection where 20 students had been injured in traffic.
Public comment periods at school board meetings felt endless. Parents’ angers — over masking, over politics, over the “LGBTQ agenda” — fed off each other.
“I came here to speak about your fascist propaganda and ideology …”
He concentrated on making it to the next break period. His thoughts had begun to turn toxic. Why am I not good enough? Why am I the one struggling? They would turn darker. I don’t want to be here anymore. If something happened to me today, that would be fine.
“We will work tirelessly to remove you if you don’t focus on what’s important ….”
When the eight-hour meeting finally ended, he would drive home and pull off the suit and rip off his shirt. He would only take care with his rainbow tie, resting it gently in the closet. It still hangs there today. He would close the door, lay down on his bed, and let himself cry.
The stories of cruel, seemingly irrational and sometimes-violent conflicts over coronavirus regulations have become lingering symptoms of the pandemic as it drags through its second year. Two men on a Mesa-to-Provo flight got into a cross-aisle fight after one refused to wear a mask. A Tennessee teenager asking his school board to impose a mask mandate in honor of his grandmother who died of COVID-19 got jeered by the crowd. A California parent angered by the requirement that his child wear a mask allegedly beat up a teacher so badly that the teacher had to go to the emergency room. An Arizona father showed up to an elementary school with zip ties, allegedly intending to make a “citizen’s arrest” over COVID-19 rules. A Missouri medical center has distributed panic buttons to about 400 employees after an increase in assaults on health care workers by people frustrated over coronavirus-induced visitation restrictions and long wait times.
Many of the altercations have begun over masking because, unlike your vaccination status, a mask is right there on your face. Depending on your point of view, the mask can symbolize an erosion of personal freedoms or a willingness to protect others, a society that accepts tyranny or one that embraces science. A person’s reaction to a mask — or the absence of one — can be driven by an entire network of beliefs and emotions that have little to do with the face covering itself.
“What the hell is happening?” said Rachel Patterson, who owns a hair salon in Huntsville, Alabama, and who has been screamed at, cussed out and walked out on for asking clients to don a mask. “Like, I feel like we are living on another planet. Like I don’t — I don’t recognize anyone anymore.”
On Julie Simanksi’s first day of teaching for the fall 2021 semester, she tried to get her students to wear masks using the only method she was allowed: an emotional appeal. Simanski teaches at Des Moines Area Community College in Iowa. By state university policy, she can’t instruct her students to wear masks. Almost none did.
Simanksi told her students about her 20-year-old daughter, Olivia, who has a neuromuscular condition and requires 24-hour care. She didn’t know how Olivia’s body would cope with the virus. She was scared.
That night she sent an all-class email. She attached a picture of Olivia, smiling to her gums in blue sunglasses.
“I cannot mandate you to wear a mask in my class,” she wrote. “However, for the sake of my daughter and potentially others, I will make a continual plea to wear one.”
Simanksi brought a box of paper masks and put them in the back of the room. Some students took them. In each of her two sections, she has a group of four or five students who will not put one on.
“I’m surprised and I’m disappointed and a little bit angry that they just didn’t have the compassion to wear a mask for 55 minutes,” she said.
People’s pandemic views aren’t just preferences. They’ve evolved to fundamental beliefs. And when that happens, social psychologists say, people are more likely to accept incivility to achieve what they want.
“When people feel that their attitudes reflect strong moral convictions, that gives them permission to dehumanize those who oppose them,” said Linda Skitka, a psychology professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago who’s researching ideological divides. “And it doesn’t take a lot for the shift into perceptions of good and evil. So if the other side is basically evil, it’s not a far stretch to say it’s OK to yell at them.”
Courtney, a 29-year-old office worker living in Virginia who has asked that her last name not be shared for fear that she might lose her job if she’s identified, sat up on a medical bed surrounded by portraits of expectant mothers and their babies. In one, a brown-haired woman smiled at her 32-week mark, hands cupping her round belly. In another, the woman’s 6-day-old baby lay swaddled in a blue-and-white quilt, eyes closed. Courtney had just listened to her unborn child’s heartbeat. It was Aug. 17, two months out from her due date, and she had never before gotten so far along in a pregnancy without a miscarriage.
Courtney said her doctor went through the standard questions about her physical condition. Then the doctor asked if Courtney was working from home. No, she said. She had to go in twice a week.
Courtney looked at the pictures of the happy mothers. She’d undergone fertility treatment and had two miscarriages in less than a year. Both times, she’d asked herself: Was it my fault?
She knew that, even though she’d been fully vaccinated since May, a severe breakthrough infection could mean a ventilator for her and premature birth or death for her baby. She walked out of the office with a doctor’s note: Either everyone had to wear a mask around her, or she needed to work from home.
She saved a copy of the note on her phone and brought it with her the next time she went to the office. She recalls that as she sat at her desk, a colleague she considered a friend walked through her open door and sat down across from her. The colleague had just returned from a weeklong vacation and hoped Courtney could catch her up on what she’d missed.
The woman wasn’t wearing a mask.
“I actually have this note,” Courtney recalls saying. She pulled it up on her phone and held it out. “Do you mind wearing a mask?”
Her colleague didn’t look at the phone. She didn’t need to mask, the woman said. She had antibodies.
Courtney tried again. She told her colleague she was worried about what the virus could do to her baby. Even if there was no damage, she said, they might have to take the baby after birth to isolate her.
Courtney said that her colleague looked at her across the desk and said: “I’m not worried about it.”
She sat across from Courtney unmasked for the next 30 minutes.
Two weeks later, Courtney’s doctor wrote her another, sterner note: “It is my professional opinion that due to the lack of support for CDC recommended mask wearing indoors, please allow Courtney to work from home for the remainder of her pregnancy.”
Courtney forwarded it to her boss. He replied that he would remind the colleague who had sat in her office unmasked to follow the policy. But she still had to come in to work. They needed staff consistency.
She is due within the month.
If it looks like we’ve forgotten each other’s humanity, it’s because we’ve evolved to do so.
Humans are tribal creatures, and our responses to the pandemic have been tribalized almost since the beginning: A Pew Research poll from June 2020 found support for masking divided along partisan lines. Almost a year after the Pew poll, Fox News host Tucker Carlson urged his supporters to confront people wearing masks.
Because the mask has become so polarizing, the extreme reactions aren’t really about being asked to wear one for an hour. It’s about communicating what side you’re on.
David Chester, a psychology professor at Virginia Commonwealth University who studies aggression, puts it this way: If you see members of the opposing group as human like you, you’ve failed as a tribalist.
“It really makes adaptive sense to treat out-group members not like people, because then it’s much easier to hurt them and to act against them,” he said. “One central piece of intergroup conflict is a switch in viewing your enemies from full-blown humans to dehumanized entities that you do not ascribe all the things that you typically ascribe to a person. That makes conflict so much easier.”
Seeing someone else wear a mask in a grocery store becomes what Chester calls “a threatening proposition from an out-group member.” It triggers anger. And giving in to anger can feel good — especially after months of frustration.
In a viral incident from June 2020, a woman who has cancer was shopping in a Florida Pier 1 when she had a confrontation with another shopper, later identified as Debra Jo Hunter. The incident culminated in Hunter, maskless, coughing in the woman’s face. In a virtual sentencing hearing nine months later, as Jacksonville’s First Coast News reported, Hunter submitted 23 pages of threats that she and her family had received. Hog from hell. I hope your whole family gets COVID and suffers immensely, then dies. Kill yourself.
Hunter’s husband testified on her behalf. It had been a hard couple months leading up to the incident, he said. They’d had a house fire and lost most of their possessions. A family member had been in a boating accident.
No one from the family responded to requests for comment.
“It was like air being inflated into a balloon, and it finally got to the point where she couldn’t handle any more air,” Hunter’s husband testified. “And then she finally rubbed up against something and just popped.”
In a treatise on tempering strong reactions, a prominent intellectual wrote: “I thought the first step was to free a man from his passions.”
The paper was written sometime around the turn of the third century. The author was philosopher-slash-medical writer Claudius Galenus, known today as Galen.
Two millennia later, the fundamental idea holds true. It’s one of the main tools in modern-day cognitive behavioral therapy: Learn how to pull yourself back from getting swept away by strong feelings, and then evaluate the situation with your rational side.
“There’s a lot of research that says that if people think about injustice from a first-person perspective, they’re more likely to respond aggressively,” said Tracy Vaillancourt, a professor at the University of Ottawa specializing in children’s mental health and violence prevention. “If they think about injustice from a third-person perspective, they’re less likely to be aggressive. And it’s because, in a sense, now they pulled back and are able to take the perspective of both parties that are involved.”
On a societal scale, one of the fastest ways for two deeply entrenched, opposing groups to start seeing each other as fellow humans again is to give them something bigger to fight against together. It’s an “Independence Day” sort of scenario, Chester, the Virginia Commonwealth University professor, said: If aliens invaded, countries who hate each other in normal times would suddenly work together against an external threat.
But the external threat with the potential to unite a deeply polarized country, he said, should have been the pandemic. And it didn’t happen.
“I think fundamentally, it’s because we have different perceptions of this pandemic,” he said. “It’s really hard now that it’s so entrenched, that masks are viewed as this group symbol. It’s really hard to get people out of that.”
It’s possible that signals from authority figures — at least the ones you already trust — could sway individual behavior, Chester said. Then again, former President Donald Trump got booed at an August rally in Alabama after suggesting that his followers get vaccinated.
When Skitka, with the University of Illinois at Chicago, saw Trump get booed, she thought it might be too late for even political leaders to temper their constituents’ passions. “We’re still trying to figure out what will work,” she said.
Kurt Thigpen resigned from the Washoe County School District on May 24, citing medical reasons. Later, he wrote an op-ed explaining what he really meant. The anxiety and the panic that had been triggered by the school board meetings had mutated into passive suicidal ideation. Even when the board transitioned to virtual meetings, he could barely get out of bed and make himself presentable for Zoom. He wished he could stop existing. No job was worth that.
“I thought I had things handled,” he wrote, “but my coping skills were no match for the events of the last seven months.”
He had sought therapy and worked with a psychiatrist to find medication. He got diagnosed with ADHD. He learned new coping mechanisms.
The initial reaction was positive. People were angry on his behalf. They wished him well. They thanked him for his openness.
And then the op-ed was mentioned in an Associated Press article on toxic school board meetings around the country. Thigpen had no idea until a friend on the city council texted him. His original op-ed got reshared on Facebook. The commenters rushed in.
“What a whiney person,” someone wrote.
“Where do these woke zombies come from?”
“I have a lot to say to this young fragile individual.”
“Perfect example of a PACB= Professional Adult Cry Baby”
“You have no idea how badly I wanted to stop reading that article, but he is such a trainwreck of an individual I couldn’t stop,” one woman posted. She added: “You know, upon re-reading my post, I apologize for being so cruel. Clearly this man is severely mentally disabled and belongs in an institution.”
No one, Thigpen said, has reached out to apologize.NYC Health Department Gestapo Cracks Down on Calories
Posted by Eric Hazard | 5 Comments to restaurants that did not have calorie counts posted beside the prices on their menu boards.”
American Madness has previously expressed our disapproval of the mandate to post calorie counts on NYC restaurant menus. Chief among the initial concerns was the libertarian notion that the government should have little to no interference of what I choose to put in my body.
Another dissenting view was that calorie counts alone do little (if any) good in determining the health of a particular food item. The concern is the potential for the development of eating disorders as people seek to avoid calories at the expense of nutrition.
Third, was the Byzantine system of compliance and display which would need to be concocted in order to properly disclose “calorie counts.” One day into enforcement, and already our prognostication has been proven right as we are seeing “violations” being issued because calorie counts are improperly displayed. That is because the proper displaying of calorie counts is up to the individual health inspector. The New York Times cites one miserable bureaucratic health inspector named Corey Williams, who was citation happy in issuing calorie-count violation notices to three restaurants yesterday. One unfortunate target of Williams’ unhappiness with life was the Dunkin’ Donuts at 445 Park Avenue South. He said flat out there was no gray area, “[t]his is pass-fail,” according to the New York Times article. And guess what didn’t count as a “pass” in Williams’ book:
Some were already there, though not in a form that was acceptable to Mr. Williams. A small sign on the counter said “80 calories or less in a small.” It also said, “Order sugar substitute & skim milk for lots of flavor, and no fat.” Another sign advertising a 99-cent special on coffee with an egg-and-cheese breakfast sandwich said the coffee had 25 calories and the sandwich, 280. The sign urged customers to add hash browns for another 99 cents. Doing so would add 180 calories, according to the sign.
If the above example is not adequate compliance, they how the hell is Dunkin’ Donuts supposed to account for calorie counts at all? Depending on the day of the week, the lighting in the store, the individual health inspector or the customer’s order; Dunkin’ Donuts could be considered in violation of proper calorie counting.
Guess what folks, this is going to cost restaurants A LOT of money to ensure compliance. And when they aren’t in compliance it will cost A LOT of money to pay out fines because the Corey Williams of the world hate their life and wish to inflict misery on others. And in the low margin business Dunkin’ Donuts operates, do you think they are simply going to internalize those costs? HA! Those costs are coming right back to you, the consumer.
And what about the time health inspectors will be wasting inspecting line items on menu boards? Wouldn’t their time be better spent making sure rat shit is being kept out of my soufflé? What has the more immediate health impact on the city, not properly listing the calories in a cup of black coffee, or a cockroach infestation?
Welcome to our brave new world.

The newest proposal, which I heard from an “Informed Source,” is the distribution of meters which measure the muscle to fat ratio of diners before they are allowed to eat. I don’t know exactly what the parameters of the system are, but when my source went to eat at MacDonalds yesterday he was tested and allowed to eat a small salad without dressing in styrofoam container and a cup of water. Will this be the future?

In my new society there are no calorie counts.

This problem of violations being left to the whimsy of the inspector seems to be a bureaucratic problem across the board. My mother is a licensed New York State Childcare Provider and subject to inspections. She was recently assigned a new representative who cited her for several violations which were not violations according to her old representative.
But the difference in her line of work is that she doesn’t receive a fine, nor is there any punitive action taken right away. She is given time to correct the violation (although the public website lists that she has violations, but I think fails to note exactly what they are).

Yes, but people are getting fatter and something needs to be done. We have an obesity epidemic in this country. I don’t care if McDonald’s is fined. They should be run out of business for all the pain they have inflicted on this country.

Marvel Studios’ Black Widow — the first new movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since the onset of the global coronavirus pandemic — is finally hitting theaters and living rooms this weekend, on the big screen and on Disney Plus.
But between the last Marvel movie and Black Widow there’s been something new: Marvel’s Disney Plus television shows, which are tied much more directly into Marvel Cinematic Universe canon than their predecessors like Agents of SHIELD or Agent Carter.
Case in point: If you haven’t kept up on Marvel’s TV series, Black Widow’s end credits scene is gonna throw a lot of new stuff at you.
[Ed. note: This post contains spoilers for Black Widow and some Marvel television shows on Disney Plus.]
:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19888840/Screen_Shot_2020_04_10_at_9.16.50_AM.png)
What happens in Black Widow’s credits scene?
The fact hanging over all of Black Widow is that the whole thing is a prequel — taking place between Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War — and its main character is dead in modern Marvel movie continuity.
During the events of Avengers: Endgame, Natasha (Scarlett Johansson) sacrificed her life on the planet Vormir so Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) could walk away with the Soul Stone. Since she outright died, and wasn’t caught in Thanos’ snap, she did not return with the other characters when the Avengers used the assembled Infinity Stones to undo his work.
And while Black Widow proper stayed firmly in the past, the movie’s end credits scene give us a reminder of the present, as a current-day Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh) and her dog Fanny visit Natasha’s grave. There, she’s cornered by a newcomer to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus).
:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22448277/falcon_winter_julia_louis_dreyfus_episode_5.jpg)
In the comics, Fontaine is a SHIELD double agent, who eventually defected and rose to command her own evil secret society as Madame Hydra. Her MCU incarnation is still largely shrouded in secrecy. Black Widow was originally going to be Fontaine’s first appearance in the franchise, but thanks to COVID-related release date shuffling, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier premiered before Black Widow, and debuted her first.
What seems clear is that she works for the United States government in some secretive capacity, and she’s preparing for an upcoming conflict by contacting her own recruits. In TFatWS, she made contact with John Walker, and aided him in his transformation from Captain America to the U.S. Agent.
:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22708085/black_widow_after_credits_contessa.jpg)
From Black Widow’s final scene, it seems clear that Yelena has found a place working for the U.S. government — or at least for Fontaine, as she complains that she’s supposed to be on vacation rather than in the field for Fontaine.
But Fontaine has arrived with a more personal mission, and she hands over a file on Clint Barton, Natasha Romanoff’s beloved partner. The Marvel Cinematic Universe viewer knows that Natasha sacrificed herself on Vormir as Clint yelled at her to let him do it instead, but Yelena only has Clint’s word for that. Fontaine explains that this is Yelena’s chance to go after the man who killed her sister, and the scene ends with that promise: Of an inevitable showdown between Yelena and Hawkeye.

That showdown is almost certainly coming this fall in Marvel’s Hawkeye television series, inspired by Matt Fraction and David Aja’s 2012 comic series of the same name. Disney announced that Florence Pugh had joined the cast of the TV show in late 2020.

A Catholic bishop with an anti-gay history has resigned from his post following several controversies involving him covering up for priests who were credibly abused of sexually abusing young children.
Bishop Richard J. Malone, who raised money through the Church to fight against same-sex marriage laws in 2009, got into trouble last year when he released a list of abusive priests that included 42 names. That’s because the actual went as high as 324, according to some reports.
A year later, in September, someone leaked a recording of Malone talking about how he wasn’t going to act on harassment involving another priest, whom he called a “sick puppy.” It’s a pretty troubling pattern.
All that scandal finally resulted in his resignation, as noted by the New York Times:.
Now that is the understatement of the year. There is certainly going to be no healing with him in power.
Malone had previously vowed that he wouldn’t resign, especially because he was scheduled to retire in 15 months — on his 75th birthday, as is tradition.
In case you think Pope Francis did the right thing in asking Malone to step down, however, that doesn’t appear to be the case.
When Malone, 73, returned from the “ad limina” visit in Rome, he issued a statement Nov. 18 restating his position that he had no intention of resigning.
In that statement, Malone said “… it was clear that the pope understands the difficulties and distress we here in Buffalo and I, personally, have been experiencing.”
Reports consistently show that Pope Francis has supported the bishop throughout this controversy. Ultimately, the public pressure may have been too much.
It shouldn’t take this long for those who cover-up for abusers to leave (or resign or get forced out of) the Catholic Church. The Church needs to do a better job of holding its own leaders accountable for their inappropriate actions."DAMS HARRISON NOTE BOOK-FOR PG ENTRANCE”. Ever since its first edition in 1949, Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine has been a companion and reference book for every medical student as well as practitioner. As far as the scenario of PG Medical Entrance exams is concerned, a lot of questions are often handpicked from Harrison. But often there is a time shortage to cover important topics from Harrison before the exam. As the title of the book suggests, it is my “NOTE BOOK” of USEFUL ONELINERS, MOST COMMONS, FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ), IMPORTANT TABLES and CHARTS based on Harrison’s 19th edition is by no means a substitute for text book and is solely intended for the purpose of PG Entrance exams.

Grounded is an excellent survival game from Xbox Game Studios' Obsidian. Already one of the best games on Xbox Game Pass, Grounded is a tough but accessible adventure where you're shrunk down to the size of a matchstick.
Stuck in a 'Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'-style nightmare, naturally, gigantic spooky spiders will make your life in the backyard all the more difficult. With some tips, though, they become a whole lot less scary. Here's how to kill spiders effectively in Grounded.

How to kill spiders in Grounded
Spider slaying in Grounded revolves blocking primarily. There are two types of blocking in Grounded: a passive block, and a "perfect" block. Simply holding down the block button will greatly reduce the amount of incoming damage you take, but you'll still take a hit, which means you could end up poisoned, severely reducing your chance of combat success. Ideally, you'll want to time your blocks close to the moment the spiders strike, which will prevent all damage and also prevent poison procs from occurring.
- There are two types of spiders in Grounded, an Orb Weaver and a Wolf spider.
Orb Weavers have yellow patterned abdomens and skinny legs, Wolf spiders have big hairy legs and brown striped, and are much larger.
Source: Windows Central
- Orb Weavers are far easier to kill, dealing less damage and moving more slowly. They open the fight by spitting webs from their abdomen, which you can easily dodge. Wolf spiders attack more quickly, deal poison damage, and also do a dive bomb attack, which can instantly-kill under-geared players.
- To increase your chance of success, consider getting an Ant Mallet crafted from Soldier Ant mandibles, or at the very least a Sprig Mallet, crafted from needles gathered from a thistle plant. You could also craft some Acorn armor, from acorn parts near the big oak tree.
Approach your spider to aggro it. Its eyes will glow red, and it will focus you with hungry, murderous intent. You can also use a bow and arrow to get some hits in first, using a vantage point to avoid getting hit. You'd need a ton of arrows to kill a spider this way, though. It's far more effective to simply beat them down.
Source: Windows Central
- Orb weavers start the fight by attempting to web you, simply sidestep when they do this. Wolf spiders may jump up for a dive attack. You can perfect block this or run away out of range. Do not get hit, though, because it deals a crazy amount of damage.
- Once the spiders have used their cooldown attacks, they will rear up and try to bite you. With some practice, it's easy to get the timing down. See the video above on how to block into a spider lunge. Especially on a Wolf spider, do not try and get more than one attack in after a block, or you won't have enough time to block the next spider lunge.
Wolf spiders have a far bigger attack range than Orb Weaver spiders, making blocking a bit more crucial. You can hug Orb Weavers and strafe sideways to simply avoid their bites, but it's better to perfect block. If you fail to perfect block, you may get poisoned.
Source: Windows Central
- Hit the spiders in the head as much as possible. Three or four hits with a two-handed weapon like the Ant Mallet will stun them temporarily, allowing for a few free hits or charge up attacks.
- Repeat this process until the spider is squished. Be wary of the Wolf spider, since it will try to dive-bomb on you again after a few seconds into the fight. Orb Weavers only try to use webs again if you run out of range.

Oh and one more tip: watch your back!
Once you have killed the spiders, you can harvest their parts to make some mighty weapons and armor, so don't forget to loot!

Digest powered by RSS DigestCreating the Ultimate Northwestern Quarterback
As the 2021 Northwestern Football season creeps closer, a lot of talk has focused around the quarterbacks. On August 17th, head coach Pat Fitzgerald officially named senior Hunter Johnson as the game one starter for the 2021 season, over fellow senior Andrew Marty and sophomore Ryan Hilinski.
While hopes remain high for quarterback play in 2021, Fitzgerald did answer some questions about who the ultimate quarterback for Northwestern could be. In other words, traits and attributes that would make the perfect quarterback.
His answer included the likes of Steve Schnur '96, Dan Persa '11, Clayton Thorson '18, Mike Kafka '09, Kain Colter '13 and Peyton Ramsey '21.
"I probably take a little bit of everybody," Fitzgerald said. "You'd take the leadership of guys like Schnur and Persa, the arm talent of guys like Thorson and Kafka that had big arms that could make all the shots. You take the athleticism of Kain, you take the moxie and the leadership of Peyton that's a pretty good crew right there"
This list includes players that Fitzgerald has both played with and coached, and truly encompasses many different play styles of a quarterback. Let's take a look at what that mock up could look like.
Leadership
Being a leader is par for the course when one ventures into the life of a quarterback, as the basic requirements for the position call for control and guidance. The quarterback handles the ball on ever play, signals when to start and must execute a handoff, pass or decide to make a run for it and the game is reliant on this decision making ability. When looking at Northwestern history, team success is not always indicative of strong leadership from a quarterback, but it's safe to say that having a quarterback who asserts himself as a leader has never hurt.
Schnur was a winner. He led the Wildcats to two Big-10 Championships and a Rose Bowl appearance in 1995, and finished his career with a 19-8 record as starting quarterback. These numbers are even more impressive considering that the Wildcats were a struggling program for much of its existence and this period set the tone for continued improvement and led to the bright future that lies ahead in Evanston. It's also notable that Fitzgerald was Schnur's teammate on those teams, which further proves his leadership ability.
Persa was a stud for the Wildcats on the field, throwing for over 5,000 yards and rushing for over 700 in his three years of seeing action, including two years as the starting quarterback.. Whats also impressive is how he was a two-year captain and also made an impact on special teams during his redshirt freshman season. Persa did everything a team could ask for.
Ramsey came in as a graduate transfer student from Big-10 foe Indiana University, and won the job through his gritty attitude and workhorse mentality. He led the Wildcats to a Big-10 Championship appearance against Ohio State and a Citrus Bowl Victory over Auburn University. The Wildcats finished ranked 10th in the country after the season ended, and Ramsey's strong leadership ability certainly contributed to his ability to take over the offense and lead it to success.
Arm Talent
When thinking of elite quarterbacks, arm strength is a true game changer. While many signal callers are able to be successful through intelligence and strategically finding weaknesses on the defense, having the ability to gun the football all over the field is certainly a huge perk.
Thorson was a problem for Big-10 defenses in his four year career as the starting quarterback at Northwestern. He possessed a terrific quarterback build at 6'4" and 226 lbs and used this to the tune of over 10,000 career passing yards, 61 touchdowns and averaged about 200 yards per game. He also got the job done with his legs as well, with over 400 yards and 27 rushing touchdowns to his credit..
Kafka was the man before Persa and was also gifted with a great quarterback frame, standing at 6'3" and weighing 230 lbs. He only had one season as the starter for the Wildcats, but certainly made the most of it by tossing nearly 3,500 yards and 16 touchdowns, as well as an efficient 64.8 completion percentage. Notable, Kafka twirled 532 yards in the Outback Bowl against Auburn, showcasing his ability to use his natural talents to put the Wildcats in contention for a victory.
Athleticism
Having a big arm is a plus for a quarterback, but being able to run and being a versatile option is a weapon that many college coaches salivate over. Colter played significant snaps at quarterback and wide receiver during his time in Evanston and was elite at every aspect. He produced 2,160 yards and 18 touchdowns in the air and 2,180 yards and 28 touchdowns on the ground as a quarterback and 683 yards and four touchdowns as a receiver. His ability to be extremely versatile was a huge weapon for the Wildcats during his career.
Conclusion
It's obviously difficult to create the ultimate quarterback for any team in college football, but from Fitzgerald's answer it appears that a quarterback with good size, a big arm, strong legs and a winning attitude would pass the test. This sounds a bit like Cam Newton during his time at Auburn, but who knows, maybe it is someone in the quarterback room right now!

THE ex-partner of Scots dad Alan Jeffrey who vanished in Tenerife has urged him to come home — a year after his disappearance.
Kimberley Toner begged for help ahead of the anniversary as she revealed her daughter Savannah, four, is desperate to cuddle her daddy.
She told how the past 12 months without Alan, 25, had been the “worst for his family, Savannah and herself”.
She wrote online: “One full year since my girl got to be in her daddy’s arms.
Sis of missing Scots dad in Ibiza says he's vanished without phone, wallet or passport
“Never did anyone imagine we would be nearly a year gone and still no news.
“I remember Savannah being so excited to tell her dad she was a big four-year-old and now I’ll soon have a distraught five-year-old who only wants one thing and that’s her daddy home.”
She added: “I’m begging, keep sharing so we have the best hope of finding him.”

Concretely, these are the 7 attributes of leadership that I expect my employees to have:
1. Solidarity: A leader breathes through her group. A true leader knows how to work in groups, and should try to understand the problems of other workers. In sound groups, solidarity among members is a symmetrical relation. Solidarity is the first step a leader should take in order to gain the respect and attention of her teammates. Leaders exhibit strong confidence in the ability of the other members of the group to meet the work’s expectations.
2. Modesty: gain it. Modesty keeps the leader from exerting the fake leadership coming from authority of position. The true leadership is NOT associated with positions of authority (but obviously the converse has to be true if the organization is to succeed.)
3. Self-confidence: her recur to the masterpiece by. This is the agglomerative attribute of leaders. Albeit leaders are oriented to their work (and not to their self-exaltation), they are a symbol of the group, which may easily mean that they are a symbol of your company. This way, leaders constitute an external (and internal!) representation of your business. And, as I want the best representation, and the best results for my company, I like to accept and work with leaders. True leaders.

The Pittsburgh Steelers organization throughout history has produced some of the best defenses in the history of the NFL. The 2020 Steelers defense will fit right into that history. They were a big reason why the Steelers went 11-0 to begin the season. Unfortunately, the Steelers offense could not give them much help. The Steelers ended up spiraling after the Washington Football game and eventually went 1-6 and were eliminated by the Browns in the playoffs. That was an embarrassing loss. I would put that playoff loss next to the Tim Tebow loss in Denver as being one of the worst playoff losses in Steelers history.
Peter King recently sat down with Mike Florio and discussed what the Steelers need to do to be contenders in 2021. King said he would line up 12-15 teams and he would take the Steelers as being a team to contend because they have Ben Roethlisberger and a championship defense. Even if Bud Dupree leaves in free agency King feels the Steelers defense will remain a Super Bowl caliber defense.
The problem Peter King has is the AFC North teams are getting better each season. With Joe Burrow coming back and the Bengals coaching staff knowing they have to start winning in 2021 they will become a threat. King says the Browns and Ravens are already a threat to the Steelers. He feels the Steelers can win the division, but they also could finish 4th in the AFC North as well.
If everything goes right like the first 11 weeks of the 2020 season King says the Pittsburgh Steelers can be a Super Bowl team in 2021. Florio says the Steelers need to find a Franco Harris this year in the 2021 NFL draft. That would be the first step to making the Steelers a contending team because it doesn't feel like any of the running backs they have right now give them what they need to help out in the running game.
King says one of the biggest problems with the Steeler's running game is that James Conner has been hurt every single year since becoming the starter in Pittsburgh. That is true. Conner has not played a full season with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Not only do the Steelers need a workhorse in Pittsburgh... They also need offensive line help too. If the Steelers can give Ben Roethlisberger a new best friend in the backfield, an offensive line that can protect the pass and help the running game alongside their championship-caliber defense then the Steelers can definitely become a Super Bowl caliber team in 2021.Aqua Nera

I now realize that I am pretty focused on promoting myself – I overshare my blog on Facebook and Twitter. I email all kinds of people if I have a book coming out. I try to generate an audience, all in the name of me, me and me.
But how much time do I make for promoting others?
Today I am going to direct you to someone who is focused on that very thing – Ken Mueller and Inkling Media. Once a week they have Others First Friday, a blog post designed to promote some of the non-profits or other inspiring people doing good things in our world.
Click on the link HERE and you can check out the organization being promoted – it’s an example of a very sad story turning into something that could potentially help a lot of people.
Of course, today I’m the one writing the guest post which means this is just another example of me promoting myself.
It’s a sickness.
Honest question – I don’t want to steal Ken’s idea, so how could I use my own blog to promote other folks or provide some kind of service?
Haha man, I’ve basically stolen Ken’s idea without realizing it. I just stopped writing a bi-monthly feature for a newspaper about, well, nonprofits or other inspiring people doing good things in our world. Seriously, that was the stories’ description to the T. Now I’m doing something similar on my blog with the Awesome People Series. Right now the APS is about people who have impacted my life, and explores what makes them awesome in their own lives, but I envisioned branching out eventually into something similar to my old features for the paper.
It’s tough, though, not to self-promote like crazy.
How could you use your blog to promote other folks, or provide some kind of service? Hmm. Maybe free writing tips once a week or once a month or something. Or reviewing things that have helped you as a writer that you think will help others. Or you know, something along those lines. People like free stuff. Maybe you could just give away gift cards, haha.
Oh, and by the way, to answer your question, just be yourself and promote people when you genuinely feel like it. You write about many things and bring up many topics that are not just about you, so in many ways you are often “promoting” others.Pollution is a product of our consumer lifestyles
Opinion
Thank you for the excellent article, Trash and treasure (Culture, 12 November), which quotes a museum curator: “We are arguably living in the waste age.” Waste is just part of the story. We are living in the age of consumerism: resource extraction (pollution), manufacture (pollution), transport (pollution), use (planned obsolescence) and waste (pollution). Pollution goes in lock-step with economic growth, driven by consumerism.

$719.95Little Annie Rooney (1925)
“OUR MARY – As you like her best—a broth of a brat ready to fight at the drop of a hat—and drop the hat!”
Director: William Beaudine
Cast: Mary Pickford, William Haines, Walter James
Synopsis: A tough slum girl faces a crisis of the heart when the boy she loves is accused of shooting her cop father.
Presumably, by 1925 the mere appearance of Mary Pickford in a movie was enough to ensure its box office success because the makers of Little Annie Rooney clearly felt that there was no need for anything other than an arbitrary storyline to fill out the more than 90 minute running time. It opens with Mary and her gang engaging in a fight with a rival gang that lasts around 20 minutes. Bricks are thrown with abandon, but no heads or bones are broken, and anyone who gets in the way of a missile simply rubs their head before returning to the fray.
We’re then treated to a long, drawn out sequence in which Annie’s home life is explored. She’s the daughter of a cop (Walter James), with whom she lives in a modest apartment with her older brother, Tim (Gordon Griffith). At 33, Pickford was just ten years younger than her screen father, and actually fifteen years older than her ‘older’ screen brother. Of course she doesn’t, for one minute, convince as a twelve-year-old but the 1920s audiences apparently lapped her up in these kind of roles. In fact, her previous few movies, in which she had played fully grown women, had all bombed, and Little Annie Rooney marked a return to a proven formula in order to recover Pickford’s position as a major star.
Although Little Annie Rooney was a box office hit it’s an achingly dull film for most of its running time. This is largely because it’s virtually plotless, and relies entirely on the charisma of its star to pull it through. While this might have been fine in the 1920s, today Pickford’s allure is considerably less than it was back then, and contemporary audiences will gain little from it. Things do improve in the film’s final act, but Pickford wrings every ounce of emotion from a situation that must have been cliched even in 1925. Unless you’re a diehard Pickford fan, this is definitely one to avoid.

Summary of Free water clearance
Free water is defined as distilled water that is free of solutes. In the nephron of the kidney, free water is generated in the diluting segments, which are the thick ascending limb and the early distal tubule. These sections are impermeable to water, thus solute is reabsorbed without water. Measurement of free water clearance provides a method for assessing the function of the kidney.

In the preceding post, we touched upon some major work and lifestyle choices that new attendings face. A few years of continuing to work, live, and spend like a resident yields financial dividends early on that can compound over a career.
I likened the training of a physician to the lifecycle of a caterpillar, with a new attending being the butterfly emerging from the dark chrysalis of residency. Making some good work/life choices helps to dry your wrinkly-new-attending-wings for flight. In the next two posts, we are going to learn to navigate through some of the financial winds that can buffet you around.
The big forces that can blow a new attending off course and how to deal with them.
Your personal and professional finances will intermingle. So, there will be some overlap. However, for this first post, we will focus on the personal financial recalibration needed upon entering practice. Next week, we’ll shift more to the business side of starting a medical practice.
#1 You need to read this post and get educated.
Duh. That is why you are here. Well, that and the funny pictures and questionable jokes. I am stating this upfront because most docs find finance a bit [gasp] boring and I want to motivate you to keep reading. Plenty of people want to sell you their services and share in your newfound pay raise. They will be very motivated.
Since financial professionals are making money for providing you with their expertise, they can have biases towards their “products” and services. You do need the expertise of many of these professionals, but it pays to be an educated client. This is why we need unbiased physicians to help teach physicians about what to look for in choosing the right professional help. Plus, the basics of the advice or services they provide.
Unfortunately, this is not generally covered in medical training. So, here we are bravely venturing into the eye of the storm.
#2 Take a look at your debt and deliberately plan how to deal with it.
Winter is here… The debt millstone has hung around the necks of medical students and residents’ heads for long enough that some are oddly numb to it.
In medical school, the vast majority can’t really pay it down. The best you can usually do is focus on not racking up more debt than needed. That is behaviourally difficult due to the ease of using a line of credit (LOC) now coupled to the promise of future riches to pay for it later.
In residency, you actually have an income. Some residents do nibble away at their debt, but the magnitude of it can still be overwhelming. Like micturition into the ocean. Continuing with that medically sopissticated analogy, early independent practice is like getting a two liter bolus of saline – you now have both the urgent need and means to pay down that ocean of debt rapidly.
Debt Consolidation
The first step is to look at your various debts (LOC, student loans, consumer debt) and consolidate them to the lowest rate. This generally means putting it on your LOC, if you have the room. Most medical students or doctors can get a line of credit at prime for personal LOC or sometimes prime -0.25% for corporate. Many docs will have already consolidated their debts to a LOC in residency, particularly if student loan repayment becomes an issue.
Consolidating to a LOC has the advantages of:
- Lower interest rate: Canada Student Loans are at Prime +2%, OSAP is Prime +1%
- Simplicity: All of your debt in one place
- Flexibility for payments: You can often just pay the interest if needed or make larger payments when able.
The main disadvantage to consolidating to your LOC is that it may cap your total access to credit. For example, if you have $70K on your $100K LOC and put your $30K student loan onto it. Then, you don’t have any more easy line of credit space.
If you incorporate, there may be some other strategies like using a share-holder loan. However, that is a complex one and will warrant a separate post at some point. Finding a good accountant is definitely a prerequisite for considering this approach.
The Bait and Switch
Be aware that some banks will send you an innocuous looking letter post-residency that your line of credit is changing from a “Medical Student LOC” to a “Professional LOC”. Be sure to read this and negotiate the best deal for yourself.
The default position is usually to start making repayments plus an interest rate increase. Sometimes monthly fees on top of that. Again, the goal should be Prime or Prime -0.25% with no monthly fees.
To find where the deals are, do a LOC search on the Facebook Group page. It may take some persistence and the right contacts.
Make a Debt Repayment Plan
If you still have debt, the main dilemma with a larger income coming in should not be what to buy with it. It should be: Do I put the extra money towards paying my debt or towards investments?
#3 The Pay Debt vs. Invest Debate
There is an argument that with interest rates so low currently, that it is better to not pay off debt. Rather, invest the money and earn a higher return. The mathematical argument is that Prime is currently 3.7% and equities historically return around 8%. It can also be viable with different rates over longer periods. It is a personal decision. However, my advice would be to pay off debt first and fast.
My rationale for why trashing debt is the better option for a new attending:
- 8%/yr is an average return on equities. It fluctuates up and down. You can reduce investment risk, but you cannot eliminate it. The reason for a risk premium in expected equity returns is because they are riskier.
- If investing outside of a TFSA or RRSP, there is also exposure to tax. Even with a debt at Prime minus 0.25%, you need to beat 3.5%/yr after-tax to come out ahead.
- Conversely, paying the debt at 3.5% is like making a 3.5% after-tax return. If you are in the 54% tax bracket, that is like a 7% pre-tax return with no investment risk. Try to find that somewhere else. You won’t.
- Paying down your LOC also gives you room to absorb the unanticipated costs and fluctuating income that is typical when starting a business.
#4 Debt reduction rules, but some investing is also a good idea.
I know, I am so indecisive.
My main reason to suggest this is to get yourself off on the right foot and avoid getting seduced by fee-laden investing.
You can learn how easy it is to manage your own investments to make more per hour than anything you do in medical practice. That will hopefully give you the confidence to strut your investing stuff without excessively expensive investment advisor lingerie.
A great simple way to get started is to open a self-directed TFSA at a discount brokerage.
You can use Q-Trade, Questrade, MD Direct (at MD Financial), or whatever platform your bank uses. Opening an account is as simple as filling out some online forms. It is free.
Put in a few thousand bucks. Or if you already have a mutual fund or “high interest” savings account type of TFSA, have the funds transferred directly (without your personally withdrawing them) to your new TFSA as cash. The receiving institution will do this for you. You don’t even have to talk to The-Nice-Lady/Guy-At-The-Bank and break their heart.
Next, buy a single ETF like XAW (all the world except Canada). The trade commission at a discount brokerage will be under ten bucks no matter how much you buy.
Voila! You are investing and have the start of a broadly diversified equity portfolio.
I suggest using the TFSA first since it is most powerful when allowed to grow over time.
The sooner you start, the more time it has. A broad equity ETF, like XAW, is a good option since equities will likely grow the most in the long run. You just don’t know which parts of the world will do the best at any given time. So, best to own it all! Well, you are missing Canada. But, fear not, Canada is a small market. You can build up Canadian equities later in other larger accounts where the favourable tax treatment actually matters.
Once you do this once, you will realize how simple it is and not want to spend 2%/yr on high mutual fund fees.
The weight of historical evidence suggests that high-fee actively managed funds underperform low-cost passive ETFs. Mutual fund sellers will always tell you that they use the best managers who have the best chance to outperform the market. They can even manipulate the numbers to look better over certain periods of time. Only a very small percentage of individual managers actually beat the market over long periods. I would not bet that I could pick the right one at the right time.
By avoiding the mutual fund fee-trap, you can easily save a million dollars over your career.
You will need to learn to save and invest. In fact, you will have to do so in a massive way.
The delayed start to saving for retirement due to years training, followed by catching up on debt and establishing your life has consequences. Time for returns to compound and grow is the biggest ally of an investor, and you will need a much higher savings rate to catch up. Likely 20%/yr or more of your income.
You may still want to hire a financial advisor using a more cost-effective fee model to help you with the non-investment aspects of financial planning. Or even intermittently for a second opinion on your investments.
#5 Riding The Revenue and Expense Waves
As a resident, you got a steady paycheque every two weeks. You paid your rent and living expenses. With the exception of the occasional theft, vehicular breakdown, or a binge, expenses were pretty consistent. Your financial life was pretty predictable, but some financial reserve was needed. This is now even more true as a new attending when income and expenses both become larger and less predictable.
As an attending, money comes in fits and spurts.
That may be because work comes in clusters – like opportunities for locums or extra shifts in the summer or around March break so that guys like me can go surfing. It is very common when starting out, and even later, to have multiple small or medium jobs that together constitute your practice.
Even with a full-time job at one location, the money can fluctuate. With a fee-for-service model, the income per week fluctuates depending on activity. It also usually only pays out once per month, with a one-month lag time. Stipended work or call stipends can pay out at different times. Sometimes, only once every 3 months, or even once per year.
Expenses will also be more sporadic, and well… more expensive.
Royal College exam fees are a large (hopefully one-time) expense. After walking those hallowed marble-clad halls, you will understand your ongoing fee rates better. Once you pass your exams and start independent practice, the annual membership fees will also jump. Provincial regulatory college dues will also bite and CMPA premiums plump up. Everyone wants to skim money from you. Since you are now a rich doctor, the same things cost more – whether justifiable or not.
The costs of running a practice can also vary. Other than a stethoscope, most equipment was supplied as a resident. Depending on your practice, equipment or supply purchase and maintenance can be significant. Rent is predictable. If you own the real estate of your practice, that brings other sporadic maintenance costs and periodic expenses like property taxes.
One thing that you can control is your personal spending on luxuries.
There is an image of the wealthy physician lifestyle that your can attain. You just need to make sure that you do it in sequence and establish your financial foundation before building your Loonie Doctor House and fill its three garages plus barn with vehicles.
You cannot control the unexpected, but you should expect it.
There are two basic approaches to planning for this ebb and flow of money.
One approach is to build up and keep a buffer of money in your personal and/or business operational account as an “emergency fund“. The downside of that approach is that it is money sitting idle. I prefer to keep a small buffer of about a month’s usual expenses in each and keep my LOC empty and available if needed in a pinch.
Using Your LOC To Buffer The Cash Flow Tides
To use your LOC as your emergency fund, you need to have enough unused space in it. If you have an outstanding LOC debt, you need to aggressively pay it down with any unspent money. You can then put major expenses back on it when they come up. In the interim, you have saved on the interest. It is like depositing money into a “high-interest savings account” – except getting an effective 6-7% tax-free interest rate rather than a 1-2% fully taxed one.
Using a corporation opens the possibility of utilizing a corporate line of credit. It may be easier to get a better interest rate with a corporation. Further, the interest is considered deductible as a business expense for the corporation. So, the interest is paid with pre-tax money. Having a corporate line of credit obviates the need to have piles of cash around in case of emergency.
Two Important Behavioural Pitfalls Of Using A LOC For Your “Emergency Fund”
The first is to remember that, if using a corporate LOC, corporate money is not your money. If you need money personally, that means paying money from the corporation and then the personal taxes on that.
The second is that the LOC is for “emergencies”. You need to have the discipline to pay it off aggressively and only use it for real emergencies. Not because you have a “Critical Vitamin D Deficiency” that only the Mexican sunshine will cure when you don’t have the money to pay for it.
#6 Insure Against Personal Catastrophe
It is important to review your personal insurance because you may now have different liabilities as an attending. When thinking of insurance, you want to make sure that you have enough to cover your expenses and responsibilities. Not having enough insurance is gambling that the unexpected catastrophe won’t happen. Risky idea.
Conversely, you do not want more than you need. Taking more insurance than you need is like betting that your premiums will be less than the unlikely pay-out. Like buying lottery tickets. You are playing the odds against the underwriting department of the insurance company. Who do you think is better at calculating the odds?
Life Insurance
You want enough life insurance that if you were to die that your financial obligations would be met. This means enough to pay off any debt. That debt includes a mortgage if you have one. It is often cheaper to buy enough term life insurance to cover your mortgage than to buy the mortgage insurance affiliated by your mortgage issuer.
You should also plan to leave enough money to pay for your dependents. That will vary based on the age of any kids, the employability of a spouse (if dependent on you), and the desired lifestyle you want them to have. Remember that an insurance payout is tax-free.
Term life insurance is usually the most efficient way to insure for these obligations. The premiums are cheaper than whole life insurance. Further, by the time the term is up, you may have fewer liabilities to insure for with your kids grown and mortgage paid off. Plus, if you have been saving appropriately, you will have enough of your own financial assets to act as your own insurance company.
Disability Insurance
This won’t kick in until several months into a disability. So, it is still important to have access to emergency funds as described in #5. However, with a longer-term disability, this type of insurance is to cover your loss of income. You will want to have “own occupation” insurance to ensure that you don’t have to go back to work in another field.
The amount you need should not be your gross income. If you pay for your disability insurance with personal money, then the payouts are in after-tax dollars. If you are buying disability insurance via your corporation, you do so with pre-tax dollars. However, a payout will be taxed when it passes from the corporation into your hands. Either way, you should plan on enough to cover your business expenses (if they can’t be frozen while disabled) and your lifestyle costs. Consider that your lifestyle costs may change, for better or worse, with a disability.
Umbrella Liability Insurance
This is an extension of your home or auto insurance. It covers for liability beyond those policies and payouts that exceed the usual coverage. Unfortunately, in our litigious society, payouts can be large. As a high-income professional, you are a prime target for lawsuits from everyday life. Fortunately, if you have your home and auto insurance policies with the same provider, there can be some efficiencies.
As a new attending, your personal and professional finances will influence each other.
Kind of like different weather systems colliding. In this post, we traced the big winds of debt, cash flow, and calamity that can buffet you in flight. In the next post, we’ll explore how to best handle our business finances. As new attending butterflies, we don’t want to beat our wings in one place and cause a tornado in another.
Love this series of posts you are starting. Wish it was around when I was finishing medical school as it may have prevented me from making all the mistakes I did (deferment and forebearance and taking 17 yrs to finally pay student loans off).
After you mention it, it was obvious and I can’t believe I never thought of it myself but the amount you save paying off debt is not just the interest rate of the loan. That money is after tax money so you have to reverse engineer the % truly saved with that in mind. When I paid off my mortgage I was at the highest tax bracket of 39.6%. Granted I also got a mortgage interest tax deduction of 39.6% but the overall effect was still a higher “return” than just my mortgage interest rate (which was 5.625%). Just the non monetary reward of peace of mind of being debt free was enough to justify doing it but with this fact you pointed out the difference I thought I lost by not being in the market for that amount is almost negligible.
Thanks Xrayvsn! Me too! The power of the internet.

Hey LD!
The early years are filled with so much change. You make a lot but many of us owed a lot.
I suggest they keep it simple for the initial years. Just live modestly and whack all the debt away ASAP. As for homes, see where your work takes you before saddling yourself with mortgage debt as well.
Work diligently and avoid the lifestyle inflation for a few years as best as you can. It’s a long journey after all.
Hey Dr. MB. Great advice. Medicine is a marathon. Important to get the right shoes and set a good pace.

Great Post!
I gave a talk to a group of Radiology Residents last week and all the themes you mention in this article came up. This is a great place for new staff physicians to start thinking about their finances. I would emphasize the point you raised about whole life insurance. Many in our group have bought policies they didn’t understand and now can’t get rid of. New staff need to educate themselves about financial basics even if they sign on with an advisor. If you understand the basics you might just decide to self-manage and if you decide to get an advisor you will at least speak the language and be able to hold your own.
Thanks Paul! Whole life is a potentially “dangerous” trap to the unsuspecting. It is common, on the surface it is appealing, and it is heavily promoted/marketed. Beneath the surface, it has a low barrier to entry, high barrier to exit, and the fees that drag down performance compared to the alternative strategy of term insurance plus low cost investing are well hidden. It can have some specific roles, like estate planning for a particularly large estate, but they are not issues to even consider until well down the road. Some basic education can help avoid these hazards. A few hours per year effort can save thousands of hours in income loss.

Hey LD!
I am liking this series so far! Am I sensing a future book being in the works? You definitely should publish, and slip it into all those unsuspecting MD Management backpacks. 🙂 That would definitely help solve many of the financial issues that new attendings face.
Half-seriously and half-joking, I would also recommend a new attending physician to have a social circle OUTSIDE of medicine. They may get accustomed to the “doctor lifestyle” of their peers and try to “keep up” appearances that they may not even realize they have a spending problem.
Obviously, if their social circle in medicine are with docs like you and Paul Healey, then no issue at all!
Hey DN! That is excellent advice about keeping your social circles broad. Not only does it give perspective, but it also helps you maintain or develop your non-medical interests or hobbies. When I was starting out, the demands of work and having a couple of small kids honestly occupied all of my time. Having kids also created an easy network of mostly non-medical parents. Largely a parental exhaustion support group early on. As my kids got bigger and my career established, that improved. After achieving financial independence, you want to keep practicing medicine for the joy of it and not because you have nothing else to do or no one to do it with.

Hey LD,
I’m a new attending, and one of the perks I’ve been offered, is to do a split dollar life insurance. This is done via an outside company. My understanding is that some providers here use this venue, as well as some of the executives. The company handling the accounts require 25K a year commitment, for minimum of 3 years. The return is between 1-12%, meaning that if the market goes down, you’re still gonna be up 1% no matter what, on the other hand, you max at 12%, and if the returns are higher, the company gets to keep that. What are your thoughts and experience with these kind of accounts? And how much should I actually put into this account?
Thank you!
Hi YC,
I honestly haven’t had any experience with that. Is this in the U.S. or Canada? Split-dollar life is basically a variation on whole life insurance. The devils would be in the details about who pays what (employee vs employer), who collects a pay-out (employee vs employer), and what happens if switching jobs, terminated, or you simply want out.
It would also be important to know the alternatives to the policy for comparison. Generally, term-life for insurance and self-directed investment accounts for investing are most efficient for most people. Most docs realize later that they would have rather gone that route than permanent life insurance. External employer contributions could tip that balance if the alternative is nothing. Sorry, to be unhelpful, but it sounds like you are looking at a pretty specific situation.
My suggestion would be to get some non-biased third party professional advice specific to your situation if you are thinking about this because it is likely a significant commitment of cash. That will cost you something in the short-term, but the long-term cost of a wrong path is not to be ignored.
-LD
Thank you LD,
You’re correct, this is in the US. Have asked several professionals, but interestingly enough, they have no experience with this type of setup. Have been reading online, and the reviews simply try to explain what it is, without giving an advice in any direction, simply stating this is what this is, and that is what’s it for. Unlike 401K or 403b, where it’s a unanimous vote that it’s a great investment, it’s not clear if the split dollar is an actual safe and smart form of investment.
As a new attending, I am trying to be smart about finances, but I have to tell you that the information out there is not so easy to get, and even if I go to a “professional” (which I have), the trust is close to nothing. The online resources seem to be tainted by large firms interests, which looks like they’re sugar coating everything and have a condescending language aimed at making you feel stupid and that this is beyond you. The only way out I see right now, is invest with a financial advisor, but at the same time start investing my self with a small amount, and figure out how things work, and hopefully later – transfer all the assets invested with the “professional” to my “self” managed accounts, so they’ll be 100% under our control.
I guess like in medicine, you need to practice a few times until you get it right, and I’m pretty sure if you can grasp medical concepts, your brains can understand basic economics. I don’t believe “financial advisor” have better brain power then MDs.
Thanks again LD!
Hi YC,
It is surprising how hard it is to find info on some financial products on the internet or to get the details from those who sell them. Two comments on that. One, the products that seem to be the hardest to find the fees or to understand how they work usually have the most to hide. If they are super-awesome, then they would just lay that all out there and shout it from the mountain-tops. Two, products like that which “lock you in” are double scary to me. I would rather go simple and add in later if I felt it has a role. The only way that I would reconsider those two rules of thumb would be if my employer was ponying up a big cash that they otherwise simply would not give me.

Love your blog. There are too many FIRE blogs out there and financial advice focused on regular payroll employees but not for small business owners. Your blog covers much more and is more focused on people who have the potential to earn more and invest more. It covers CCPC and how to do investments within corp vs personal withdrawals etc etc. It is really hard to find. It is a Canadian blog which is a big plus.
Thanks YB! It is a smaller niche, but I think one where big impacts can be made.

Thanks for your website and your superb posts! I am a recently minted attending and although I don’t have student loans I did buy a house and car etc. such that I have taken on a lot of debt (3-3.75% rate) right after graduating residency (didn’t find your blog soon enough). I initially wanted to take out more from my corp to speed up payments but was advised by my accountant that I should avoid the maximum personal income tax rate of Alberta (48%).
You mentioned it is likely better to pay off debt first (as opposed to invest). My questions is would it be better to stay under the max tax bracket and keep retained earning that can be invested through my corp (through horizon etf portfolio) or take more out, pay the max tax, and get out of debt sooner?
Once again appreciate all the work you’ve been doing on your website.
Thanks SF! Excellent question.
The approach to debt is a very personal one. It really comes down to comfort and where you want to allocate your capital. In your case, since you have debt and are choosing to invest rather than pay it off, you are essentially investing with leverage. That is not necessarily a bad thing as long as: 1) Your debt is at a relatively low rate (it is) and 2) You are comfortable with your investing plan and debt level enough that you won’t freak out when your investments temporarily drop (they will). In the very long run, investing with leverage usually comes out ahead mathematically – as long as you can live with it emotionally (debt heightens fear) and not make a behavioral investing mistake because of it. FFMD just did a great review of the math of invest vs pay debt.
Rates won’t stay this low forever (probably but I can’t predict the future). So, you should still make a plan to pay your debt off. You don’t want to jack up your taxes too much to do so, but will need to pay it. One approach to that is to take out enough extra money from your corp to top you up to the top of whatever tax bracket you are in. but not go too far into the next one. You may even want to go up more than one, but the marginal rate really takes off in the upper brackets. That way, you can bleed the money out slowly with less loss to tax. When taking that money out, if you are below $145K/yr, use salary. It has the added benefit of giving you RRSP room to use when you need it. That is my general thought – of course, your accountant is likely the best to advise.

hey LD,
Great blog. Thanks for sharing your time and wisdom.
A little about me:
Early 30s, completed 15months of practice, non-surgical specialist, grossed ~$600K over my first 15months (minus ~20% overhead on average). I worked hard and have been doing better every month (made only $5k my first month of practice, then 10k, then 15k, then….). Incorporated.
No mortgage, no student debt, living in a small house and pay rent in the GTA (killer expensive, trash house costs 1M). Only big purchase this year was a van for the family ~25k$. Trying to avoid the temptations of spending. Haven’t ever touched my TFSA, RRSP.
Life goals:
– time for family and hobbies (running, reading)
– not worry about money
– chase the numbers of wealth just for the heck of it and hit 8 figures. No interest in fancy homes, cars, jewellery, boats, clothes, tech etc.
What advice would you give me as a ‘New Attending’?
thanks again!! <3
PS: your home is beautiful.
Hey Random Doc,
Sounds like you have hit the ground running and are off to a great start. Make hay while the sun is shining (like you are!). Every year that you make lots and spend little at the beginning of your career is worth several years of doing that later because of the compounding over time. Important, so you don’t need to if you don’t want to or unexpectedly cannot later (happens to most of us in some form!). Just make sure to enjoy your family and check-in that they are all on board with the front-loading of work. It is much easier to do now while you are fresh, but you also don’t get back time. Your low spending will do more for you than anything else since earning more is blunted by taxes.
Don’t be in a rush to buy a house. Even though rent is expensive, owning a home is more so. Plus, it locks you in. You can make a better purchase a few years out. Don’t get locked into other costly things like high-fee mutual funds (ever) or whole-life (it has a use, but mostly later if you have built a large estate -easy to get when you need it and hard to get out of if you don’t). Be free.
Thanks for reading the blog and the other piece I would say is to make sure you continue investing wisely – max the RRSP and TFSA and bloat up the corp. I will be having an easy to use tool coming out soon to help with that aspect. I call it Robocorp – I am pretty stoked about it and wish I had had it ten years ago!

Thanks for your reply LD 🙂
Appreciate the advice and feedback.
Sorry for my late reply– I got stuck in the snowstorm we had on Monday. Took me 2hrs to get home and I forgot about my post!The owner of this Cal 25 contacted us to have a winter sailboat cover made for their boat which was being moved to Sagatuck, MI. The winters on the great lakes can be cold and snow fall totals can be in excess of 12″ per event. Instead of draping canvas over the boom and the rest of the hull we fabricated a heavy galvanized steel frame that would sit over all of the rigging and then rest outside of the lifelines. This would ultimately keep the cover off the Cal 25 sailboat itself but also allowed over 6′ of headroom underneath the cover to perform any maintenance or prep work before next season began.
The frame itself acts as a skeleton on top of the boat with a spine and then ribs supporting the winter sailboat cover. For practical purposes of installing and removing, the spine is broken into multiple pieces and joined. Each rib is fitted to spine with a through joint tightened down via screws. The equally spread out weight of the frame assists in stabilizing itself making it an extremely solid support structure. With rubber tips at the bottom of each rib the hull is protected from scratching.
The cover is split into a large forward and aft section adjoining together with a doubled up zipper and velcro flap. With the mast remaining up, we made small collars for each line, nine collars in total. The aft has an oversized access door that fully zippers down allowing large items to be moved in and out with the cover in place.
The beauty of our designs is the ease and quickness that the frame and cover can be installed. The frame is marked as to which pieces goes where and can be reconstructed in 30 minutes. The cover is then unfolded with all of the zippers securing around the mainstay lines. The collars to take time to zipper up and tie off but the install of the canvas should take another 1 hour. The bottom of the cover has connectors for lines made of webbing and not grommets which can scratch up the hull. It may take another 30 minutes to completely tie down the cover to the sailboat’s cradle. The goals is to have an easy to install / removed winter cover that be installed by 1 person in an afternoon.Strawberry and sweet floral notes make up an inviting perfume.

There were other fits and starts and the organizing continued with dozens of rallies and meetings. The Coalition raised the possibility of accessing a low-interest federal financing program Qualified Zone Academy Bonds (or QZABs) to restore the building for community use. They even got a top official of the federal drug czar’s office to visit and discuss the possibility of plowing money seized from drug dealers – known as asset forfeiture – into the Armory. (This was done at two armories in Manhattan, which are now sports and recreational facilities for young people.) But again, it was Rudy's reign.
In subsequent plans, schools, the main reason everyone began working on this in the first place, were pushed to the perimeter of the building since the School Construction Authority said there wouldn't be sufficient air and light if schools were built inside the drill hall. That would be OK if the city and state had come up with a plan to relocate the Guard units that still occupy the non-landmarked buildings on the northern part of the property. But those units are still in place and there has never been a solid commitment to build any schools, with the DOE even absurdly claiming a couple of years ago that there was no need for additional seats in District 10.
Tired of waiting for the city to issue a request for proposals (an RFP was promised by Bloomberg officials in 2003 but didn't materialize until 2006) the Norwood News launched its Armory Clock in July 2005, ticking off the days until the release of an RFP. Assemblyman Rivera, then also the Bronx Democratic chairman, waved the clock at local meetings and he did eventually get Governor Pataki to tour the building in the hopes he would relocate the National Guard from the rear non-landmarked buildings (he didn't). And Deputy Mayor Dan Doctoroff came up for a tour later that year, vowing, “We’re ready to roll.” The RFP was finally issued the following year. That step was celebrated by the newly formed KARA on the drill floor with balloons and lots of speeches by community residents, clergy and union members.
None of the above would have happened without a strong local organizing campaign. And I don't think I'm being immodest when I say that the Norwood News contributed significantly by amplifying local efforts and getting the armory on everyone's radar screen before the grassroots push even began.
Unfortunately, little is recognizable in Related's plan from those original blueprints the Coalition hammered out with Pratt and later iterations from KARA. Related is not calling the project Shops at the Armory for nothing. It’s a shopping mall pure and simple..
What's left is better wages – and calling it a “living wage” is pushing it since $10 an hour is $18,200 before taxes -- for local residents and a less insane development policy that doesn't pad developer's wallets with tens of millions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies without requiring a anything in return.
Perhaps having learned from Related's too-sweet deal at the Gateway Center or feeling a little guilty about falling for the city's promise to replace the parkland occupied by the new Yankee Stadium anytime soon, Bronx politicians have been taking an unprecedented tough stand on the Armory and getting out in front of the Coalition – which packed over 1,000 people into a school gym for an October meeting that mainly focused on the Armory. A new borough president, Ruben Diaz, Jr., has provided spirited leadership in stark contrast to his predecessor, Adolfo Carrion, who was essentially Bloomberg's deputy mayor for Bronx development. The borough' Council members have coalesced around Diaz (though we'll see how tightly on Monday).
Diaz's bold move signals his development philosophy very early in his tenure. At the Coalition's massive October meeting, Diaz called the fight for fairness at the Armory “our new civil rights movement.”
"I want to do business in the Bronx,” Diaz said, [but] “it is not radical to simply say, a) we should protect surrounding businesses and b) we should have jobs and living wages," He added, "You want to do business, we can do business. But business has to be good for everybody.
At the Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee hearing, he testified: “I do want to see new jobs created in my borough. But these jobs must be created in the right way. The old model, that any job is better than no job, is no longer acceptable.”
Diaz has done his part as quarterback. Now Joel Rivera, who has emerged to the surprise of many as articulate spokesman for this issue in the City Council, has the ball.
“In my book, this is an economic exploitation project,” Rivera said in November. “We need to change the conversation with the administration.”
It's a pivotal moment for Rivera, who became an instant politician while he was still a 23-year-old Fordham student when his father, Jose Rivera, backed Gifford Miller for Council speaker and got his son installed as majority leader in return. This is, without a doubt, his most critical political role to date.
There have been reports that Rivera and the Bronx delegation may agree to a deal which would have people who work all day at the Armory line up for handout in the same building (some kind of subsidy that would absolve retailers of actually paying a living wage themselves).
If they do, they'll be ignoring their own eloquent arguments over the last two months.
With their decision on the Armory, Bronx elected officials can lead and even set the development agenda for the city going forward. Yes, that may mean the Armory lies vacant for the remainder of the Bloomberg administration. But we will survive without another cookie-cutter mall – we are not a suburb – and pushing the reset button will allow for a project that is both lucrative for a developer and an investment in our community, it workers, and its young people.
This is the Bronx's chance to change the bizarre development equation that hands over public property to enrich developers but does nothing to lift Bronx families out of poverty. (Click here for a good explanation why Related's argument that a $10 an hour will sink the project is hogwash.).

On Decision Day, Editor Looks Back -- and Ahead -- at Armory Battle
By Jordan Moss
>
nice job... and i'm glad you finally mentioned the filtration plant at the end because you didn't do it earlier in the piece when you talked about why bronx electeds are standing up now. (i was about to get mad!)
but what bothers me here is that this community - and those fighting yankee stadium and the filtration plant - did EXACTLY what you're supposed to do when your community wants to have input in its own destiny.
they created well organized and supported, credible organizations, they intelligently and responsibly studied and researched the projects (and in many cases knew more about it than those who approved them), they properly negotiated and lobbied with officials at every level of government, and (with the norwood news and bronxtalk being part of it) they got publicity to call attention to the issues and their proposed solutions.
and despite all that, here at the 11th hour on the armory, they are still in a position of standing on the outside looking in, trying to get some god-damned respect for their ideas and positions. that's why what BP diaz has done is so significant. it's the fist time in a generation that elected officials - in this case bronx officials - have chosen to back a community's ideas in a fight of this sort on a large-scale project.
also, it's why the choice that appears to be on the table, either say no and have to start again (!) or accept a disgusting deal that is as condescending as it is ineffectual, is so outrageous and despicable.
if these people, who have done everything right from the first day, are still fighting to create their own destiny, then , really, who in our supposed democratic society can?
@Gax: As you say we the people of the bronx have done everything that a people should do to get their voices heard. Yet time and time again big money/business get their way. We need to STUDY & RESEARCH the reasons for this and the ingredient that we are missing in our campaigns shall be revealed. The fact that I am posting this as Anonymous is very revealing too!
Jordan - thank you for the superb analysis and background and your work on publicizing this over the (many) years
Jordan,
This is a great synopsis of the struggle and the role NN and BxNN have played in it. This article really puts the vote in a better perspective and gives some of the newbies to the debate some real context. You've made it clear that the debate is much larger than the supermarket issue.
The City Council Voted No!!!
45 yes, 1 no, and 1 excused!
Next Step: Living Wage for All!
Good job patting yourself on the back
No rejoicing here. This is only a speed bump along the way as powerful interests recalculate. Mark my words, they will wear the people down.

The project concepts and prototypes were finalised last week, which leads on to the task for this week: preparing and building the prototypes. The logistics of preparing 11 prototypes are mind boggling with each project guardian taking charge of ensuring that their ideas become a reality over the coming weeks, and Vannesa, Susan and Brian overseeing their completion. Mary’s project on the ‘Lack of linkages’ in the area is particularly vital at this stage, as her prototype is matching people in the Market’s area with the ‘Lack of’s’ to ensure community buy-in and in the process helping us find the perfect long-term project champions. A number of project overlaps have occurred so further projects have become married to support one another in prototyping. The soft concepts of the prototypes are meeting the hard realities of making them happen, with plans of action, budgets and permissions all becoming hot topics! The prototypes are as follows:
10 Enterprises // 10 Days // 10 Tests – Using a vacant space to showcase innovative ways of how enterprise can transform an area.
Urban Furniture - Creating a destination place where people can pause, spend time, have a coffee, read a book, meet friends, within the Markets area.
City Works – Showcasing and telling the story of the people who make the city work in all levels of the and involving them in a human library event.

In this essay I would like to consider a new project in the Concertgebouw called ‘Classics’ and discuss it within a Hegelian framework. This particular series is meant to attract new people such as Henk & Ingrid to the building, who normally wouldn’t come, because as I argued in my previous essay, they seem to be afraid of the unfamiliar. Now the unfamiliar seems not to be doing that good, so the Concertgebouw decided to fall back on the familiar instead. I have already expressed my (mild) contempt for series in the Concertgebouw such as ‘Night of the proms’ with ‘the Bach Choir and Orchestra of the Netherlands’, for this kind of entertainment – as opposed to what Hegel was referring to, that is, art for getting a better understanding of the Self in order to obtain self-knowledge – turned out not to encourage reflection, but rather blur our self-knowledge or distract us from getting anywhere close to it.
It is my belief that the Concertgebouw was not built for serving this purpose, for exposing ‘music for the millions’, but should rather be considered a breeding place for the unfamiliar. I will try to elaborate on some reasons for grounding this claim. Having said that, of course finding solutions for the decreasing number of visitors are crucial, I just don’t think the Concertgebouw should do that by introducing more kitsch than it already has and I will point out why. The focus will be on the program of Classics, where pieces as Ravel’s Bolero and Strauss’ Radetsky March shine in triviality. It is essential to realise however, that Ravel’s Bolero for instance, is not trivial because of the music itself; there is not a single note trivial in this masterpiece! The frequent use of it (for commercials purposes such as movies and every other kind of entertainment) is. But before I go in on the questions and problems raised, how did art ever become trivial?
Since the presentations of Romantic Art, everything seems to have a place. As Hegel puts it:
“every sphere of life, all phenomena, the greatest and the least, the supreme and the trivial, the moral, immoral, and evil” (594, all page numbers in this essay refer to Hegel’s Aesthetics)
So the trivial has a place as well nowadays according to Hegel. How did that become possible and if we take it literally, what could this place be then in our times? I will argue that in any case it is not the Concertgebouw.
Pre-Romantic Movements
According to Hegel art developed in three stages and since the idea of art can only be grasped if we follow and reconstruct the development of the concept, I will briefly discuss the historical and (necessary) sequence of elements. Art developed from the Symbolic form, to the Classical (Greek art) and culminated into the Romantic; in other words, the Christian form of art. The symbolic form is what Hegel calls the beginning of art in pre-Greek society, but he considered it not yet providing the proper content of art, because the Idea is not worked out well here, its meaning is indeterminate, as the form and the content are not in unity:
“But this striving remained only a quest of the spirit, and therefore, not yet providing the proper content of art” (517)
The disharmony between form and content is overcome in the Classical art form. The meaning of this kind of art is clear and appears in concrete form to the senses, as the meaning of the content is to be form, “because the spiritual was completely drawn through its external appearance.” (517). It is important to realize that the perfection of art reached its peak in the Classical; the spiritual and its external appearance formed the most beautiful unification. Beautiful in the sense that Classical art was the conceptually most adequate representation of the Ideal; the immediate identity of subject and object, unfolded by the spirit:
“[I]n this beautiful unification it idealized the natural and made it into an adequate embodiment of spirit’s own substantial individuality.” (517)
Unbeautiful Christianity
After Classical art nothing could become more beautiful, meaning that Christian art is not beautiful in this context. It is still art, but form and content cannot be unified any longer. This also constitutes an important difference with symbolic art where the content is indeterminate. In Romantic art, it is determinate, but there is more to the content than art can show. To understand this, one could consider the following. Ever since Christianity developed into a prominent religious conviction, God became transcendent as opposed to the Gods in Greek antiquity, who lived amongst the people and where more friendly to visualization in art (beauty in Classical Art) as a consequence. This transcendence separated the Christian God from the world because he was not part of the empirical sphere any longer. According to Hegel this was problematic for art because art was no longer able to understand and give an explanation or representation of the transcendent realm. This is where religion outshadowed art, because it was able to offer a dialectical argument for why God was transcendent: the argument being that God came to the world in the form of Christ and left again to become almighty. Hence, “thought and reflection have spread their wings above fine art” (10), because art could not understand what was going on there due to the complexity of transcendence according to Hegel. An argument was needed now to understand Christianity, or to speak in Hegelian terms, an argument was needed to satisfy our spiritual need for knowledge of the Absolute and precisely this is the reason why art lost its highest status. Hegel refers to this as the end of art in so far as it is not the best intellectual medium any longer for knowledge of the Absolute:
“The peculiar nature of artistic production and of works of art no longer fills our highest need.” (10)
Subjective inwardness and materiality: disharmony once more
The ‘dissolution’ of the Classical ideal appears clearly as dissolution in Romanticism. Hegel emphasizes the complete contingency and externality of the material which artistic activity grasps and shapes in Romanticism. Whereas in Classical art the subjective inner element was related to the external – the material – in a way that this external could be considered the very own shape of the inner itself, now instead it is independent of it; the inwardness withdraws itself into itself so that the material acquires all the freedom to go its own way. The point is that if the subjective inwardness of the artist becomes the essential feature to be represented, the question of which specific material of external actuality and the spiritual world would best embody the heart, becomes arbitrary, in other words a matter of accident or contingency and indeed this is the reason that everything, including the trivial, had a place now. This has implications for Romantic art, which Hegel puts as follows:
“For this reason.” (594)
Once this idea of subjective inwardness came up, the oppositional idea of granting validity to the external world came up as well. Hegel discusses Shakespeare’s plays as an example where he sees alongside the most important interests the most insignificant and incidental ones. In Hamlet the sentries alongside the King’s Court and in other pieces:
“fools, louts, all sorts of everyday vulgarities, taverns, carters, chamber-pots, and fleas (…) in the case of the birth of Christ and the Adoration of the Kings, oxen and asses, the manger and straw must not be left out.” (594)
This meant the collapse of Romantic Art. On one side, there stands the real world in its ‘prosaic objectivity’ and on the other side it is the subjectivity of the artist which can ‘rise to mastery of the whole of reality’ without leaving nothing in its usual context based on his/her subjective opinion, mood, and originality. The religious framework, still significant in Romanticism, as a consequence of the artist’s subjectivity and the lack of faith, is left behind and not taken seriously any longer. The unity between subject and object is not realized in the sensuous sphere. Still, the artist is busy with materiality and therefore bound to the sensuous sphere. He is just no longer dominated by given and determined conditions of content and form, imposed by religion in most cases, but free to do what he wants in both the subject-matter as in the way of presenting it. The consequence however, is that he can never reach stadium of subject-object unity as thinking does. Therefore, his status of artist is not so important anymore and the best way of reconciling with the world now is thinking, not representation (religion) or intuition (art).
Self-reflective times: modern art
Today, whatever we do; we’re doing it ourselves. In Romanticism art had the highest value for reflection and self-understanding, even though the subject was unable to reach the ideal. This is the tragic part of Romantic art: the subject is always longing for something he knows he cannot reach. But this changed with the collapse of Romantic Art. Philosophy would now be the best medium for reflection and self-understanding, as Hegel points out. What is interesting in modern times is the objective/material part of art:
“This material remains for [the artist] the infinite and true element in his own consciousness – a material with which he lives in an original unity as part of his inmost self, while the form in which he exhibits it is for him as artist the final, necessary, and supreme manner of bringing before our contemplation the Absolute and the soul of objects in general.” (603)
So modern art is about objectifying the essence of the artist’s existence and present what he is out of his own supplies. This is the only way the artists’ creations are a result of his individual inner essence, inspired by his material and its presentation, according to Hegel.
I slowly arrive at the subject introduced earlier on, because just as Hegel points out we can’t just simply build a statue as the Greeks did, or paint like they did in the Middle Ages, I believe we can’t just play the same over and over again. Well, we can, but in that case we would not be seriously earnest with the material because we lack the faith. Hegel meant to say we know that religion as such can’t express the inner structure of the world. In my example I think we lack ‘the innermost faith’ of music as such. We know that Ravel’s Bolero has been played so many times that it became a ‘hit’, so we can’t really take it very seriously any longer in present times, and still the Concertgebouw decided to play it some more! This is where triviality comes in; we are not being earnest with the material, with Ravel’s music.
The red carpet
I have shown how triviality developed as a part of art; it was because of the subjective inwardness of the artist that became an essential feature to be represented so that the question of which specific material of external actuality and the spiritual world would become a contingent question. The subjective inner element of Ravel for example was not related to the external in a way that it could be considered the shape of his inner self, it was independent of it as we have seen in the dissolution of the Classical ideal. Thus, the music of Ravel was not trivial itself, but allowed for triviality, which Concertgebouw Classics seems happy in taking advantage of: alongside the most important interests – the music – we see the most insignificant – the red carpet and prosecco.
Unfortunately, we now live in times where the Dutch government is failing in having a proper art policy, mainly because they won’t recognize ‘the universal need for art’ and have a dubious taste, to say the least, themselves (Halbe Zijlstra’s favourite authors: Tom Clancy and Dan Brown). The sad part is that the Concertgebouw contributes to the process of ‘mediocrization’ of our society, because the program of Classics is not about art and its materiality here, about inspiring or enriching, it is about trying to be commercially successful. Precisely because of the inability of making a distinction between prosecco and allegro, it doesn’t seem to me that Henk & Ingrid will be visiting Schubert’s chamber works or a Shostakovich symphony as a result of Classics. So the series is not a solution to the real problem, which is the decline in regular visitors. Playing the Carmen suites or Strauss’ Blue Danube is to serve a commercial purpose only, which is not about the conservation of cultural heritage or stimulation of further and deeper interest in classical music. If people do want to hear this music, it should certainly be possible in places such as Carré or the De La Mar theater for example, where triviality has a place. Again, nothing against this music in the proper context, but here clearly it is not the case and the Concertgebouw should take a stance against this, because as opposed to the theaters just mentioned, art in the Concertgebouw has never been a means to an end, it was about art itself because that’s what it believed in. It was the place where Willem Mengelberg introduced a then quite unpopular Mahler and it still is the place where new music gets exposure and the chance to develop. With Classics on the other hand, art does become a means, the end being commercial success.
The problem is that the Concertgebouw had an excellent reputation up till now, because art has always been strictly separated from commerce. This reputation makes us attract the kind of public that made the existence of the building possible up till present days. The problem with Classics is, apart from it not being profitable at all if we look at the number of tickets sold, that it damages the good reputation, in order to make an extra buck in narrow times. In my humble opinion however, there are possibilities where music still is the most important aspect and where the Concertgebouw does not have to ‘sell out’, such as the Sunday-morning concerts or the modern series (triple A) by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra.The Brockville Museum operates as a Board-run department of the City of Brockville.

For nearly a decade prior to that the Brockville Historical Society had held a “summer museum” in various historical locations throughout Brockville on a variety of local heritage themes. Since 1981 the museum has seen its’ collection grow substantially, and in 1995 expanded its facility at 5 Henry Street. Today the Brockville Museum is entrenched in this community as a vibrant hub of activity.What Everybody Dislikes About Literature Review Introduction and Why
In the sciences, for example, treatments for medical problems are continuously changing according to the most recent studies. Regardless of the topic of concern, you can be certain to receive the best results whenever you seek our assistance. It primarily intends to bring clinical and biomedical research experts together in searching for innovative and sustainable solutions to deal with the several health issues of the nation.
The Dissertation Literature Review Example gives you a great deal of new ideas for an exceptional review. Literature reviews are a foundation for research in just about any academic field. The Critical Review is similar to a literature review, but demands a more sophisticated examination of the literature, as a way to compare and evaluate quite a few perspectives.
Your review should cover a variety of the articles out there. It should be unbiased and does not report any new or original work. It is where you do that, and at its most general is just a summary of the conversation to date.
This will allow it to be a lot easier that you compose the review article. The Scoping Review is frequently used at the start of a report, dissertation or research proposal.
Whether there are a few authors, list the very last names, separated by commas. This literature review template provides a fundamental outline of the sections you should put in your review. The following are a few of the more prevalent kinds of literature reviews.
Finding the literature is frequently the simple part. An introduction is the initial section of a report, paper, book or a study that briefly introduces what will be discovered in these sections. Or, which you require to compose a literature review that encompasses every facet of the literature on your topic.
The 30-Second Trick for Literature Review Introduction
The introduction needs to be brief and captivating. If you’ve used one of the synthesis matrices described in the preceding blog, you’ll be in a superb place to organize your review thematically. Different types of systematic reviews Writing a protocol Any very good systematic review starts with a protocol.
A better approach to organize the aforementioned sources chronologically is to inspect the sources under another trend, including the history of whaling. Chart out the way you can organize the information which you have accumulated. These examples and descriptions of publication types will provide you with a notion of the way to use many works and why you would want to compose a specific sort of paper..
Most are aware it is a practice of gathering information from different sources and documenting it, but few have any notion of the way to evaluate the info, or the way to present it. For your writing to reflect strong important analysis, you want to rate the sources. The narrower your topic, the simpler it is going to be to limit the amount of sources you want to read to be able to find a great survey of the material.
Ideas, Formulas and Shortcuts for Literature Review Introduction
Appropriate websites will change based on this issue, scope, and purpose of an undertaking. Researching your field needs to be your top priority. Identification of the experts on a specific topic.
Students often get confused when it has to do with writing literature review. But if it’s an APA style literature review, it has to adhere to some guidelines which are always important to have into account. As you’re at college, you might be asked to compose a literature review.
Try to remember that that the way that you opt to organise your review will largely depend upon the form of information which essays online you have gathered. Chart out the way you can organize the information which you have accumulated. The aim is breadth as opposed to depth and to receive an overall sense of the size of the topic area.
In the following piece, we’ll be discussing, 1. Learn what has been written on the subject.
A decent first draft should remain messy. Using only credible and dependable sources is the secret to getting a high-quality output. You may now end your search since we’ve precisely what you want.Neon‘s Campaign Fundraising workshop notes.
Fundraising through philanthropic foundations application process cycle based on a funder and fundraisers presentations:
- What you want to do? How far can you get without finding? Plan with a team, people are assets not just beneficiaries. Hope for the best, plan for the worst.
- Find some one who wants to do it. Collect a database of potential funders, look at successful bids. Funders want to hope for a better world, they have an agenda and targets for giving.
- Be able to give a 3 minute pitch then phone ahead of applying to test the water so not to waste everyone’s time on inappropriate applications. Bate the funder to ask questions. Don’t just talk about your self, ask questions about the funder, are you a right fit?
- Request feedback and tweak plans.
- Write the bid, if possible share it with the funder for feedback before submitting. Tips:
- Clarity – application needs 1 sentence explanation. Funders wont spend more than 5 minutes reading an application. Be aware explaining the need is easy but explaining the strategy is more important. I.E. the living wage spent a while shaming employers into committing to the it, this had limited effect. By commissioning research to show that it benefited the business as well as they employees they responded to the positive reputation benefit more than the shame.
- Why will your strategy work? What is your theory of change?
- Every campaign is a series of mile stones i.e. make an alliance of interested groups, work out who your audience is… Where are you in the journey? Why now? What opportunities are arising?
- Why hasn’t your campaign worked yet? Or Why has it? e.g. shifting attitudes, what audience/message. Commission research and evaluate plans. What are your indicators of success?
- Understand your adaptability.
- Why now?
- Niche is sometime easier because there is little competition, if you are working in a crowded field, how are you working with other campaigns? What is your team? Who are you and what legitimacy do you have around this issue?
- Targets – audience can’t be too broad. What particular group? i.e. 5 MP’s and 2 particular special advisor?
- How much will it cost? Value for money is important. Do not ask for more than 13% – 19% core costs, ask for campaign costs.
- What happens afterwards? What follow through? For example how will you get more resources for policy to become practise i.e. will police/councils enforce policy?
- Make sure you have a bank account.
- SAY THANK YOU. Treat them like a friend, listen, be honest & upfront. Be able to say no to funding and make sure you don’t change your plan to fit funders, do what you WANT.
- Evaluate your campaign, get evidence.
- Send feedback from evaluation.
- Back to the start with what you want to do NEXT.

Their struggle is a far lonelier one, made more difficult by federal Medicaid rules that limit the medical treatment covered by that insurance to 60 days past the birth of the child — despite a strong body of evidence that for many women the symptoms may not appear for months and can last for a year or more.
Advertisement
There are efforts in Washington to change the rule, and Massachusetts is among several states that have applied for a federal waiver that would allow its MassHealth program to offer coverage for a full 12 months past a birth. But there’s been no action on either so far.
So once again the pressure mounts on state lawmakers to act to make sure the state’s neediest women can get care for the long haul — even as legislators ponder more sweeping efforts to achieve genuine parity for mental and behavioral health care coverage.
“We’re all on this committee working toward treatment of mental illness and substance abuse disorder just like we cover heart disease and diabetes,” said Senator Cindy Friedman, cochair, with Representative John Lawn, of the Committee on Health Care Financing, which heard testimony Tuesday on the postpartum depression bill and a number of other bills aimed at improving availability and coverage of mental health services.
Friedman and Senator Julian Cyr have been tasked by Senate President Karen Spilka with drafting an updated version of a long-stalled mental health parity bill. House inaction on the sweeping Senate-passed bill allowed it to die on the legislative vine in 2020.

Spilka is vowing to get it to the governor’s desk this year. And Governor Charlie Baker, in a Tuesday speech to the New England Council, pledged to go back at a health care reform bill that would address behavioral health and substance abuse services — probably next year.
Meanwhile, there are some incremental changes that can be made now and can make a difference. And, as Friedman put it at the hearing, “It’s just such common sense to take care of mothers and babies.”
The bill to extend MassHealth coverage for new mothers has wide-ranging support, including that of the Massachusetts Medical Society, whose president, Carole Allen, a pediatrician, called the bill “essential,” adding that inadequate maternal care is bound to lead to greater racial and ethnic disparities. MassHealth patients, she added, are also more likely than private-pay patients to have underlying health conditions even before pregnancy.
Given that MassHealth covers some 35 percent of all births in the state, the matter of providing adequate postpartum depression coverage to those new mothers could potentially impact thousands of women a year.
“Roughly one-third of pregnancy-related deaths occur in the postpartum period, which can last several months; pregnancy-related deaths from preventable causes, including overdose and suicide, also occur more frequently during this period,” according to written testimony from the MMS provided last spring in support of the state’s waiver request.
Representative Liz Miranda of Boston, who filed the PPD bill along with Senator Joan Lovely, said in a statement, “Six out of ten zip codes in the state with troubling Black maternal health outcomes are in my district. It’s time to bridge maternal health care and racial justice to save more Black lives.”

The health care community here is clearly on the same page. New mothers — especially those already facing financial challenges — shouldn’t be forced to forgo treatment that could save their lives just because Washington bureaucrats somehow came to believe two months is time enough for mom to “get back on her feet,” nurse her new baby, and carry on.
Maybe Washington will fix this — maybe not. What is clear is that not another year should go by here in Massachusetts in which new mothers and their families wait for sufficient help. That’s not who we are. We can do better.

Exploring Worcestershire’s great outdoors as must when visiting the County – so why not add a stay under the stars to your holiday wish list.
With great access to beautiful views across the county, camping and caravanning offers the perfect opportunity to experience the Countryside – tepee, bell tent or even a shepherds hut.
These quirky camping options are becoming super popular and are a great option for those people who want something that little bit different for a short break or family holiday (with zero tent assembly required!).
Many campsites in Worcestershire are located near the River Severn, or close to historic towns and local pubs offering plenty of opportunities for exploring and enjoying your stay.
Set within a nine-acre equestrian facility, and surrounded by fresh, rolling countryside, you’ll feel blissfully secluded from civilisation.
Hopleys Family Camping is a beautiful campsite set just outside of Bewdley, in the heart of the Severn Valley.

Many of us reluctantly get up and go to the workplace, then take satisfaction in a job well done. These days, some people have an entitlement mentality where they expect money for doing little or nothing at all. We were designed to do work.The work ethic is important in Western civilization. It was emphasized by the Protestant Reformers who noticed that it is a strong aspect of Christianity. Indeed, the value of work is all through the Bible and goes back to Genesis. Someone can be a construction worker, CEO, musician, ranch hand, stay-at-home mom, working with the developmentally disabled, author, or any of a myriad of professions. There's honor in that, especially when the worker seeks to glorify God..

Reichelt had also lied to the board about this, the company said.
Reichelt could not be reached for comment.
Axel Springer said it would appoint Johannes Boie, 37, as the new chair of Bild’s three-member editorial board.
The announcement came after it emerged over the weekend that journalists at a rival German media group had been investigating allegations against Reichelt but were prevented from publishing their findings.
In a letter dated Friday, four senior reporters at the Ippen media group accused their company and its publisher, Dirk Ippen, of a “breach of trust” for deciding to halt the report, which had been months in the making and was due to be published Sunday.
The Ippen media group said it had nixed the story to “avoid the impression we might want to economically harm a competitor.” It denied there had been any pressure from Axel Springer executives over the matter.
While Ippen held back on its story, The New York Times published a report Sunday about Reichelt’s alleged affair with an Axel Springer trainee. The affair had been part of the probe ordered earlier this year by Axel Springer into allegations that Reichelt had acted in a bullying manner and abused his position of power toward female staff.
Reichelt, one of the mightiest figures in German media, was briefly suspended during that investigation but later reinstated after the company said the probe — conducted by an independent law firm — found his actions didn’t warrant dismissal.
In its statement, Axel Springer said the first investigation never included allegations of sexual harassment or assault against Reichelt, but rather centered around “consensual intimate relationships with female Bild employees and indications of abuse of power in that connection.”
At the time, the company said, a decision was made to give Reichelt a second chance.
“In the context of recent media investigations, new evidence of current misconduct by Julian Reichelt has come to the company’s attention in the last few days,” it said.
“As the executive board has learned, Julian Reichelt still fails to maintain a clear boundary between private and professional matters and has also been untruthful to the executive board in this regard,” the company added. “The executive board therefore considers the termination of his office to be unavoidable.”
It also announced legal steps against “third parties” for releasing confidential business information and private communication with the aim of trying to harm the company and having Reichelt removed.
Axel Springer’s chief executive, Mathias Doepfner, said Reichelt had done “an outstanding job” at Bild and that the company would have liked to continue developing the media brand “with him on board.”
“That is now no longer possible,” said Doepfner, adding that new chief editor Boie “possesses a proven ability to combine excellent journalism with a leadership style in keeping with today’s needs.”
Axel Springer has successfully expanded its business in the United States in recent years. It owns online media company Insider and the business-oriented Morning Brew, and in August it announced a deal to buy the U.S.-based political news company Politico and the tech news site Protocol.DW Hot Sale Continuous LD Conveyor Mesh Belt Dryer/ Equipments For corn starch

The power modulation control of high-voltage direct current (HVDC) links can improve the dynamic security of the power system. Having several HVDC links in a system creates the opportunity to coordinate such control, and coordination also ensures that negative interactions do not occur among the controllable devices.
This thesis aims to increase dynamic security by coordinating HVDC links, as an alternative to decreasing the transfer capacity. This thesis contributes four control approaches for increasing the dynamic stability, based on feedforward control, adaptive control, optimal control, and exact-feedback linearization control. Depending on the available measurements, dynamic system model, and system topology, one of the developed methods can be applied. The wide-area measurement system provides the central controller with real-time data and sends control signals to the HVDC links.
The feedforward controller applies rapid power dispatch, and the strategy used here is to link the N-1 criterion between two systems. The adaptive controller uses the modal analysis approach; based on forecasted load paths, the controller gains are adaptively adjusted to maximize the damping in the system. The optimal controller is designed based on an estimated reduced-order model; system identification develops the model based on the system response. The exact-feedback linearization approach uses a pre-feedback loop to cancel the nonlinearities; a stabilizing controller is designed for the remaining linear system.
The conclusion is that coordinating the HVDC links improves the dynamic stability, which makes it possible to increase the transfer capacity. This conclusion is also supported by simulations of each control approach.

This paper presents a method for designing a centralized coordinated controller for several HVDC links. The controller increases the damping of the power oscillations by modulating the current through the HVDC links in a coordinated fashion. To design a centralized coordinated controller a reduced order open system model is estimated. The open system model of the power system is estimated using the Numerical Algorithms for Subspace State-Space System Identification (N4SID) algorithm which is a black-box system identification technique. The current set-point change through the HVDC links is the set of input signals and the speeds of the generators are the set of outputs. This controller design method increases the damping significantly, which is shown for a small power system. CIGRÉ Nordic 32-bus system including two HVDC links. The case study demonstrates that accurate low-order state-space models can be estimated and validated by using the described method to accurately model the system's power oscillatory behavior.
This paper deals with optimal coordinated control of several high voltage direct current (HVDC) links based on an estimated model of large power systems. The model of the power system is estimated by using subspace system identification techniques. An optimal controller is designed based on the estimated model with the aim to improve the damping in the system. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a new method which uses global Phasor measurement units (PMUs) signals for coordinated damping control of multiple HVDC links. The input signals are the controllable set-points of the HVDC links, the output signals are the speed signals of selected generators obtained from PMU. The PMU signals are used to estimate the current state of the model, i.e., the state of the system, an appropriate control action can then be applied to dampen the system. The benefit of the method is that the used output signals, i.e., the used PMU signals, are independent of the system equilibrium and therefore makes it possible to use state-feedback control, i.e., coordinated control. The method is applied to the Cigre Nordic 32-bus system including two HVDC links. The consistent results show that the damping can be significantly increased.

Starting with the introduction of the new Taxi and Limousine bylaw in July 1, 2012, the city prohibited transfers of vehicles older than 3 model years old. This prohibition was not explicitly written in the bylaw, but the administration used the definition of plating as the reason to prohibit the long existing practice.
We have just learned that the City of London Licence manager Orest Katolyk has reversed the policy on vehicle transfers effective immediately. So long as the vehicle is no longer than 7 years old and is already existing as a taxi, the vehicle may be transferred between plate owners.If your list to Santa includes a new car or SUV, some of these lease deals might be able to make your holiday dream come true.

I was lucky enough to go to the PostSecret event at SkyCity Theatre in Auckland on Friday. Frank Warren, creator of the PostSecret project, spoke to us for an hour and a half about the project, secrets, and his journey. He gave a chance for audience members to share their secrets at the conclusion... and after no takers initially, there ended up being lines at the microphones to share.
The thing about secrets as they can be funny, sad, tragic, horrible, hurtful, heart-warming, criminal, sexy... they can be anything. Frank's talk made me laugh out loud many times, and it made me tear-up - if I'd been at home alone, I might've cried.
The project reminds us that there is always hope, and that we are never alone.
After a long time away from the PostSecret blog, I'm heading back there... and I want to post some of the images/secrets here.
PostSecret is an ongoing community mail art project, created by Frank Warren, in which people mail their secrets anonymously on a homemade postcard. Select secrets are then posted on the PostSecret website, or used for PostSecret's books or museum exhibits.Wednesday, May 26, 2021 10:20 pm

The Special Visitation Panel to Ambrose Alli University (AAU), Ekpoma, has revealed how the immediate past Vice Chancellor of the institution, Prof. Ignatius Akhakhia Onimawo, wrongfully appointed and promoted his wife, Mrs. Janet Onimawo and other cronies.
The panel noted that due process was not observed in the conversion and appointment of Mrs. Janet Onimawo, against the rules of the University.
The panel was constituted by Governor Godwin Obaseki in October, 2020, in the wake of the agitation by staff unions in the school and other stakeholders in the university community,
It was tasked to investigate operations of the University in terms of revenue generation, transparency, accountability, adherence to due process, mode of employment and promotions and sustainability.
In its report submitted to the Governor in March 2021, the panel recommended that the University Management “reverses the conversion/appointment of Mrs. Janet Onimawo from the post of Lecturer 1 to assistant Lecturer with effect from 29th September 2016, being the effective date of her wrongful conversion/appointment to the post, considering her academic discipline and her qualifications at entry point.”
“The University Management should put in place modalities to ensure that Lecturers who were improperly ranked at the point of appointment/transfer are given their proper ranks according to the qualification they possessed at point of entry.
“These rankings should be backdated to the dates of first appointment, while the remuneration shortfalls occasioned by wrong rankings should be paid to the affected candidates in arrears.
“The same must necessarily apply to all staff that benefited from wrong placement at any point in time during the period covered by this Report,” the report said.
The Visitation Panel urged the University Management to put in place modalities to ensure that “lecturers who were improperly ranked at the point of appointment/transfer are given their proper ranks according to the qualification they possessed at point of entry.”

By Rev. Erika Hewitt of Midcoast UU Fellowship (Damariscotta, Maine), adaptly slightly by Rev. Myke Johnson and offered at Allen Avenue UU Church in Portland, Maine.
We shared a blessing on Sunday for all of those marching on January 21. Particularly those who are going to the Women's March on Washington, but also those who are marching in Augusta, Boston, New York, Portland and the other Maine locations as well. This blessing was created by Rev. Erika Hewitt, and adapted slightly for our worship:
May you be safe.
May you be free from all harm.
As the road or skies carry you toward your fellow justice seekers,
may you sense the presence of those who travel with you in spirit,
whose hopes and hearts are tucked into your pockets..
May the crowds be gentle, friendly, and patient.
If not, may the Spirit of Playfulness appoint you its momentary agent.
May you offer quiet praise for gestures of kindness.
May the sturdiest of marchers make space for those who need more time,
more help, or a different means of moving.
May those bearing snacks share generously with others.
In your hour of need, may you easily find a restroom,
and may it accommodate your body’s gender, size, and abilities.
Amid the excitement of selfies and hashtags,
may you remember the commitment that led you there,
and what will be required for the road ahead.
Gather it all up, dear marchers; let it feed you.
Allow the crowds’ electric energy to seep into you,
knitting itself into courage; into holy boldness;
into fuel for the journey back, and for the journey forward. May it be so.$997,617

It's important for those seeking credit card debt consolidation in Paint Rock, Alabama to understand the approach and evaluate solutions.

Things to be aware of with credit card debt consolidation in Paint Rock, Alabama
To illustrate, if you want to work with a balance transfer account to consolidate your consumer credit card debt, you need to formulate a payment plan that will make use of the 0% or very low-interest. For this particular method to give good results, you are not going to get a reduced payment, and you will need to have a steady income source to handle it with success. Because you are endeavoring to ensure that more of your installments go to the principal balance than the interest, you should send just as much towards these installment payments as possible. When you do this the right way, you can manage to pay back a sizable portion of your overall balance in a shorter time frame.
Then, there is the solution of obtaining an unsecured loan for a lower interest rate on consumer credit card debt. For this to work best, you will need an excellent credit standing. To maximize the cost savings available, it is best to just obtain a shorter term. If you combine the lower-interest rate and the short loan repayment period, you'll be able to lower the interest amount that you need to pay through the loan. That will add to the benefit you will get from utilizing a personal unsecured loan to consolidate your consumer credit card debt.
Then, you have the home equity loan strategy, that's only workable if your home has adequate equity. It will be important for the equity to pay for all your excessive interest credit debt if you want this to work. Further, you should come up with a schedule that can help you repay the home equity loan. If you fail to make the monthly payments, than the method puts your house in jeopardy.
Compare the benefits and disadvantages of debt consolidation in Paint Rock, Alabama
Before you can finalize the choice to make use of consolidation, you have to understand the pros and cons to start with.
Next are some of the advantages of deciding to consolidate your credit card debt.
It de-stresses your debt installment payments. This credit card debt approach merges your many debts into just one. Instead of overseeing and tracking each of the credit balances that you've got, you only have to concern yourself with one. You're unlikely to become overwhelmed with the easy payment.KEN
You have more desirable conditions on your arrangement. Typically, consolidating debts will involve shifting or restructuring your numerous credit accounts into a brand new one. There's no better chance to get more desirable agreements. You can find a shorter payment term or a far more versatile schedule. You could save cash on interest charges with a lower interest rate and faster repayment.
It gives you the ability to decrease your interest rates. Choosing a lower rate of interest is an integral part of consolidating debts. You shouldn't opt for consolidation if a lower rate of interest can't be discovered. Having the same interest rate or more interest undoes the advantages of debt consolidation.
Next are the downsides of choosing to consolidate your personal credit card debt.
Many mistakenly think that they're free of debt. It's true that you'll free up your lines of credit through consolidation. This makes it seem like you have paid back your debt but in reality, you only shifted your debt balances in to a new financial loan. Your debt is merged, but the exact amount that you must pay back continues to be the same.
It could result in further debt. The pull to use your charge cards, now that your credit lines are freed up, can bring about further credit card debt in the long run. This would result in higher financial debt balances, and the exact same dilemma which you started in.
It doesn't solve the actual reason for the matter. Debt consolidation is also something which can make your credit card debt payments simpler - but it will not actually resolve the situation that prompted you to be in financial debt. Only the effects of your financial debt are attended to.
It can put your property in danger. A lot of people opt to place their properties up as collateral, putting their properties in jeopardy if they are unable to pay. Although home equity will help you receive a lower rate of interest on the financial loan, this can put your property in danger of being taken by the loan company.
Submit an application for a Paint Rock, Alabama consolidation loan
The loan application process for debt consolidation loans depends on the way you intend to consolidate.
A personal loan debt consolidation strategy will involve applying for the loan just like you might with any kind of unsecured loan. You start by sending in the application, and you will then be approved or turned down depending on your history of credit. Once you are approved, you can go ahead and finish the application task and present the necessary prerequisites. If you utilize the web to submit an application, then you could be scanning and mailing digital copies of your info. This can be done on the loan company's website or by e mail.
An even more thorough underwriting endeavor commences when you've finalized the criteria of the application form. When everything is complete and authorized, that is when you will get the amount you borrow. Sometimes, you will have to open up an account withthe loan provider and get the funding in this account.
Should you wish to use the equity in your house in the consolidation loan, you will begin with process of a typical home loan application. The method involved is the same as the procedure involved in unsecured loan applications. But, the lender will execute a estimation of the property that you'll offer as collateral. This is usually higher priced than requesting a personal unsecured loan.
A lot of people don't realize that they can help save time and money by consolidating their debt with the same loan provider or financial institution that they're already dealing with.
When you have a bad credit score, is it possible to still consolidate debt in Paint Rock, Alabama ?
Yes, it's possible to acquire a consolidation loan despite a less-than-perfect credit. There are two ways in which this could occur.
One option would be to submit an application for a secured or unsecured loan. You should anticipate that in either loan, you're going to get a substantial interest rate because you'll be deemed to be a high risk borrower. This is because your bad credit is an indication that you don't handle consumer debt well. When compared to a secured financial loan, the interest rates are higher with unsecured financial loans. You'll generally have lower rates of interest if you secure the financial loan with collateral.
Then there's the next method, when secured or unsecured loans aren't a feasible plan of action for you. This option is credit card debt settlement. People with bad credit will find that this is a fantastic approach to managing debt.
This is a technique for bargaining for the opportunity to pay just a percentage of the financial debt that you have. When you employ a debt settlement service to assist you, they will handle the discussions with each of your credit card companies and loan providers. When you've arrived at an agreement to settle the debt for a lot less than what you owe, the financial institution or collector forgives the rest of the credit card debt.
Below-average credit and debt consolidation in Paint Rock, Alabama
There are 2 ways to get lower interest debt consolidation loans. The best method is to have an excellent credit history standing. A good credit score signifies to the loan provider that you repay what you owe and are an accountable consumer. This can only be confirmed by your credit rating.
Another solution for you to obtain a reduced interest debt consolidation loan is to get a secured loan. Most of the time, consumers make use of the equity of their property. Using this approach gives the loan provider some security because your house is the collateral for the loan. Thus, the lender will take the home should you go into default on your installments.
Shopping for cost-free consumer credit card debt consolidation
If you are trying to find a zero cost consolidation lender, we've got bad news: There are not any. Naturally, the borrowed funds must be paid back and it's with interest charges. Then, there are the application charges, though they normally are not very large. The provider must process your application and look at your credit score, which costs money. They'll make you shoulder those obligations with the application fees.
A lot of companies offering debt consolidation loans in Paint Rock, Alabama can provide you with a cost-free estimate so you will be aware of just how much the borrowed funds will set you back in terms of installments. But this is the only real free thing youâ€™ll find.
Accredited debt consolidation businesses
The provider's certifications can reveal whether they are legit. This is how you'll see which businesses and organizations the company is affiliated with. Before a loan company is authorized for accreditation with a different agency, they are generally researched by that organization. It will be useful to understand just what the company's requirements are for authorization.
Next, are many of the possible credentials that the provider might have.
Better Business Bureau. This agency scores their Business Partners with their BBB Business Partner Code of Conduct as a guideline. Their webpage is an excellent reference for discovering more info on the consolidation company which you wish to use. You'll be able to discover other customer opinions and relationships with the service.
American Fair Credit Council. The American Fair Credit Council is the leading Consumer Credit Advocate association. They strive to support consumers that are overwhelmed by credit card debt and advocate for their honest treatment.
National Foundation for Credit Counseling. This institution is dedicated to empowering both debt relief businesses and consumers with regards to financial wellness. The NFCC only welcomes members that successfully passed the certification of the Council on Accreditation.
International Association of Professional Debt Arbitrators. The goal of the International Association of Professional Debt Arbitrators is always to make sure consolidation services utilize debt arbitrators who are properly educated and licensed.
There are more accrediting organizations, global and nationwide, that you can investigate. These certifications aren't easily attained, and only reputable services will be found on their listings.
Research the debt consolidation company's consumer reviews
An additional way to ensure you are only doing business with a legit and trustworthy service is with review articles. Some websites are even specially designed to review consolidation companies. Next, there are the web pages dedicated to personal finance matters, which often highlight companies worth considering.
These types of reviews will show you many things about a company, including the cost, the method, and the various accessible services and products. Although the costs are a significant part of it, they shouldn't be your primary interest. A great lender needs more than just reduced fees. Other crucial elements include things like customer support and customer satisfaction.
It's also essential to give some thought to what you need in your consolidation loan. Many providers are prompt to focus on the low-interest rate but don't be misled. You may wind up bound to a rigid repayment schedule or disproportionate fees. Although a low interest is essential, you want to be sure that the company you decide to work with meets all your needs for consolidation.
Consolidating debts with a non profit service
Though you'll find non profit consumer credit counseling agencies, there are not any debt consolidation loan companies who are not in it for the financial gain. You'll want to be quite distrustful of any consolidation loan company that promises to be non profit. You'll invariably have to repay more than what you loaned when you obtain financing. This profit is normally obtained from the interest rate or the management fees.
Instead of attempting to find non-profit organizations, it is best to concentrate on seeking those that will give you the smallest interest rate and service fees. If you pair the cheaper rates with a good credit standing, you're confident to obtain a great package out of the debt consolidation loan.
Any consolidation lender which promises to be non-profit has to be thoroughly researched. It is highly probable that such a service is planning to con you into paying excessive fees and penalties.

Could you share a couple of fun facts about yourself?
I'm ambidextrous! I was born left-handed but I taught myself to write with my right hand while my roommate taught himself to write with his left hand.
Why did you decide to become a peer academic advisor?
I wanted to become a PAA because I really like helping other students out! I didn't know about the Peer Academic Advising program my first year, so I had to find out a lot of the information myself, especially for stuff like enrollment information and campus resources. One of the main reasons why I wanted to become a PAA was because I wanted to help other students utilize the resources that I found so incredibly helpful.
What has been your favorite part of being a peer academic advisor so far?
My favorite part has been helping out students during the drop-in Zoom hours. I think this has been my favorite part of the job so far because it's the most interactive part of the job and, even though it's virtual, it's nice to help out students live.
What do you hope to accomplish in this role?
One thing that I really look forward to is being able to reach out and interact more with the ICS student community, whether it is through informational sessions or during advising sessions.

Kurt Squire Shares Lessons Learned In ‘Making Games for Impact’5 teams from across Leicestershire and Rutland competed in 2013’s girls ASDA kwik cricket county final, having qualified through their local competition. Representing their areas were:
South Charnwood: Riverside Primary
City (Lanc): Braunston Community
City (CH): Sandfield Close
South Leics: St Peters
Rutland: Cottesmore
The final was held at the delightful Uppingham Town Cricket Club, and was very ably supported by student Young Leaders from Uppingham Community College, who took on umpiring and scoring duties, as well as keeping teams who were not currently playing occupied with simple games and assisting with the communication of information to schools. We were also joined by ASDA representatives who bought with them a bountiful supply of food for cricket teas and who, when not supervising the distribution of the food, cheered on all of the teams with great enthusiasm.
The format for the competition was to be a straightforward round robin league, with the option for a 1st/2nd place play off if time allowed. We were conscious of the rapidly closing in weather and while the first round started in gentle sunshine the clouds soon gathered and the second and third rounds were both played in steady rain. Despite this all the teams showed a willingness to get stuck in, with excellent bowling and batting skills on display, including some towering 6s, as well as very good awareness of the tactical requirements of fielding, with players backing up the stumps and communicating well with each other.
At just beyond the halfway mark, with the rain looking like it was not going to relent and underfoot conditions becoming increasingly treacherous, it was decided that the final two rounds would be decided by bowl offs. Not dissimilar to penalty shoot outs, every player in the team had one bowl at a set of stumps, the team that hit the most frequently were the winners!
The UCC young leaders rose to the occasion magnificently, producing impromptu score sheets to keep track of wickets despite the rain that had dissolved their scoresheets almost beyond recognition in the previous round.
In the end the result of the competition came down to the final bowl off. Sandfield Close had to be victorious to draw level on points with St Peters, with the overall winner being found with the team with the highest average score in games that they did play. Secure victory they did and it was a tense presentation ceremony as the two teams waited to find out who would be moving on to the regional finals. In the end, Sandfield Close just nicked it by 2.3 runs, scoring an average of 250 to St Peters’ 247.7!
All teams collected their spirit of cricket stickers as a reward for the generous spirit they all showed throughout the day. Congratulations to all teams who took part it what was, despite the weather, a lovely day, and special congratulations to Sandfield Close who will be representing Leicestershire and Rutland in the regional final – we wish them well!,500 Sq Ft / Industrial

How to conduct a year-end review of your marketing
Uncovering the true performance of your marketing
This is the right time to do a mop-up of your marketing and undertake some general housekeeping to ensure you start the year in the best shape. It is easy to jump to the wrong conclusions and also feel marketing isn’t working without doing any proper analysis.
Remember that marketing can serve several objectives from raising awareness of your business to generating website traffic to generating leads. Always start by looking at what you set out to achieve.
Here are some key areas to look at:-
1. Look at how your leads are generated
Examine your lead or enquiry source throughout the year. How have your prospective customers found you? Break down the main areas. For example, this could be Google, Paid Ads, referrals, Linked In, events or newspapers. This is an invaluable exercise, as it often tells you to need to relook at how you track your leads to ensure you’re capturing the right data consistently. This becomes more complex when you have sales, business development and customer service teams. As you expand your marketing, you will need to refine this criteria.
Once you have this data you should be able to see where the most valuable channels are for your future marketing. Now you can calculate the cost per lead. To do this, you’ll need a record of all your external costs – this will include media spend, event attendance, content creation, and production etc. Of course, it won't factor in any internal time you and your team have spent.
A cost per lead will allow you to understand your top-performing channels and aid budget planning for the year ahead. Be aware though, that it won’t include new areas of investment that you haven’t considered or generated any leads from. For example webinars or email marketing. Over time this metric will become more useful.
2. Examine the original enquiry source of your sales
Now repeat the exercise but look at how your customers originally found you as there can be a difference. Remember these are the customers that have converted into a sale so these are your most important source of data and if your business is growing and is profitable, ideally you want to repeat this customer journey to win more customers.
Remember not all sales are equal. You want to focus on your more profitable customers so this may depend on what they are buying, what they are spending and how often. It really depends on your business model.
As long as you have sales or billing data and a record of how the sale has originally been generated, you can calculate the acquisition cost, also known as the CAC. This is a key metric for marketing. You can then work out how much money you can afford to invest acquiring customers. Clients often ask how much should they spend on customer acquisition. This really depends on your industry. A general rule is 25% of lifetime margin.
Ideally, you can then take this a stage further and calculate the lifetime value of a customer to give you the complete picture. To do this you will need to know how long the average customer stays with you and how much they spend. You should aim for a lifetime value of at least 3 times your customer acquisition cost.
3. Analyse website traffic
Look at your website traffic using a tool like Google Analytics. Analyse the key sources of traffic – can you spot monthly and annual trends? Has there been an increase in traffic this year? How is the most amount of traffic being generated? How important is organic traffic and traffic from social media?
There are no rules about where your traffic should come from and this does vary from business to business. However, the key here is to look at upwards trends and ensure annual growth. You want to aim at growing free channels like organic, social media and referral channels and reduce paid for channels such as social media advertising and Google ads.
4. Undertake a social media audit
Social media can easily absorb 1-2 days a week of your time , or a significant amount of spend a year if you outsource. Therefore, you want to know that this investment is worthwhile and paying off. It is a question I get asked all the time. But it isn't this straight forward to answer.
You’ll need to take into account what you want to achieve with social media. According to Quick Sprout, these most commonly fall into 3 main areas for small businesses:-
Generating leads - 70% of businesses main social media goal
Generating brand awareness - 53% of businesses main social media goal
Engaging with customers - 50% of businesses main social media goal
Remember this really comes down to your business - for some businesses, customer service will be the key driver, whilst other sales. Social media requires dedication and commitment, so you only get out of it what you put in.
To conduct an audit, you'll need to examine your social media insights for each platform. There are dozens of metrics within social media and it can become overwhelming but essentially there are 4 core areas:-
Awareness - impressions and reach
Engagement - likes, comments, clicks and shares
Share of voice - volume and sentiment
ROI - referrals and sales
However, if you want to take more of a birds eye view, then start by identifying how many followers you've acquired year on year and what actions they have taken i.e. have they visited your website, have they shared posts and how they are contributing to your website traffic, lead generation or even customer sales.
5. Ask your customers for feedback
When was the last time you asked for feedback from your customers? So much has happened over the last year so it would be wise to ask your most loyal fans how they are feeling and undertake a satisfaction survey. A free tool like Survey Monkey makes it easy to administer and analyse.
Prospectus customers love reviews and case studies so if you haven't already, start collecting these. You can learn a lot from these as well. Customers may be more receptive to taking part at this time of the year and people are already starting to get into the festive spirit.
Start the year in the best shape
Hopefully, this has given you some practical advice to take forward. Marketing is complex and has hundreds of different ways you can measure it. Learn more over in my blog how to measure your marketing.
A review focusing on your marketing at this time of the year will prove fruitful and you'll get a lot out of it. Above all it will tell you what is working and what isn’t so you can make well informed decisions for the year ahead.

Needing to optimise available space, buildings such as offices, retail developments and hospitals often include parking areas on the uppermost roof deck. The challenge with this solution is to construct a durable, trafficable surface, while protecting the integrity of the waterproofing system, and ensuring the building roof is adequately insulated. The expectation is that this solution should match design performance criteria for a system lifetime of minimum fifty years.
Design of an optimum solution involves multiple structural and product aspects, from anticipated loading of the roof deck, waterproofing, drainage, insulation and the choice of trafficable surface.
A principal benefit of thermally insulating above the waterproofing system with IsoBoard, is the membrane is protected by the bulk of the insulation, requiring no maintenance. Not only is the membrane protected from aging due to weathering, UV exposure and thermal shocks, it is also protected against mechanical damage resulting from vehicle traffic, and damage caused by interstitial condensation.
Another important benefit is that the thermal mass of the concrete roof deck is maintained at internal temperature, assisting hugely in providing temperature control to the environment below.
Choosing a thermal insulator appropriate for this application, means specifying a product with the highest resistance to water and moisture absorption, to prevent any performance or compression failure. The product must be light in mass yet possess the compressive strength to support vehicle traffic over fifty years and maintain designed thermal performance over this period. Here is where IsoBoard XPS comes into its own.
More than twenty years ago, IsoBoard was installed as thermal insulation beneath paved roof parking in the Steve Biko Academic Hospital in Pretoria. IsoBoard continues to perform as designed, providing thermal insulation to the building below, protecting the waterproofing system and accommodating vehicle traffic, with no collapse of the paved surface. Waterproofing maintenance has been limited to exposed upstands.
In 2016, IsoBoard XPS was installed to the roof parking area of the Military Hospital in Wynberg, with the same positive outcome thus far, which we look forward to confirming and reporting on in fifty years’ time.
When looking for thermal insulation that is thermally effective, durable and fit for purpose for the long term, you know you can rely on IsoBoard.

Clockwise tells the story of Saad Ben Khalaf, a singer/drummer who sells old watches in Souk Wakef in the center of Doha, the capital of Qatar. Saad had a troubled childhood: he is an orphan rescued from a shipwreck, which was crushed in a devastating storm. As the only survivor of the tragedy, Saad was found and raised by Atique Ben Barud, who knows all too well how it feels to be the last of his kind. Atique was one of the three men who learned the forbidden art of Fijiri and is the only one who could still share the secret if he weren’t killed immediately. Through one of the magical watches in his collection, Saad take a trip back to the 1930s where he learns about his stepfather’s secret and also falls in love with Jeena, a beautiful female jinn who may be able to lift the curse on Atique.

Just before 8 a.m. on Oct. 17, an employee of a business at a strip mall in the 500-block of the Trans-Canada Highway called police to report there were lights on in what was supposed to a vacant building, said Staff Sgt. Scott West.
Investigating officers found a portion of a fence behind the business had been cut and a door that wasn’t secured. Once inside, the officers located and arrested a 40-year-old man.
While continuing their investigation, West said officers found property in the man’s possession believed to have been stolen several days prior during a break and enter at a business in the same complex.
West said the man was released from custody and is expected to appear in court in late December.
“This really goes to show the importance of reporting suspicious incidents to police,” said West. “The complainant in this case helped us solve two business break and enters with one call.”

Most B2B lead generation marketing strategies are still stuck on cold emails, basic social media updates and professional networking (attending events etc.)
Here are some stats that can show just how powerful lead generation can be once coupled with strategic digital platforms:
Content marketing generates 3 times as many leads as traditional outbound marketing but costs 62% less. (Demand Metric)
People are more likely to visit a B2B tech company’s website after seeing a tweet from the company, getting them one step closer to becoming a lead. (KoMarketing Associates)
59% of B2B marketers say SEO has the biggest impact on their lead generation goals. (Marketing Charts)
In this post, we’ll talk about a detailed plan of action that you can apply to your business to generate 100+ B2B leads every month.
Case In Hand
Let’s make this post more interesting by adding two examples from the B2B business world. Let’s consider we are dealing with the following types of companies
1. A SaaS platform which helps marketers with social media automation (Product Business)
2. A consulting firm that helps technology companies to make better business decisions (Service Business)
Most B2B businesses will fall in either one of the categories- product or service.
Defining The Approach
In our b2b marketing plan, we will be using the following areas to achieve our goals
- Outbound marketing using LinkedIn and other social media.
- Organic content marketing including blogging and social media.
- Paid marketing including content promotion and re-marketing.
- Conversion Rate Optimisation including landing page and analytics.
Time Frame To Achieve Goals
Starting from scratch, we’d be planning to hit our goals in 120 days.
Here is what the timeline looks like:
Points To Address Before You Begin Marketing
Before you begin to market your tool/service, you need to make sure that
-You can identify who your target audience is and
-What your content strategy would look like
# 1 Step One: Create a Buyer Persona
Most companies end up getting this part wrong. They start with all sorts of marketing that they can get their hands on and end up in a campaign which isn’t targeted and under-performs.
What is a customer persona?
A customer persona is nothing but mapping out the ideal characteristics of your target audience. It involves collecting information like the demographics of your audience, their digital activity, life choices, things they care about, the challenges they face and products they look out for.
How to draw a customer persona?
A lot of companies “get out of the room” and talk to their potential customers to know more about them ( this is a great way of going about it). However, smaller businesses might not have the bandwidth to do it. It is possible to draw a customer persona by brainstorming thoroughly about your business.
A framework for designing a customer persona:
When it comes to creating buyer personas, I particularly like this post by Buffer which talks about creating a persona from a scratch. Basically, this is how their template looks :
Image Credits: Bufferapp.com
As you can see, the persona starts with the name and job title of the person and then narrows down to :
– Demographics including location, education, income, family etc
– Goals and challenges including what the value system of your customer is, what do they fear and their challenges.
– Marketing message: This part talks about how and where to pitch your ideal customer once you know them.
Let’s take our two examples to build on this.
Example 1
– A B2B SaaS marketing platform which helps marketers with social media automation (Product Business)
Let’s map out our ideal customer in this case.
1. Name and Job Title: Sarah Bolton, Social Media Marketing Manager
2. Demographics: Age 24-32, female, Salary between $40,000- $60,000 per year, Urban city, Master’s degree, Married with no kids
3. Goals and Challenges: Find better social media content, increase engagement of her content, automate time-consuming tasks.
4. Marketing message: How social media automation can help Sarah save time and focus on more important tasks.
Example 2
A consulting firm that helps technology companies to make better business decisions ( Service Business)
In this case, this is how we should break down the persona
1. Name and Job Title: John Doe, Business Development/ Operations Head
2. Demographics: Age 30-42, male, Salary between $90,000- $130,000 per year, Urban city, Master’s degree, Married with kids
3. Goals and Challenges: How to grow the company revenue with better decisions. How to improve employee efficiency and company processes.
4. Marketing message: Case studies from similar industries on how they improved business development and operations.
Note: The above customer personas can be created in much more detail. For example, in the case of the first tool, you could include ( other than the social media manager) the digital marketing head, marketing automation head, CMO etc in your customer persona as well. This would depend entirely on the fact that how big is the size of your target business and who are the business decision makers in the same.

# 2 Step Two: What Your Content Strategy Should Look Like
Your content strategy is a mixture of multiple things including
– Content on landing pages
– Blog content
– Social media content
– Pitches/sales messages
The one thing that you need in common with all of these channels is coherence.
As a strong B2B firm, you need to give out a message that your product/service is reliable, has been successfully used by clients in the past and that you genuinely care about clients if and when something goes wrong.
To start with our example of the tool (social media automation), here are some amazing things that make Hootsuite (social media scheduling tool) a success.
Landing Pages
If you analyse the different elements on the home page of Hootsuite, you will see that they have clearly
– Mentioned that they are trusted by a LOT of people.
– You can use their tool for free to give it a try.
– You can connect over 35 popular social networks which basically gives you a complete control over all your social profiles.
Social Media Content
If you closely look at the social content of Hootsuite, their posts are all about educating their target customers. They understand that their target audience is from the social media marketing world and they’ve made sure to invest in educational content that resonates with their audience.
When it comes to B2B content, educational material can do wonders in terms of building credibility.
Marketing Activities For 100 Leads/Month
Let’s dive into the real thing now. Here we will talk about choosing the right strategies and executing them step by step. Broadly, we can define our strategies into two categories
#1 Outbound Lead Generation Strategy
#2 Inbound Lead Generation Strategy
In simpler terms, outbound is when you reach out ( such as ads, cold emails) to potential leads with a compelling offer and subsequently convert them. Inbound is when potential customers find you via your website, content, social media, ebooks or any other similar form of digital presence.
Inbound marketing is one of the best forms of lead generation. However, it takes time to build your authority in order to drive inbound leads.
Image : seopressor.com
Outbound Marketing Part 1: Using LinkedIn Lead Generation
More than 80% of B2B marketers believe that LinkedIn performs better than any other social network. Here we will talk about how to exactly use LinkedIn for generating quality leads.
Step 1: Map out a detailed buyer persona: Understanding who do you want to sell to is of utmost importance. Given our examples of SaaS and service businesses, you can create a detailed customer persona using the information given in the above sections.
Step 2: Search for the lead’s profile on LinkedIn: Using a keyword search inside of LinkedIn, you can start finding people who will be a great fit for your lead standards.
For the SaaS company that sells social media automation to companies, I would search for the social media head of companies in my target geographies.
With the second example of the consulting firms that consult tech firms on their business decisions, I would look out for the business development or operations heads in technology companies.
Step 3: Send a connect request: While sending a connect request to your potential lead, LinkedIn will give you a small box to add info as an introductory message. Don’t try selling your product/service, just mention that you’d like to connect with the person.
Step 4: Send a soft pitch after connecting: Once your potential lead gets connected with you on LinkedIn, send them a thank-you message for accepting your request. After a couple of days, send them a short pitch introducing yourself and your company.
Don’t write an essay and tell how your product/service is the best in the world.
Chances are that your potential leads get pitched a lot. In order to stand out and gain their attention, you need to manage your tone and the way you approach them.
Here is an example of a soft pitch that I’d send
Step 5: Followup with annoying your leads: A lot of your potential leads would be busy. They might not be as active as you on LinkedIn, they might be on a holiday or very busy with a project or your message might have been lost in the pool of their unread messages. The best way to not lose any opportunities is to followup warmly once a week for the next 2 weeks.
How many leads will LinkedIn get?
The number could vary with your industry, however, as a benchmark, the following numbers would serve you well.
Outbound Marketing Part 2: Digital Advertising
Advertising constitutes a major share of the digital marketing world. Broadly classifying ads, you can use
# 1 Search Engine Ads
# 2 Social Media Ads
# 3 Private Network Ads
# 4 Influencer Marketing (not exactly ads but still outbound)
To decide where your product/service could be advertised best, you need to answer the following questions
- Where does your audience look for your product?
If people search a lot about your type of product/service on search engines, then search ads should be the best way.
If your target audience reads a lot of industry blogs and follows influencers, tying up with influencers for writing a “review post” about your product/service would be the best thing to do.
Taking another example, if your target audience is “social media managers”, then you should definitely invest in Facebook ads where people have mentioned that job role.
- How does your audience interact with your business?
Do you sell high-end consulting solutions or do you have a free/freemium tool that users can try right away? Depending on the same, you need to decide on an “ideal period of time” between being aware of your product and feeling comfortable to buy it.
Customers generally take multi-step journeys before buying your product. You need to advertise on all different steps.
- Is advertising a model that you can scale?
Most companies go blind with digital ads until they burn their fingers. A simple equation for deciding if advertising would work for you is
Cost of acquiring the customer (via different channels)> Customer lifetime value
CLV is defined as customer lifetime value. It is the total amount of money that a customer will make for you for the entire period of time that he will spend with you.
So if you are selling software at $100 per month and you spent $300 in acquiring the customer via ads, you need to make sure that the customer stays for more than 3 months in order to be profitable.
Inbound Lead Generation
Part 1: Developing Content
In the sections above, we talked about how to decide the right content strategy.
“A successful content strategy is always focused on adding tremendous value to people who consume that content”
If we take our previous examples of SaaS and service firms, here is what the content strategy would look like
– SaaS app for scheduling social media content: Their content should revolve around educating social media managers and entrepreneurs. Covering the latest trends in social media marketing, developing valuable guides on different social channels, building podcasts and info-graphics around the same theme would really help.
– A consulting firm selling business advice to tech firms: Their content needs to highlight mistakes that tech firms make and how they could take better decisions to improve revenue and operations. Creating content in the form of blog posts, guides, webinars and email newsletters would do best.
Part 2: Content Promotion
Believe it or not, most people believe in the rule of “build it and people will come”. That’s never true. Content promotion is as important as content development. Once you’ve built content that fits the right strategy, you can use the following engagement strategies for promoting the content
- Engage in B2B industry forums. There are multiple forums out there where people are looking for advice on topics you created content around. Start looking out for such questions and answer whenever you see one.
As a matter of fact, LinkedIn group discussions in the right communities will give you a lot of opportunities to distribute your content.
- Distribute content on third-party platforms. Republish your content on LinkedIn Pulse, Slideshare, Quora blog posts, Reddit threads, Medium.com and every other platform that allows so and is relevant to your business.
- Talk to influencers. There are multiple influencers in different industries today. By doing an audit using a tool like Buzzsumo, you can look out for the most shared content and influencers in your industry. Once you have curated a list of influencers, start by tweeting or emailing them and introduce your content. Tell them how you appreciate their content and ask politely for their thoughts ( or a social share) about your content.
- Last but definitely not the least, share the content on your own social media multiple times.
Part 3: Collect Contact Information
Once you start developing content and promoting it the right way, you will discover a steady flow of users accessing your content. This is a core opportunity that marketers miss out on.
Once people discover your content, put a hook on to them by getting their contact info.
For example, if people started discovering your website blog posts, you should have subtle email opt-ins which give away something in lieu of the user’s contact info.
Hubspot does a great job at promoting their eBooks and collecting contact information
Part 4: Nurture Your Leads
If you know your business well, you would understand how long it takes a lead to convert once they are aware of your service/product. Depending on the same, you need to nurture the leads that you gained via your inbound marketing efforts. Here are some ways to do so successfully
- If they signed up for your content, send them relevant emails with more of the same content without being annoying. This acts a good reminder. Depending on how much time your leads take to convert, send them a promotional email at the end of your email drip campaign.
- If they visited your pricing page but didn’t go further, serve them re-marketing ads across social media and search network. This keeps them reminded of your products/services.
- Keep building your authority with more quality content and asking them if they’d like your help with anything.

Unfortunately, flu-like symptoms prevented my going, but I caught up with Defoor the following Saturday at EBD4. The 2,000 foot space is just off Chamblee-Tucker road in the Chamblee Commons business center. Elyse has built out a salon type area, there are two large exhibition spaces and a rear area is her working studio. I was impressed with the two mammoth roll-down garage doors, that just beg for giant paintings to be hauled through them.
The invitational exhibit, titled “40 over 40”, is a tribute to artists who are mid-career or older, although a few had never shown before. “This show champions artists who continue to take risks, explore, and do the work that they are meant to do,” says curator Defoor in Buckhaven Lifestyle, and acknowledged that she chose what she liked in terms of curating the work. A few artists are mainstays on the Atlanta art scene, one small painting is by Jerry Cullum, the city’s preeminent arts critic. Many others I had met from exhibits years ago, or through the Seek ATL group, founded in 2011 by the now New York based painter Shara Hughes and Ben Steele, who still resides here.
The show includes sculpture, painting, printmaking, drawing and mixed media, photography, fiber and textile art and provides a good overview of a strong group of artists who have devoted their lives to making and creating. What stands out is the diversity of both style and mediums, but because of the thoughtfulness of the installation the entirety of the exhibit flows smoothly, and sometimes surprisingly, throughout the space. I missed a few artists in this post, please head out to Chamblee before the show ends to catch everyone’s work.
The front gallery has a small seating area.

Thanks! Great to read and see photos of the exhibit in preparation for my trip to see since I missed the opening.
Well done Elyse – and thank you. Atlanta needs this!
Looks like a really strong show and a nice space to boot! The Steven Anderson and Richard Harris, Michael jones and Susan Kerr Seymour pieces stand out most for me. I wish I could hop the pond and see them in the flesh!
Elyse, thank you for including me in this show with an excellent group of artists! Not only did you make the point about ageism being so rampant in the “Art World”, but the artwork in a gallery where
professional concerns such as lighting, curation, and space lends itself to many future gallery exhibitions as well.-by Pierre Yoshio

Indigenous bombshell Margaret Albert, 16, is in Los Angeles as the face of WA for the annual G'day USA event to promote Australia in North America.
The Broome beauty will walk the red carpet at a black-tie gala tomorrow alongside celebrities, including Kylie Minogue, Russell Crowe, Olivia Newton-John, Shane Warne, John Travolta and Harrison Ford.
"I'm really looking forward to meeting Kylie,'' Albert said.
The quietly spoken high school student was discovered late last year when she took part in the Miss Kimberley catwalk competition as part of a personal development program for indigenous teenagers.
"My family talked me into doing it,'' she said. ``I never thought I would actually get this far _ I was only doing it for the whole experience.''
Albert, who balances studies with being the sole carer for her elderly grandmother, had not travelled outside Australia before winning the competition and said she was excited about her whirlwind week-long trip.
"LA is such a massive city _ it really blew me away,'' she said. ``I've had a great time so far.''
As part of her trip, the teenager has been photographed by Hollywood fashion photographer Michael Higgins for her modelling portfolio.
She also modelled at a fashion show in Hollywood for WA labels including Aurelio Costarella, Belle Bijoux, Pierucci, su and Xenheist.
The labels were chosen by the WA Government for a sponsored trip to Los Angeles as part of the G'day USA event to promote ties between WA businesses and the US market.
Part of the festivities tomorrow include Crowe captaining Australia in a celebrity cricket match against England.
Billed as the ``battle for the Hollywood Ashes'', Crowe is tipped to be joined by Mel Gibson and former Australian players Steve Waugh and Mike Whitney, who are in town for the event.
At a glitzy Paramount Studios preview of Australian short films this week, hosted by Melissa George and featuring Joel Edgerton, the rumour mill was in overdrive _ even by Hollywood standards _ with suggestions that Sir Mick Jagger and Robbie Williams may make surprise appearances for the Old Dart.
But unfortunately Jude Law, who had agreed to face Crowe as the opposing captain, has ``walked'' and is confirmed as a scratching.
Given the usual standards of celebrity behaviour, the Australian camp is keeping its fingers crossed that Crowe and Gibson would show, as promised, for the San Fernando Valley clash at Woodley Playing Fields.
The Brits were keeping their line-up under wraps, admitting only that quick Simon Jones and Test batsman Robert Key will take to the pitch.Post Modern Home White Lacquer Dining Table With Wood

Now, the in-game skin’s model has finally been revealed.
The God of Mischief will soon wreak havoc as the skin will release for those who are signed up to Fortnite Crew Membership in July on all platforms: PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X, Xbox One, PC, Nintendo Switch and Android phones. The skin will release in the early hours of July 1 and the skin will be available for the remainder of the month.
Crew members will receive a pack filled with goodies in addition to the Loki Laufeyson outfit including Loki’s Cape Back Bling, his Scepter Pickaxe, a Chitauri Chariot Glider, and Loki’s own loading screen. On top of that, Crew subscribers will be given their usual reward of 1,000 V-Bucks and will also automatically gain access to the Chapter 2 Season 7 Battle Pass.
How to get the Fortnite Loki skin
The Loki Fortnite skin will only be available with a Fortnite Crew membership subscription, which costs $11.99/£9.99 a month. The fee is recurring until the membership is manually cancelled. To sign up for the service, follow these simple steps:
- Launch Fortnite on your primary device (console, pc or android)
- Navigate to the Battle Pass menu screen
- Select the icon for Fortnite Crew sign-up
- Enter your details to complete the purchase and confirm your membership.
It’s worth noting that your Crew account will only work on your chosen primary device and, therefore, will only work on one platform. So if you, for example, sign-up for Crew membership on PlayStation, you would not be able to use the same rewards on Xbox or PC without another membership.
So that’s how you get this awesome looking Loki Fortnite skin. With plenty of other Marvel heroes and villains all currently sporting in-game skins, it won’t be long before you can re-enact the battle in Avengers: Endgame in Pleasant Park!.

How the Fed Saved Credit Funds
Mortgage-backed and structured credit funds have recovered from double-digit losses in early 2020. They can thank the Fed.
Investors in credit hedge funds, which are generally designed to provide stability to portfolios, had a wild ride in 2020. If not for the Fed, it could have been a lot wilder.
In March, when markets cratered as global economies shut down because of Covid-19, PivotalPath’s mortgage-backed securities and structured credit index — which represents hedge funds invested in the sector — plummeted 18.6 percent. But the category has mostly recovered since then: PivotalPath’s index is down 1.8 percent for the year as of the end of November. Investors should thank the U.S. Federal Reserve for that, PivotalPath’s CEO says.
“We were on the precipice,” said Jon Caplis, CEO of hedge fund research and data firm PivotalPath, in an interview. “But [Fed chair Jerome] Powell moved so quick, with such power, and he unfroze these markets that could have taken us down into the abyss. Every one of these credit strategies would have been destroyed from structured credit to any of these illiquid funds. There would have been no market for so much of this stuff for a while.”
Caplis was referring to moves made in late March, when the Fed, with $75 billion in backing from the U.S. Treasury, announced programs to stabilize the credit markets. The central bank said it would buy newly issued bonds as well as exchange-traded funds that held corporate debt. With credit markets in disarray at the time, the Fed programs were designed, among other things, to help investors and managers avoid fire-sales and other indiscriminate selling.
According to PivotalPath, the MBS and structured credit index has posted gains every month since the low in March. In April, the index gained 1.75 percent; in May, it returned 3.9 percent; and in June it posted a 4.42 percent gain. From July to October, the index increased by 1.4, 1.6, 1.3, and 0.8 percent, respectively. In November, the index racked up a gain of 2.8 percent.
[II Deep Dive: Credit Hedge Funds Can’t Figure Out What They’re Worth]
In some ways, it was the first big test of the credit markets since their transformation after the global financial crisis. Since 2008, banks have curbed much of their riskiest lending, with hedge funds and others filling the void. At the same time, banks also stepped back from their role as principal market makers and buying up debt in falling markets.
In late April, PivotalPath got a delayed warning about the extent of problems with credit hedge funds. Only about one-third of funds focused on structured credit and mortgage-backed securities had calculated a net asset value — the portfolio's worth — and provided that information to PivotalPath.
Caplis said investors need to do significant due diligence on credit managers to determine their ability to negotiate any trouble in the fixed income markets, including their skill with potential workouts and their relationships with counter-parties, including prime brokers that may demand additional collateral when securities prices fall.
While March was unique in that few could have foreseen a global pandemic, inexperienced credit managers could be challenged in the future by something as simple as an unexpected rise in interest rates after years of being near record lows, Caplis said.
“There’s some big asymmetric tail risk in these funds. It’s the proverbial picking up pennies in front of the steamroller,” Caplis said. “Then all of a sudden you lose everything you made over the last five years in a matter of a month or three months. That’s what the Fed bailed us out of in a major way in March and April of this year.”When he starred for Dutch masters Ajax in the early 1970s, Johann Cruyff had a phrase -- "the Italian clubs can't beat you, but you can lose to them."
This apparent nonsense reveals a great truth about football, a low scoring game where part of the charm is that the best team does not always prevail. Cruyff's phase applies perfectly to the Club World Cup, which reaches a climax on Saturday with a final between Real Madrid of Spain and Gremio of Brazil.
The current format of the competition was adopted in 2005. The Europeans have dominated, but there have been three occasions where the South Americans have triumphed 00 a hat trick of Brazilian wins, for Sao Paulo (over Liverpool) in 2005, Internacional (over Barcelona in 2006) and Corinthians (over Chelsea) in 2012.
In all three cases the winner fought from a bunker, acknowledging the superiority of the opponent, covering up and looking to take advantage of a rare break. All three were 1-0 victories. In the current age, it is hard to see what else the South American champion can do. In today's globalised market the best South Americans are representing the European champions. It is not an even fight and the South American team would surely be unwise to go toe to toe and trade punches. Perhaps the closest to this scenario was in 2007, when Boca Juniors of Argentina tried to trade punches with Milan of Italy and went down more heavily than the 4-2 scoreline might suggest.
And it is hard to see Gremio doing anything different against Real on Saturday. Gremio have spent the year playing eye pleasing, possession based football. But injury robs them of key midfielder Arthur, a prototype Andres Iniesta fundamental to their passing game. And even against CONCACAF champions Pachuca in the semifinal, Gremio spent much of the game watching their opponent exchange passes. It is reasonable to expect that on Saturday Real Madrid will see more of the ball than the Brazilians.
There are plenty of reasons for Gremio to take extra defensive precautions. Real are full of attacking potency. Cristiano Ronaldo and Karin Benzema, for example, give them a massive aerial threat. Gremio keeper Marcelo Grohe is a magnificent reaction shot-stopper, one of the heroes of their year. But he is weak on crosses. Centre-backs Pedro Geromel and Walter Kannemann are therefore forced back into their own area to help him out against the high ball. Gremio will surely be obliged to sit deep for long periods of the game.
But this does not mean that they have no chance of victory. If Grohe can perform more reflex heroics, if Geromel can show the imperious form he displayed against Pachuca, if the combative Argentine Kannemann can channel his aggression sufficiently to stay on the field for 90 minutes, then Gremio can hope to hold Real and hit them on the break. They have the tools to do it.
One of the most fascinating aspects of the final is the way in which Gremio coach Renato Portaluppi might change the balance of his side in accordance with the circumstances. He won the Libertadores against Lanus of Argentina, the self-styled "biggest neighbourhood club in the world." He overcame Pachuca to reach the Club World Cup final. But now the degree of difficulty rises. Can Renato adapt?
He has been one of the figures of South American football this year. A top player -- Gremio's attacking star when they won the Libertadores and Intercontinental Cup back in 1983 -- he rates himself as better than Cristiano Ronaldo. It fits an image he has cultivated as a swaggering beach bum, a man who does not need to study because he was born knowing it all. But he has shown that there is much more to him. Renato's stewardship of Gremio has been admirably mature; he has had the humility to work inside the guidelines set by his predecessor Roger Machado. And his man-management has been so good that he has been responsible for recuperating several careers, for drawing excellent performances out of players who had widely been written off.
The news from the camp on Thursday was that Gremio trained with Jael in place of Lucas Barrios in the centre-forward position. But there must surely be a temptation to do away with a centre-forward altogether for this game. If Real will have more of the ball, and Gremio will sit deep, then pace on the counterattack is surely their best weapon. Real showed their vulnerability to this approach against Al Jazira in the semifinal, and all season they have struggled against teams who drop deep and deny them space.
Gremio, on the other hand, should have plenty of space in which to launch their sporadic attacks. It may well make sense to start with Everton, who came off the bench to score the only goal against Pachuca, on one flank and the equally rapid Fernandinho on the other, with the intelligent and dangerous Luan floating behind them as a false nine.
Will Renato conclude that this approach offers him the best chance of victory? Because he has a team that would seem incapable of outplaying Real Madrid, but that may yet to able to outscore them.A couple of Super 12 players makes all the difference. Captain Paul Warwick vouched for that after Australia returned to the force of old last night. Four legs into the IRB Series and Australia are languishing in an embarrassing eighth place with 12 points, a massive 56 behind arch rivals New Zealand. Losing was becoming acceptable. That's anathema to Aussies. So the Australian Rugby Union took matters in hand, beefed up the squad with a couple of Super 12 players and bingo ... the team have been turned around. That much was clear after Australia beat Samoa 19-12 in their final pool game last night to earn the 'easier' quarter-final today - against South Africa, rather than New Zealand. 'We expected to be in this position,' Warwick said. 'We are extremely confident going into [today's] quarter-final against South Africa. We have been playing in Bowl finals in the last couple of tournaments so it's great to be back in contention for the Cup. We'll give it a good shot. But we haven't done anything yet. 'It's been a disappointing year for Australian sevens but the combination of a few new guys and releasing a couple of Super 12 players have aided our cause,' Warwick said, referring to Elia Tuqiri, who has just returned from Super 12 duty with the Waratahs in South Africa, and Peter Hewat, who is contracted to the Waratahs. Elia is a cousin of Wallaby winger Lote Tuqiri and was drafted in at the last minute for Hong Kong. 'Adam Ashley-Cooper has also just come back from South Africa with the Brumbies,' Warwick said. 'These guys along with the likes of Matt Hodgson, who is also with the Waratahs, help the young guys and give them a bit of confidence. Obviously, the results are showing. 'It helps breed a winning culture. It's been a disappointing year for all the young guys and they have got used to losing. Hopefully, this tournament, we can turn this around.' Australia raced into a 19-0 lead, thanks to tries by Warwick, Tuqiri and Luke Inman and Samoa were always chasing the game. They restored some respectability with David Lemi and Sailosi Tagicakibau scoring, but it was all in vain. 'We did the early work to get that lead and slowed up a bit,' Warwick said. 'We have been run down a few times in the past so it is good to get one of those close ones tonight.' Australia showed no mercy to Chinese Taipei in their first match, winning 68-0, the highest score of the tournament. But Warwick rated the Samoa win higher because of the quality of the opposition. 'This morning was great from an attacking point of view. But for about 10 minutes tonight we were very impressive defensively,' he said. Australia have beaten South Africa 11 times in their 18 meetings, but South Africa have won the last three. However, a strengthened Australia could reverse that trend early this afternoon. And waiting for them are likely to be England, whom Warwick rates as the main dangers for the title along with New Zealand. 'England were sharp and along with New Zealand are the teams to beat,' he said. The name of Richard Haughton, the England flying machine, will be on everyone's lips. 'I'd like to have some of that pace and I'm sure half our team would,' Warwick said. And how to beat England? 'The key is you don't give the ball away easily,' he said. 'The simple thing about sevens is if you've got the ball they can't score. Defensively, you can't rush up on them because if you make an error you are gone. Defensive strategy comes into it with those types of players, but if you overmark him, [Ben] Gollings or someone like him can do the business. They are just a good team.' Samoa coach John Schuster could not hide his disappointment as his players headed back to the changing rooms, wandering whether they had made it through to the Cup. He needn't have worried. They qualified but will face New Zealand in their quarter-final today. 'Basic errors cost us dearly,' said Schuster. 'Silly passes and basic knock-ons led to turnovers and you can't afford that against any side.' Samoa have only beaten New Zealand twice in 16 meetings, and have not threatened the Kiwis in their two clashes in this year's series, losing 21-7 in Wellington last month and 33-0 in Dubai in December.Markets and Economy
The Impact of Technological Disruption
Watch Jim Glassman, Commercial Banking’s Head Economist, discuss how technology is increasing worker productivity, boosting competition and creating—rather than displacing—jobs.
From e-commerce transforming retail to robotic assembly lines disrupting the manufacturing sector, technology is shaping and challenging the future of seemingly every industry. For companies to succeed in this increasingly competitive market, they must adapt quickly and take advantage of innovation. And although there’s been concern in the past about automation taking human jobs, history shows us that technological advancements raise living standards and actually create new jobs..

Would you create an actual cryptocurrency to make fun of other cryptocurrencies? That’s exactly what Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus did, and it’s paid off with an over $70 billion currency market. Now, it’s the fourth-largest cryptocurrency in the world.
Dogecoin (symbol: Ð) is a cryptocurrency that provides a payment system (like Bitcoin, another digital currency) that is instant, fun, and free from traditional banking fees. Its playful name and Shiba Inu dog mascot caused the currency to start as a meme, but as people began to actually purchase it, it became worth more and more.
Before Dogecoin, Palmer was a product manager at Adobe Inc.’s office in Sydney, Australia. As a “skeptic-analytic” observer of crypto, he joked on Twitter about creating Dogecoin as a way of satirizing the hype for cryptocurrencies. Surprisingly, people were totally on board. So, he bought the domain name Dogecoin.com.
That’s when Markus, a software developer at IBM, contacted Palmer. He wanted to create a digital currency but had trouble promoting his project and decided to jump on the Dogecoin buzz. He asked Palmer’s permission to build the software to create an actual Dogecoin.
Most cryptocurrencies are fairly serious and sterile in presentation, but Dogecoin was always different. Palmer and Markus decided to market Dogecoin as the “fun” version of Bitcoin. Since Bitcoin had a limited supply while Dogecoin had an unlimited supply, Dogecoin was also faster and more consumer-friendly for new crypto investors.
In 2015, Palmer made his departure from Dogecoin, citing the currency’s “toxic community” as a main reason why he left. Dogecoin also had its financial struggles during the 2018 cryptocurrency crash, but today, it’s grown stronger than ever. As of early May 2021, Dogecoin’s price is up more than 13,000% for the year.
Even though Dogecoin’s origins are humorous, Palmer and Markus’ business decisions were no joke. If you decide to purchase Dogecoin yourself, whether as a joke or for investing, please do your due diligence to understand the risks of cryptocurrency.
-Randy SklarDesign Your Own Experiments With PSLab
PSLab, with its simple and open architecture allows programmers, hobbyists to use the tool for various measurements and to develop new experiments with simple python code.
One of the main target group, the PSLab is aimed at, is high-school science teachers and students, who may or may-not be familiar with the computer programming. For such users it is difficult to design or develop new experiments on their own. They may also find it difficult to fetch the data and plot required graphs, if a ready-made GUI is not available for that particular experiment.
To enable such users to quickly design a simple experiment for studying various phenomena, we have developed a simple Experiment Designer GUI. This incorporates few controls, read-back elements and easy functions to select parameters and plot graphs.
The screen shot of the ‘Design Your Own Experiment’ GUI along with the App-window is here..
Experiment Designer allows the user to define the control and read-back sequences of parameters and execute them.
Features of “Design Your Own Experiment” GUI
- Configure Experiment : Here user can select the required channels ( manual / sweep / read-back). One can also add a derived channel for measuring some physical quantity, for example ‘current’.
- Make Measurements : Selected channels are displayed. User can make measurements individually for each step or can sweep in auto mode.
- Plot and View Plots: Enables user to plot selected parameters. Acquired plots can be selectively displayed or deleted.
- Save Plots: Data acquired can be save in a spreadsheet.
- Save Profile : Experiment profile can be saved for repeating the experiment in future. Saved profiles can be loaded from “Load Profile” tab.
Example : Diode IV Characteristics Experiment
For this experiment one needs the following…
- A variable voltage source : Needs to be swept from Voltage A to B (say from 0V to 5V)
- Current Monitoring : Needs to be read for every value of Voltage
- Plotting and analytics : Tools to plot the parameters and save data
Schematic Circuit diagram:
CH3 monitors the voltage drop across the diode. PV1 is varied in steps, and for each step the current is calculated from the difference between voltages at PV1 and CH3, and the known value of the resistor. For example for 1K resistor, current through the diode is given by
I = (PV1-CH3)/1K
Procedure :
Step 1. Connect Fossasia PSLab to the pc. Connect the components – Diode from CH3 to Ground and 1k resistor from PV1 to CH3
Step 2. From the terminal Run
Experiments
The App-window will pop-up. Click on ‘Design your own Experiment’ button to get the experiment designer GUI.
Step 3: Select channels
Sweep Channel PV1 – Sweep from 0.00V -5.00V in 200 steps
Read-back Channel CH3 – for monitoring voltage across the diode
Derived Channel – To measure Current. Type the equation to calculate the current, (PV1()-CH3())/1000
Step 4. Click on ‘Prepare Experiment‘ to get measurements screen. Click on ‘Evaluate All Rows‘ to make the measurements.
Step 5. Select the required columns and click on ‘Plot Selected Columns‘, a message window will pop-up, here user can select the Axes for plotting the graph. On clicking ‘Plot‘, view plots screen will be displayed.
One can repeat the experiment and plot multiple curves and save them in a spreadsheet. Acquired plots can be selectively displayed or deleted.
Step 6. The entire design ( Experiment Profile) of the experiment can be saved for repeating the experiment in future. Saved profiles can be loaded from “Load Profile” tab.
This is a very important value add to PSLab Apps. It has enabled PSLab to reach out and help users, who do not have any background in programming. Now ‘designing your own experiments’ has become super easy 🙂 🙂 🙂

my adopted childs rights to step fathers finances
When my husband and I started seeing each other I had guardianship of a 3 yr
old who i had had since he was 5 months. a couple years later when my
husband asked me to marry him, i told him my intent was to adopt ‘Gavin’ if the
chance ever arose and wanted to make sure he was clear that if we were to
marry we would adopt if the parents gave up their rights, he understood this.
Later this time came and he refused to adopt with me, Gavin was then 7 yrs old.
i was not letting him fall into the foster care system so i adopted him on my own
with my husbands consent. now 4 yrs later he doesnt love me and is done with
me. what rights does Gavin have? I also was diagnosed with lympyoma a
couple months after getting married so really my concern is Gavin’s future when
i am gone. Gavin was diagnosed with autism a year and a half ago. i want
nothing for me and will put anything Gavin has a right to in an account only for
him and his future care. needless to say i am in a mess here and dont know
what to do

Unless his stepfather had adopted him, your son cannot inherit in this case. A stepparent-stepchild relationship imparts no rights of heirship.

Your son has no rights to support or money from his stepfather. A step- relationship is not a legally recognized relationship: it imposes no obligations or duties (unlike adoption, which does). If your husband never adopted your son, he has no duty to your son; your son is not legally.LNG | Daily GPI | Infrastructure | NGI All News Access | NGI The Weekly Gas Market Report
Alaska LNG Project Lands Private Partner, Plans to Seek Federal Funding to Launch $5.9B First Phase
Alaska is pursuing federal funding and partnering with a private firm to jumpstart a long-simmering pipeline project to export North Slope natural gas.
Tim Fitzpatrick, spokesman for the state-owned Alaska Gasline Development Corp. (AGDC), told NGI that Alaska aims to begin the first phase of the state’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) pipeline and export plant by partnering with an as-yet unnamed private firm and by applying for federal pandemic stimulus and infrastructure funds.
AGDC may also seek defense funding because a large military installation in the state would be able to switch from coal to natural gas if the project is completed, Fitzpatrick said. AGDC anticipates that federal funds would cover approximately 75% of costs of the first phase, he said, with the private partner paying the rest and taking the lead on the project once funded.
AGDC said it and the private firm would build a $5.9 billion natural gas pipeline from the North Slope to Fairbanks. It would span about 500 miles and could begin delivering gas to the Fairbanks area by 2025, AGDC said.
Frank Richards, AGDC president, said that by breaking the project into phases, AGDC hopes to complete the key first portion of the pipeline largely with federal investments. With that work underway, he said, the overall project would gain momentum and likely be viewed as lower risk, opening a door for more private investments to complete the overall project.
“We’re calling strategic parties right now,” Richards told NGI. “That’s ongoing.”
Richards noted that the first phase of the project would create an estimated 1,400 direct construction jobs.
The total Alaska LNG project has an estimated cost of $38.7 billion. Plans call for three liquefaction trains with capacity of 20 million metric tons/year (2.55 Bcf/d), an 807-mile pipeline to move gas to the facility, a North Slope gas treatment plant and facilities to connect the Prudhoe Bay gas complex to the treatment plant.
Richards said AGDC hopes to complete the full project by 2030.
The Alaska LNG export facility is one of a few under development on the West Coast of North America, which is geographically well-situated to serve Asia, a lucrative market for U.S. LNG exports. Asia is expected to be a lead driver of growth in global natural gas consumption for much of this decade.
Asian demand for U.S. LNG has been particularly robust this winter.
LNG exports exceeded gas delivered via pipeline by nearly 1.2 Bcf/d in November, marking only the second time since 1998 that had happened. Demand from Asia for the super-chilled fuel mounted ahead of winter and intensified in December and January amid extended bouts of freezing temperatures.
LNG feed gas volumes increased in both December and January, NGI data show, as Asian demand further intensified amid the onset of a particularly harsh stretch of cold temperatures.EIA estimated that U.S. LNG exports would average 9.8 Bcf/d this month, on par with January’s record level. In its January Short-Term Energy Outlook, the agency forecasted that U.S. LNG exports would average 8.5 Bcf/d over 2021 and climb to 9.2 Bcf/d in 2022.

-.This week, we have been absorbing some of the feedback given to us during our week in St.Stephen’s Green; part of Innovation Dublin. As a result of this, all of the projects are now being reviewed. Some are going back to their roots; while others are going to have to change significantly. It’s all a process of evolution.
The latter part of the week was spent preparing for prototyping and presenting the projects in Clongriffin. Prototypes were centered around validating the projects with Clongriffin residents; finding out what they think of them. Friday was the deadline for moving the Designing Dublin office to Clongriffin. It was a rush to the finish and there wasn’t much time to share what each group was prototyping. In the end we made it across the line around 6pm.

There is a growing movement for ethnicity pay gap reporting to become mandatory. The government ran a consultation for employers that ended in January 2019. In October 2020 30 business leaders signed an open letter to the Prime Minister calling for mandatory ethnicity pay gap reporting. In February 2021, the Women and Equalities Select Committee in its report Unequal impact? Coronavirus and the gendered economic impact called for the government to publish proposals.
Capturing ethnicity data and publicising progress is the second call to action in Business in the Community’s (BITC) Race at Work Charter. Capturing data is important for establishing a baseline and measuring progress. It is a crucial step towards an organisation reporting on ethnicity pay differentials. Ethnicity pay gap reporting helps hold employers accountable for any disparities between different ethnic groups, draws attention to specific areas of concern, and drives a case for action to be taken to mitigate these imbalances.
Business in the Community (BITC) believes every employer must prioritise action on race. For more information on BITC’s framework for supporting employers with promoting racial equality in the workplace, visit the Business in the Community race campaign webpage.Most Popular in the Last...
A Gathering Of Africa’s Tech Hubs: AfriLab Gathering At Re:publica Berlin
The definite highlight of attending Re:publica was the gathering of African Tech Hubs taking place there, organised by AfriLabs. Having recently appointed a new Director Tayo Akinyemi, their role is to strengthen collaboration between Africa’s tech hubs, creating a Pan-African movement and creating mutual benefit by working collectively.
All interested Stakeholders including hub founders, managers and funders met for 2 days before the conference. There were hub representatives from right across the continent, including Activ Spaces, iHub, NaiLabs, Hive Colab, Habaka, KINU, ICE Cairo and Addis, Wennovation, Banta Labs, iLab, RLabs, Co-Creation Hub and Bongo Hive. I’m sure these meetings will be written up in further detail elsewhere, but it was inspiring to see such tremendous enthusiasm and fantastic ideas coming out from the group who discussed how to share knowledge and collaborate, shared information about hub sustainability and business models and explored ways in which to build the AfriLabs ecosystem. An excellent new governance structure is also being devised which will involve a rotating board and three steering committees, ensuring that inclusivity and openness is the name of the game.In Focus - with IRSC Public Media IRSC's Theatre Department is Ready to Entertain You (Socially Distanced of Course).

- Salt and pepper
- 1 cup light cream
- 2 cups frozen peas, thawed
- 1/4 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano Cheese
Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add salt, then add the pasta. Cook until al dente. Drain in a colander.
Meanwhile, in a small pan heat the olive oil and garlic, add the pancetta when hot and cook until golden brown. Set aside in a dish.
In the same pan, melt the butter over medium heat, until foaming. Add the onions and cook until soft. Add in the chicken stock or water and season with salt and pepper to taste. Stir in the pancetta and cook for about 2 minutes. Add in the cream; bring to a low simmer and cook 5 minutes until slightly thickened.
Pour the cooked pasta into the saucepan. Mix well to coat the pasta evenly with sauce. Lastly, stir in both the peas and cheese. Transfer to a warm serving bowl to serve. If desired, finish with grated cheese on top.
Serves 4One of my favorite trends for any home or apartment is creating a small office nook. Personally, when we built our playroom, I changed a larger than average closet into a small space for myself. Coming from a home of all boys, I wanted something where I can add my touch of gold and pink. Whether you live in a small apartment in NYC or wanted to add a desk to a bare wall in your bedroom, adding a chic desk or writing table can add, what my husband would call, "good use of space".
Ivy House turned a small corner of a master bedroom, into a chic office nook. We used the Gabby Georgia table, as the writing desk. If the client ever wants to change this part of the room in the future, they could use the table as an entry table or sofa table. For the chair, we chose a Lucite Louis chair, to keep the area clean. In case the client ever wanted to save space, we also included the West Elm Mongolian stools under the desk. We love how this look turned out and how versatile the space became.

Autopistas del Sol (AUSOL) was a company that had started off as a partnership forged in 1994, when it was commissioned, through a public bidding process, to build and manage two of the main highways into the Buenos Aires City. SES Foundation was a nonprofit organization informally created in 1998 -and formally established in 2000- by a group of professionals who developed informal educational programs to promote poor youths’ social inclusion. One of its more salient programs involved a number of “Community Study Groups” (CSGs,) an initiative SES carried out with AUSOL to boost schooling in two of the neighborhoods surrounding one of the highways.
This case takes place in late 2001 –that is, just a few months before Argentina succumbed to a severe crisis. It focuses on the potential changes and risks entailed for the CSG program by AUSOL’s decision to expand its alliance with SES by incorporating other sponsoring companies. While this strategy intended to secure program continuity, it also brought about a series of challenges for both organizations.
Also, the case allows for the analysis of how AUSOL’s business affected its ties to the community and how the company understood, early on, its need to build a relationship with the various stakeholders involved. In addition, it provides a forum to discuss some of the challenges faced by private companies managing public services.
Identifying problems in a timely manner, understanding social demands to businesses negatively affecting certain groups in the communities where they operate, spotting opportunities and risks involved in community relations are some of the issues addressed in this case.
Additionally, this case may be useful to discuss the following issues:
As it shows how forging ties with the community tends to follow business needs, the case is suitable for the analysis of topics such as strategic management and change processes, corporate strategic approaches, and business opportunities and challenges posed by social contexts. It is recommended for courses focusing on management strategies.INSTRUXTIONS

If you have a weak stomach stop reading right now.
Clan Valley High School has canceled summer school.
I know, it sounds insane. Right? Half the summer semester is already over with so canceling summer school seemed very odd to me. I called around and found out the true reason.
With the influx of gnomes into Clan Valley the school board insisted all gnomes under the age of eighteen must attend school. For those of you who don't know, Clan Valley is primarily a vampire valley. The transition has not been easy for gnomes or vampires.
Well, the gnomes – generally speaking they are three-feet tall with wrinkly skin like a Shar Pei and have brilliant red fuzzy hair that's about an inch long – refused to comply with the mandate.
Everyone knows gnomes are notorious pranksters so their response shouldn't have surprised anyone.
Gnomes taped the official mandate to the school doors, marked 'no' across the paper in bold red ink, and then flushed a fairy made stink bomb down every commode on school property.
Mundanes have no clue how bad a fairy made stink bomb smells.
Honestly, fairies – especially those from the artist caste – can create just about anything by utilizing their talent to manipulate synth energy, including changing normal attributes of certain objects. Today, the object in question was super glue. What they did was 'scientifically' impossible, but you must remember we are talking about fairies. They tend to warp scientific theory out of shape until it's unrecognizable.
The stink bombs were comprised of super glue, cow manure, rabbit manure, and skrivett pus. (A skrivett is a pus covered rodent.) The compressed bomb went down the pipes and exploded, spreading chunks of manure through-out the entire sewage system. No, it did not dissolve.
When the synth enhanced super glue touched the interior plastic wall of the pipes, it activated and expanded, sticking cow manure and pebble sized rabbit pellets throughout the entire sewer system. The skrivett pus, which smells like raw sewage in its natural state went everywhere, including the ceiling of the bathrooms.
I'm sure you can imagine, Principle Tinklebunn blew a gasket.
Literally, she shrieked until all the windows in the entire school and surrounding community shattered. Need I mention she is a fairy of the warrior caste? To be very specific she is a siren.
Even with so much damage, with the proper fairy made solvent, it shouldn't take the remainder of the summer to clean up the mess.
Well, you wouldn't think so, but the only one who can create a counter chemical to destroy the super glue is Samuel Nippers, the fairy who created the stink bombs. He is a Master Class within his caste and has refused to create a solvent that would disolve the super glue.
I've heard it without the solvent it will take weeks to dislodge the crap from the sewer system, clean the skrivett pus off the walls, and replace all of the windows.
Thanks so much for taking the time to comment!

About this event
Hopefully, you are blessed with a physical home. A house with four walls and a roof. But what about your spiritual home? Do you have a place where you feel you belong? Where you are loved, respected, and cared for?
Everyone deserves to know the feeling of unconditional love. To have their place in a tribe; a sisterhood; a community.
Do you feel heard, seen, valued, and celebrated exactly for who you are? Do you feel free to be you? Even if that means being grumpy, clumsy, forgetful, or weird at times?
Know that there is this place in the world where you are always welcome. Exactly as you are. It is a home where women are united, in harmony, in acceptance, in joy.
No matter our circumstances, no matter where we are in the world, we always have the ability to connect with each other. As long as we open ourselves up for it.
From the comfort of your own home, you'll enter a safe bubble in cyberspace. Where we will get to know each other, take time to rest and relax in guided meditation, and share the challenges and successes we are experiencing during our journey on planet Earth.
With a cup of tea, and perhaps some chocolate or a cookie from your pantry, we take a step back and become aware of what's present for us, what we need, and how we ensure we continue to look after ourselves and each other.
Will we meet you on the 19th? I hope so!
Let's connect.

The other part responsible for a good night gone bad? An expletive-laced quarrel between Candace and Gus. Typically the voice of reason in the house, Candace wasn't having it after Kirk got booted from Tootsies for throwing crackers at the head of a heckler.
"I don't understand why Kirk is the only one being thrown out of the club," she said.
After the Memphis native confronted the police, calling their decision "bulls**t," Gus piped up, defending the cops. Kirk was indeed slinging Saltines, which could be considered battery in some cases if the victim of said cracker-tossing were to press charges.
Candace wasn't having that either. "We are roommates. You're supposed to have your roommate's back," she said of Gus, who was just trying to celebrate his 23rd birthday in peace (and a JeriGus airbrushed tank).
While Kirk actually sided with Gus, understanding that his actions (throwing crackers) have consequences (getting kicked out), Candace's attitude was still "on 10" when the gang got to Coyote Ugly. And all Gus wanted to do was enjoy his birthday party.
"Talk about a birthday," he said. "I have to deal with Kirk getting kicked out of the bar. I have Candace coming at me saying, 'F*ck you, b*tch.' It's my birthday -- I'm supposed to have the attention. At this point, this is just a birthday I wanna forget."
The crew left its second bar of the night when Kirk got in trouble with a different PCB bar troll, and after he apologized, Gus requested the same from Candace, who swiftly declined. "I don't owe nobody an apology," she told the birthday boy. "We all should stick together, but you stuck with the cops."
Back at the shore house, the police arrived to arrest Kirk, and Candace opted to start packing.
"You know what? It's time for me to leave," she declared.
Should Candace apologize to Gus, and more importantly -- could she be finished with Floribama once and for all? (Say it ain't so!) Sound off with your thoughts, and catch an all-new episode Monday at 10/9c.LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — The Arkansas Supreme Court says it won't reconsider its ruling that blocked the city of Fayetteville from enforcing an ordinance banning discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.
The court without comment denied the request Thursday from the city and LGBT advocates for a rehearing. In January , the state Supreme Court overturned a lower court's decision and ruled that Fayetteville can't enforce its ordinance because of a previous ruling that found it violates a law aimed at preventing cities and counties from enacting protections not covered by state law.
Arkansas' civil rights law does not cover sexual orientation or gender identity.
Meanwhile, a federal nondiscrimination bill that includes protections for LGBT people was introduced this week in Congress, but the measure faces a lack of GOP support .[

The true meaning of justice
Justice and love. This is what Jesus is calling for in Luke 11:42-46. Without these, woe are we!
Justice and love go hand-in-hand. Justice is not revenge, nor is it punishment. It’s fairness. Love is the heart of Christian living; justice is its hands and feet.
Justice is not fairness as in “anything is okay as long as no one gets hurt”. If it’s not in accordance with the laws of God, people do get hurt. Not even the smallest sin can be justified. The sinner gets hurt by his separation from God, even if he or she does not recognize the separation. The target of the sin gets hurt of course, as does the whole Body of Christ, because the effect of the sin ripples farther than any of us can see.
Sometimes we think that justice means retaliation. It’s “eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth”, but this is an unredeemed sort of justice. When Jesus came to redeem the world, he gave us the Golden Rule of “do to others what you’d like them to do to you, even though they might not do it back to you, because you love your enemies and are willing to go the extra mile for them”. He raised us above the old attitude of “do to others what they did to you, ha-ha, now we’re even.” Justice means protecting ourselves from further harm without a spirit of vengeance. We care about our enemies while taking good care of ourselves.
Sometimes we think that if no one demands their God-given right to be treated fairly, it’s okay to overlook injustices, or if we don’t see a way to resolve the unfairness, it’s okay to do nothing about it. This is why employees are often drastically underpaid for their skill level, women are stereotyped as less capable than men, expertise gained by experience and self-education is not as “good” as a formal degree, bad-mouthing and insults and other abusive treatments are dismissed as merely someone’s management style, etc. — in the Church! Woe are we for the injustices of society when we are not teaching what true justice looks like by our examples!
True justice is described in Romans 2:8. “Affliction and distress will come upon everyone who does evil.” This is not the punishment of a revenging God. It’s a “woe to you” reaping what you sow. God’s anger is based on a genuine concern for those who are caught in the traps of sin. He’s upset about the choices we make that cause our woe-full self-inflicted anguish.
The challenge before us is to learn what we can do about the injustices that God calls to our attention, then discern when and where and how to take action, caring for the victims and also caring about those who are committing the injustices. If we don’t say yes to this challenge, woe are we!

As far as i know, if it was already digitzed material and not lightsound on film, that has allway been done with a reference timecode. To get external sound with 44/96 KHz in sync with a 23,98 fps sound that was speed up to 25 frames, smtp code is needed. Not possible with GH2.

In v1.1 and 25p you stil have to do some de-interlacing, there is no time winning, ad least not with sony vegas.
i use in final rendering also 25p But i am also waiting on the v1.1 hack/patch, there are more improvements i like.
Anyone think there's less noise at high ISOs with v1.1 vs the stock 1.0?
I think with 1.1 more noise, but always more detail

Facilitator, John Talbot, started off the meeting with introductions of the members of the Bear
River Basin Advisory Group, the consultants and the state staff, including members of the
Wyoming Water Development Commission, WRDS, State Engineers Office, and finally the
general public in attendance. Mr. Talbot also introduced his replacement, Joe Lord. Mr.
Lord gave a brief history on himself and how he came to be selected as the new facilitator.
Next, John Talbot summarized the agenda and expectations for the meeting.
Development of Programs for Local Presentations
The group asked for the State Planning Team to produce a video that explained what the
water planning process is all about. In order to clarify what was expected, Talbot asked the
group if they could be more specific as to what they wanted. Three potential formats were
discussed:
There was some discussion as to who the group is trying to reach with these programs, what
the message is, and whether this is the groups responsibility. The mission statement was read
again. The group feels that it is important to inform the public and try to get more people
involved. Everyone agreed that the more information that the public has, the better their
response will be at a later date. The group feels each member is responsible to represent the
people in their area and to get information out to the public.
Sue Lowry, State Engineers Office, stated that the planning team would start working on an
informational handout for the members to use in the near future, but that a video will take
longer to put together. The video will include information on the river basin planning process
and the purpose of the Basin Advisory Groups, with similar information also available on the
website.
BAG Membership Issues and Alternates
There were changes in the membership at the last meeting. New members were contacted and
asked if they wanted to participate. Additional contacts will be made to finalize the
membership.
Issues Identification
It was the consensus of the group that the issues that have already been identified are a good
starting point. This is a work in progress and issues can be added as they come to the groups
attention. The reason for the list is to give the consultant a starting point on basin issues to
be addressed in the plan. Assignment of municipal water rights and water transfers continue
to be major concerns.
Informational Presentations
Executive summary of consultant work tasks - Clarence Kemp, Forsgren and
Associates.
Clarence discussed the tasks in his
scope of services as relates to the issues previously identified by the basin advisory group.
A handout
detailing this information was presented to the group.
Additional topics discussed included:
Purposes of Planning
Clarence explained the basin planning process and products with a flow chart. He outlined
the responsibilities of the consulting team, which is made up of Forsgren & Associates,
Leonard Rice Consulting Water Engineers Inc, Anderson Consulting, and BBC Consulting.
Water Rights Attribution - Mike O'Grady, Frank Carr, States West Water
Resources
Mike described the water rights attribution work that will be done as a
part of the Bear River Basin Plan, and Frank explained the process and how this information
is useful for river basin planning and other interests. They pointed out that water rights
attribution would be done for both groundwater and surface water, but this is not a
comparison of the water rights of record to what is actually being irrigated. There will be
no mapping of water rights geographic boundaries.
Future Meetings
The September 13, 1999 meeting is scheduled in Cokeville for 6:00 PM at the Cokeville Town
Hall. The group decided to switch to an every other month format beginning with the next
meeting. There will not be a meeting in October, so the next meeting will be on November
8, 1999 in Evanston.
John Talbot reminded members of the need to turn in biographical questionnaires.
The meeting adjourned at 9:20 PM.In another display of monoclonal antibodies' appeal to drug developers, Maryland-based Humab Genome Sciences announced that it will team up with Xencor on drug development.

Sometimes that alone can do wonders for you."Hough says his celeb partner, Polish-born model Joanna Krupa, is concerned folks have the wrong impression of her because of the not-so-nice run-ins she had with football star Terrell Owens on the reality show ."She's all worried that people are going to think she's a big bitch," Hough said. She's very very sweet."Their first dance will be a salsa. Now that I'm single and she's good at the whole dating thing, she's going to help me out."But then he quickly added, "I'm not really worried about that."The models always kind of have that stiff thing going on and not being able to loosen up," Hough said.

The global monoethylene glycol market was valued at US$ 27.79 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach US$ 39.98 billion by year 2028, at a CAGR of 4.70%. Furthermore, bio-based monoethylene glycol is expected to create abundant opportunities for the expansion of the global monoethylene glycol market. Moreover, the growing demand for non-ionic surfactant and growing textile and fibre industries are probable to generate plentiful prospects for the growth of the global monoethylene glycol market, during the forecast period.
Polyester fabrics are extensively used in apparels, home furnishings, yarns and ropes and other industrial applications including conveyer belts and insulating tapes which are likely to drive the demand for MEG over the forecast period. The production of polyester fibres in the past years has been increasing. This increasing trend will also be observed during the forecast period. Roughly, 0.345 kg of MEG is used to make 1 kg of polyester
The growing demand for MEG in the production of polyester fibre is the major factor influencing the market growth. Interpreting to the technology, naphtha-based segment recorded the highest share in the market of approximately 47.1% The increasing industrial sector in countries such as China and India are driving the market growth. The Asia Pacific holds the largest market share of 37.5% in the global MEG market due to the rising demand for polyester fibre in the region
North America witnessed a stable growth in the market over the past few years and will continue to do so during the forecast period.Man Utd must give returning ace a chance rather than considering swap for 31-cap star – opinion
Despite being repeatedly linked to new attackers ahead of the summer transfer window, the one area that Manchester United seemingly need to improve is their defence.
The Red Devils have had no problem finding the back of the net since the restart, scoring 12 goals in their last four games, but defensive lapses are still there to be exploited.
Handing Bournemouth a route back into the game due to Eric Bailly giving away a silly penalty could have cost Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s team points had they not been so clinical going forward, and conceding an injury-time equaliser to Southampton is what currently stands between them and a top-four spot.
United fans will be glad to know that they’ve been linked to a £43.2m-rated centre-back this week, with reports circulating that Inter Milan are willing to offer the 20-time champions of England a swap deal involving Milan Skriniar for Anthony Martial.
Skriniar would seemingly bolster the United backline, he’s started 28 league games for a team with the best defensive record in a league famed for its defensive prowess, but is it worth sacrificing their top scorer for him when there could be a player just as good already on the books?
Of course, we’re talking about Chris Smalling.
The 30-year-old has seen a bit of a career resurgence over in Italy, and due to the fact he’s playing in the same league as Skriniar it’s very easy to compare the two.
The Englishman does make fewer tackles per game, but he trumps the Inter man when it comes to interceptions, clearances, catching people offside, making blocks and being dribbled past.
In fact, the 31-cap ace is dribbled past six-times more often than Smalling, and in a league where most teams have incredibly pacy attackers, that could be very costly if United want to bring him in.
Signing defenders from Serie A is always going to be fashionable due to the reputation that league has, but United’s loanee has shown he can hang with the best of them in Italy, and he has more than earnt his chance at another shot at Old Trafford, especially when one of the alternatives is swapping Martial for a defender who has been statistically outperformed by Smalling this term.

Some 13 years ago, Rodriguez was in search of a boat to fit his offshore fishing needs. Like many, he went to a boat show and purchased a new boat. After a year of ownership, it was stolen and later found stripped to the bare hull, a total loss.
Rodriguez was wanting to scratch that offshore itch, but before purchasing another new boat, a thought crossed his mind. “I asked myself if I really wanted to jump back into a new boat, or build my dreamboat instead.”
After some searching, he came across the boat he had always wanted, a 25 Contender. The boat was water-ready, and Rodriguez fished it as it sat. But there came a time when the boat needed new power.
“Repowering was the best move I could’ve made.” Going with twin 200-hp four-strokes, the fuel efficiency more than doubled from the original outboards. The updating didn’t stop at the transom, though.
Rodriguez figured this was a great time to spray the boat with new gelcoat, both inside and out, as well as fresh nonskid throughout the cockpit sole. He then laid custom engraved SeaDek throughout the boat making the boat “nice and silent.”
Bottom fishing required Rodriguez to be in the cockpit often, and the original leaning post storage was not cutting it. Reaching out to Boat Outfitters, he was able to get a custom tackle center that would hold all of his necessities, and fit right in the existing spot. While there, a cooler slide was added below the tackle center, opening up two more seats, when needed.
The original T-top was on the small side, and didn’t even cover all of the leaning post. Birdsall Marine fabricated a top to the exact specs Rodriguez needed, making plenty of shade for him and guests. Details, such as the diamond upholstery stitching throughout, made the boat unique, exactly what he wanted.
The boat was originally purchased for $25,000. After adding new motors and all modifications, the total investment came out $85,000. The value of life-long memories with family and friends? Priceless.
- How the boat sat when Rodriguez purchased it.
- An empty engine bracket could only mean one thing, power was on the way!
- Rodriguez decided it was time to redo all of the gel coat, both inside and out when hanging the new motors.
- The custom tackle center on the rear of the leaning post makes re-rigging a breeze when bottom fishing.
- The custom T-top from Birdsall Marine added more shade for those hot days offshore.
- Features such as custom stitching made this boat unique.
- Rodriguez was able to keep the classic feel of the boat, blended with new school technology, making for his perfect dreamboat.As the Family Goes, So Goes the Nation

Have you decided it isn’t working and sales are the only way to grow your business? Is the thought of social media overwhelming and seems like a waste of time?
Unless you are a medium- to large-sized company with a hefty marketing budget, a team of professional and a mountain of positive analytics that show success, you probably fall into one of these three categories:
Anything sound familiar?
Marketing is difficult. Sure, if you are a seasoned marketing executive or long-time business growth expert, this might seem like an overstatement. For the rest of us this is just the plain truth.
The typical successful business owner or executive is good at their business; they are good at delivering a great product or service. I work with doctors who are great at practicing medicine, educators who are changing the way kids learn and real estate professionals who are evolving our markets and how we do business. You are an expert at your profession and you should not be expected to be just as adept at marketing your business. Today’s marketing climate is complex, time consuming and rapidly changing.
You know how to be great at your business, but do you really know how to find more clients or revenue? Do you know how to get to these buyers? Do you realize that consumers use the internet to finalize almost all purchase decisions? Is your business digitally ready to close the sale? I can’t count the number of business owners I have met with that have an amazing product or service, but really don’t know how to get more customers on an ongoing basis or repeatedly maintain sales.
Getting customers is the secret sauce to business success and there are two ways to do it: sales and marketing. While sales are incredibly important and I could write thousands of words on it, let’s focus on marketing.
Marketing is the process and tools that we can use to amplify the sales of your product or service.
While marketing may not result in a direct sale, it is the only way (other than word of mouth or shopping) to get more people to learn about what you do. (A reminder that marketing and sales conversions are two different animals; marketing gets people to the store, it will not make them buy what you are selling.)
Marketing is technical, complicated and requires a creative AND practical method to succeed. Great design means nothing without a delivery strategy. A high tech digital presence means nothing if it is too tedious for your clients to navigate. PR is a waste of time if you don’t have a great digital strategy to capture the new audience.
Marketing is complicated because in today’s environment you must consider some or all of the following as platforms to amplify your business. And THEN you have to figure out how they will work for you and why.
Overwhelmed? Ready to think about how to get some help? Wondering why your current marketing team or agency isn’t walking through all of these items with you and relating it to top line growth? There is a reason for that too.
To successfully market your business we (the collective for whomever is doing your marketing) have to know your business inside and out. If we don’t understand your product, your service, your goals, your processes or your customers, it is impossible to successfully market your business. We have to know where your customers (or target) are and why they buy.
I believe that my agency does well because my background is growing businesses. I spent years working with CEO’s and learning how to grow businesses using planning, people, tools, sales and most recently, marketing. I’m not a seasoned marketer. I’m passionate about growing businesses and marketing just happens to be my tool of choice.
Most marketing and PR agencies don’t understand how to grow businesses. They know how to build tools or ads, maybe run your Facebook for you or get you some local PR in the paper, but they don’t really know how to connect business strategy to marketing.
Marketing cannot just be a print ad, email newsletter, Facebook business page or website. It has to be a combination of the right tools with the right purpose. We need to cross leverage marketing investments to ensure we are maximizing the ROI of each.
The Solution
When you are ready to commit to investing in marketing to grow your business, you have two options for how to succeed at it.
#1 – Hire a strategic marketer
Strategic marketers are not PR experts, designers or social media “experts.” They are business people that understand business goals and how to create a plan to deliver on that goal. Strategic marketers will take the time to learn your business from end to end. They must understand your revenue generation cycle as it stands today and then work with you to create a plan for taking it to the next level. Market dynamics, sales conversion process, sales cycle, competition, service delivery, branding, pricing and market demand should all be considered as part of your marketing plan.
If you are spending marketing dollars without this level of planning and analysis, you should start donating the budget to a great nonprofit instead. Not to mention, you need to be sure that you have a product or service that is in demand. Marketing is not difficult for companies that have great products and services. If you are having a hard time expanding your market or generating a repeatable service model, you might have to evaluate if you even have something that people want to buy.
#2 – Learn to be a strategic marketer
At least 50 percent of the business owners / executives that I have met with went into business without a media strategy for how they would grow. Reliance on word of mouth and sales only for growth is not a long range growth plan and we usually find that while they have experienced some success through their referral engine, business drops off at some point.
Great marketing includes an assessment and plan. Where is your business today, where do you want to go, exactly how will you get there and how much are you going to invest in it? You have to invest to grow. We recently worked with a company that had a goal of $35,000 to $50,000 a month in new revenue (service business). They spend $6,000 to $8,000 a month in digital ads + a retainer for us to run the digital ads, manage social media, create blog content and email marketing. They spend an average of 35 percent of target revenue on marketing. May seem like a high percentage for some businesses, but this is also a retainer-based business and many of these clients stay on for several months or years.
You have to spend money to make money.

The rest of French soloist's - or group maybe (that bit isn't quite clear) - material is fairly raw to say the least. More recently though, "The Youth" shows some really solid song writing dexterity. With the vocals being rather unorthodox to say the least, it produces a racket that could only be achieved by a 12 year old girl singing through a seriously crappy microphone who had accidentally turned the reverb settings up to 10. Well, perhaps not, but what is does add up to is a seriously catchy piece of garage styled grunge-pop that has slight similarities with Brighton's Gross Magic.

505: Understanding Customers’ Temperature Sensitivity Using Segmented Regressions
Session Category : Customer
People have different sensitivity over home temperature. Understanding the response of the customer’s electricity usage to external temperature could help utilities market groups of customers differently. Here we present a study where we fitted segmented linear regression models for over 500,000 residential customers in our service territory using the electricity usage and temperature data. The results gave us insights about the customer’s comfort zone, the base level usage, and distinct patterns of sensitivity to hot and cold temperatures. Customers using electric heaters during the winter can be easily separated from those using gas heaters. We suggest that this method can be applied to other utilities and by combining with demographics data, it can provide a powerful view about customers.Are you looking for black magic specialist in U.k Canada Taranto then here you can get help of our astrologer who is offering their services by black magic in U.k Canada Taranto.

Ingram Micro is in talks with a number of “major” UK retailers as it looks to become an established provider of white labelled ODM handsets, tablets and wearables.
The company, which is nearing a $6 billion sale to aviation firm HNA, has teamed up with a manufacturing factory in China to provide the service, which has been in development for 18 months.
Ingram will work closely with retailers and operators both in the UK and internationally to build bespoke products to their requirements under their own branding.
It will also manage all sourcing, logistics, repairs, flashing and packaging for the lifetime of the product for their customers.
Speaking exclusively to Mobile News during last month’s Mobile World Congress, Ingram Micro executive VP mobility Shailendra Gupta (pictured left) said the opportunity was “vast” with around 45 per cent of the 1.4 billion handsets shipped globally last year carrying white label brands.
Big opportunity
“It’s really coming to fruition,” said Gupta. “There are a number of extremely good Chinese ODMs who are able to manufacture products to a very high quality. The problem they have is how to bring their products to the market, because they don’t have a commercial arm.
“We are now providing the enablement to bring their products to the market under the private labels of the carriers and retailers.
“We’ll identify a product that meets their requirements, help to design a unique ID for that product and for the customer, package it and support it for the lifetime.”
Ingram Micro president Europe mobility Jac Currie (pictured right) added: “The local brands are a big part of the market and target a set of customers who are wanting value for money. It’s a big opportunity.”
Target markets
The names of the retailers in discussion could not be revealed as we went to press. The company has already soft launched a number of handsets in Latin America, Africa and Eastern Europe with carriers and retailers.
Currie said the UK launch has been made possible as a result of last year’s acquisition of ANOVO for a rumoured £80 million.
ANOVO, headquartered in Norwich, has operations in the UK, Columbia, Chile, Brazil, Peru, Spain, France, Poland and Belgium – all potential target markets. It was described as the missing piece to spearhead Ingram’s ODM drive, providing it with a complete suite of services, managing both forward (distribution) and reverse (returns) logistics.
This is something, Currie claimed many have struggled with. “Some have tried and been successful by going it alone, but many have faced issues when the products come back,” said Currie.
“It’s one thing to manage it going out, but its an entirely other thing managing the process when its returns. We are doing everything properly.
“What we have done is put the forward motion in place but also the reverse motion so we can take care of the refurbishment, repair, regeneration and resell for them.”
They say “many have faced a problem with the product coming back”. It is coming back because the quality is poor and that is the real issue. The Chinese manufacturers have been working the European markets for years. They do not need Ingram except to give them a Purchase Order. Good Luck.

This can be achieved by rotating the wrists so that the palms are facing outwards. Once this position has been achieved, flex the arms by bringing the hands towards the shoulders. Once the arm is fully flexed, slowly lower the hands back to the starting position, keeping the palms facing outwards the entire time (this will focus the exercise primarily on the biceps). Throughout this entire movement the elbows should remain fixed in one spot by the side of the body. Allowing the elbows to move increases the involvement of other muscles during the exercise, this will decrease its effectiveness at strengthening the biceps.
.jpeg)
Equipment needed: Resistance band (preferably one with handles attached to each end).
Modifications: It is very easy to modify this exercise, but it requires having different levels of resistance bands. To make this exercise easier simply use an easier band with less tension and to make it more challenging simply use a band with more tension. There are many different colors of bands, but typically the lighter the color the easier the band. Another easy way of distinguishing between bands is to look at the width of the band.
Applications: The biceps do not play a major role in many functional movements, but do provide stabilization in many upper body functional movements. They do play a major role during most rowing or pulling movements, so strengthening them is important.46 million fewer visitors and £2.8bn lost: Covid-19's impact on Lancashire tourism revealed

The 2020 figures, benchmarked against 2018 figures as STEAM figures were not collected for 2019, take into account the range of unprecedented circumstances faced by the sector; from national lockdowns, enforced periods of closure, varying local restrictions across the county, the introduction of the furlough scheme and reduced operating capacity resulting from the implementation of social distancing measures..
“Support such as the furlough scheme and the VAT reduction for hospitality businesses, helped Lancashire’s tourism sector rally and once restrictions were lifted, tourism and hospitality businesses demonstrated remarkable levels of creativity and responsibility in both their offer and customer.
Also 70 per cent of Lancashire businesses taking part stated that advanced bookings (Oct-Dec 2021) were at or above those across the same period in 2019.
Marketing Lancashire said that over the coming months it is investing in Visit Lancashire campaigns to attract visitors for autumn/winter short breaks, and to highlight events and activities linked to half term, Halloween and Christmas.
On November 27, Lancashire Day, the team at Marketing Lancashire will once again lead asocial media campaign championing the county on a local, national and international level.
Rachel added: “We are all learning to manage the risks of Covid-19 and we should be very proud of the way Lancashire’s tourism and hospitality sector has weathered this unbelievably difficult time. This summer, tourism and hospitality businesses across the county have gone to great lengths to build-back visitor confidence and to provide safe environments for holidays closer to home.
“Lancashire is redefining in every sense and Marketing Lancashire will continue to seize opportunities that will support the tourism and hospitality sector into 2022 and beyond.”He was never going to get it for this. And I don’t mean John Goodman of course. Denzel Washington is almost always a safe bet when it comes to entertainment, although I wish I didn’t see The Book of Eli which for some inexplicable reason has 6.8 rating on imbd. Sure enough, Denzel is ok in Flight and it’s entertaining enough a movie. Most would probably say it’s very American. To me it also appeared like he was going for an Oscar style performance in Flight.
I didn’t have high expectations, and I was expecting some over the top emotional acting, so I got just what I was looking for I suppose. John Goodman was a change of pace in the movie whenever he showed up, and one of the few funny moments, even if it was over the top too, and did not fit well in the rest of the movie. For some, Nadine Velazquez is probably the only thing they’ll remember from the movie.
Funny (or possibly not funny at all), the film is based on true story with somewhat different outcome. For me, definitely the the first quarter or third of the film was the best bit, as shallow as it might seem. But all of it was pretty unsurprising and the latter part of the movie didn’t really offer any major insights into the matters the movie was dealing with.
Then again there’s only a handful of directors that come up with this type of major American drama; if it’s not Spielberg, is has to be Robert Zemeckis.MERO CONSULTANY is an umbrella organisation which manages its four subsidies: Three Migration Services, GlobEd Education and Nepalese Crafts.

Major US stock indices slumped more than two percent on Friday to conclude a bruising week for markets rattled by the US-China trade clash.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 2.2 percent, or more than 550 points, at 24,388.95. The broad-based S&P 500 slumped 2.3 percent to 2,633.08, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 3.1 percent to 6,969.25. The losses ended the worst week for US stocks since March and left both the Dow and S&P 500 in negative territory for the year.
The declines followed a mixed US jobs report that had initially helped lift stocks early in the session. US stocks had opened the week on a positive note after Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping agreed over the weekend on a ceasefire on new tariffs. But sentiment soon shifted, especially following the US-initiated arrest of a top Chinese Huawei executive that was seen as exacerbating the US-China clash. Most sectors were sharply lower on Wall Street, with industrials, consumer discretionary and technology all losing two percent or more. Losses among energy shares were comparatively small after an OPEC deal boosted oil prices. But shares of Chevron, ExxonMobil and others also finished the session in the red.
KSE-100 stages modest recovery with 261-point gain
A day after tumbling over 1,000 points, the Pakistan Stock Exchange staged a modest recovery on Friday and gained 261 points, closing above the 38,500 mark. At the start of trading, stocks traded briefly in the green zone before a bear-run prevailed, which struck 500 points off the benchmark index. However, most of the losses were wiped off by the end of the first session as investors began cherry-picking of stocks.
The positive rally continued in the second half as well and the market ended the day in the green. Exploration and production stocks bore the brunt of dented sentiments following two massive falls in the KSE-100 index in the current week. Other index-heavy stocks moved higher.
At the end of trading, the benchmark KSE 100-share Index recorded an increase of 261.42 points or 0.68 percent to settle at 38,562.05. Overall, trading volumes decreased to 128.5 million shares compared with Thursday’s tally of 189.8 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs6.7 billion. Shares of 354 companies were traded. At the end of the day, 228 stocks closed higher, 108 declined and 15 remained unchanged. K-Electric was the volume leader with 13.9 million shares, gaining Rs0.35 to close at Rs5.53. It was followed by Pak Elektron with 12 million shares, losing Rs0.09 to close at Rs24.81 and Lotte Chemical with 7.1 million shares, gaining Rs0.03 to close at Rs18.42. Foreign institutional investors were net sellers of Rs106.7 million worth of shares during the trading session, according to data compiled by the National Clearing Company of Pakistan.
Saudi Arabia stocks decline
Saudi Arabia stocks were lower after the close on Thursday, as losses in the Industrial Investment, Hotels & Tourism and Petrochemicals sectors led shares lower.
At the close in Saudi Arabia, the Tadawul All Share declined 0.44 percent. The best performers of the session on the Tadawul All Share were Mobile Telecommunications Company, which rose 6.34 percent or 0.42 points to trade at 7.04 at the close. Meanwhile, Solidarity Saudi Takaful Co added 5.30 percent or 0.80 points to end at 15.90 and Eastern Province Cement Co. was up 4.82 percent or 0.94 points to 20.44 in late trade.
The worst performers of the session were Saudi Cable Company, which fell 2.87 percent or 1.10 points to trade at 37.20 at the close. Saudi Industrial Export Co declined 2.73 percent or 2.70 points to end at 96.20 and Yanbu National Petrochemical Co was down 2.45 percent or 1.70 points to 67.70. Falling stocks outnumbered advancing ones on the Saudi Arabia Stock Exchange by 121 to 50 and 15 ended unchanged.
India Sensex index moves higher
Indian markets rose over one percent on Friday after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) ended talks without a deal on oil production cuts when the markets closed.
BSE’s 30 share benchmark Sensex rose 1.02 percent or 361.12 points to closed at 35,673.25, while the National Stock Exchange’s 50 share index Nifty climbed 0.87percent to 10,693.70 points. Later, OPEC and its Russia-led allies moved closer to clinching a deal that would cut oil production by more than the market had expected. The producer club will curb output by 0.8 million barrels per day (bpd) from January while non-OPEC allies contribute an additional 0.4 million bpd of cuts, Iraqi oil minister Thamer Ghadban said after OPEC concluded two days of talks in Vienna. However, domestic institutional investors (DIIs) continue to sell in equities ahead of state election results. So far in December, DIIs have sold nearly 2,500 crore worth of Indian shares. For the year to date, DIIs have invested a net of 1.06 trillion while foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have pulled out a net of $4.91 billion in Indian equities.
Brokers hit out at Hong Kong stock exchange trading proposals
Hong Kong stockbrokers have raised the alarm over new rules proposed by the city’s stock exchange operator that would automatically suspend trading in companies whose auditors have issued unfavorable comments on their financial statements. The Hong Kong Securities Association, an industry group with more than 1,100 members from roughly 350 companies representing more than 70 percent of the city’s stockbrokers, says the rules would curtail investors’ freedom of action, potentially damaging the value of their holdings.Selected pieces of La Loba hand painted Mexican furniture can be found in these stores.

- It protects your right to make medical choices that can affect your life
- It may minimize the stress and responsibility on family members having to make medical decisions for you
- It gives guidelines to the physician(s) involved in your care our Advance Directive brochure >

Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST)
This is a document signed by both the patient and his/her health care provider that helps all health care providers understand and honor a patient’s wishes regarding resuscitative and life-sustaining treatment.

.”
Thank you to my editor, the wonderful Anne Victory of Victory Editing, for the reference, after I asked her if I was wrong to be irritated when I saw “that” instead of “who” when referring to people.
She confirmed that it’s not technically wrong to use “that,” but it creates distance and dehumanizes whatever you’re talking about.
The guy that kissed me.
The guy who kissed me.
I hate seeing that used in reference to a person. Especially a person who just kissed me. If I were writing about Edward I’d use THAT, but for Jacob, WHO.
Zombie? That.
And no kissing.

With Beauty & the Beast celebrating its 25th anniversary this year, and the new movie being released next year, I thought it would be great to have a Beauty & the Beast – themed tea party. And since December is approaching, why not kick start the holidays with a Beauty & the Beast Holiday tea party?
Whether you’re having a holiday get-together, Beauty & the Beast themed birthday party, or afternoon tea, I hope you enjoy the photos from my celebration, and are able to pull inspiration and ideas from my set-up for your own parties!
The Food
I had to include some tea sandwiches, of course! On whole grain bread, I spread cream cheese and canned whole cranberries, then used my Mickey Mouse cookie cutters to infuse some Disney magic into my tea sandwiches!
They were simple to make, and turned out absolutely delicious! To display and serve the food at the tea party, I used Q Squared NYC plates, in Yuletide pattern. These plates are my favorite for get togethers, since they look and feel like porcelain (one of my guests even thought they were), but are actually shatterproof! You can check out more of their patterns here.
For the savory entree, I created a Holiday Pasta Salad served in a Q Squared NYC Yuletide bowl. It is penne pasta, broccoli, pine nuts, with a cranberry, Greek yogurt, and Cabernet Sauvignon sauce. You can click here for the recipe.
I also included gingerbread biscotti! I used Nonni’s brand gingerbread biscotti – my absolute favorite! Their biscotti is low in calories, uses natural, high quality ingredients, and are incredible delectable. Just the perfect amount of crunch without being too hard! It was the perfect food addition to our holiday tea party.
For a more dessert-type food item, I created the Grey Stuff! It’s my healthy copycat version of Be Our Guest Restaurant’s famous dessert “The Grey Stuff”. You can get my recipe here. I served them in espresso shot glasses, topped with soy whipped cream from Whole Foods.
Last but not least, the tea for the tea party! In theme to Beauty & the Beast, I used Tudor House’s Romantic Rose tea, made with wild roses, white tea, green tea, peppermint, lavender, and jasmine flowers. It had a wonderful, delicate, floral taste.
I loved the rose petals in the tea! And since the loose leaf tea smelled so wonderful, I even put a bowl of the dry tea on the table for aroma. You can learn more about Tudor House Teas here.
The Decor
The decor really made the party! My friend Melanie from Gable Fox Design created this beautiful enchanted rose centerpiece, and can easily be replicated! She glued a faux rose onto a piece of glittery gold scrapbooking paper. She then wrapped tulle around the base, and put a vase upside down over it. I love that it was so simple, yet really will blow guests away with how gorgeous it is! To elevate the centerpiece, she placed two fairytale books underneath.
Also on the table was a framed print of a Disneyland Christmas-inspired print illustrated by Beep Boop Beep Clothing. You can purchase your print or this design on phone cases or shirts here.
My absolute favorite piece of decor at the party was this beautiful hand drawn sign on the table, also lettered by Gable Fox Design!
The last few touches where silverware wrapped in white napkins, wrapped in twine. I finished it off by clipping a white bird ornament to the twine. It reminded me of the birds Belle feeds in the snowball fight scene in Beauty & the Beast! I had the Q Squared NYC plates and bowls out in the yuletide pattern, and beautiful name place cards from Gable Fox Design.
For the children’s activity, we had the Seedling Beauty & the Beast Flower Press Kit! This kit allows children to be creative by pressing and preserving flowers and plants – complete with beautiful Beauty & the Beast theming! You can find the Seedling flower press kit here.
It was definitely a great way to start the holiday season, and will be a party I will remember for years to come! I would love to hear what themed party you would like to see from me next!

Ingen kommentarerThe other day over dinner with a friend, she said, “You’ll never guess what my mom got me for Christmas—a sewing machine and a hand mixer. I mean, I’ll keep the mixer because I do like to make chocolate chip cookies, but I mean, a sewing machine?!”
Our other friend said, “She should have bought you a climbing rack!”
We laughed and agreed that maybe her mom doesn’t understand her very well. Some of us women just aren’t that into the trappings of domesticity. Not because we’re feminists. Or because we’re career driven, or lazy. We’d just rather be playing outside.
Even as American women are becoming more free to pursue careers and nontraditional life paths, there still seems to be a subconscious or societal pressure to also hold up the traditional domestic roles we’ve taken on in the past. Sure, we’re free to work 60+ hour weeks or be professional cyclists, but shouldn’t our houses also be spotless? And all our meals organic and homemade? And our living rooms perfectly curated? It’s tough to pull it all off. And sometimes getting out on the trail just might be more rewarding.
A couple years ago, I was carrying my dirty mountain bike up to my apartment, well after dark, trying to open the door with one hand and also not squish the burrito I’d bought on the way home from riding. The smell of an elaborate dinner filled my nostrils. My roommate had cooked a healthy, delicious-smelling meal and was scraping the leftovers into a container as I plopped, dusty and sweaty, into a kitchen chair. She offered me some as I peeled open the foil on my burrito. And I thought to myself, Someday. Maybe someday I’ll cook again.
It’s not that I didn’t like to cook. I loved handling vegetables and putting together tasty, creative meals. Just not as much as I loved mountain biking. So every night after work, instead of heading home to prepare food, I’d be driving to the trailhead. And when I got home late, dirty, tired and happy, I’d eat whatever I could throw together or pick up from a takeout joint.
After a couple of dates with a guy who didn’t mountain bike at the time, I invited him over for dinner for the first time. I was actually going to cook something, and it felt like a pivotal moment. When I apologized for the house being cluttered, he said, “A clean house is a sign of a wasted life.” This relationship might really go somewhere, I thought.
There’s a difference between not-quite-squeaky-clean and gross, of course. But I’ve found that a housework to-do list will automatically expand to fill the time allotted. And the more money I’m spending on curtains, pillows and kitchen gadgets, the less I have to spend on plane tickets, bike parts and climbing shoes.
I’m really glad my mom gave me a vacuum cleaner for Christmas a couple years ago because—and maybe this is sad—I wasn’t planning on spending my own money on one anytime soon. And I truly appreciate it when friends invite me over to their neat, clean homes for gourmet dinners. Maybe I feel a little guilty about not having swept my floor in a few days, or not making my gnocchi from scratch.
Don’t get me wrong—I own a sewing machine, which I’ve used. And a heart-shaped cake pan. And a Pinterest account. But if I have the choice between sitting at home to mop the floor and heading up to the mountains to ride or climb a few pitches, you can probably guess which one I’m choosing.
How has no one commented on this? I believe this applies to having children too, I’d rather play (outside) with my kids than worry my house is cluttered.
BTW, finally clicked on your link from an AJ article. Your website is now in my favorites!
Thank you for writing this!! Every Sunday when I get home from a weekend packed full of fun with bikes and surfboards, I always feel guilty that I didn’t make something delicious or clean my house or grocery shop or whatever but I’m exhausted from all the playing that is done. I’m glad it’s not just me! 🙂Recently back from Japan, Bill Hagerty says he plans on 'spending a lot time' traveling Tennessee as he mulls U.S. Senate bid
With the Republican primary less than a year away, former U.S. Ambassador to Japan Bill Hagerty stoked speculation Friday that he will enter Tennessee's U.S. Senate race in the coming weeks.
Speaking to a roomful of Republicans gathered in Williamson County for Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson’s annual fundraiser, Hagerty remained silent about his plans for the Senate race while expressing appreciation for being in Tennessee.
"It's wonderful to be back home," he said, later telling reporters he returned to Tennessee on Thursday night.
Hagerty is widely expected to launch a bid for the Senate in the coming weeks. Last month, President Donald Trump announced on Twitter that the ambassador would leave his post and run for the U.S. Senate. Trump endorsed Hagerty, who has skirted public attention since the president’s tweet as he’s initiated the process to official resign from as ambassador.
Speaking to The Tennessean and The Tennessee Journal, Hagerty initially declined to elaborate on his future plans, instead thanking Trump. But he later added additional insights about his future.
"The next steps that I'll take will get me back re-engaged here with Tennessee," he said. "I plan on spending a lot of time going from one end of the state to the other talking to people and hear from them what the issues are."
Hagerty added, “We have new horizons ahead of us. We’re working on that right now and I’ll be able to…talk very soon about what we’re going to do.”
Asked about Trump's endorsement, Hagerty said, "I’m very honored by the president’s tweet. I just need to put some componentry in place before I can address what that tweet was about.”
Since Trump's endorsement, Hagerty stayed abroad and was reportedly helping with diplomatic efforts. But on Friday he declined to say what he was doing in recent weeks.
"I got back home as soon as I reasonably could," he said. "We've got a lot of important things going on in the region and I've been involved in a lot of that."
Addressing the GOP gathering, Hagerty praised the president, Johnson and U.S. Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Marco Rubio, both of whom were in attendance, while calling it an honor to work in Japan as ambassador.
Although he has yet to launch his campaign, Hagerty teased what could be some of his platform. He praised Blackburn for her support of the proposed wall along the southern border and her efforts to fight against illegal immigration.
Addressing the crowd, Rubio praised Hagerty.
“I’m interested to see what he’s going to do next,” Rubio said of Hagerty. “I have some ideas about where we could use him, but I’ll leave that up to him. But I know President Trump is a tremendous supporter.”
Nashville orthopedic trauma surgeon Manny Sethi, who is the only top-tier Republican candidate in the race thus far, stood on the side of the room Friday as Hagerty appeared on stage. He arrived late from the operating room, Sethi said.
Sethi confirmed he was "not invited" to make an appearance on stage as Hagerty had been, and alluded to Hagerty's backing by the Republican establishment as being "Manny versus the machine."
"This election is going to be about someone who comes from the outside, the conservative outsider, someone who comes from the private sector," Sethi said. "I've been spending my whole life trying to help people across the state, versus kind of more of the same, of career politicians and the establishment. That's what you saw tonight."
Hagerty's return to Tennessee comes more than two weeks after he shared a video on Twitter offering a goodbye to Japan, further signaling his interest in the race to replace U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander.
Also in the race but facing significant uphill battles are Knoxville physician Josh Gapp, truck driver Aaron Pettigrew, who received 15 percent of the vote in last year's GOP primary, and Clyde Benson, who served in the U.S. Army Reserves and unsuccessfully ran for the legislature in 2016.
Nashville attorney and Iraq War veteran James Mackler is the lone Democrat in the race.
Ward Baker, who ran U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn’s 2018 campaign, is expected to lead Hagerty’s campaign.Zach Sherwin is a Los Angeles-based writer and performer whose YouTube videos have been viewed over 400 million times.

When thinking of Mexican cuisine, one often conjures up images of enchiladas, tacos, rice, and refried beans. Yes, those dishes are part of traditional Mexican cuisine, but, so too is seafood. Known as a Marisqueria, Mariscos Azteca is a Mexican seafood restaurant. Yes, Mariscos serves the familiar Mexican cuisine, but the restaurant does specialize in authentic Mexican seafood.
Located adjacent to Ed Smith Stadium, in a small strip mall on the corner of Tuttle and 12th, Mariscos is a small, unassuming, very casual, family friendly restaurant. With a modest, clean, and simple decor, one is completely at ease when entering the restaurant.
Open daily at 11:00am, Mariscos Azteca serves lunch and dinner. The menu is large offering a wide variety of Mexican favorites, lunch specials, and of course, seafood. In other words, a multitude of delicious options which means something for the picky eater, and a tough decision for the connessior.
For our meals we chose the following:
Tostadas de Ceviche: Raw fish or shrimp cooked in fresh lemon juice, mixed with fresh tomatoes, red onions and cilantro in our specialty spices, topped with avocado slices. We chose Camaron o Pulpo $11.50
Fresh and colorful. A great contrast between the soft fish and crunchy tortilla. Ample pieces of shrimp and fish. Hint of cilantro. Plenty of thinly sliced red onion but not overpowering.
Azteca Salad: Hearts of romaine lettuce, tomato, red onion, cucumbers, sliced avocado, Mexican queso fresco and our very own avocado vinaigrette dressing. $6.95
A very fresh and crisp salad. The avocado dressing was mellow with a lucious mouthfeel.
Shrimp Empanadas: Fried flour tortilla dough filled with shrimp, Monterey Jack cheese, garnished with sour cream, guacamole, lettuce and tomatoes. (3) $9.95
Light and flaky, not overly filled but adequate. The guacamole was a tad salty. A good starter.
Pork Tamales: Corn based dough steamed in a corn husk leaf wrapper filled with our specialty marinated pork. Topped with our house green tomatillo sauce, lettuce, and Mexican queso fresco. (4) $8.75
Great flavors with a slightly spicy kick! The pork’s textures was stringy and was well seasoned. The steamed corn was mild. Great value! Easily shared.
Tacos de Camaron o de Pescado: Soft corn tortilla served with grilled shrimp or fish, topped with lettuce and guacamole. $2.95
Tortilla was soft, earthy, grainy texture. Guacamole was too salty. Seafood was fresh.
Pescado Sarandeado: Roasted marinated adobo filet of fish seated in a bed of Chipotle Coleslaw and fresh tomatoes. Grouper $15.90
Ah yes summer on a plate. Refreshing coolness from the lettuce, cabbage and tomatoes, contrasting with the fresh seasoned fish and sauce. Cool and slightly spicy. Ample size.
Mole Poblano: An absolute must have chicken breast covered with Azteca style mole made from some of the 30 ingredients, chilies, nuts, seeds, spices, and Mexican chocolate. Rich, bold flavor. Served with a side of Mexican style rice, lettuce, tomato typed with our very own avocado vinaigrette. $11.25
The Mole was a beautiful dark brown color. Rich and deeply seasoned. Layers of flavors. Slightly spicy. If you are a connoisseur of Mexican cuisine, this is a must try dish.
Chile Relleno: Large poblano pepper stuffed with your favorite filling: queso fresco, ground beef, carne asada, pastor, carnitas, or shredded beef. Topped with ranchero sauce and our Mexican queso fresco. Served with side of tortillas, rice and beans. $11.50. (We chose queso fresco.)
Large chile pepper. Amply filled. Soft, tender, not too spicy. Mouth wateringly delicious. A favorite of mine.
Ground Beef Enchilada: Enchilada topped with enchilada red sauce. Served with rice and beans. $7.25
A traditional Mexican cuisine favorite.
Chicken Enchilada: Topped with sour cream sauce, mole sauce or green sauce. Served with rice and beans. $7.25. (We chose green sauce.)
The texture of the fresh corn tortilla and a little bit of kick in the green sauce made for a tasty enchilada.
Mariscos Azteca offers an adequate selection of soft drinks, imported and domestic beers and wine. The wait staffs are very friendly, work together, fast, helpful in explaining items on the menu, and efficient.
The perfect spot for a casual ethnic meal, Mariscos Azteca is a short drive from downtown; definitely worth the trip!

Cryptopsy have released “Fear His Displeasure,” another track off their forthcoming EP, The Book of Suffering – Tome II. I’m not sure I’d recommend listening to it, though. Not because it’s bad — because the EP only has four songs! It comes out October 26, so why have half of it already spoiled for you when you just a wee bit more patience to experience the whole thing in one setting?
Still, if you don’t have the willpower to resist, you can listen below. Tome Deux pre-orders are here.Wrinkles, frown lines, forehead furrows and fine lines? When women reach the age of 30s, they start to show signs of early ageing.
The premature signs of ageing begin to surface that most women want to hide it to cover their real age. Although some admit that they don’t fret with their wrinkles, more women than men, are more concerned to cover up these signs of aging.
Sun exposure, stress, free radicals and environmental pollution are the main contributory factors to develop wrinkles. Moreover, as one ages, the skin begins to lose elastin proteins and collagen that are responsible to keep the skin firm. The ability of the skin to absorb moisture is also diminished, making the skin appear saggy and wrinkled, especially on the forehead, mouth, eyes, and neck.
Botox and surgery are recommended for people who want to get rid of wrinkles in a more invasive way. There are more natural ways to help you reduce wrinkles without resorting to botox. Here are some easy tips to do it:
Facial yoga
One of the easiest and free ways to lessen and slow the signs of aging is through facial yoga or exercises. Doing it regularly, tightens and strengthens your facial muscles. As a result, it reduces the wrinkles and tone the saggy facial skin. Do you want to get rid of the stubborn lines on your forehead? Using your finger pull the skin on above and below your eyebrows. Lift it as high as you can and as far as you can. Repeat the procedure three or more times daily to see the difference.
Avoid the sun
Sun is the main cause of wrinkles more than heredity, according to studies. Frown lines are caused by squinting. Make it a habit to wear sunglasses to avoid squinting and relax the skin around the eyes. This lessens the development of wrinkles in the forehead and around the eyes.
It’s important to keep your skin moisturized. You can use anti-wrinkle creams, but remember that some of these contain ingredients that can dry out the skin. Examples of these products are Retin A and Renova. Use products that have retinoids and alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) that can increase the collagen production and hydrate the skin. However, these products are usually pricey. Instead, use cheaper labels that have concentrated portions of vitamin A, E, and C that provide the same effects.
Avoid smoking
Smoking can lead to premature aging. If you don’t want to develop wrinkles early, avoid smoking. If you’re out in public, make sure to avoid smoking zone or opt for smoke-free sections.
Drink plenty of water
Drink plenty of water to prevent the early formation of wrinkles and fine lines. It easily hydrates the skin, making it appear firm. Drink 8 to 10 glasses of water every day. You can also eat foods rich in water, including watermelon, lettuce, cucumber, berries, pumpkin, and tomato.
Use frownie pads
Frownie pads are small adhesive patches, available over the counter. It can help you lessen the wrinkles and fine lines on your face by just wearing the patch on the affected area. Leave it overnight to help the muscles relax and avoid sagging. It is made from natural ingredients, so it is safe to use. Use it for 2 to 4 weeks to observe the result.

It must be the Yankee in me (see, I’m not totally Southern), but I consider one’s politics about like one’s genitals: I’m happy you’ve got them, and am sure that you are proud of them, but don’t go sticking them in my face (no matter how well I know you) or waving them around in public (except at certain kinds of parties, likely involving alcohol).
It isn’t shame, or feeling unsure, or anything like that. It comes from a very pragmatic place. When entering into any political debate, imagine the chances your opponent has of convincing you that you’re wrong. Those are the same chances (more or less) you have for changing their mind. You are probably not going to convince them of anything, so the whole thing is rather masturbatory ((as a side note, this metaphor for politics and genitals keeps amusing me)).
And yet.
And yet I am realizing that silence too says something; you can’t say nothing even if you don’t say anything. If you don’t share your thoughts, your opinions, then other people are going to read into that whatever they want – probably that you agree with them, unless they want to hate you, and then it will be that you support mandatory puppy murder.
Silence enables the popular opinion, no matter how wrong the popular opinion may be, and while you may not consent to the actions done because of that, I think that you are complicit. Inaction is a statement of indifference if nothing else, of not caring enough to say anything one way or the other (which may not at all be what you feel, but until humans perfect ways to telepathically transmit emotions and beliefs (AND WE SHOULD NEVER DO THIS) all that others know is what you say).
Edmund Burke said, “All the is required for evil to prevail is for good men to do nothing.” I find it true. Not every issue that more people should speak about is evil, but so much evil is allowed (though silently condemned) because of silence. The rape culture is a culture of silence and fear. Racism is still so pervasive because so many are afraid to say anything negative against the examples of it that they see. Abuse, bigotry, and prejudice are stronger because those that practice them are met too often with silence, silence which enables future actions.
That doesn’t mean that I’m going to espouse political debate as a foundation of change, because I still don’t believe that entering in to a debate to convince your opponent of something is entirely sane. I do believe that people should share what they believe, though, not to convince those that will argue, but to support the silent victims, those that feel alone. They should speak up to let their beliefs be known, so that their opinion is not automatically counted in with the majority. To shed light on dark opinions.
It is understandably difficult. We fear judgment, the judgment of our peers and our superiors, who may believe differently than we do. We fear alienation for our beliefs, and so we hide them and keep quiet.
But while you or I may have to hide our belief that a homosexual should have all the rights of everyone else for fear of alienation, a gay man has to hide who he is.
While you or I may be afraid to speak up against creepy, unwanted, overly aggressive advances for fear of judgment, the victim lives in fear of being raped, or with the silent shame of it.
We fear being judged for our beliefs, but the people we don’t speak up for fear for who they are.
This is no panacea to the world’s ills, and believe me when I say I realize that I am as guilty or guiltier of it than most, but I think it’s an important step. The hardest problem to fix is the one that you won’t acknowledge or aren’t aware of.
I don’t mean to come off as preachy, and I don’t have a call to action or any such thing. This is just an observation, a thought on my mind that I haven’t been able to shake. What does my silence say about me? And what does it say to those listening?
I just think it’s too easy to misinterpret silence to keep saying nothing, I guess, so while I’m not going to go trying to convince you that my way is the right way, you may hear a little more of what I believe, so that at least I’m being judged for what I actually think rather than what you think I do."Shakuntala" at Purbasha Saraswati Puja

16 Things I Learned in 2016, Part.
#13. I'm More Conflicted on Abortion
#13. I'm More Conflicted on Abortion
When shady videos dropped in mid-2015 from the Center for Medical Progress allegedly showing Planned Parenthood officials in various positions of power admitting to the practice of selling aborted baby parts for profit, I was, in my own words, "pretty adamantly pro-choice." What slowly altered my perspective was not the videos themselves--they're circumstantial evidence of some wrongdoing at best--but the overwhelmingly extreme reactions from both sides of the abortion debate. People on the left leapt to the defense of Planned Parenthood with fervor, accused the Center for Medical Progress of fraud, and refused to find anything even remotely troubling about the videos. Meanwhile, people on the right decried Planned Parenthood as an evil baby-killing factory that needs to not only be defunded but prosecuted into non-existence. Ultimately, I found both sides terribly unconvincing by their sheer unwillingness to embrace reality, and when the issue came to its climax last year--when
Carly Fiorina made dubious statements at a presidential debate
--I found myself more concerned with the visceral than the theoretical. As 2016 fades into memory, I must admit that I am now neither pro-choice nor pro-life. I say a pox on both your houses until you can let go of your intransigence and find compromise. There is no simple answer here, and I'm sick and tired of both sides acting as though it's black and white.
#14. The FBI is Asleep at the Wheel
#14. The FBI is Asleep at the Wheel
By now, we should all be aware of the pattern. A psychopath kills a bunch of people, and as the dust settles, we learn the murderer had been on the FBI's radar for a long time. Sometimes, the FBI may have even interrogated the person long before the rampage, but decided to release him as harmless. It's happened again and again, and 2016 saw perhaps the grossest example of this negligence in Omar Mateen, a man the FBI brought in
three times
, was warned about multiple times (including once by Walt Disney World, for crying out loud), and who was not considered dangerous enough to be on any kind of watch list before he walked into a nightclub in Orlando and killed nearly fifty people. This strikes me as unforgivably inept. Add to that the laughable James Comey announcement that, even though the FBI could spent fifteen minutes outlining the dozens of ways Hillary Clinton is guilty of federal crimes that would be prosecutable for most of us, the FBI is not going to recommend prosecution because, for some odd reason, provable intent is now a legal standard for people with the last name "Clinton." I don't want to insult the many competent men and women working hard to ensure my safety and security, but really, what the hell is going on over at the FBI? All I'm seeing is incompetence and corruption.
#15. Warehouse Stores are Worth It
#15. Warehouse Stores are Worth It
Ten gallon jugs of mayonnaise aside, I've come to grips with walking into a members-only warehouse store and buying certain things in bulk. Heck, the gas prices alone are worth it. For years, I associated such shopping with hoarders, enormous families, and my difficult grandmother. That, and yeah, the friggin mayonnaise. My wife and I have spent years trying to figure out how to shave our grocery budget, and I've gone down many domestic roads I never thought I would--from coupons to sale catalogues--but it wasn't until 2016 when I finally broke down and agreed to go to a warehouse store. It's harder to quantify the savings than you'd think--and it's all too easy to get carried away and wind up with literal tons of things you don't need--but I am absolutely certain that it's better for my relatively small family to go to the warehouse, at least occasionally.
#16. My Son Knows Circuits
#16. My Son Knows Circuits
If you were to ask my eight-year-old son what he wants to be when he grows up, he'll tell you he wants to be an "electrical engineerer." His uncanny math skills make this seem reasonable, but in just a few short years, he has far exceeded my knowledge when it comes to circuitry. He started small--with Snap Circuits® toys that teach the basics--but he's moved on to advanced logic gate construction. Though it's limited at the moment to virtual circuits in video games like
Minecraft
and
LittleBigPlanet 3
, I have no doubt that he could reasonably construct a working circuit in the real world. That's just amazing, because it's something I could never do, no matter how many times he tries to explain the difference between a NOT gate and a NOR gate to me.
So that's it: 2016 in a nutshell. It was a crazy year--especially for politics--but I'm not going to get in a bunker and freak out about it. I'm going to take what I learned, remember the good stuff, and look forward to 2017!

Author Unknown
As a horse owner, it’s hard to imagine that someday you must bid farewell to your horse. Yet eventually, if you keep your horse long enough, the day will come when it’s in your beloved animal’s best interest to ask your vet to administer humane euthanasia. It’s an extremely difficult decision, fraught with emotion. But if you prepare yourself ahead of time, accepting that making this ultimate decision is part of responsible equine stewardship, then you’re less likely to feel overwhelmed and conflicted.
In general, you and your vet may contemplate euthanasia for your horse in these four situations:
A disease or injury is chronic and incurable
The prognosis is hopeless, such as an inoperable case of colic
Due to behavioral issues, the horse has become a hazard to itself and its handlers, even after professional training and intervention
In order to relieve suffering, the horse will require daily pain medication for the remainder of its life
Of course, there are many other scenarios when humane euthanasia is considered. For example, a senior horse may be afflicted with a myriad of debilitating conditions which, in total, reduce his quality of life to the point that he is merely enduring each day. Another example is the harsh reality that some treatment options are simply financially out of the question.
To be sure, except in the instance of a severe traumatic injury, choosing to euthanize your horse is never an easy decision. But when you’re struggling with ambivalence, ask yourself this question: “By avoiding euthanasia, am I prolonging my horse’s suffering simply because it’s too painful for me to let go?” As tough as it may be, euthanizing a horse that has little or no quality of life is perhaps an owner’s most compassionate act.
When you decide to proceed with euthanasia, there are a few steps to take beforehand. First, if your horse is insured you’ll have to contact the carrier. They may require a second opinion before your horse is euthanized in order to maintain the mortality policy. Second, notify your local hauler (your vet will have the phone number) who will remove your horse’s body for either cremation (if that’s your choice) or for transport to the rendering plant. If you’re fortunate to be able to inter your horse on your property, have the gravesite prepared. Finally, be aware that you may not be able to hold or touch your horse during the actual administration. That’s because the horse will typically drop suddenly, and it requires an experienced handler to guide the horse to the ground. Therefore, say your good-byes and perhaps snip a locket of his tail hair before your vet arrives. Afterwards you can spend some time with your horse, knowing that he met a peaceful, humane end and that his suffering is over.Resource

As a family caregiver, one thing that you will need to focus on with your elderly loved one is their cognitive health. There are so many cognitive health disorders and diseases that could affect your elderly loved one. However, there are also many steps that can be taken by you and their elder care providers to help prevent some of these health issues.
Exercising Regularly
Elder Care Somerset County NJ – Tips for Maintaining Cognitive Health
One of the best steps to take when trying to prevent cognitive health issues is exercising regularly. Before helping your elderly loved one implement an exercise routine, make sure they speak with their doctor. If your elderly loved one has physical health problems, there may be certain exercises their doctor doesn’t want them to do. Once you have a cleared plan with the doctor, you or an elder care provider can help your loved one make an exercise plan and schedule. Regular exercise is the key, so keep that in mind when creating the plan.
Eating a Healthy Diet
Another way that your elderly loved one can maintain their cognitive health is by eating a healthy diet. Everyone knows there are certain foods that are good for their physical health. However, there are also foods that are good for one’s cognitive health. Mainly, your elderly loved one should make sure they are regularly eating vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and healthy fats.
Spending Time with Loved Ones
Did you know that spending time with loved ones can help people to live longer? Research shows that people who socialize and have healthy family relationships seem to live longer than those who don’t have these things. If your elderly loved one isn’t currently spending enough time with their loved ones, you should schedule some time for them to do so. If they don’t have a lot of family, it would be a good idea to have them spend time with their elder care providers. You can always hire companion care providers to socialize with your elderly loved one.
Tips for You and Their Elder Care Providers
These are some of the best tips for maintaining cognitive health in your elderly loved one. If they are able to implement these tips, it can help to prevent cognitive health disorders and diseases.

2/22/2018
In recent days, there has been a lot of rhetoric by the President and the NRA about “crazy people” and a desire to return to the days of the “institutions.” These comments reinforce inaccurate and negative stereotypes and create barriers to having real conversations about how to improve the mental health services that lead to recovery and participation in American society by people experiencing mental health conditions.
The National Alliance on Mental Illness fights for a more understanding and accepting world for the millions of Americans affected by mental illness, and for a mental health system that provides the care and support they need to do well in school, work and life. All Americans should have coverage for mental health care and access to treatment when needed.
Psychiatric institutions were closed historically for many reasons, including unsafe treatment of patients and deplorable conditions. Today, we see many youth and young adults languishing in emergency rooms and law enforcement officers are forced to respond to crises because mental health services are frequently not available. There is a need for high-quality inpatient care, including as a last resort, court ordered treatment.
Solutions to this crisis also require more than inpatient care. There are many common sense approaches that we know are effective and that can be implemented now to improve access to mental health services along a continuum of care for youth who are at risk. These include:
- Implementing intensive community-based mental health interventions for youth and young adults with the most serious mental illnesses.
- Integrating mental health in primary care and in schools so that mental health treatment is readily available.
- Increasing access to high-quality inpatient treatment through repealing the exclusion in Medicaid for paying for these beds and increasing reimbursement along with required outcomes.
- Ensuring a well-funded and strong mental health system through fully funding the Medicaid program and requiring private health insurance to provide adequate coverage for mental health and substance use treatment.
NAMI would welcome the opportunity to meet with President Trump and work with his administration on steps for improving mental health services in America. We were proud to participate in the Interdepartmental Coordinating Committee for Serious Mental Illness. This report provides the Administration with a blueprint for fixing our nation’s broken mental health system, including improving services for children and youth who are at risk.

That is customer service (and someone, I suspect, who truly understands the NEED to HAVE STUFF to MAKE STUFF NOW)! Still, can't wait to get it, I'll be snatching the postman's hand off when it does arrive. I've got magnetic clasps, O rings and all sorts of other metallic bits and pieces, and a couple of Amy Butler bag patterns to use as ideas and fodder for my own designs. I tend to be pretty rubbish at following patterns and templates, and besides, given that I'm reconning - turning coats into bags - having exact amounts of fabric to a pattern is never going to happen. So yes, nervously anticipating the arrival of those because it means I'll actually have to do some cutting out, rather than just thinking about it...and that's the bit I find really scary. Once it's cut, there's no going back.
On a bit of a tangent I was looking at purseblog.com earlier, and good lord...designer bags are really bloody ugly to my eye. Impractical, for the main, all horrible hard shiny leather or fake leather in garish colours with a ton of ott metal...yuck. Nope, it just doesn't do it for me - give me velvets and tweeds and soft, felty-woolly fabrics, or cheery cotton prints any day.
I'm also awaiting my registration for Craftster after finding an insane number of tutorials I want to have a go at...besides, it's good manners to go and say thank you for the shirt->dress conversion, too! I do think this may become a dangerous time-sink, though...
Craft has been going on elsewhere, too - I bought A a subscription to MAKE as an exceedingly late birthday present, and many and varied bits of electronics have appeared in the house. He was also very tickled by the Swahili frame bed, which he is currently reproducing out of timber and strapping for the cats. And whilst he's doing that, he's knocking up a little 11x11" frame for me to FINALLY have a go at silk painting with. Scary. Biscuits.

FAQs
What type of loan does PayRay offer?
We offer a range of loans depending on your business size and needs. Small companies and farmers can borrow from 15,000 up to 50,000 EUR for a maximum term of 12 months. Larger businesses can borrow up to 7.5million EUR. We also offer factoring and products supported by the INVEGA guarantee scheme.
What is the difference between a line of credit and a loan?
They are both types of financing. Loans are usually used for a specific purpose, such as buying new equipment. Lines of credit are used for everyday purchases, like a business trip. Loans have a non-revolving credit limit, so you only have access to the amount loaned once, and will need to make payments until it is paid off. A line of credit is a revolving facility – meaning you can use the funds over and over again whilst paying it off. You’ll also get a credit limit as to how much you can borrow.
How can I use my funds?
You can use the loan for working capital financing and business development.
Is a personal guarantee required for a PayRay loan?
We don't always need a guarantee, it depends on your company's financial situation.
What are the minimum and maximum I could be approved to access? What loan terms do you offer?
We provide loans from 15,000 up to 7.5million EUR, but will consider smaller amounts. Our standard terms are between 6 and 12 months. Other terms can also be considered as long at they don’t exceed the 12 months.
Does every customer qualify for 24-month terms?
Yes.
How do I return my loan?
Our team looks at your application and customizes your loan return, based on your needs and capabilities.
What do I do if I have a complaint regarding my loan?
Please contact your account manager.
What fees are charged for taking a loan?
We’ll deduct a contract fee and annual interest from your loan amount.
What fees will I incur if my repayment is late?
You’ll pay a standard fine of 0.08%/d. on any overdue amount.
Does every loan I take have fees?
Yes. We apply a contract fee and annual interest to all loans.
Why did my available funds decrease after I took a PayRay loan?
We deduct the annual interest from your loan as soon as the funds are released. That way there are no monthly fees or instalments to worry about, you just return the total amount of the loan at the end of the term.Kangaroo Bus Lines is committed to reducing barriers for people with a disability when using transport services.

The team brought to the OS355 some 80 new design features, which are on display literally from stem to stern.
The foredeck has been cleaned up with a thru-stem anchor system with easy-access windlass; no more pulpit and topside hardware. At the stern, elongated transom platforms improve access from shore or sea. In between, Pursuit raised the splashwell to accommodate 30-inch shafts; tucked away the engine rigging; lifted the batteries out of the bilge; installed aft-facing cockpit seats with insulated storage; and fitted the cabin with maple dovetail woodwork, stainless steel refrigerator and an extra three inches of midberth height. The list goes on.
A pair of 350-horsepower Yamaha outboards is a logical power package. Optimal cruise range and efficiency come at about 4,000 rpm and 28.6 mph, just shy of 1 mile per gallon. With a full fuel load and five men on board, we topped out at around 40 mph on a flat calm Sarasota Bay. What about get-home speed if one engine goes down? The boat wouldn’t plane on a single 350, but with the 15 pitch prop and one engine trimmed all the way up, we made about 7 mph at 3,000 rpm. Steering was secure and, importantly, visibility at the helm was excellent. The one-piece, laminated, optically clear windshield (derived from technology supplying European rail services) offers an unobstructed view forward, and the classic Pursuit “A” tower side windows give good views port and starboard. Pursuit says the windshield is engineered to the same impact resistance as the hull itself, good to know if the ocean decides to lob some green water over your bow.
The OS355 is a sensible, well-conceived express overnighter. Four persons could comfortably stay aboard for a long weekend. With the aft curtain down, the helm station is fully protected from the elements. Turn on the AC for those hot summer days and enjoy the view. For more information, visit.

A business reshuffle left the group's attributable profit 42.82 per cent lower at HK$272.66 million last year, as it bought seven piped-gas projects from parent China Resources (Holdings) for more sustainable growth, and sold its mixed concrete and semiconductor operations. Managing director Wang Chuandong said yesterday CR Gas would pursue its acquisition strategy this year for more rapid growth. 'We are confident of stronger profit growth this year as the number of new projects is growing fast,' he said. 'We have started discussions on buying some profitable projects out of the parent's existing 23 projects. We are also in talks to acquire five or six projects from other parties.' So far this year, CR Gas had spent HK$550 million on nine piped-gas projects, of which three were in the provincial capital cities of Wuhan, Jinan, and Kunming, Mr Wang said. The HK$1.6 billion outlay for acquisitions should boost the companies portfolio to 31 piped-gas projects by year-end from 16, he said. Funding for the new projects will come from an HK$800 million syndicated bank loan and the HK$300 million proceeds from selling the concrete business. The group had net cash of nearly HK$1 billion at the end of last year. Turnover fell 51.62 per cent to HK$2.98 billion despite gas sales rising 39.5 per cent to HK$2.14 billion. A final dividend of 4 HK cents per share was proposed. CR Gas shares rose 15 HK cents or 3.94 per cent to HK$13.95 yesterday, after the results announcement.- Prague, Czech Republic

For immediate release: Thursday, Dec. 11
Statement by Barbara Dorris of St. Louis, Outreach Director of SNAP, the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (314 503 0003, bdorris@SNAPnetwork.org)
We’re grateful to two retired police officers who are helping to expose stunning recklessness and deceit by Syracuse Catholic officials. They say law enforcement staff warned a Catholic bishop about suspected sexual misconduct by Msgr. Charles Eckermann.
We strongly suspect that, over the years, dozens of Syracuse church staff knew of or suspected Eckermann’s sexual misdeeds and crimes but repeatedly chose to ignore or hide them. We suspect that at least a few of these church officials are still on the church payroll. Shame on each of them.
It’s not enough for Bishop Robert Cunningham to apologize. For the safety of the vulnerable and the healing of the wounded, he must use his vast resources to tell parents, parishioners, police, prosecutors and the public about other proven, admitted and credibly accused child molesting clerics in the area.
Cunningham should start by asking – through pulpit announcements, church websites and parish bulletins – that others with information or suspicions about Eckermann’s crimes should call law enforcement immediately. (Even if Eckermann can’t be prosecuted, it’s possible that others who helped him hide his crimes might be.)
Cunningham should personally visit every parish where Eckermann worked, making this same plea.
Cunningham should permanently post on his diocesan website – and periodically post in parish bulletins – the names, photos and whereabouts of every child molesting cleric who is in or has been in the Syracuse area (whether living or deceased, diocesan or religious order). That kind of honesty is what safeguards children, not weak, belated, vague apologies about what his predecessor did or did not do.
Complacency protects no one. Only vigilance protects kids. So we beg Syracuse citizens and Catholics to remain skeptical of claims by the Catholic hierarchy when it comes to predator priests and children’s safety.
It’s tempting but irresponsible to believe that clergy sex crimes and cover ups are largely over. They are not. Even now, despite decades of horrific scandal, most church officials still put their own reputations, power and careers ahead of children’s safety.
So we urge anyone who saw, suspected or suffered clergy sex crimes and cover ups in Syracuse to call police, expose wrongdoers, protect kids, deter cover ups, and start healing by seeking help from independent sources.
While we are grateful to retired officers John Falge and Thomas Murphy for being honest, the real heroes here are men like Kevin Braney who are finding the courage to report the heinous crimes they suffered at the hands of priests like Eckermann. We hope others who have been severely hurt by child molesting Syracuse clerics will summon the strength to step forwardSPRINGFIELD — When his defensive unit runs onto the sidelines after getting a stop, Springfield High School defensive coordinator Conley Smoot takes a few minutes to instruct his players about what they’re doing wrong and what they’re seeing from the opposing team.
The problem? He’s not able to watch his son, Wildcats senior quarterback Te’Sean Smoot, drive Springfield’s offense down the field.
“I try to get out there, but sometimes we score too quick and I’ll have to watch it on film,” Conley Smoot said.
The father-son Smoot duo has played a key role in the Wildcats ascent to the state’s biggest stage over the last four years. Conley Smoot is the coordinator of one of the top defenses in the area, while Te’Sean, the Wildcats dual-threat quarterback, has accounted for more than 2,265 yards and 30 touchdowns (17 rushing, 13 passing) this season.
“I remember when he was four years old, we were driving down Clifton Avenue and he saw Evans Stadium,” Conley Smoot said. “He said, ‘Dad, that’s where you played football, that’s where I want to play.’ It’s awesome. I’m speechless from it. Watching these kids — this senior class, they started playing together in third grade — it’s a blessing.”
The senior quarterback is fortunate to have his father on the sidelines with him, he said.
“He always keeps my head on straight and keeps me up when things aren’t going right,” Te’Sean Smoot said.
He’s also thankful for the way the Wildcats defense prepares them throughout the week.
“He makes it hard in practice,” Te’Sean Smoot said. “Going against them every day and him knowing so much, it gets us ready for the game.”
The Wildcats defense has allowed just 7.6 points per game this season, tallying 22.5 sacks and eight interceptions. The key has been film study throughout the week, Conley Smoot said.
“I just give them the blueprint and they execute,” he said. “They study film like no other. … We’ve got kids who’ll watch an hour, hour-and-a-half of film throughout the week and it shows in their game play.”
Conley Smoot, a 2002 South High School graduate and 2008 Wilmington College graduate, knew his son’s class had a chance to be great from the beginning. They won pee wee and middle school championships before appearing in back-to-back state semifinal games during their sophomore and junior seasons, he said.
“The ultimate goal is a state title,” he said.
Springfield coach Maurice Douglass also coached his son, Moses, now a sophomore defensive back at the University of Kentucky. Wildcats offensive coordinator Chris Wallace’s son CJ will join the program next season, Douglass said.
“They’ve got a great relationship,” Douglass said of the father-son Smoot duo. “It’s a beautiful sight to see a father and son be on the same team. It’s special.”
Te’Sean Smoot, the two-time Greater Western Ohio Conference Athlete of the Year, has more than 20 scholarship offers to play college football. He recently received an official offer from Ohio University and is expected to take several official visits this winter.
The 9-1 Wildcats, however, don’t want the season to end anytime soon. They host seventh-seeded Dublin Jerome in a Division I, Region 2 quarterfinal game at 7 p.m. Friday at Springfield High School. The Wildcats beat the Celtics 37-14 in a regional quarterfinal game in 2019.
“I’m just trying to embrace the moment,” Te’Sean Smoot said. “My class is trying to make the best of it. Ever since pee wee, we’ve always wanted a state championship. My Dad has been coaching us since then and he’s always preached state championship. He built us up for these moments and we’re just trying to cherish it and take it all the way for the city.”
While his son will join the college ranks next season, Conley Smoot will be back on the Springfield sidelines next fall.
“I’m not going anywhere,” he said. “I’m a Wildcat.”

Whether we like it or not, we just keep learning and growing!
The Lord has a way of stretching our abilities and boundaries until we grow into our responsibilities and meet His requirements for us.
That's kind of how it is for us in the India Bangalore Mission (IBM) Office. Everyday there is something new to do and this old brain of mine has to ask "Now, have I done this before?"
or "Where do I find the checklist for that packet of documents?"
It's fun and challenging. Well, that's the best way to look at it.
Sometimes I say, "This is beyond me!"
But it's not beyond my abilities to keep learning, so I just dig in and get at it!
Sometimes I say, "This is beyond me!"
But it's not beyond my abilities to keep learning, so I just dig in and get at it!
I always admire our good friend Mel, in Spokane, when he says, as he often does,
"Life is always an adventure!"
I think that is the best way to approach everyday and I try to do that. Look for the good.
Like this crow, for example...
One Elder says "I hate crows, they're so loud and annoying."
But I say "Have a closer look. This House Crow has many beautiful colours that one may not see without close inspection. And hey, they eat rats, so that's a good thing, right?"
Some people probably think that we are loud and annoying, but we all have our purpose.
I'm going to close this blog today with a quote from Elder Dallin H. Oaks:

The 2014 battle for the Senate has featured a few candidate bumbles and some colorful characters.
So far, it’s lacked any cycle-defining gaffes — “Todd Akin moments” — but there is still a week to go until Election Day and potentially two runoffs extending things into early next year.
Every election cycle provides noteworthy events or moments in time that, in hindsight, proved to be pivot points in the outcome. Roll Call has identified 10 such instances that helped define this cycle’s Senate landscape.
In 2012, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe’s, R-Maine, last-minute retirement began to alter the conventional wisdom that Republicans were likely headed for the majority. Months later, comments about rape by Todd Akin and Richard Mourdock sealed the deal for Democrats.
Now, once again, the majority is up for grabs: Republicans have pushed the fight into purple states, while Democrats are holding out hope the party can hang on.
Here are 10 moments that helped get us here, in chronological order:
Hollywood Star Declines McConnell Challenge (March 27, 2013)
There is little doubt an Ashley Judd-Mitch McConnell race would have garnered plenty of attention, but it’s unlikely the actress could have put up as strong a fight against the Senate minority leader as has Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes. Although McConnell remains favored in the Kentucky race, Grimes has pushed the Republican in one of the most expensive races of the cycle. Two weeks after Judd announced in a series of tweets that she wouldn’t run, a bizarre story unfolded from a Mother Jones report on a secret recording of a McConnell campaign meeting where opposition research on Judd had been discussed. Lundergan Grimes jumped in the race three months later.
After serious and thorough contemplation, I realize that my responsibilities & energy at this time need to be focused on my family.

Herseth Sandlin Decides Not to Run (May 13, 2013) Former Rep. Stephanie Herseth Sandlin’s decision not to run for Senate in South Dakota all but ended any hopes Democrats had of holding the seat. The Republican-leaning state would have been a tough race for Democrats in the best-case scenario, but with Sen. Tim Johnson, D-S.D., retiring, there was little shot without a top recruit, such as Herseth Sandlin. Her decision to pass, which came shortly after the senator’s son made clear he would not pursue the seat, left Democrats without a strong candidate to contest the seat. There was a brief ray of light for Democrats in early October, when poll numbers showed Democratic nominee Rick Weiland and independent Larry Pressler closing on Republican nominee Mike Rounds. Democrats dropped $1 million into the race to capitalize on that, but Republicans matched them, and with less than two weeks ago, this race is sliding back into the Republican column.
Schweitzer Shocks Democrats (July 13, 2013)
Heading into the state Democratic Party convention, former Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer was widely expected to announce he would seek the seat of retiring Sen. Max Baucus. But on a Saturday morning in the middle of the confab, Schweitzer declared he would not run , leaving Democrats in a lurch and giving Republicans the upper hand . Had he run, most or all of the events that followed would never have happened: Democratic Lt. Gov. John Walsh entered the race, GOP Rep. Steve Daines entered the race , Baucus resigned, the governor appointed Walsh to the seat, The New York Times uncovered extensive plagiarism by Walsh in a graduate school paper, Walsh dropped out of the race.
Gardner In, Buck Out (Feb. 26, 2014)
When we look back on the 2014 midterms, there may be no more pivotal moment than the day in late February when Republicans pulled off a smooth candidate swap in Colorado between the 4th District and Senate races. National Republicans worked for months to recruit Rep. Cory Gardner, who represented a safe seat, to take on Democratic Sen. Mark Udall, who was headed for a likely victory over Republican Ken Buck. But Buck, back after losing a winnable race against Sen. Michael Bennet in 2010, agreed to run for Gardner’s seat, clearing a path for Gardner and putting Colorado in jeopardy for Democrats.
Brown Announces Preparations for New Hampshire
Senate Bid (March 14, 2014)
The 2014 Senate map always looked good for Republicans. Between the Democratic retirements and the Democrats facing re-election — most of them in Republican-leaning states — the GOP had the potential to pick up at least a handful of seats. But former Sen. Scott P. Brown’s decision to challenge Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., put the Granite State on the map for Republicans and fueled the narrative of just how good a year this could be for the party. And though Shaheen still has the edge, New Hampshire could be the bellwether for a Republican wave: If Brown wins, it’s going to be a good night for the GOP.
Hog Castration and Farmers Hit the Air Waves (March 25, 2014) This fateful day set the course for the rest of the Iowa Senate race, helping move what had been a lower-tier race directly onto the competitive playing field .
Joni Ernst, then one of five Republicans vying for the nomination, released an ad about her experience castrating hogs . (Technically, the ad was released on March 24, but most publications wrote about it the next morning.) The ad went viral, catapulted Ernst to national recognition and helped her win the nomination by an overwhelming margin. She avoided the convention Democrats had hoped for and received a significant boost in fundraising.
On the same day, America Rising released video of Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley denigrating Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, as “a farmer from Iowa who never went to law school.” Republicans seized on the comment , which Braley quickly apologized for , to define the congressman as elitist and out of touch — a theme that has carried through the entire race .
Tillis Shows Up to the State House to Preside as Speaker (May 14, 2014) Republicans are scrambling to push Thom Tillis over the edge in the race to unseat Sen. Kay Hagan, D-N.C. Many Republicans privately attribute that state of affairs to Tillis’ decision not to step down as speaker of the state House when he won the nomination . One week after the primary, Tillis reported to Raleigh to preside over the “short session” of the general assembly. When he emerged three months later, after the contentious session finally came to a close, a poor second quarter fundraising haul and a barrage of Democratic ads had him back on his heels.
Cochran Wins the Republican Runoff (June 24, 2014)
His challenger was still contesting the result until last week , but Sen. Thad Cochran pulled off a miracle by defeating tea-party-backed Chris McDaniel in a runoff after finishing behind him in the primary. Cochran’s supporters weren’t as engaged, but his campaign and key allies were able to expand the electorate — which could include anyone who didn’t vote in the Democratic primary — and increase the number of anti-McDaniel voters. Cochran’s victory wiped the state off the map for national Democrats , who, with former Rep. Travis Childers as their nominee, would have added it to the party’s nearly barren plank of offensive opportunities had McDaniel prevailed.
Democratic Nominee Drops Out of the Kansas Senate Race (Sept. 3, 2014) Sen. Pat Roberts did not have as easy a path to re-election as he had anticipated. But in a state as Republican-leaning as Kansas, all of that was supposed to be over after the primary . Then Chad Taylor, the Democratic nominee for Senate, dropped out , leaving Roberts in a one-on-one race with independent businessman Greg Orman. Unlike Taylor, Orman had done well fundraising, was airing television ads, and polled ahead of Roberts in a head-to-head match up. Suddenly, Republicans had to scramble to save the unprepared incumbent — and their shot at gaining the six seats they need for a Senate majority.
Perdue Is Proud of Outsourcing Record (Oct. 6, 2014)
As a first-time candidate, former corporate CEO David Perdue took an on-the-job lesson in political crisis communications one month before the general election. At a campaign stop in early October, the Republican, who faces Democrat Michelle Nunn in the Georgia Senate race, was asked about a recent report that he’d professed to outsourcing jobs most of his career. “Defend it? I’m proud of it,” Perdue said. The Nunn campaign would go on to cut three TV ads on the issue within a week, Nunn took small leads in two public polls , and outside money began flowing in from both parties, as the race — which could go to a Jan. 6 runoff — emerged as a potential majority decider .

The publication highlights 10 simple strategies for enabling individuals and community groups to join together to purchase under-performing assets the Government plans to sell off and transform these into revitalised, community-owned enterprises.
To Buy, To Bid, To Build: Community Rights for an Asset Owning Democracy follows on from two of ResPublica's earlier publications, The Ownership State and The Venture Society, which highlight how democratising access to assets will help redress the inequality that currently characterises the UK.
At the launch, Greg Clark MP, minister for decentralisation, praised: “ResPublica's phenomenal productivity and influence on the thinking of the new Government”.
He went on to note that being able to purchase and manage assets has the same beneficial effects for communities in terms of confidence and capability building as it does in the personal sphere for private individuals.
He added that the upcoming Localism Bill would put flesh on the bones of the Report's recommendations by enshrining communities' 'right to know' about monies currently being disbursed by local authorities on managing community assets.
This expansion of consumer rights in the private sector to community groups would, he went on to say, will help the latter bid successfully to run these assets themselves, dismantling in the process entrenched local authority monopolies.
Steve Wyler, joint author of the report, and director of the Development Trusts Association, cited examples from around the country of buildings and land being successfully taken into community ownership; he described this as a nationwide "entrepreneurial movement".
He added by way of historical context that this local self-determination movement has roots stretching back to Thomas Spence’s vision for localism penned in the 1790s and Chartist Fergus O’Connor’s creation of a National Land Bank to fund dwellings in five model villages for the urban poor fifty years later.
Phillip Blond noted the crucial role of community rights in reversing the current massive inequalities in asset distribution in the UK, whereby the bottom 25% of the population owns just 1% of the total wealth and, in terms of liquid capital, the bottom 50% owns just 1%.
He went on to say that enabling communities to bid for, buy and run local enterprises was one of three core strategies aimed at breaking open markets, the other two being Pathways to Work, which would enable local people on benefits to work in local enterprises and keep more of the money they earn, and the extension to community social enterprises of opportunities to bid for public sector contracts, the majority of which currently go to monopoly private sector providers at regional and national level.This time last week myself and Nicola spent the day at the Scottish Speciality Food Show at the SECC. One of the first exhibitors that I met was Stephen Kwan, the man behind Kwan's Kitchen. The Kwan family have a long heritage within the Chinese restaurant trade, running Beijing Beijing in Galashiels and Kwan's Chinese Restaurant in Kelso.
Kwan's Kitchen supply traditional Chinese spice mixes and condiments to a host of suppliers across the UK. In order to maintain quality and authenticity, all of the condiments are made in small batches within the kitchenn of the Beijing Beijing Restaurant, using no MSG, artifices colouring, flavouring or preservatives.
Here's their story;
How did you get started?
I was a restaurateur and Chef for 10 years running my own Chinese restaurants until one day a customer asked me to “can” the recipe for “Salt & Pepper” dishes such as Chicken wings. Following a series of failed attempts “Salt & Pepper Spice” was created which subsequently won 2 Gold Stars at the Great Taste Awards in 2011. Following the award I launched an authentic range of restaurant quality Chinese condiments which includes Blackbean & Garlic and Szechuan Chilli Oil. You can use all three condiments to create many different tasty Chinese dishes. We quickly listed in a number of local delis including Realfoods in Edinburgh and now stock throughout Scotland.
What’s the best piece of business advice you could give?
Where would you like to see your business in 5 years time?
Supplying fine food retailers throughout the UK.
If you could only cook one of your own products/recipes, what would it be & why?
Blackbean & Garlic on Salmon Fillet – quick, tasty, healthy and indulgent!
You can invite one person (living or dead) to your last meal – Who would it be and why? …and what’s on the menu?
Choosing just one guest would be easy! It would have to be my loving partner who has encouraged me and supported me throughout this adventure! I would cook Szechuan Salt & Pepper Prawns, delicious!
We managed to sample some of the condiments in the range, including a fantastic blend of black bean paste with Szechuan chilli oil, as well as the aromatic salt and pepper spice mix. Both were packed with flavour and tasted like something you would eat in an authentic Chinese restaurant.
With Chinese New Year just around the corner, why not check if there's a Kwan's Kitchen stockist near you and bring in Chinese Year of The Horse in style.

There is a lot of talk about company’s “cleaning up their supply chains”. In the growing maelstrom of indignation, let’s not forget the human components of those supply chains: the transporters and sex workers (the invisible link in every supply chain).
To get from the DRC to the factories in China and Taiwan, those minerals travel thousands of kilometres and cross multiple borders to the ports in either Tanzania or South Africa. The truckers hauling them work for SMEs or themselves. They spend an average of 27 days a month on the road with no access to health or information. HIV prevalence rates are twice as high among truckers as among the general population and is the number one killer of drivers. Road accidents and malaria come in at numbers two and three respectively. At the congested borders, where the drivers often spend days or even weeks waiting their turn to cross, sex work flourishes, turning rest spots into public health “hotspots“.
Blood minerals are fuelling a war that has killed millions, and we should applaud and support those responding to this tragedy.
But the same blood minerals are also fuelling the spread of HIV and other epidemics. Those affected deserve our support too.

School has been very calm and quieter than usual but routines and planned changes are working well. The most exciting and rewarding part of the whole week has, without a doubt been the smiling faces and enthusiasm shown by our pupils this week - without exception they have been beaming form ear to ear. It is clear we are all glad to be back in school.
Over the coming weeks as we settle, while access to the building in limited, please feel free to make contact by email or telephone with questions or queries - there are no silly questions!
On Tuesday 2nd September we will be welcoming everyone into school together for the first time which we are very much looking forward to.
The children will be bringing home the usual batch of annual forms for parents to complete - Data Collection Form, Photograph Permission form etc. In addition to these this year an Internet Survey has been added to inform our planning for homework. Please return this survey as soon as you can and by 4th September if possible.
It is particularly important this year that the school office has a current mobile number to contact a family member during the school day. Please keep us updated regarding this information.
Please find below a copy of the beginning of year letter which will go home next week. I hope this will provide further details regarding our provision for staggered finishing times. The option of older children leaving earlier with younger siblings is currently being offered - it is not compulsory. It would be appreciated if parents could inform class teachers with a little note or email if they would like older siblings out earlier.
(It will take a little while to settle into this which is very different to what we have been used to but hopefully by the end of the week we will have it working.)
In the mean time please have a look at the letters and information leaflet issued by the Department of Education on Thursday 13th August outlining their aims and recommendations to parents. If you have any specific questions or queries please feel free to email Miss McKane at any time.
Windsor Hill Primary School - Restart Arrangements - for the convenience of newcomer parents the contents of the principal's letter is pasted below and should therefore be available for translation using the link on the front page of the website.
I trust you have had a chance to enjoy some of the good weather over the holidays. We are now in a position to provide some further updates and arrangements for returning to school. As a school staff we are very much looking forward to welcoming children back. We fully appreciate that there continues to be a lot of challenges for families and we remain available to support parents and families with this return to schools – please do not hesitate to email / call with specific questions or concerns. We would also encourage you to prepare your children for their return, discuss coming back into school positively and assist us by sharing the arrangements listed below with your children. (Possibly a little at a time!) All of this information will be walked through with the children on their ‘induction morning’ when time and care will be taken to ensure they are as comfortable and confident with our arrangements as possible.
As we plan for the implementation of the Department of Education guidance and put procedures in place to ensure everyone’s safety we would appreciate co-operation with the following arrangements which are intended to minimize movement in and out of school. Each class will be viewed as a ‘class bubble’. In school movement between bubbles will be kept to a minimum. At the beginning of the year we will not have school assemblies or large gatherings of children. The playground is zoned and play times etc. will be timetabled for each class.
Children are asked, as far as possible, to wear a fresh uniform to school each day – this can be done by alternating between PE tracksuit and uniform if this is easier for parents. To start off with, children should not bring school bags, personal toys or pencil cases into school. (All stationery will be provided and this will be reviewed in the light of updated guidance).
Packed lunches can be brought in disposable packaging or a lunch box, clearly labeled which can be cleaned daily. Children are also encouraged to bring their own clearly labelled water bottle into school.
Arrangements for homework, which will not resume during the first week or two, will be shared at a later date.
As we establish and endeavor to maintain ‘class bubbles’ in school, we very much regret that at present, we are unable to resume normal after school activities, including 2-3 Club. This will however be kept under review in the coming weeks.
1. RETURN DATES
P7 Classes
All P7 pupils return to school on Monday 24th August @ 9:15 am. P7 pupil attend 9:15am – 2:00pm. Everyone should bring packed lunches as no school dinners will be available until Tuesday 1st September.
INDUCTION MORNINGS – 9:15 am – 12:15 pm
To provide the children will a chance to become familiar with their new classroom, with their break / play areas and routines e.g. hand washing etc. an induction morning has been planned for each class as detailed below:
TUESDAY 25th August Mrs. Jennet’s P2 class
TUESDAY 25th August Miss Nesbitt’s P6 class
WEDNESDAY 26th August Mrs. Magill’s P5 class
WEDNESDAY 26th August Mrs. Loney’s P5 class
WEDNESDAY 26th August Miss McKeown’s P4 class
THURSDAY 27th August Miss Henning’s P3 class
THURSDAY 27th August Mrs Chapman’s P3/4 class
THURSDAY 27th August Mr Morrow’s P6 pupils to join P7
2. ACCESS TO SCHOOL
Parents, other than P1 Parents, are asked not to accompany their children into school. Please leave pupils at the footpath inside the school gate. We would appreciate it if parents would try not to gather around the gate and move quickly from the school premises both in the morning and afternoon while maintain social distancing. Everyone coming in to the school building will be required to sanitise their hands on entry and a one-way system will be operated around the school.
3. ARRIVAL AT SCHOOL
It is felt that it is not practical to enforce a ‘staggered start’ that everyone can adhere to first thing in the morning. Rather than designating a specific ‘arrival time’ for classes / family groups, which could potentially increase pressure in the morning, a ‘Trickle Arrival’ Approach will be trialled – and will be reviewed and updated if necessary. The School door will be open from 8:45 am – 9:15am each morning for children to come into school. On entry the children will go straight to their own class and should not accompany younger siblings to their classes. As a protective measure, we would ask parents to exercise wise judgement upon arrival at school and simply wait in the car for a few moments if there should happen to be a larger number of families arriving at the same time. Please do not, if at all possible, allow your children to gather at the school door before 8:45am.
4. STAGGERED DISMISSAL TIMES
P1 – P3 children we will trial the following staggered leaving times. (with siblings)
P1 1:30pm (From 21st September)
P2 1:45pm
P3 2:00pm
P4 – P7 – IN CLASSES (with siblings)
2:30pm P4 Miss McKeown & P4 Mrs. Chapman
2:40pm P5 Mrs. Magill & P5 Mrs. Loney
2:50pm P6 Miss Nesbitt
3:00pm P6/7 Mr. Morrow
3:10pm P7 Mrs. Kerrigan
We would appreciate it if the office is informed in advance if your child needs to leave school early for medical appointments so that we can, as far as possible have the children ready to go on time. Parents are asked to notify us in advance of pupils needing to leave early for medical appointments etc.
5. SCHOOL MEALS
School dinners will begin again on Tuesday 1st September with arrangements being made for meals to be eaten in bubbles either in classroom or in staggered lunch breaks at ‘bubble tables’ in the assembly hall. (Arrangements will be confirmed when the catering staff return to school.)
FREE SCHOOL MEALS AND UNIFORM GRANT
Please ensure that those who may be eligible for free school meals and uniform grant have made a new application for this school year as soon as possible if you have not already done so. Free meals cannot be provided until clearance is given by the EA. For your convenience a form can be downloaded from the school website, is available from the office and from EA Website. (Further details are available at EA:).
Menus will be made available from the beginning of term and this year in particular we request that payment for dinners in only sent to school on Monday morning in a sealed envelope with the pupil’s name and dates dinner is required written on the front. (Cheques can be made payable to 'Education Authority'. Cash can be sent but the exact money would be very much appreciated.)
6. FAMILIES WITH EXISTING MEDICAL CONDITIONS
There may be families with existing health concerns or medical conditions which require further consideration / shielding. Please email/ telephone the principal directly to make arrangements for your child’s learning which fits in with your situation.
7. FAMILIES IN QUARANTINE
If your family has been effected by the Government guidance on quarantine, particularly if returning from abroad, please email / phone the principal to inform us that your child’s return will be delayed.
8. FAMILY MEMBERS WITH COVID SYMPTOMS
Do not send your child to school if your child or anyone you live with has any of the following symptoms, or has been in contact with anyone with these symptoms: of or change in sense of smell or taste.
The links to the latest Government guidance may be accessed through the Education Minister’s letter which is on the school website above and also at:
Please inform the office immediately if your child or immediate family member they live with are suspected to have Covid.
The classrooms may need to be protective bubbles for a while at least, but our school will still have life and fun as we resume our learning together. Please try to keep the conversations about returning as positive as possible. Tell your children how much we are looking forward to welcoming them back. If they feel like they have forgotten lots of things, tell them not to worry; it’s our job to help each of them to get back on track with their learning and to keep school a happy but busy place where they can grow together. Despite the challenges and restrictions, we are confident that we can do that. It is so important that the children know that, along with you, we all want the best for them.
It will certainly go against the grain for us to have to control parental entry into the school more robustly than before, but this does not mean that we are unavailable; just available in a different way. Feel free to call or email me and I will get back to you as soon as possible. Staff are committed to support the learning and well-being of the children as they return and we want to work with you all on this. Staff emails were also distributed during lockdown and we very much appreciated the feedback so many gave using email – this can be continued as needed.
Sammy, with other staff, have worked extremely hard all summer cleaning, sanitising and putting up additional signage to help our pupils. Procedures are in place for handwashing, enhanced cleaning etc. to protect us all as much as possible. I assure you, that as a whole staff we will do all we can to nurture our pupils all back into school as sensitively as possible, but with a sense of getting on with it and moving forward as positively and productively as possible together. Our procedures and routines will be reviewed and updated regularly as we strive to work as effectively and efficiently as possible and try to minimise inconvenience for parents.
Your patience, co-operation and suggestions working on this together in these extraordinary circumstances will be very much appreciated. Please feel free to get in touch if you have any further questions or concerns.
Yours faithfully

Beautiful photos Heather! Job well done. So happy we got to work together. Thank you for including my contact info!Baby.
That’s such a wonderful photo!
I’m totally with you regarding the idea of having photos that capture moments. Studio photos are so 1860!
Anyway – the one thing that’s more true than anything else is your bias. Just take a look at YOUR studio pics as you grew up and you can see a little girl who hated every moment – a process that looked like it was pure torture.
No wonder you have a disdain for such pics. 😉
Fair enough. But I would also add, that I’ve rarely ever seen a studio photo where I thought it looked amazing. Smiles are stiff, there’s too much background showing, and people are in poses they’d NEVER strike in real life.
The photo above is an amazing specimen. Frankly, far beyond my abilities; but what I love about it is how close in it is. The details: a parent’s hands, a ribbon, and a little girl patiently waiting. Yes, the lighting and editing make this photo extraordinary. BUT, it is the composition of this photo that makes it so true to life and in my opinion (which seems pretty passionate at the moment!) truly beautiful. I’m convinced that even shot with a PHD this moment would far exceed anything in front of a blue screen. (or brown, or green, or grey)
I admit to liking both! The photos I tend to put around the house are the posed shots, but the ones I really look at are the impromptu ones. The ones I put in my husband’s slide show were also a mix.
I hear you. I know some people like those. And I don’t mind a posed shot: where people are aware they’re being photographed. I just hate to see baby photos where the fake backdrop is larger and more obvious than the little tyke who is supposed to be the subject of the photo.It started as a mundane amble up to Baker’s Arms with the wife for a mooch about. She headed off to pick the kids up from school so I followed my nose down Boundary Road. I’m going to speculate that it was the Boundary between Walthamstow and Leyton but that’s just a wild stab in the dark.
The Dagenham Brook winds its way behind the houses to the River Lee. Further along its course at Marsh Lane Fields the council are lavishing large sums of money on a new bridge across its narrow banks. It’d better be a good bridge, the one that was there already did the job of getting you from one side to the other without getting your feet wet, so this new expensive bridge better come with its own troll, perhaps a kiosk in the middle, and free foot massages.
I took several photographs of the brook from different angles – transfixed by it, wanting document its existence and pay homage to this slither of wildness passing through our realm of bricks and mortar. Some blokes were testing out new car speakers nearby and I wondered how I could justify to them my fixation with what might look like a muddy ditch.
I fumbled around in my head for a bit past lists of chocolate bars and the Suarez 10-match ban and came to the conclusion that people go to great lengths to seek out historical monuments of the man-made world for their supposed links to the past but here was a tangible relic from a much more distant age, as old at least as a Wooly Mammoth, just sliding past the backs of terraced house gardens minding its own business.
I got drawn into the industrial estate off Lea Bridge Road and wandered around admiring the modernist industrial architecture – it’s like a miniature version of the splendour of the Great West Road.
One of the factories in Staffa Road was possibly where the Panjandrum was built. With the high-tech military research funds long gone the great brains of Leyton have turned their attention to constructing giant wooden shoes.
The bridge that took me over the railway tracks was thick with flies – I had a mouthful by the time I reached the other end. I must remember to keep my mouth shut and not have my tongue hanging out in those situations.
The horses mowing the grass of the Lea Valley Riding Centre on the other side were less than sympathetic and harassed me for sugar cubes and Polo mints – neither of which I had.
The once mighty River Lee tamed and subordinate. I’ve written a few thoughts about it in my forthcoming book so don’t want to blow that now – I can’t think of anything else to say for now – just that I prefer the tributaries, although I’ve only mentioned the Dagenham, Coppermill, and Filly Brook in my book.
After following the path round Porter’s Field I ended up in a section of Walthamstow Marshes navigating my way along tunnels cut through a deep growth of brambles. Around and around I went through this maze of thorns with no evident way out. In a clearing a man was laid in the sun reading a book – he just looked up and smirked. I was too embarrassed to ask directions.
By the time I reached Springfield Park with lacerated hands I was more than ready for afternoon tea on the lawns drinking in the view across the Lea Valley to the dark ridge of Epping Forest.
It’s impossible to pass through the area without noticing the spire of the Georgian Orthodox Church in Upper Clapton. Apparently this was previously home to the Agapemonite sect – what a great name, up there with the Muggletonians.
I couldn’t get a decent photo of the winged creatures looking out from the belfry – Wikipedia says they are a reference to Blake’s Jerusalem.
The Salisbury on Harringay Green Lanes seemed like a natural place to end up. We used to drink here when I lived in a student house up on the Harringay Ladder. One night the pub was closed so they could film a scene for the Chaplin biopic directed by Dickie Attenborough and starring Robert Downey Jr.
From memory Chaplin is stood at the bar and berated by a couple of locals about not supporting the war effort during WWI. He’d be safe in the Salisbury today – there was only me and a couple of old fellas.Mr. Angel Gurría, Secretary-General of the OECD, was in Berlin on 5 April 2016 at the invitation of Mrs. Angela Merkel, Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, to attend a meeting of the Heads of International Organisations (International Monetary Fund, OECD, World Bank Group, World Trade Organization and International Labour Organisation).

Applications Technology (AppTek) and BSE announce today their partnership to bring automated closed captioning to Canadian broadcasters.
“BSE is incredibly impressed with the quality of the captions provided by AppTek’s automated closed captioning appliance,” said Stephen Aitcheson, BSE’s Managing Partner and President. “The Canadian broadcast market is embracing appropriate technical solutions to ensure that the deaf and hard-of-hearing community have the best viewing experience.”
AppTek’s Live CC Appliance offers high accuracy, no paraphrasing, 3-second average latency and can be adapted for each user and local geography through deep learning and artificial intelligence.
“In addition to continuously updating our proprietary speech-to-text IP, AppTek has been working directly with the hard-of-hearing community to compare different closed captioning methodologies,” stated Adam Sutherland, AppTek CEO. “In cooperation with our research university partners, we have received early feedback that our Live CC Appliance results can be more complete and understandable than human captioning. This alternative allows the deaf and hard-of-hearing broader access to a viewing experience that is closer to the experience the hearing community enjoys.”
BSE will offer the Live CC Appliance in English and French for the Canadian market, and is available in 11 other languages including Mandarin, German, French, Arabic and others.
Aitcheson added, “Our team at BSE recognized very early that artificial intelligence (AI), data and machine learning were going to have a profound impact on the broadcast and Media landscape. We realized that to address the changing needs of our customers we would have to find industry leading technology partners to give the broadcast industry the products required to achieve these goals. AppTek is one of those industry leaders, with an extremely advanced AI based captioning technology. They are the first truly automated captioning platform with the ability to handle the stringent demands of the live broadcast marketplace. BSE is excited to be working with the team at AppTek.”

I use my blog as a personal knowledge management tool. Every day I collect up 20-30 blog posts, web pages, PDF files etc to read. They are all there on my Tablet PC as different tabs in Maxthon, the following morning I read them and then for those that need some sort of action I add them to Maxthon groups like For action, To watch, To blog, etc.
For action stuff I work through when I get chance and it tends to be software to download, emails to send etc
To watch stuff is self explanatory, the only twist being that I try and download stuff to watch onto my Tablet so that I can watch it when I am at a loose end, waiting to pick the kids up from swimming for example
To blog stuff, is anything that I find really interesting and want to remember for later, I find blogging it much more useful than just tagging it because not only do I remember it but I get to think a little about the context and how it links to other things I am interested in. Of course the spin off benefit is that I get to share it with others in my company and beyond. I also post stuff on my blog in answer to questions that people ask me, it’s more efficient than email.
I find this usage model for my blog very effective, in almost every conversation I have now – after writing a blog for 3 years – I tend to illustrate the point I am making with a few links to articles I have already written, it makes me seem super efficient!
There are many more uses for blogs in the enterprise, some of which I have described on by blog already, but this post by Martin provides an excellent overview and of course Rod Boothby has consistently excellent posts on the topic.
By the way, for any of you wondering at the number of posts today – I have just got back from holiday and have an hour to work through my “To Blog” lists before I go swimming!
very interesting, but I don’t agree with you
IdetrorceHow many times a day do you need to spell out a word for someone? It happens a lot more frequently than we realise, both over the phone and in person. So, in case this happens when you’re speaking French, below is the French alphabet and how to pronounce each letter.
How Learning the French Alphabet and its Pronunciation can Help Your Grasp of the Language
It may seem a little pointless to learn the French Alphabet and how to pronounce the individual letters, but this can actually really help your grasp of the French language.
The alphabet is one of the very first things you learn in your native tongue, so it stands to reason that it should be one of the first things that you learn when learning a new language.
The French alphabet will help you in all aspects of your French learning. For one, it helps with your pronunciation, because even if you aren’t sure how to say a word that you have read, you can sound it out in a similar way to how you would in your native language.
Learning how to pronounce letters of the French alphabet can also help with your writing. When you are trying to remember how to spell a word, you can use the above technique, but in reverse by sounding it out. Identify the different sounds and link them to the letters as you write.
As with every language, there are exceptions to how the letters will sound, especially if they are paired with an accent. But once you have learnt the basics of their pronunciation you can begin to learn the variations as well.
The French Alphabet and its Pronunciation
Other Resources That Can Help You to Learn the French Alphabet
When learning French, staring at and memorising tables of sounds for pronunciation can be a bit tiresome. This method certainly doesn’t work for everyone. As such, there are other ways that can help you to learn the French Alphabet and its pronunciation.
The most popular way is to use YouTube. As a video streaming platform, you can actually hear how the letters are supposed to sound. Some videos can even show you how to form the letters with your mouth, to imitate the noises a little easier.
There are several songs available for learning your ABC’s in any language. You can have these playing in the background while you go about your day. By doing this, the information can subconsciously enter your brain as a catchy tune while you multitask.
Conclusion
Once you have learnt the French alphabet and the pronunciation of the letters, you can begin to build upon this knowledge and look into how the sound changes depending upon which accents are being used and which letters follow it in different words.You can look into other pronunciation tips in this article. It will give you an outline of other factors that can affect the pronunciation of French letters and words. Or, if you are struggling with the sounds certain words make when they follow after one another, there is a guide on liaisons (the correct term for this) which will help you.In Jinan This, not Group D, is the toughest in this year's Asian Cup. World Cup semi-finalists Korea, 1996 Asian Cup semi-finalists the United Arab Emirates, 2000 Asian Cup quarter-finalists Kuwait, are all in a state of flux are joined by Jordan, arguably the most improved Asian nation in the new millennium. It might seem crazy to doubt Korea's ability to get through the first phase, but in this company anything could happen. However Korea should have too many good players and too much experience to fall at this early stage. Having set out with the best intentions for the post-Hiddink era, Korea have panicked. Humberto Coelho's 'failure' probably had less to do with systems and tactics and a lot more to do with the fact he only occasionally got to work with Korea's best players, particularly the Dutch-based contingent, and that he had little time with them when he did. Even the search for his successor was poorly handled. Stating that former Senegal coach Bruno Metsu was the chosen candidate before beginning negotiations was hardly the wisest point from which to begin bargaining. Jo Bonfrere was a hasty replacement, which hardly creates the most stable of platforms for the abrasive Dutchman whose record since guiding Nigeria to the 1996 Atlanta Olympics gold medal is not so glorious. They are also missing a gaggle of youngsters for the Olympics, as well as Feyenoord's Song Chong-gug and more importantly sweeper Yoo Sang-chul, who both go to Athens as over-age players. It's amazing to think Jordan will go into their first Asian Cup ranked higher than both Kuwait and the UAE, but that is a testament to the progress made under Mahmoud Al Gohary, who guided his native Egypt to the 1990 World Cup, and the backing of King Abullah II and his brother Prince Ali Al Hussein. The result has been victories such as the one over Iran in the dreaded Azadi Stadium in June's World Cup qualifiers. 'The support of the King is unbelievable. He is always there for us wearing the national team jersey and this motivates us to the limit,' explained captain Abdullah Abu Zema. Kuwait and the UAE have a better history than Jordan, both have been to World Cups, but then both have seen better times. Both have also been chopping and changing coaches - Roy Hodgson, Jean-Francois Jodar and now Aad de Mos - have all been in charge of the Emirates this year. Kuwait, after embarrassing themselves as hosts of the Gulf Cup, cut the cord on Brazilian coach Paulo Cesar Carpeggiani, a veteran of the 1974 World Cup and the man best-known as the coach who took Paraguay to the second round of 1998 World Cup, and replaced him with Mohammed Ibrahim. However ,even last week there have been rumours of a possible new appointment. Since outdoing the rest of Asia at the 200 Olympics times have been tough for Al Azraq (The Blues)..

We respect your privacyAfter the trauma of the First World War, it
seemed inconceivable to many in Britain in the 1930s that another
war with Germany was possible. However the rise of Hitler and the
Nazis in Germany from 1933, German re-armament, Germany’s
plans for its territorial expansion in Central Europe and its involvement
with the fascists parties of Italy and Spain made a new war begin
to appear inevitable.
In Britain, an anti-war campaign hoped that
through negotiations war could be prevented in spite of the National
Government’s policies and actions related to re-armament.
Sheffield Peace March (1936)
represents this moment very well. Made by the Sheffield and District
Workers Film Society, it shows anti-war protests through the streets
of Sheffield. Members of the Labour Party, the Communist Party and
Trade Unions carry placards with slogans such as ‘Sheffield
Workers Unite for Peace’ and ‘Re-armament Means Profit
to Big Business’.
By 1938 the potential for war with Germany increased
dramatically, culminating with the Munich Crisis of late September.
The issuing of gas masks and the digging of trenches at this time
increased the tension and engendered real fear in the nation. The
Minster, on the 29th of September brought relief from this panic
as it signified for many that war in Europe had been adverted. This
is a Matter Which Vitally Concerns You and Southsea
Review, both of 1938, capture the war mood of this year
very well. Southsea Review shows not only the preparations for war
with sandbags being laid in order to protect key buildings, the
digging of air raid shelters and the testing of anti-aircraft guns
but also, through a service of Thanksgiving in Portsmouth, how the
nation was calmed by public knowledge of the Munich Agreement. The
city and the nation rejoiced, not knowing of course that war in
Europe would break out within a year.
Given these circumstances and despite the Munich
Agreement, military camps and maneuvers (such as those seen in The
Leicester Yeomanry (May 1939)) and civilian preparations
for war that were found in 1938 continued into 1939. The Air Raid
Precautions Act (ARP) had been passed in December 1937. It created
an Air Raid Wardens' Service that was devoted to the protection
of the population during aerial bombardments. ARP
/ Malton Evacuees (May 1939-1940) is an early example of
an ARP film. It features an ARP Decontamination Squad practicing
for a gas attack and also presents the preparations for the arrival
of evacuees.
At the same time, many communities were continuing
with their 'normal' activities sometimes seemingly unaffected by,
or perhaps in spite of, the changes taking place, such as the celebrations
seen in Gunnislake Carnival (August
1939).
After the German invasion of Poland, Britain
declared war against Germany on 3 September 1939. The imagined and
feared war was now a reality. ARP / Malton Evacuees also
represents this transition as it presents the presence in late 1939
and throughout 1940 of actual evacuees from Hull in Malton. It was
recognised that Hull and its sea port would be a major target for
the Germans and Hull did suffer extensive damage during the war,
especially during the Blitz of 1941.

Prohibition you live in Somerville, you probably know of someone who
has suffered from drug abuse. Coke, meth, crack, and particularly
heroin and oxycontin use is ruining lives, stressing families,
promoting crime, destroying young peoples' futures, and occasionally,
killing them. A significant portion of assaults and murders are
drug related.
Somerville Cares About Prevention educates citizens regarding
drug use and its consequences. Our Police Department works hard
to reduce drug related crime. They do at least as well, and probably
a little better, than their colleagues in other urban areas.
Yet there are always more addicts to treat, more dealers to arrest,
more funerals to attend, more heartache to heal.
Thirty-five years ago, Richard Nixon declared war on drugs.
Since then, we've spent more on that war than in Iraq and Afghanistan.
We've made 37 million arrests for nonviolent drug crimes. Prisons
are our fastest growing industry, with 2.2 million Americans
currently locked up. We're annually making 1.9 million arrests
and spending $70 billion. Yet drugs are cheaper, more potent,
and far more available. What is to be done?
If you drive northwest on Mystic Avenue, not far past the
Medford line you'll pass a modest office building. One of its
tenants is LEAP, an organization that is influencing opinion
on drug policy across North America. Law Enforcement Against Prohibition's members-current
and retired law officers-propose a different way. They advocate
"a system of regulation and control of production and distribution
[that] will be far more effective and ethical than one of prohibition."
LEAP member, Terry Nelson was a federal drug enforcement officer
for 30 years. He "saw on a daily basis that we were making
no difference....When you put a drug dealer in jail, you create
a job opening."
Former federal Drug Czar Lee Brown says, "When you're
in that position, you see very quickly that you can't arrest
your way out of this. You see the cycle of people using drugs,
going to prison, getting out, and getting into drugs again."
The alternative? Brown points to a study conducted fifteen
years ago by the RAND Corporation. A team of mathematicians calculated
the most cost effective tactics in the drug war-law enforcement,
interdiction, foreign aid, treatment, and prevention. They were
surprised to find that only treatment was effective.
But the hard evidence has no impact on drug policies that
have not just failed in their stated goals of reducing drug addiction,
crime, and juvenile drug use. Instead, the drug war continues
to worsen each of these.
LEAP member Jim Gray describes himself as a conservative judge
in a conservative jurisdiction. Prior to joining the Orange County
Superior Court, he prosecuted what was then Los Angeles' largest
ever drug case. He says unequivocally, "We have a more radical
approach [to drug law] than any other western democracy, and
we have a bigger drug problem. I'm convinced there is a connection."
The plain truth is that drug laws create crime. In his book
Bad Trip, conservative author Joel Miller writes, "Drug
prohibition does not end drug use. It simply forces the consumer
to break the law to get what he wants."
Add to that addicts who steal to support their habit and drug
bosses who kill to dominate their territory. Peter Christ, a
LEAP member and retired Buffalo PD captain observes, "We
legalized alcohol because it only took us 13 years to learn the
lesson that alcohol did not create Al Capone. Prohibition created
Al Capone. And everyone didn't become a drunk in 1934."
He's right. With alcohol prohibition, murder went up 13% and
robbery, 83%. Prohibition ended in 1933, and violent crimes returned
to their pre-prohibition levels by 1937. Judge Gray estimates
that 80 percent of felonies are drug related.
One of the drug war's hypocrisies is that its purpose is to
prevent harm to users. While drug addicts do serious damage to
their lives, the drug war destroys those lives.
Jay Fleming, a thoughtful LEAP member, served 15 years with
multiple drug enforcement agencies: "As with all wars, you
have to have an enemy. That enemy turns out to be our fellow
citizens. Once you make the enemy evil, its ok to use any means
to destroy them." He relates how, working undercover, he
got to know drug culture people and their families. "And
then you have to come back and destroy that family."
The number of Americans behind bars for drug offenses, mostly
nonviolent, has increased by 1,200 percent since 1980. Legendary
NYPD crusader Frank Serpico describes the prison system as an
industry. "They run it like real estate. They have so many
rooms, they have to rent them out, and the police fill them."
Former drug cop, then coroner, then mayor of Vancouver Larry
Campbel says that the drug war isn't really a war, it's a business.
Imprisonment and a criminal record is not the only damage
prohibition does to addicts' lives. Joel Miller writes, "People
who fall into a drug habit and do not want to harm others by
stealing, instead harm themselves by whoring."
Fleming's remorse suggests another drug war impact. Former
Seattle Police Chief and LEAP member Norm Stamper says, "Narcotic
enforcement puts cops in an untenable situation. They are enforcing
laws that in many cases they don't believe in." Then there
are lucrative temptations to corruption. The few cops who yield,
damage the morale of and public respect for the many who don't.
Nor is corruption limited to law enforcement officers. LEAP
member Cellie Castillo was a DEA agent interdicting Latin American
drug traffic. He discovered that U.S. officials were sending
flights of cocaine to the U.S., buying weapons with the proceeds,
and sending the weapons on return flights to Nicaraguan Contras
who used them to commit atrocities. His reports were ignored.
And of course the Taliban, al-Qaida, and terrorists in Colombia,
Peru, and Pakistan can finance their operations through drug
trafficking because drug use is criminalized in the U.S.
LEAP's solution is to legalize, regulate, and heavily tax
drugs. Then as Judge Gray suggests, "Hold people accountable
for what they do instead of what they put in their bodies."
A portion of the enormous revenues and reduced costs thus
generated could be put into drug treatment. The RAND study found
that 13 percent of addicts who went through treatment stopped
using permanently. That seems minimal until you realize that
no other tactic has produced any reduction at all. And treatment
programs have become more effective since the study.
This is not a matter of morality. Enforcement causes more
misery than it prevents. It's not a matter of ideology. George
Will, Howard Zinn, William F. Buckley, Noam Chomsky, Milton Friedman,
and George Shultz have all agreed with the policies that LEAP
advocates. It's a matter of hard evidence, honesty, and courage.
Nixon was right to call drug abuse an epidemic, but he was
wrong to make "war" on its victims. Over my lifetime,
a half dozen people whom I have known died from overdoses or
bad drugs. At least that many got caught in prison/addiction
cycle. One was shot to death in a transaction. Judge Gray says
that, "Eventually we will come to our senses." I hope.electric trash cans fancy trash can outdoor amazing bronze wastebasket dual compartment trash can full size of bronze wastebasket fancy trash can electric trash cans home.
