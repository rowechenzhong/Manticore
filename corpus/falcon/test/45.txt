A green & inclusive economy requires the emergence of new business models that are fit-for-purpose in regenerative capitalism. What are the information and reporting needs of those new business model innovators that disrupt business-as-usual and existing industries? Considering the context of business model innovation, they need reliable sources of information on key trends (foresight), industry forces, market forces and macro-economic forces. Responding to these with their own value propositions, they have different business case insights into what is relevant, its measurement and communication. Responding to their information needs, this blueprint project will capture the dynamics around the need to transform data collection, accounting and reporting in the light of those that disrupt. Consider for example how will circular and sharing business models disrupt mainstream views on the value of reporting and accounting. How will <2°C Business Models respond to the new demands of a carbon constrained economy – and what mechanisms are needed to assess the robustness of these <2°C Business Models?

Chapter 1: Jane 1. JANE
Outside the walls of the castle, standing before the moat, looking out at the stream that separates us from our subjects, there is a woman in a box. She is tall and blond. She has an ivory dress and pale skin and a shock of a red mouth. She doesn’t move. Not even when the townspeople wave and clamor for her attention. Not even now, when I am looking into her unblinking eyes. She doesn’t move. She can’t.
The woman is my mother.
I tell myself these facts every day, a story I repeat in my head. A true story that can feel untrue, which is why I find myself saying it over and over. My mother, the queen, is frozen in a box. We have to break the spell.
“What’d you say?” Olive says, pulling on one side of my dress, then the other, as if there is a perfect way to wear it, but my body isn’t cooperating. I must have said the words out loud. Years of hunger have broken down my defenses, and thoughts slip out too often now, forgetting to ask my permission first.
“We’re going to break the spell today,” I say, testing out the words for my attendant. They sound true enough. They sound possible, at least.
Olive pauses. Her hands are on my back, pulling and stitching fabric that was meant for someone softer, someone fuller, someone fed. It’s her job to make my dresses fit me, and that means her fingers are always calloused from the needle, her eyes always squinting from the delicacy of the work, the impossibility of making my body look anything but Spellbound. “I hope that’s true,” she says at last.
There’s a clatter from the dining room, one floor below us. I used to like this part of the castle. It always smells like whatever is cooking. And whatever is cooking is always delicious. Now it’s a pointed kind of torture, to smell everything I haven’t been able to eat for five years.
Dad’s offered to move me into a different room a hundred times, but it feels like admitting defeat, so I stay. “Queens don’t complain,” I’ve reminded him more than once. A lesson my mother taught me, when she was out here and not in that box.
“They’re having scones,” I say now, smelling the air. “Cherry.”
“Chocolate cherry,” Olive says before shaking her head and correcting herself. “I’m sorry. I don’t know why I said that. You don’t need to know that.”
“Chocolate-cherry scones,” I say. “Don’t know that I’ve ever had them.”
“For Eden’s birthday, whatever she requests is what gets made,” Olive says, repeating the rules to me as if they aren’t my own, as if I don’t live with them every day. Across the generations many things have happened on Thirteenth Birthdays. Engagements. Weddings. Treaties between nations. And of course, eighty years ago, a kidnapped princess, the start of the biggest War. The War We Won.
I’m begging tonight to matter the way so many other Thirteenth Birthdays have.
Downstairs, my sisters are laughing at something. I can practically hear their tongues in their mouths, their hands wiping their lips, their throats swallowing. It’s not just food I miss. It’s everything that comes with food. The way my father used to spread the butter on my bread for me, always caking on extra. The jokes at the table. The loveliness of a heavy silver fork in my hand. Even the way meals mark the passing of time, giving a long day balance and breaks.
Now a day is just an endless stretch of hunger that goes from dawn until dusk without a single breath of relief.
Even today.
“I think you’ll be able to break the spell,” Olive says, working on fitting the sleeves of my gown around my wrists. This dress fit fine a month ago, but it’s now swallowing me whole. The Slow Spell is Quickening. Time is running out.
Ever since the spell was cast, I’ve been counting down to Eden’s Thirteenth Birthday, when the witch promised she’d return to tell us how to break the spell before it turns True.
I wonder if the people of Ever have been thinking about it too. They cried the day the spell was cast. They watched from the other side of the moat when the witch appeared on the Grand Yard, arms raised, a cape flying out behind her. She was a young witch. My age. Her voice was thin as it recited a magical chant. She called out our fates one by one, telling us what malady would befall us on our Thirteenth Birthdays. “When you each reach my age,” she said, “that’s when the spell will bind you. On your Thirteenth Birthday. When it binds the last of you, in five years’ time on Princess Eden’s birthday, I’ll return. I’ll give you one chance to break the spell.”
I waited for Dad to react, to boom out a hundred questions. Most importantly, Why are you doing this? and Don’t you know what our agreement is? and maybe also Do the older witches know you’re here; are you confused; can someone fetch this young, unhinged witch and return her to her Home on the Hill?
Instead, he was quiet. We were all in shock. Witches were our partners in keeping Ever safe. We protected them. They protected us. Perfect symbiosis. Everything about this witch, from her age to her words to the spell itself, was wrong. More than wrong. Impossible.
I was shaking from the impossibility of it.
Mom was quiet too. Queens are quiet, and she was always, always a queen first.
I stayed quiet for as long as I could, because I wanted to be queen. But as long as I could turned out to be twenty-two seconds.
“Why would you do this?” I said. My voice was small at first, then louder, because she didn’t answer, and her face only got harder, more sure. “This is— What are you doing? We’re princesses, and you’re... We don’t do this to each other! Why would you do this?”
Mom had told me a hundred times that silence is more meaningful than words. I was failing at following Mom’s rules, but I didn’t know how to be quiet in the face of this witch.
The witch kept her mouth closed. She wouldn’t look at me. She looked everywhere else, though. She looked at the castle—its stone, its turrets, its incredible size.
I tried to say only the most important thing in the enormous valley of my parents’ silence. “Please,” I said. “No.”
“I have to,” she said. She looked a little sad saying it. Or maybe I’m just remembering it that way.
I was the oldest, three days from my Thirteenth Birthday. The rest of my sisters would have more time to prepare for the spell. Nora would have over a year. Alice another year beyond that. Grace would have nearly four years to think it all through. And Eden would have the whole five years. I had three days. My heart beat out the number. Three. Three. Three.
“Please,” I said again. “No.” Thirteenth Birthdays are celebrated with enormous royal balls, a feast, a dance, silk dresses, a silver crown. Not with curses. Mine was already all planned. “No,” I said again, trying to make it sound royal and right. “No.”
I looked at my mother. She would know how to fix it. My whole life, she’d solved every problem that had come my way.
There hadn’t been many.
I watched her body lean forward a little, her mouth form an O shape, about to say something wise and true to this young witch, ready to finally break her queenly silence. But before a word came out, before she could stitch things back together, make our world right again, she froze. A glass box appeared around her, trapping her inside.
She was Spellbound.
My heart spun right out of my body and joined her in that glass box. I didn’t cry or scream or throw myself onto the glass. Instead I buried my face in my arms and bent at the waist, like if I could get small and hidden enough, I could disappear from the moment.
She was not yet done teaching me how to be a queen, and I was immediately lost without her. I couldn’t think of words or find the right shape for my body to take. I ran through everything she’d ever told me about queens and witches and spells and How to Be. Queens don’t beg witches to be kind. Queens don’t let their eyes fill with tears or let their hearts beat out three, three, three. Queens don’t wish they weren’t the oldest princess; queens don’t wish their sisters would be hit by the spell first; queens don’t hate everyone who isn’t cursed.
I closed my eyes and told my heart to shut up. Queens are quiet.
I knew enough about witches to know that a thirteen-year-old witch could only cast a Slow Spell, the kind that didn’t have everlasting consequences. When witches turn eighteen, their spells turn True, permanent, everlasting, and damaging.
“How do we break the spell?” I asked, trying to find the right words for a queen to say, hoping my mother could hear me and be proud of me, even behind that layer of thick glass.
The witch’s eyes were steady and wide and gray. Her skin looked like mine—an uneven, patchy white. Her mouth was a surprising shade of red, like my mother’s. It is impossible to pick out a witch by anything but the skirts around their waists. In every other way, they look like the rest of Ever. Their skin is every shade of white or brown or in-between; their noses and eyes and chins take different shapes. They are tall and short and round and straight. They are mostly women, but there are witches across the gender spectrum. The only thing they always have in common is magic and the layers of fabric in all colors and textures and patterns tied around their waists, marking them, warning us.
“I’ll return in five years’ time,” the young witch said, repeating her earlier promise with no further details. It wasn’t what I wanted to hear. I wanted a new answer, a better spell, an easier curse.
Alice’s fingers found mine in the silence that followed. Nora drew closer to me. Mom in her glass box had a straight back and kind eyes. I tried to imitate her, but my knees kept buckling. Queens aren’t scared, I told my knees, but they didn’t listen. My mouth was dry. My head swam.
“Please,” Dad said. I had never heard my father beg for anything. He was the king, after all. If queens weren’t meant to beg, kings certainly weren’t either. I wrapped my arms around myself, as if that could hold me together. We were all falling apart.
The witch didn’t care about any of it. She didn’t tell us why. She just looked at us, at all of us, like we already knew.
“How do we break the spell?” I called out to her again, a question I’d already asked and she’d already answered. These were the only words I had. That, and three days. Three days. Three days.
“I’ll be back when the spell has bound the last of you,” the witch said again. With one more sorry look at me, the witch was gone and Mom was trapped, and three days later I turned thirteen and I wasn’t able to lift food or drink to my mouth. I wasn’t able to eat.
And finally, five years later, we are here. Eden’s birthday. Chocolate-cherry scones. A dress that doesn’t fit. A crowd of people across the moat, remembering or not remembering that we were not always Spellbound.
I don’t know when the witch will turn eighteen, when exactly the Slow Spell could turn True, as all unbroken Slow Spells do. But I hope it’s months from now, or maybe a whole year. We’ve studied the breaking of spells these past five years, and they can be complicated and dangerous to undo. Maybe we will be required to cut our hair and give up all our jewels or climb a mountain in another kingdom or solve a nearly impossible riddle. We may have to sit alone in a locked room for weeks or stand outside in the town square for a month without speaking. We might have to give up our castle, our attendants, our avocados, the summer months.
My stomach grips as I try to imagine what tonight will bring. I didn’t know it was possible to look forward to something and dread it all at once, but it is. I am. We are.
“I hope—” I start, but I have no idea how to finish the sentence. I want a hundred things I can’t have. “I hope—” I try again, but there’s no end; there’s nothing to say.
“I know,” Olive says. My father’s voice bellows from downstairs. He’s loud when he’s happy, and it seems to startle Olive. Her shoulders jump. “I hope too.”
My heart pounds, like it did all those years ago. My knees are weak again, weaker now, from lack of nourishment. And I want my mother more than I’ve ever wanted anything. I want her here, now, the way she should be. Smoothing my dress, suggesting hairstyles, telling me I look beautiful.
“I want to show my mother my dress,” I tell Olive, and she escorts me downstairs and out the door. I don’t go anywhere alone. Even when I’m sleeping, Olive checks in on me throughout the night, to make sure I’m safe and comfortable and the right temperature for a princess.
We don’t stop in the dining room, don’t greet my family. I don’t speak with them when they’re eating. It’s easier that way.
“Your Spellbound! Good morning!” a girl with brown skin and braided hair calls out from across the moat the second we are on the Grand Yard. We aren’t meant to speak directly to our subjects, and they know this. But they try anyway. I wave but say nothing.
“Your Stillness,” her white, rosy-cheeked friend booms to my mother in her glass box. “We miss you!”
Subjects say silly things from across the moat. It’s our job to let them. To smile and wave and say nothing. We stay on our side of the moat, and they stay on theirs. It’s how things are and how things have been and how they will always be.
A long time ago, before I was Spellbound, I wondered aloud what it would be like to walk in the kingdom that belongs to us, to know its streets and its people. But my mother and father assured me I did know Ever. “You don’t need to see every leaf in the forest to be the sun giving it the light to grow,” Dad said, and now I know that he’s right. Princesses stay in castles. Kings gives speeches from towers. Attendants say yes and bow their heads when the king enters and sometimes shake at the sight of him. We see Ever from here. That is enough, because it has always been enough.
What I don’t understand, what maybe no one understands, is witches. “They keep us at rest,” Mom said before she was rendered speechless in a box. “And we keep them safe. It’s an imperfect thing. Witches are imperfect. We are too. A queen needs to know that.” I nodded. She nodded back. Looked at me to make sure I was really hearing her. She didn’t need to look so hard, though. I always listened to my mother. “Anyway, it’s all we have. The imperfect agreement. It’s all they have too, after the War We Won. We’re all just waiting for the kidnapped princess to return.” She looked like she had more to say. She was speaking more quickly than usual, repeating herself to make sure I understood. “The witches help us wait.” She nodded to the candles across the moat, the ones our subjects keep lit at all times, so that the kidnapped princess can find her way back to us, someday. And she gestured to the rock carving of the kidnapped princess that Alice had made based on a photograph Dad had given her. She looks a little like me. Pointy chin, straight back, small nose, long hair.
I’m supposed to hope for the return of this princess, for solving the mystery of who took her, for knowing which kingdom, out of all the kingdoms, is actually the one that should be Banned. But I can’t hope for anything but the breaking of the spell.
“Do you like my dress?” I ask my mother, holding up the corners of the gown that now more or less fits me. It’s an icy pale blue and is embroidered with jewels. “I wanted something special for Eden’s Thirteenth Birthday,” I say. “Olive made it.” Olive stands a few yards away from my mother and me. She knows when to be close and when to give me space. She knows what I need more than I do, sometimes.
What I need right now, though, is my mother’s kind smile and her bright eyes. I want her to tell me I look like a queen, finally, because the last time she spoke to me, I was so young and so silly and so unstudied.
“The dress is fine, Jane,” my sister Nora says from her spot on the lawn. I don’t know when she joined me out here. She’s sneaky, Nora. Quiet when she wants to be and never wasting time with things like saying good morning or asking how I’m doing. She has hitched her skirts up to her knees and is letting the sun freckle her skin. “Who cares what you look like anyway. This isn’t exactly the party where you’re going to meet the love of your life.”
Her mouth sort of folds over the word “love,” like it’s a joke. And I guess for her it is. The same spell that cursed me with not eating cursed her with not loving. She can’t feel any kind of love—not for princes or princesses or dukes or duchesses, which wouldn’t be so unusual. But Nora can’t feel any love for us, either, not for her family, or her subjects, or the small blue birds she used to feed bread crumbs to, and not even for herself. I suppose for Nora, love sounds about as attainable as a roast chicken does to me.
“Thirteenth Birthdays were Mom’s favorite,” I say. Nora and I remember her best. Alice, Grace, and Eden guess at who she is and what she loved and what she used to say. But Nora and I recall the specifics—the way her hair knotted in the wind, the way she held her hands to her heart when she was disappointed, the care with which she shrugged into a new ball gown like it was a second skin. “She said a Thirteenth Birthday marks the moment a princess becomes herself.”
The day the spell was cast was so close to my own Thirteenth Birthday that preparations had been well underway. Mom and I had chosen the ocean as a theme. I’ve never seen one, but I was fascinated by the idea of an expanse of water so large you couldn’t see the other side. My Thirteenth Birthday was going to have seafood entrées and waves of water beneath glass floors and the smell of salt in the air. The witches had agreed to help make it so. Olive made me an ocean dress in blues and greens, waves of fabric that swished and swayed with such force I could have imagined I was caught in a tide’s pull.
But when it was time for my Thirteenth Birthday, I spent it in a corner, and I called Olive ridiculous for making the gown. I refused to eat a last meal. If I think too hard now, I can still feel the pain of it. How good it felt to topple a tray of bonbons. How I wanted to punch my hand through a window or kick a prince.
It’s there even now, deep down. A simmering rage I’m barely holding back.
Nora knows it too. We are both thinking about last year’s party for Grace. And two years before that when Alice turned thirteen. A royal Thirteenth Birthday used to be a joyous moment, introducing a princess to her future. She’d meet princes and princesses from other kingdoms. She would be given a silver-and-emerald crown. She would be given a title. Princess Mara the Clever. Princess Emily the Listening. Princess Betsy the Strong.
Now we are given our spell and nothing else. Princess Jane Who Can’t Eat. Princess Nora Who Can’t Love. Princess Alice Who Can’t Sleep. Princess Grace Who Can’t Remember. Princess Eden Who Can’t Hope.
“Who cares about Birthdays and dresses?” Nora asks. “Who cares about any of this?”
I’d be better off ignoring Nora, but I can’t. She’s so present. Her body looks the way mine used to—thick around the hips, rounded at the breasts, at the belly. Sturdy and sweet.
I squeeze my hands into fists and wonder what it would be like to shove her, hard, against a tree.
What would a queen do? my mind interrupts. Be a queen. I pull my shoulders back and lift my chin and take on the pose of a ruler.
Nora raises her eyebrows at the way the lace of my dress drapes, clings, tries to thicken me up, fails. Because the spell is a Slow one, I can’t waste away entirely, I can’t die of starvation, but I can’t imagine getting any skinnier than I am right now. I suppose that makes sense. One way or another, we are near the end.
I push the thought away. You will be queen. I will not die from this spell.
“Mom loved the food at the Thirteenth Birthdays,” Nora says. I can’t tell if it’s meant to be cruel or matter-of-fact. I don’t think Nora knows either.
“The only taste I remember is apple,” I say.
“Apple, huh?” Nora says. She stands up, and her dress falls down around her, a mint-green cloud.
“It’s sweet,” I say, licking my lips like some phantom taste might still be there. “Tangy. Watery. A pinch of a taste. The kind of thing you could eat for hours and never feel full from. Is that right?”
“That’s about right,” Nora says with a sort of smile. “The Prince of Soar loves apples. Dad told me. The chef will be making them baked with cinnamon for him.”
“He’s the redheaded one?” I ask.
She shakes her head. “No, that’s the Prince of Nethering. The Prince of Soar is the tall one. Glasses. Dimples. Soft voice.”
I nod. It’s hard to keep track of these things. When I was allowed to eat, names and faces and locations felt like distinct, graspable ideas. Now it’s all hazy, and my anger keeps rising and rising, obscuring things even more.
Be a queen, I tell myself again. I try to stay still and silent. It’s harder than it sounds.
I remember reciting the Royal Rules with my mother before bed every night. I loved the rules. If I could follow them, I would be queen, and all would be well. At rest. The way it was meant to be. I can almost hear my mother’s small voice singing its way through the long list of things I was supposed to be.
Then the moment’s over, and she’s just a woman in glass again, just a trapped queen, just someone I used to know.

Our Identity
College Achieve Public Schools is a network of three K-12 charter schools. Our own school in Plainfield is officially known as College Achieve Central Charter School — or CAPS Central for short. The other two schools are located in Paterson and Asbury Park,.Goodbye Tobacco® was created by Meryl Wexler, who initially taught Smoking/Tobacco Cessation for community participants at multiple hospitals, as well as at many employer sites for groups. After doing this for many years, she subsequently wrote and professionally filmed this detailed video course, which she teaches herself.
Goodbye Tobacco® is highly “personal touch” in style, offering a strong balance between education and support. While Meryl repeatedly emphasizes that there is no right or wrong way to quit, she firmly asserts her conviction that anyone trying to quit must be willing to be honest with themselves in the process, accepting and dealing with difficult realities in order to succeed. Meryl helps participants “feel the love” while, at the same time, evoking a calling, “the time is now”
One of the most significant and distinguishing characteristics of Goodbye Tobacco® is acknowledgment of different learning styles, with specific, step-by-step “how-to” guidance on quitting based on those different styles.
At any time when you’re in the process of viewing the program, or after completing the program, you are welcome to reach out to Meryl for assistance.Murphy Trail leads from the mesa top in Island In The Sky to the White Rim Road in about four miles.

The curfew will be in effect from 23 to 5 or 6 in the morning, as you may have learned TN.com.ar.
The owner of the Pro, Patricia bullrichHe said that “the curfew must be approved in Congress; it is not the power of a monarch. Who pays for the failure of the government’s health policy? Millions of Argentines who cannot work. Another blow to the workers! ”, He warned on his Twitter account.
Chief of Staff Santiago Cafiero said at a press conference that “the measures will be in this afternoon, they are already being drafted” and “will be published this Friday.” From 11 pm, only essential personnel can circulate on the streets.
The restriction could last the entire month of January, although the fine print of this question is being written at this time. “We know they are unfriendly measures”Cafiero acknowledged. The official measure will represent a severe blow to bars, restaurants and the commercial sector.
// What about public transport and who can travel during the toilet call
For the head of the UCR and national deputy, Alfredo Cornejo, “The measures that the Fernández government will take are a clear demonstration of the failure of the health strategy.”
And he added: “They are the coup de grace to the Argentine economy. Restricting freedoms and holding the other accountable, pure and simple Kirchnerism, “he said.
From the Civic Coalition, the national deputy Paula Olivetto He said that “the curfew that the President wants to impose, based on a very capricious interpretation of the Penal Code, is very dangerous. It allows the abuses that we have seen on the part of the security forces and the feudalists, ”he warned.
The legislator, a key ally of Elisa Carrió in Congress, said that the government should increase the number of tests and strengthen prevention protocols to contain the reappearance of cases, instead of restricting circulation. “Banning is not the solution. Test and protocol ”, he said on Twitter.
Your colleague Graciela Ocana he was not left behind with his questions. “The sanitary curfew is an extreme and dangerous measure for freedoms. We have already had arrests and disappearances during the confinement dictated by the President within the framework of the measures of social, preventive and compulsory isolation ”, he added from his account on the social network.

Last light at La Jolla
The colours came in nicely when the sun fell under the clouds before hiding behind the ocean horizon. The shoreline around La Jolla looked like someone had splashed paint across the wet rocks, swirling water as well as the dark clouds hanging above. This was a few minutes after the previous image I shared from the same sunset – interesting how the colours changed over that short period of time.
Hunting with a Barn owl at dusk
Boundary Bay is lovely throughout the year. Early spring along the levee that runs parallel to the tidal flats, driftwood piles and grassy fields is not an exception. When we were there last weekend, the rain rolled in as we were watching Snowy owls scattered across the grassland which did contribute to a beautiful scene a couple of hours later. At the time, it set the owls in their poses as they hunkered down through the showers.
Jack and I waited for the weather to change so that the owls may take to the air. Dusk was quickly approaching and we had hopes that these raptors would start hunting. The rain increased and we walked back along the dyke towards the parking lot a couple of kilometers away. As the car came into view, the rain lessened and when I was at the trailhead, the sun had even hazarded a couple looks under the clouds. The evening light was beautiful though very soft as it was filtered by the clouds and water vapour in the sky. A rainbow over the water drew my attention out over the flats and that’s where I first saw a distant bird flying low over the marshes.
I followed it through the gloom and as it moved closer and into the sunlight, I was able to identify it as a Barn owl (Tyto alba). This was my first sight of one of these owls in the wild and I fell in love immediately.
They have a chaotic flight pattern where they swoop along and then dive with great conviction downwards at crazy angles when they find a target. It crisscrossed a large area for about half an hour and all I could have wished for was a bit more light.
Dusk was well entrenched by this time and I was pushing the camera’s ISO and autofocus hard. The owl was curious too and swooped by on two separate occasions. The whole time spent watching this bird was a great experience and I’m looking forward to my next encounter with one of these beautiful owls.

I could still make out the silhouette as it flew further away but my attention was pulled in a new direction by a Short-eared owl that circled by for a couple of minutes and then a Snowy which, freed from its perch by the calm weather, landed on a pile of waterlogged wood less than a stone’s throw away. I hope to share some of those photographs soon..
Evening in the Foothills
The light this evening was lovely and the lines of the hillsides of the Foothills towards Kananaskis Country looked like a water-colour painting..
Up.Forsaking the timid passive route of quiet diplomacy, Sipho Pityana went for the jugular this week. The occasion was not some discrete inconspicuous meeting of academics or malcontents, but rather one where all the heavy-weights & decision makers were in attendance: the annual Mining Indaba.
This was speaking truth to power not in spurts of incoherent anger and rage such as a blustering Malema, but rather the poetry of well-marshalled facts. Pityana exposed for the world to view, the rot that lay beneath the platitudes, the evasive replies, the blatant mendacious lies of a kleptocratic government and a supine populace and industry.
Main picture: Sipho Pityana
Not content to reveal the top layer, the minor irritants of corrupt traffic cops and other lessor government officials, he dug deeper until he revealed the nub of the problem, the proverbial cancer within, the “Sponsor-in-Chief” – as Pityana eloquently defined it – Jacob Zuma himself.
Gutting the entrails of an animal is never a pleasant task. One averts one gaze and holds one’s nose. But all to no avail. All of the audience was held spellbound as Pityana laid bare each sordid detail as he marshalled each distasteful unpalatable fact one after the other.
Like a latter day Thuli Madonsela, Pityana has nailed his colours firmly to the mast.
His clarion call for action to reverse this appalling state of affairs deserves South Africa’s unreserved support.
From always being a positive person about South Africa’s future, the continual litany of greed, corruption, incompetence has this year finally taken its toll. The dial switched from positive to gloom, from “bright sunlit uplands” as Churchill was to evoke in Britain’s darkest days, to a dark gloomy emptiness, a formless void.
At the forefront of the struggle for clean government: Pravin Gordhan & Mcebisi Jonas
Pityana has once again provided me with that hope, that toehold that probity, common-sense and competence is once again possible and valued.
Perhaps!
Instead of an inarticulate redacted version of Pityana’s speech, it is hereafter included in full..
Thuli Madonsela – one of the few bulwarks against Zuma
Whilst the debate over State Capture rages.
Hlaudi: A favourite of Zuma
Ladies and gentlemen, our young democracy is facing its sternest test yet on a number of fronts. And whilst there is an astonishingly well martialled.
Zuma taking strain becomes. Ratings agencies are sneered at. Businesses are hobbled at any opportunity. The needs of ordinary people are ignored.
All the while, the growing wariness of investors – both here and abroad — is quietly chiseling.
Atul Gupta with Jacob Zuma?
New Public Protector Mkhwebane: Is she up to the task at hand?.
Reuel Khoza concerns.
We’ve also seen churches voice their concern at our leadership and the state of our nation. Civil society is speaking out, with a growing chorus including NGOs, students and academics. We have seen more urgency from opposition political parties, and there is a growing clamour on social media saying one thing, which I agree with: “Zuma must go”.
Even within the accountable government that has the best interests of its citizens at heart.
We can agree, and must agree, that under Zuma, the government is incapable of genuine reform. And, therefore, he must go.

2 Comments
What a brilliant article!!
A comment that was emailed to me:
I have not tried to analyse Pityana’s comments in depth except to point out a few things.
1: R26bn is closer to 1% of our GDP and not 10%.
2: This is not a new phenomenon. In 22 years, please name 1 ANC functionary who has fallen on their sword. At best they have been forced to resign but in most cases a sinecure has been found for them somewhere else until they can be retreaded. In a few cases they have been dragged kicking and screaming through the courts, all the while using the public purse to defend themselves and always with tons of ANC support along the way.
In conclusion: It’s powerful stuff you say here Mr Pityana – it’s just a pity you and your kind did not wake up to it earlier. Sorry Mr Pityana, but the ANC in government has been corrupt (as well as slothful, venal, stupid, self serving, short sighted, incompetent ….) virtually from the get go.Write Coursework For […]
Coursework can be any type or task you have to complete to pass a class, subject or course.
Every class is required to complete some course work in their course. For some students this can take just a few hours every week. For students who are able to devote more time to studying, this type of assignment can take all day.

Why is Coursework So Hard to Complete?
It’s not difficult for many students to write assignments. It’s really the matter of keeping your schedule, isn’t it?

Time restrictions due to school/work/life/life
The inability to express thoughts clearly and succinctly
Lack of interest or understanding in one particular field or subject
Personal problems
Health problems
The average student is required to complete at minimum 4 hours of work every day. This can make it difficult for students to maintain an active social or personal life.

Sunny Colorado Landscaping Design Considerations
With over 300 days of sun in Colorado, it is important that Four Seasons creates outdoor spaces that increase home equity and improves your quality of life. And in the grand scheme of things, it is also important to us to protect the environment and the richness of what nature provides. We use high-quality materials and the construction industries’ best practices to research, plan, design and implement the landscaping of your dreams.
Free Project Assessment
When looking at either front yard or backyard landscaping, or an all over plan, we always begin with a free assessment. This allows us to see the spaces and layout and listen to your objectives, budget and goals. We create a project file with the information we gather in order to create a Base Plan, Site Analysis, Use Analysis and Schematic Plan.
Landscaping Master Plan
The master plan is constructed from feedback gathered from our experts and from you, the homeowner. We consider the materials including stones, turf, plants, features and more, based on your goals and your budget. We then put your plan into action with a schedule, so you know what to expect of the timeline.
After installation, you are never alone. We provide continued education about how to care for your new front yard landscaping which may include xeriscape, new plants, trees or shrubs.

However, for some nurses and therapy professionals, the holidays can also catch you on a travel assignment.
While this may not seem like the ideal celebratory holiday situation, cheer up and worry less. Holidays as a travel nurse allow you to take charge and experience something new this holiday. Below are tips on how to celebrate the holidays while on a travel assignment
Go all Out on the Food Front
Travel assignments bless us with the opportunity to meet new people. Make your new friends a specialty meal with a little piece of your home or traditions to get yourself in the holiday spirit. Not only do you wow your new friends but also relive a special part of your home holidays.
The holiday season also offers time to try out new recipes, perhaps some you learned while on this travel assignment. Getting lost in making and curating food is the perfect way to get involved in the holiday spirit.
Video Call Your Loved Ones
We understand how much you miss home and the people you cherish this holiday. Perhaps this is the perfect time to use Zoom or FaceTime calls and get in touch with them while you work.
Video calling your loved ones helps reduce the distance. While on calls, you can try activities together, such as exchanging and opening gifts, watching a movie, or storytelling.
Revel in Your Great Work
If you are on a travel assignment or working during the holidays, your profession/work is surely one of utmost importance to people. For instance, as nurses sacrificing your holiday time and experiences may ensure a sick patient is well-taken care of and smiling. Enjoy your work during the holidays and revel in the fact that you are helping others this holiday season.
Make Plans to Celebrate Before or After
Time does not make the holidays as much as experiences do. You can set time to celebrate with loved ones before a travel assignment to motivate you ahead of a working holiday. If you are at a great destination for the travel assignment, you can get your family or friends to visit you after or during the holidays.
Share the Holiday with Patients
Like you, patients in the hospital during the holidays miss being at home celebrating. Making the most out of your working time and creating a holiday spirit within the workplace suits the magic of the holiday season. So, enjoy your day with fellow workmates and patients alike.
Despite being mixed with work, your holiday season is as special as no other. The above tips can help you make your travel assignment a fun working holiday experience. Happy holidays.When you look at me
Like I’m growing thin
Edges of my sloping chin
I walk amidst my fever ghosts
Lost, dark as night.
I feel the crown
Upon my heart
Fuse into my spine
That never woke
A fevered breath
That sounded hoarse as dust.
For when the game
Of morning light
Awakens this lost night
I will address
My dying breath
So delicate an embrace.
Fever
When you look at meAesma and the Red Eyed King
Part 4
Aesma was in such a great rush when she arrived at the battered iron gates of the Crucible that she made a very ungainly landing and sent the whole fortress swaying side to side. She rushed through its dreary halls, thick with the howling of the evil beings imprisoned within, and arrived with great haste at the tiny red-hot cage of the Red Eyed King.
“I’ve come back!” gasped Aesma, out of breath.
“What are you doing?” said the Red-Eyed King, for indeed he saw Aesma was trying to accomplish something that she seemed to greatly struggle with.
“I’m trying to prostrate myself,” said Aesma. It took her the better part of the morning, and even then she could only manage it for five seconds at a time. But in those five seconds she said this: “I promise you that if I become your wife, I will tend to your meals, and darn your clothing, and obey your every command without question. In return, you must be my protector, guide, and counselor, and you must not lift your hand against me in violence.”
The King mulled this offer over, and saw that there were many fine things for him to exploit, for his wicked mind was as twisted as Aesma’s, and he too could bend the world into shapes to his choosing. This was the source of his power.
“I accept,” he said, and his evil red eyes burned every brighter. Aesma could barely contain herself, and jumped for joy, which only sent the entire fortress swaying and shaking more violently. “What should I do, oh husband of mine?” said Aesma. “Let me out of this cage,” said the Red Eyed King. So Aesma struck the cage with all her might, and bent the bars asunder with a shower of sparks. The bars were very hard and white hot, and Aesma was burned quite badly, but Aesma was so love-struck she hardly noticed.
“Ah, I am so weak,” whispered the Red Eyed King as Aesma carried him out of the cage. And Aesma saw that this was true, for the King’s form was charred and pitifully thin from his confinement, so that he could barely stand. She cradled him and fussed over him. “Oh what I can I do for thee, my husband?” she said, desperate for his affection. “Please make for me my favorite meal,” said the Red Eyed King.
“Your favorite meal?” said Aesma, who hadn’t anticipated ever having to actually cook.
“Yes,” said the Red Eyed King, and his eyes flashed with an evil glare. “It is a plum from YISUN’s private garden. I used to eat them all the time when I was free, and I crave their sweetness now. If it is thy wish to be my wife, then that is the succor I crave.”
“Oh, that’s easy!” said Aesma, who was privately very relieved she wouldn’t have to cook, and didn’t give one thought to what the king had asked for. For the plums of YISUN’s garden could grant eternal life, and their juices nourished the flame of the body to an immense, roaring brightness, so that any who ate one would be almost impermeable to harm. Aesma dropped the Red Eyed King with very little ceremony and leapt to it, and very shortly she had returned with a glistening plum from YISUN’s garden, plump and ripe. Normally the garden was guarded by a red ten-antlered buck, who was resolute in his duty, exceedingly calm, and the most powerful fighter in the universe, for the wide trunks of the plum trees were littered with the bones of his foes. But when Aesma had arrived there and asked for a plum to please her husband, the buck had been so taken aback by the notion of Aesma submitting to marriage that he was completely stunned for a whole three seconds, which was more than enough time for Aesma to snatch a plum and leap out.
“Ah, excellent,” said the Red Eyed King, “Now feed it to me, wife.” And Aesma did, bit by bit. And bit by bit, the Red Eyed King fleshed out, and the char and scabs fell away from his flesh, and his wounds sealed, and he grew more and more in stature until he stood three times Aesma’s height. And Aesma saw that he was a tyrant king with night-blue skin and a wild mane of hair like a tangle of shadows, and great fangs and tusks jutting from his black lips. His nails were wicked claws, his arms were like corded iron, and his hands were large so as to easily snap men’s necks. For this reason Aesma fell in love just a little bit more.
“Oh but husband,” said Aesma, blushing and giggling, “You are quite naked.” She was thoroughly enjoying being a wife so far.
“Yes,” boomed the King, and gave a mighty evil laugh. “Wife, attend me!”
“Oh what can I do for thee, my husband?” said Aesma. “Mend my clothing!” commanded the Red Eyed King, “I had one time a hauberk made from the scales of the Ur-serpent that coils beneath the ash of the world. The feathers of the screaming Roc I took for my mantle, my shield was of the tail-hide of the Leviathan that haunts the deep, and my sword was carved from the bone that is found in the heart of a World Tree.” This was all a fantastic lie, of course, for the King had never had such fine or rare clothing. And if he had been girded in such armament, so empowered by the plum he had eaten, the Gods of justice would never have had any hope at all of defeating him in battle. He would have laid such waste to the universe had never been seen before, and burnt it to a cinder, so that his red eyes could lay their baleful gaze on only smoldering ashes. This was his one and true desire, for like Aesma, he was an idiot and did not understand the true nature of Royalty.
Aesma, of course, did not detect his hidden intentions, for she was smitten with love. “At once, my husband!” she said, almost tearful in her joy, and strode off to gather what she could. She was so focused in her matrimonial bliss that she scarcely gave any thought to the monumental scale of the tasks she was accomplishing. First she dug until she found and tugged upon the tail of the mighty Ur-Serpent, whose body was thicker around than a city. Yanking it from the earth, she wrestled with it for three days, during which she bashed enough scales from its body for her purpose. Then she dove into the black and limitless ocean, and swam until she found the leathery and ancient Leviathan of the deep. Aesma was very bad at fighting underwater, and couldn’t hold her breath for very long, so the battle went very poorly for her at first. But very shortly, she became so fed up that she summoned a score of transcendental fist arts and rained such horrific blows upon the water around her that she beat it back for a full day, turning the bottom of the ocean into dry land for a short while. The Leviathan was very slow on land, so Aesma bludgeoned it into unconsciousness and stole it’s tail while it slept.
Next Aesma tracked the Roc, and clung to its back for a full week while it pecked her viciously, but she was able to pluck enough feathers to make a fine mantle. Then she rode her chariot to the edge of the universe, and fought through the howling winds, the scouring cold, and the limitless demons that poured in from the edge of existence there. And after a harrowing journey, she was able to hack out a heart-slice of the fourth World Tree that held up creation using a vorpal shard of void-ice. The tree was mighty enough to withstand its mutilation, and it recovered in time. But until that time it was injured enough to bow, just a little, so for a while an entire corner of the universe sagged quite terribly. This caused great consternation in YISUN’s speaking house and among the multitudes of star-gazers, astronomers, sorcerers, and techno-saints that measured such things, but Aesma was scarcely aware of this. In a fervor, she fled to Koss’s workshop and stole his lesser chisel when he wasn’t looking. Then she crouched over a public hearth for a full week and banged her husband’s armaments into shape.
When Aesma returned, she was truly a terrible sight. Her skin was puckered and swollen from the venom of the world serpent, she was frost burned from her trip to the edge of the world, and she was bitten and punctured all over from her great battle. But she was beaming, for she was still terribly lovesick, and in her arms she had a great hauberk of shimmering dark scales, a glorious feather-mantle, a mighty hide shield, and a white and curved sword carved from the iron-hard heartwood of the world tree.
“Here is your armament, O husband,” she said, out of breath and beaming with joy. “This is a sword that will cut thirty six ways at once!”
The king was greatly pleased at the gullibility of this poor fool, and he donned his impermeable garb.
“Oh what else can I do for thee, my husband?” said Aesma, totally consumed with love.
“I am not thy husband yet,” said the satisfied King. “I think it is time for my return to the surface world. Who are the sorry fools that sent thee?”
“Oh yes, I almost forgot!” said Aesma, prancing about in joy, “Will you return to the Temple of the Disc of the Sun with me and join me in marriage? We can have a massive wedding ceremony and I’ll invite everyone in YISUN’s speaking house to attend. No, everyone in creation! We can have drinking, and dancing, and fighting, and fighting and dancing, and afterwards I can build us a great big house and we can have lots of magnificent and gigantic children!”
“Yes, let us attend this ceremony,” said the King. “Make of thee a beast I can mount and we will be there promptly.” And Aesma did. She turned herself into a massive black beast with wings of the darkling sky and talons the size of a man. And the king sat astride her back and rode her out of the pit, his red eyes flashing the entire way.
Might love be the biggest lie of all? It sure is a shroud that hides lies.
But it also a force that can move mountains, when coupled with Determination.
When alone, Love shackles like a thousand iron chains, dragging one into the deepest abyss. While a lie it may be, Love is a frightening thing. It is much like the Self, in that regard.
It seems the chains of commanding weigh heavily upon the lovely widow Om.
And lovely as she is, beauty earned through the suffering of so many must taste like ashes in one’s mouth…
(Anyone have a time machine? Hyuck hyuck.)
Jokes aside I feel like balls–be they heads, plots or golf balls–are about to roll both on the small and large (possibly even cosmic) scale. Combine Alice-UN’s fan club and the Angelic Asshats… well, this’ll be a party to remember.
I believe this piece of music may be relevant at this point.
And so in a moment of clarity, she saw what she had become, a shadow of herself, a creature of no Semblance to who she was. She saw the city which she had loved as a gleaming gem from which the world would look to in hope, and saw it, black, broken, CORRUPTED. And she saw all of which she had done, all her deeds and evils she committed in the name of good.
She saw the truth for what is was.
And she Wept.
Why, I knew this Queen was a terrible tyrant, but I’m surprised to find that she’s also such a great thespian. There is some truth in this speech, and that is what makes it such a good lie.
The question is, then: to what end is she doing this? Does she wish to sway her by this act of pity? Does she want Allison to learn to discern lies better, to be constantly vigilant? I anxiously await the answer.
She could simply truly be miserable. She was was forced into the life consumption and oppression when she was still a child. She had no control over anything and was used by a tyrant, valued only for her beauty her entire natural life. By the time she finally freed herself and gained control she had already been swallowed by the cycle, corrupted.
Now eons have passed and consumption no longer gives her satisfaction. Without the pleasure she experience in the past, the horrors she inflicts have become clear to her again, yet she can’t change her nature. Every day is agony, all of the atrocities and falseness of her rule consume her. She is aware of her own vileness but is too much a coward to accept death.
Now along comes a young beautiful girl who like herself was ripped from her home and forced into the world of rulers. She sees Allison both as an escape from life, as well as something of a second chance. As what she might have been if she had inherited power while still young herself, before she was twisted into a monster.
At least that is one possibly among a universe of infinites.
I hadn’t considered this angle, but… it does seem strange that Mottom, if she is so appalled at the prospect of showing weakness to the other Demiurges, at the ravages of aging, should willingly appear before them in her hag aspect.
She expresses her power in other ways before the demiurges, for they as her peers are not so easily cowed by mere beauty. She doesn’t hide her age from them because there is no point, and in a way it gives her a brief respite from having to play the beautiful Queen. With the demiurges however, the lack of decorum and grace is how she stays intimidating, insulting the others, blowing up Gog-Agog’s head, all of it is a way of asserting that she is equal to others in power and there is nothing they can do about it. But they are not her friends, and just as she has grown sick of playing the ever-youthful and ever-beautiful Queen for her subjects, she has grown sick of playing Baba Yaga to the other six. Neither role gives her what she wants; love and respect
The Maiden is naive, and weak, and in her naive weakness desirable.
The Matron is stronger, but her strength must be wielded on behalf of those who are her charges, who are an eternal point of vulnerability.
The Crone has drunk so deep of the well of life she tires of its waters, and need serve no god but her own desires. Alone among the feminine Trinity she is free to show contempt without fear of reprisal.
It is quite possible that the shade she casts shows the marks of her years, no matter how often she removes them from her body.
might it be that they would be able to see her true form regardless? They are all equally powerful, and to hide behind a Facade of false youth in front of them might earn their ire for such a lie and show of weakness.
The other six are no fools, they hold no illusions over the relation of power to glory like the common folk do. The mask of youth is one Mottom wears before the populus, but before fellow Royalty it would be an insult not to show her horrid fangs.
Mother Om’s offer offer may be genuine – but that does not mean her reasons are.
Consider the prophecy and Mother Om’s interpretation of it. Consider that Mother Om believes the Heir is Zaid.
Consider that in times of war in human realms, when there is a conscription by lot, the wealthy who are chosen often hire another man to serve in their place, as a substitute.
There has never been a better time to find just such a substitute for one head of the seven-headed beast.
If there is a prophet who is never wrong, the wise – or those who think themselves wise – will attempt to manipulate such prophecies to their advantage.
Clearly our heroine’s only option is to burn it all.
This one agrees. Blaze it all, and inhale the fumes.
This is how one understands the truth to the multiverse.
The red eyed king would approve.
Except the bread. You can’t defile burnt bread. The oven already defiled it first. And it leaves some scarring.
She has many options. She could, for example, grab the broken jewel by the arm and drag her out of that skypalace, to watch it fall to the ground with all of the court still inside. To watch the guilds turn inward and devour themselves. To leave Nadia’s responsibilities behind, crushed under tons of stone or burned by petty tyrants in their petty wars, and take her some place peaceful, where she can count out her remaining days.
I like how you think; such a simple, relatively easy- plan.
I’m sure 6 Juggernaut would be happy to oblige with the burning.
Indeed, that seems to be the plan that Michael and Metatron sent him to enact.
Though what secret purpose of his own he pursues, I cannot say.
Agreed! Fire is perfection of the natural state. This partly is why the sun is so praiseworthy.
In the next chapter, Aesma goes to prom.
Incidentally, “Aesma goes to Prom” is known to be the title of the most disastrously destructive episode of It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia to have ever been produced in the multiverse.
“Days are like water.”
There is no greater friction than time itself. Whatever [GLORY] she had once before, is now tarnished beyond repair, like iron braced against the stream.
This one suggests setting the entire empire ablaze, as burned cities are a good source of farming ash.
For mortals life is suffering therefore the greater life must contain greater suffering, ever more so if it is to be considered glorious. The heroes both tragic and comic are measured against what the hero overcomes. The victim is defined by the suffering that befell and the villain by the tragedies caused. Mortals are destined to decline; could [glory] be [glory] if that decline and fall was not gloriously epic? Even now is not Mother Om truly glorious? I can scarcely imagine how painful her death must be.
I hope Aesma and the Red Eyed King live happily ever after.
Mottom would have you believe such a thing is a fate worse than death.
That foolish king will soon find that even he cannot appease the Master of Want. The honeymoon phase of this relationship will not last.
My sister’s thirst is the stuff of godly legend, and if you don’t give her what she wants, she can simply Divide you from it. Praise YISUN that she has never expressed any interest in my D.
O Lord, have mercy.
O God, have mercy.
O Lord, have mercy on this miserable soul.
Many things may or may not be known about Yisun.
But it is pretty clear, that they did not grant mercy as you would describe it.
Mercy! Mercy!
Show me Mercy! From the powers that be!
Show me Mercy! Can someone rescue me?
Huh. You’re not helping your case, ma’am. If you really want the heroine to take your place, that is.
Oh fuck I pity her.
For all her crimes and misdeeds, Mottom sure expects everyone to go easy on her. That’s a court she gathered herself, and it would be only fitting for her to be devoured by it as it’s final meal.
I think we can look forward to a great spectacle. Aesma’s going to have one hell of a wedding.
YISUN is a consumate liar, and his adherents, more so; to lie also to the self, is most impressive indeed.
As it is written, “All Truth is shown to be Lies, as Lies are the only Truth; all Lies are proven to be Truth, for Truth is the greatest Lie.”
Madness and rage. A mind clouded by many things. Maybe Alice-Un should end this one and move towards her title
I’d dump whole palace,court included into the active vulcano.
Blind your eyes, cut off your nose, perforate your ears and scorch your skin black and painless. Let your body wither, break and rot – all but your gullet. Prize your mouth: it is a merry judge, and the route to true understanding. All who live, eat. All who eat, are eaten.
On the comic page, I’m just going to say, that we may are lying our eyes upon the real Mottom. Finally, after all the masks, it is in front of her husband that she reveals herself.
On Aesma’s story… Well. I don’t remember clearly that old time, but wasn’t there a great war that shook Creation for a month and two dark cycles? My memories of that time are so thin…
How do you remember that? Only the prime angels remember the gods, and your number is much higher than one.
Turns out reincarnation’s addictive.
Terrible as she is, she has never felt truly sated, truly at peace. Her peace will be found, but only in the grave I fear.
Ah, so one can gain an immunity of sorts to the fruits? At first I thought Allison had received just a tiny piece compared to the full bowl Mottom had as it was so effective, and Mottom was simply very very old. Maybe it’s a bit of both, and they only seem to be working less because of her age…
Dust in the wind …
I close my eyes, only for a moment, and the moment’s gone
Does that means that Mottom is not actually immortal, but only kept alive by the blood fruits that work less and less?
Or is everything she says a lie to manipulate Allison?
I am reminded of the sword of Damocles
If only Om had heard the tale sooner, she may have been able to avoid her current predicament.
And as for immortality, I have always believed it to be the cruelest of punishment.
Glory burns brightly, but the fire which burns bright burns hot.
wimp.Hi. As recommended here: I am posting this to this list. I am currently working with buffer in an USB device and pyusb. So when i read from the buffer of endpoint, i get an array.Array() list. I handle this chunk of data with a thread to send a receive the information that i need. In this thread, i load a list with all the information that is read from the USB device, and another layer with pop this information from the threads buffer. The thing i found is that, to pop a variable chunk of data from this buffer without copying it and deleting the elements, i have to pop one element at the time. def get_chunk(self, size): for x in range(size): yield self.recv_buffer.pop() I guess that it would be improved if i can just pop a defined number of elements, like this: pop self.recv_buffer[:-size] or self.recv_buffer.pop(,-size) That would be... "pop from (the last element minus size) to (the last element)" in that way there is only one memory transaction. The new list (or maybe a tuple) points to the old memory address and the recv_buffer is advanced to a one new address. Data is not moved. Note that i like the idea of using "pop" as the "del" operator for lists, but i am concient that this would not be backward compatible. Thanks. DiegoIf you’re a fan of national parks, forests, and BLM recreation areas, you’re in very good company. Over 325-million people visited national parks in 2021. That number is a fraction of the total number of annual campers, climbers, bikers, hikers, and boaters recreating on all federal lands—which include millions of additional acres of wildlife refuges, wetlands, tribal schools, and historic sites. Obviously the maintenance involved in this nation-wide backyard is, in a word, colossal. Yellowstone National Park alone contains nearly 500 miles of roads, 1,000 miles of trail, hundreds of campsites, visitor centers, park buildings, boardwalks, signage… You get the picture. It’s a giant—costly—task tending to our birthright lands properly. Thankfully, the Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA)—passed in August, 2020—was designed to cover the tab for some extensive, much-needed upkeep. It provides the U.S. Department of the Interior with an annual budget of $1.61 billion dollars over the next five years—totaling about $8 billion—to make critical repairs.
Where the Great American Outdoors Act’s money’s being allocated
High among the priorities are big, basic tasks like road, bridge and building repairs, water system overhauls and numerous campground upgrades—as well as conservation projects and further land acquisition. A hundred percent of the money feeds into the National Parks and Public Land Legacy Restoration Fund, with 85 percent spent by Department of the Interior. The remaining 15 percent goes to the U.S. Forest Service, a federal agency within the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The source of the funding comes from energy development revenues, plus royalties from off-shore and natural gas leases.
The importance of passing GAOA last summer was hard to dispute. Public lands need upkeep. People need jobs. The dollars go not only into improving access, enhancing visitor experience, and making travel safer, but also putting local populations to work—often in relatively remote areas hit hard by Covid shutdowns.
“Through the Great American Outdoors Act, we are investing in the American people, and in the future of our public lands and sacred spaces,” says Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland.
The Department of the Interior estimates that in 2021, GAOA investments have to date supported about 19,000 jobs and contributed $2 billion to the nation’s gross domestic product. Thousands of volunteer opportunities are also available to further connect outdoor enthusiasts with the parks and monuments they love.
In addition, GAOA authorizes $900 million a year in permanent funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) which includes dollars for three American Battlefield Protection Program grants—including land acquisition initiatives that enable the protection and preservation of over 28,000 acres of historic American battlefield lands dating back to the Revolutionary War.
The breakdown thus far
Here’s this year’s spending breakdown for GAOA: The National Park Service (NPS) gets $1.33 billion, with $95 million dollars each going to the Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management and Bureau of Indian Education. About 47 percent of the total has been for transportation support, with 30 percent going to buildings and structures, another 16 percent to water and utilities, 4 percent toward recreational assets, and three percent spent on demolition.
This year, GAOA’s NPS outreach included repairs to the intricate stonework beneath the columns of the Jefferson Memorial in Washington, D.C., fortification for the foundations of the Statue of Liberty, and repaving Shenandoah National Park’s scenic Skyline Drive. Bureau of Land Management dollars were spread across the country—including to Spokane, WA’s District Historic Building Stabilization project, New Mexico’s Prehistoric Trackways National Monument roadwork project, and an upgrade for the boat ramp at California’s Pleasant Valley Pit Campground.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service also got in on the deal. A project in the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge went to facility repair and helped to buttress the high-hazard Comanche Dam. At the Seney (MI) National Wildlife Refuge, recreational access was improved, with emphasis on the bridge and Auto Tour Route. Projects at Crab Orchard National Wildlife Refuge (IL) upgraded access and campgrounds, but also repaired the refuge’s three high-hazard dams. Many iconic structures received some badly needed work.
National Park gems like Kentucky’s Mammoth Cave Hotel finally got its new roof, and Oregon’s iconic Timberline Lodge received heat and plumbing upgrades. In Alaska’s Glacier Bay National Park, new concessionaire housing has been erected.
In 2022, rock climbers and tourists alike will see structural work done at Yosemite National Park’s historic Ahwahnee Hotel, a new day lodge at Hurricane Ridge in Washington’s Olympic National Park, and a much-needed remodel for the remote Chisos Mountains Lodge in Texas’ Big Bend National Park.
GAOA also funds land acquisition programs through the Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Park Service. It also provides State Conservation Grants, Outdoor Recreation Legacy Grants, American Battlefield Protection Programs, Endangered Species Conservation grants, and dollars to conserve the Highlands—a wild area in upstate New York.
As of September 22, 2021, roughly $682 million (42 percent) of the Department of the Interior’s funding has been obligated. Translation: there’s still a lot of work to be done—and much money to be spent.
Check out the projects in your own backyard on this DOI list of deferred maintenance projects on the Great American Outdoors Act page .
Better yet, hit the road and pay a welcome visit to some of your favorite national parks, forests, monuments, battlefields and wildlife refuges—or discover new ones at the perfect time. They’re all yours.

Article content
Oh yeah, and she won her heat.
Michelle Jenneke, a 19-year-old Australian hurdler, put on a performance during last week’s IAAF World Junior Championship in Barcelona – but it had nothing to do with her athletic ability.
No, it was her racy – if not sexy – warm-up routine prior to stepping into her blocks.
Before cruising to a win in her 100-metre hurdle heat at the world juniors, multiple cameras caught Jenneke, who hails from Sydney, doing a provocative pre-race dance that sent the world’s social media scene into a frenzy.
A YouTube video posted this week is approaching 2 million clicks as people flock to take in the athlete Australian media outlet Sky News said “set hearts ablaze” this month.
Jenneke failed to qualify for the London Games after coming 5th in the competition’s final heat.

There are people dying, if you care enough for the living, make it a better place for you and for me. – Michael Jackson
A Vietnam veteran shared with me that Jane Fonda was unforgiveable for being in North Vietnam in 1972. The former soldier said that, “Fonda’s traitorous act…went unpunished, most likely because of who she was. I do not hate this woman. I am just disgusted at what she did. We have to make America great again.”
I appreciate that he could separate the person from her supposed actions at one level, but there was no self-reflection nor recognition that he was ordered to fight and kill in an undeclared war in a country who didn’t ask us to be there. He saw it like, “We were obedient to what we were told; we acted in that role; and thus our service is an honor.”
We all know that soldiers are taught and ordered to kill ‘the enemy’, someone they don’t even know on a personal level. They are trained to objectify others and think that it’s permissible because the upper chain of command says it’s their duty and an honor. Those authority figures, often in ‘leadership positions’, make the rules and orders for soldiers and civilians.
And at a certain level, it is somehow agreed upon that it’s acceptable for these orders to continue, either through carrying them out or being complacent in not speaking out, so wars continue. Those who do speak out–the whistleblowers, the protectors, the on-the-scene reporters, the citizens gathering to say ‘no’– are not looked upon in friendly ways by those who are or support the authority figures. If one mishap or mistake happens in reporting, the issue becomes vilified without hearing what fully occurred. And at this point, non-corporate media is called fake and being outlawed.
Interestingly, soon after this conversation with the vet, I had listened to Fonda speak about her involvement in North Vietnam, how it happened, how others perceived her actions, and the courage and process of supporting forgiveness. Of the many stories I’ve listened to of being judged by others without them knowing all the facts, it’s amazing what she was willing to do the work on her own healing and bring that into action in the world.
She courageously gathered Vietnam vets together, so she could actually hold space to listen to their pain, for all to be heard even in their anger and rage, to bring empathy to the forefront, and to be open to all that needed to be said. The authenticity of her story, the emotions I felt from her, were real and truthful, not acted.
I told the vet that I too was in Vietnam during the late 60’s and have a very different perception of why we were there. I still can’t speak to this experience publically, but I did share that I will not allow war mindsets and nationalistic fury to overtake empathy, true service, kindness, care and forgiveness. I expressed that no nation can be great when their heart is dissociated from love.
I didn’t get to this place of awareness in any easy way. I went through a very somatic and emotional experience in 1997 around forgiving my mother (who had been dead for years), someone I hated all my life up until that point. This was before I ever knew about ThetaHealing® Technique. That is when the depth, grace and release into forgiveness would forever change my life.
I experienced an overview of ‘downloaded’ TRUTH about our relationship that roared through my body and mind. I literally sobbed for hours. I think this is what Vianna (founder of ThetaHealing Technique) means by the virtue, ‘grace’, when she says it isn’t easy.
But then release came… fully. I hardly had words to express the freedom I felt. I felt completion in letting her go so we could both walk our own paths. I knew if this could happen through forgiving my mother, it could happen with and for anyone or anything.
When someone does something to us that feels unforgivable, we can experience many reactions—righteousness; harboring heavy feelings (often used as a boundary to protect us) but ends up as depression; express some kind of statement that we’ve been hurt and that another’s actions needs to be changed and be punished; feeling revengeful; or possibly wishing someone (or groups of people) ill will through our thoughts or actions.
We might think, “Why shouldn’t they have a taste of their own medicine?!” We might think that we need to make the other suffer or feel bad through our judgments, anger, hatred, resentment, revenge, internalized shame, and/or grudges, which are often denied. But to carry these feelings, depletes us even if we never see the person again.
Being willing to step into the process of forgiveness is to start the journey to release from someone else’s toxic or hurtful ways, and to look at what they have brought up for us…the ways we may have not forgiven ourselves, which they are reflecting.
What are the ways we might have hurt others due to the way we were hurt, the acting-out or projections?
We can end up as our own worst enemies. Forgiving ourselves is the same process as forgiving others and is essential in spiritual growth. We can exit any interaction, physically, emotionally, and mentally, without carrying these heavy emotions towards others…or against ourselves.
The forgiveness process has a timing piece, a willingness and readiness. It can occur quickly or take time to fully understand what actually happened to forgive. For some people, the later shows up as premature forgiveness or ‘forgiveness bypassing’. This can be due to repressed issues where not all has surfaced from the unconscious memories and is buried with the feelings and beliefs.
So the forgiveness is superficial until the information comes to the conscious mind. But even saying, “I forgive you” to yourself in reference to you or another when the process isn’t complete, is a powerful frequency which helps the disconnection and allows for protection to occur. It sends the heavy energy elsewhere.
And forgiveness is not about forgetting…or we’d lose the awareness. When we don’t journey into forgiveness though, we continue a connection to the other that we most want to be detached from at that time. We are sending our power and energetic chords to them, and we become drained. It works the opposite to what we think as protecting ourselves.
Forgiveness can most readily be best processed in our inner world through the ‘digging’ process. We allow the remembering and then process those emotions and feelings opening up space for expression, to be seen, heard, cared about, shown empathy towards, responded to sacredly…and then cleared by finding what we learned differently from what happened. This is the way to not only heal ourselves individually, but collectively.
Forgiveness doesn’t mean to not speak our truth about what occurred. We can do this through our own release and timing without blaming. We can do it without playing the role of the victim even if we were victimized. We can do it knowing that we have choices in whether to engage again, but this time without the burden and pain that another might have attempted to impose on us. It’s about the freedom to walk unencumbered from the past or current actions.
Forgiveness makes us lighter, healthier, more present in our lives. It readjusts our boundaries to fit our present state of being. Physically, it stops headaches, digestive issues, lowers blood pressure and cholesterol, relaxes muscles, increases oxygen intake. It can clear cancer and other diseases.
It really feels essential to create our lives where we can truly embody deep forgiveness, even clearing ancestral prejudices, which we all have. If we want to make the world a better place, healing and forgiveness supports that empowerment–of bringing the truth of our inner changes to the outer world utilizing courage, inner freedom, bravery, compassion and understanding.
The world is waiting for us. Are you ready?
Wishing each of you recognition of your courage,
Judy

*Everyone is forgivable.

U.S. stocks traded mostly higher Thursday morning, led by technology shares, which took the market south in the previous session after red-hot inflation data sent Treasury yields soaring.
Signs that troubled China real estate group Evergrande has again avoided a default also were credited for improving sentiment on Wall Street.
How are stock-index futures trading?
- The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.23% fell 44 points, or 0.1%, to 36,032.
- The S&P 500 SPX, +0.18% was up 14 points, or 0.3%, at about 4,660.
- The Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.77% gained 130 points, or 0.8%, to around 15,752.
On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 240 points, or 0.7%, while the S&P 500 fell 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite slumped 1.7%.
What’s driving the market?
Stocks looked set stage a modest recovery on Thursday after Wednesday’s tumble was sparked by October consumer prices that surged 0.9%, well above forecast, and annual inflation climbed 6.2%, a more-than-three-decade high. The data ignited fears the Federal Reserve may have to act faster and more aggressively to rein in inflation, with investors fleeing into gold, the dollar and cryptocurrencies.
Hardest hit was the Nasdaq Composite, which saw its worst session since Oct. 4—as its technology and growth-geared stocks are viewed as more sensitive to higher interest rates. Investors were also dealing with a poorly received 30-year government bond auction.
Bond markets are closed for the Veterans Day holiday, but Wednesday saw the 10-year TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.553% and 30-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD30Y, 1.909% yields surge. Gold prices continued to push higher, after the biggest gains since mid-June on Thursday, while the dollar also rose.
The rise in yields marked a bounce from a sharp two-week decline that wasn’t based on fundaments and was, therefore, unlikely to last, said Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research, in a.

A sharp fall for shares of Walt Disney Co. DIS, -7.49% was seen holding back the Dow. Shares of the entertainment conglomerate were down 7.6% after it disappointed on theme park revenue and subscriber numbers for its Disney+ streaming service.
One lift for sentiment appeared to come from China’s property sector. “Chinese equities are up 2% today on the news that the battled real-estate developer Evergrande 3333, +6.75% managed to pay overdue interest on three bonds worth $148 million,” said Saxo Bank’s chief investment officer, Steen Jakobsen, who noted that was also aiding sentiment for U.S. equity futures.
A softer stance from officials there on the sector also helped rally those stocks, said Marios Hadjikyriacos, senior investment analyst at XM, in a note to clients. “Beijing is apparently prepared to relax the rules around how much leverage property developers can take on, allowing distressed companies some breathing room,” he said.

To respond to the growing concerns about the need for university students to learn generic skills to complement their disciplinary expertise, many universities have included General Education (GE) in their curriculum. A new general education framework entitled "General University Requirements" (GUR) was implemented at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) in the 2012/13 academic year. A fiveyear). Both students and teachers perceived the subject contents, teaching and learning methods, and teaching staff in GUR subjects favorably though several challenges were also noted.

The new features can be summarized as follows:
- Display of data about ‘Audience’ and ‘Monthly audience coverage:
- Audience – the number of users belonging to the segment just now
- Monthly audience coverage – This is the percentage of users belonging to the segment compared to the unique users in the siteGroup. The percentage is calculated from the users in the segment and siteGroup for the last 30 days
- Sorting: The segment list can be sorted across all of the columns in the list.
- Filtering: The segment list can be filtered by status, audience coverage, and segment type.
- Labels: We have re-named annotations. The new name is labels
- Segment overview: A new pop-up dialogue box has been implemented. See the picture below. By clicking on a segment name, the details of the segment are shown. New elements include:
- Audience : unique users in segment
- Monthly Audience Coverage : as defined above
For the time being, the segment editor - i.e. edit and creation screen for segments - is still the same as before. We are working on an improvement also here, but the release on July 2nd, 2018 does not include improvements to segment editor.

First up, some general information….
- For the Basic Rundown of Act One of Wild Wild West, go HERE
- For Basic Q&A, go HERE
- For “ADD ME” Requests, go HERE
- For the Main Questline, Go HERE
- For everything Event … HERE HERE HERE
There… links to stuff you need to know. Moving on…
WHEN DO NEIGHBOR VISITS START?
I always like to wait for the game Questline to tell me when to go visit my Neighbors during an Event. This way I know all the items I will be using will be active.
For Wild West Act One, that is Part 7 of the Main Questline. Once Upon a Time in Springfield.
The game will direct you to go drop off some Prospectors to a Neighbor during Part 7… also a good time to start visiting while you are there.
It is also good to check your Neighbor Screen to ensure your Neighbors are showing Clue Counts under them. This is a good sign they started the Event too.
WHAT DO I TAP ON IN A NEIGHBORS TOWN?
Bandits. You can tap on up to 3 Bandits per town. As you are limited to a 30 MAX taps to pay currency every 24hrs, do NOT tap anything else until you hit the MAX. If you tap on something else, like a building, it will still count towards your Daily Tap and you will lose that potential currency.
They try to stay on Roads in towns, so that is the best place to check first to locate them.
WHAT DO I GET FROM THE BANDITS?
Same Currency you will see in the Event. For each Bandit you tap on you will get…
+1
Clue
AND
+4
Hats
OR
+ 8
Pickaxes
OR
+1
Prospector (more Rare)
In short ONE Clue and one other random item.
IS THERE A LIMIT TO BANDIT PAYOUTS?
YES! As noted above and with any Event prior you will be limited on just how many of your Neighbors you can tap on until the Event Currency stops paying out.
For this Event, I found in my games testing that you can have a MAX of 30 Neighbor Actions (or 10 Neighbors). I will test it again today, but 30 seems to be the number.
Once you hit that MAX, any taps on Bandits will just payout coins, XP, FP (if applies). (Side Note: I did not test yet to see if still getting donuts after MAX FP, please comment if you did.)
WHEN CAN I GET PAYOUTS AGAIN?
In 24hrs. The Neighbor Visits reset every 24hrs, so you can begin to collect more Event Currency at that point up to 30 MAX again.
HOW DO I KNOW MY 24HRS ARE UP?
This is something actually set up by YOU. If all your Neighbor towns were to reset to zero (no timer showing in Main Friend Screen under their name), the timer starts as soon as you enter that first one and tap. You will see it start to count down in your Main Neighbor Screen.
So if you are unsure or want to set it so you know, let ALL the towns go to zero and reset, then just use ONE town (like the “Other Springfield”) to be the first one tapped every single day and essentially your “timer” for the 24hrs.
WHAT ABOUT THE DEPUTY CREDENTIALS?
As you are playing the game and going through the Questline, you will see the Deputy Credentials unlock for you to purchase with 90 Donuts, more on it HERE.
WITHOUT the card you’ll earn 1
Clue per Bandit tapped (before you reach MAX).
WITH the Card you’ll earn 2
Clue per Bandit tapped (before you reach MAX).
Per Alissa, she noticed with the card she earned pick axes AND hats from tapping bandits in neighbor’s towns instead of just one or the other randomly without it.
Now for the OTHER element of Neighbor Visits… Prospectors.
HOW DO I GET PROSPECTORS?
To clarify, I will focus on the ones that you can EARN to drop off to a Neighbor’s Town.
As the Bandits appear around towns you can tap on them and clear them to earn 4 variable items. One of those Random Items being a Poster with the Prospector pictured on it.
For every one of these you collect, you gain 1 Prospector to go drop off to a Neighbor.
Don’t confuse Prospectors Pictures with Clues.
Clue
Prospector Picture
WHAT DO I DO WITH THE PROSPECTORS I EARN?
As you will not earn a lot of these, I would suggest to “help” your Neighbors by scattering them around the many that you have. Possibly starting at the front of your list and dropping one off to each as you keep earning them until you reach the end of your list.
This will help both of you benefit from them better. As usual though, up to you on how you distribute them.
HOW DO I DROP OFF A PROSPECTOR?
Just go to any Neighbors town and look in the top Right Corner of the game screen. You will see the Prospector Image Icon with a Number on it. That number is the MAX amount of Prospectors you can drop off to that Neighbor.
If it is Zero, that means their town is already full and you have to wait til they clear some to give them more.
If a Number is there above zero, then just tap on the Icon. The game will take you to a random area of the town where a Prospector will be placed.
SIDE NOTE: These lil buggers are FAST!! They run EVERYWHERE in your town. At times if you wait in one spot a bit, they come to you.
WHAT DO I GET FROM A PROSPECTOR DROPPED IN MY TOWN?
Here is where the Benefit comes in, now with the Prospector in the town… your Neighbor will be alerted (delayed many times) that they have one “stealing their gold” and to go find them. You will see this too if one if dropped in yours.
So if you are able to locate the Prospector(s) in your town and tap on them you have a chance at getting per Prospector…

OR

Pickaxes
WHAT DO I GET IF MY NEIGHBOR TAPS ON MY PROSPECTOR?
This is what I was seeing in return for dropping off Prospectors in my Neighbors and my Neighbor finding them and tapping on them right away.
By your Neighbor clearing the Prospectors, you will have a chance at getting rewarded per Prospector found and tapped…
+12
Hats
OR
+24
Pickaxes
Now your Payout will NOT be the same as what they got in that you won’t get identical Materials.
It is essentially x the amount of Prospectors they cleared. So say they cleared 3 Prospectors, you get 3 payouts. ANY combo of the payouts listed above up til you get 3 total payouts.
For instance, if your Neighbor Cleared 3 Prospectors you can potentially get the Payout of one of the following options.
+12 +12 +12 OR +12 +24 +24 OR +12 +12+ 24 OR +24+24+24.
I dropped of 5 in a Neighbors Town, they cleared them right away and got random payouts. Here were mine in return. (see pic also at top of this section)
+12
Hats
+96
Pickaxes (+24, +24, +24, +24)
Five total Payouts for 5 total Prospectors. Just a mix of 1 Payout per 1 Prospector cleared. Just like theirs will be random what the Prospector pays them. Just like tapping on them in your town gives a random payout.
HOW LONG DO I HAVE TO CLEAR THE PROSPECTORS?
I am still testing this as I am getting mixed results, it is also hard to test with multiple people dropping off and picking up Prospectors while I am testing. I will update once my testing is complete.
From what it seems to look like, if a Neighbor takes too long to clear them out (approx 4hrs), your Neighbor gets nothing but you will still get a reward of…
+8
Hats
OR
+16
Pickaxes
Again, I am still trying to verify this. Feel free to share your results.

To date, I have neither seen the message about prospectors in my town nor have I seen any. I play usually every 4 hours. I also only have 1 person on my friends list that says they drop prospectors in my town regularly…
Feels like EA is punishing Long Time Tappers with a large amount of Neighboreenos and catering to Noobs that hardly have any (tapping three bandits in 10 Neighbor Springfields means visiting a different set of 10 each day – I had up to 60 last year, I’m down to 30 since so many quit) …..
Well, if you’re one of my Neighboreenos, I’ve done my part to ensure there are Bandits to tap, and some Miners to chase (they are impossible to tap when near buildings) ….
Does anyone know if prospectors carry over into act 2?
They should
I started the wild west and earned 1 medal. I clear prospectors and drop them in neighbors towns and I’m still on medal number 1 ?
Well its the 29th and still only 1 medal and no answers here I will check with EA see if it is some type of error.
That means you’re in first place among your friends. There’s a leadership board like for Springfield Heights.
Wait, so your saying if I go to sleep and someone drops off a prospector and I don’t wake up for 6 or 8 hours, then I lose the stuff? That’s just a little crappy. What about those of us that get 8 hours for a normal sleep schedual or have a normal work day, since I can’t check my game during work hours.. hope your wrong this.
It always works that way….in all of the events I’ve ever played in that had this kind of neighbor interaction, the item dropped off by your neighbor has a 4-hour expiration date.
However, one suggestion that Totbox had was to use one of your multi-color spotlight from the Casino event as a code for whether you’re available to tap prospectors (green – your available; yellow – you’re busy (like at work), but might get a chance to check in at least once every 4 hours; red – your’e not available (asleep or whatever)). So, you might want to participate in that!
I must admit I don’t really understand the scoreboard (not like it really matters) but there was a neighbor I had with 48ish medals and No Clues. (I have no clue how that works). …seriously.
Medals are from dropping off and clearing Prospectors
I was wondering about that, too, but it looks like the medal shows your place on the leaderboard, they are not a counter for anything else.
By tapping 4 bandits I think I counted 37 actions gave me hats or pickaxes (I only managed to tap 3 in one neighbour). Still no doughnuts from visiting neighbours 🙁
I have 32 friends and have seen 1 prospector. I play a lot, so I don’t know if I’m just unlucky or have rubbish friends!
They don’t stick around forever so it could be they’re hitting your game when you’re sleeping
I find that, for this game, it’s better to always have the maximum number of friends, for a variety of reasons. You might want to head over to the Add Friends area and get some more! 🙂
Same here! I just assumed it was because my ID starts with R, so it’s further down the list. I made sure to leave prospectors in every one of my neighbors towns (that I could), and I’ve only received one prospector in return.😔 I know how you feel, I have 23 neighbors so I feel like I should have had more than one.
Just remember it’s hard to get 5 or 10 prospectors a day… so to get 100 for 100 friends…. can take a while.
Unfortunately, my friends cant see my town. I asked 3 real friends and they cant see it and so they cant visite it. I can see their town an visite it. I also can see just 98 of my 100 friends. Anyone else with the same bug?
Yes. Lots. Including our Wookiee.
Do you know whether he’s called EA about it? That’s a rather serious problem (in the scope of TSTO problems, that is).
He’s focused on school n work but will eventually. He can see us just fine. We can’t see him
So, sadly, in a way, the giver is penalized if the neighbor doesn’t tap them within 4 hours? Well, there goes trying to help players at the bottom of the ranking list. I always try to give to my neighbors who might be needing help getting all the prizes….started late or whatever. Honestly, I think I probably won’t change how I do it because I’ll get mine with days to spare. But I also know not everyone can be quite as addicted as I am most days, so it kind of sucks to get less of a reward because you give to someone and they don’t clear the prospector fast enough. Hum……
In past events after the timer runs out you still got currency.
Logged in a couple of times to get the Prospectors Cleared! notice saying something like: ‘Unfortunately no-one helped you’ but still giving me some hats &/or pick axes.
So it seems you do get some rewards even if it’s less then if those neighbours had tapped on them…
After a while, you can kind of figure out your friends’ habits. I have friends in Great Britain and Australia who are on a different schedule. Some of my friends are more active tappers on the weekends. Some I think are in school because their habits vary. It’s all good!
I’ve noticed the dirt roads don’t show up in neighbour visits. One of my sons replaced all his roads and I can only see grass when I visit him
Everyone sees it. 😉
Coding is a bit different for neighbors. EA may eventually correct it
Hi! I just want to apologise to my neighbours for not dropping or clearing many prospectors. My internet has been on and off all week … damn you Virgin! I think this will be the first event where I struggle to get the prizes 😭😭 I was so pleased when I woke up this morning and the interent was working, I should on my uni learning network finishing my final assignment that is due on Wednesday, but clearly TSTO is more important …priorities!!!
I just made a Stop (Drop) Light. To let neighbors know when dropping off Prospectors is beneficial or not. Using Lights from the Casino Event I have. Red = Don’t do it at that time (I’m probably sleeping and won’t check in the next 4hrs), Yellow = ok if you want (I’m at work and hopefully catch it within 4hrs. Green = Drop as many as you’d like (I’m home and tapping at least once an hour).
Neighbors are welcome to screen shot it. I still can’t post pictures on here (and it would be a bad thing if I could.. I wouldn’t stop) :p
Looks like I have a neighbor that already understands and is taking advantage of the Green Light 🙂
What a great idea!! Maybe we should all do that! What do you think, gang? Roll call!
Hey Totbox
Giving your suggestion a try…
I get the meaning of red, amber and green but does blue mean you are depressed?
😃😃😃
So that second image is my town but I’m confused why the dirt roads didn’t show up… I have a dirt road moat around the Stop/(off yellow/off green) light. :/
Anyway, the blue light on the Monorail sign seemed to be the best attention getting color for it. That is meant to get neighbors attention to Use and Warp to my Monorail station that I have close to my main roads (Evergreen Terrace). It’s a poor man’s teleporter :p
Also interesting to about the picture is that I don’t have the nightmare pile and Bart is seen in costume (kinda glad I didn’t waste the donuts on it) 🙂
I’ve been seeing quite a few comments from people saying dirt roads etc don’t show up when neighbours visit – but sounds like there are a couple of other items not related to the event that also ‘vanish’…
If EA don’t fix this soon we’ll have to wait for the WW Showoff to see what our neighbours have actually done with their designs
😄😄😄
ps – I hope you changed the dirt road around your Stop sign/lights to water because that’s what is there this morning when I popped in to check…
I think this is a great idea. I was trying for a similar thing during Tap Ball with the stadium lights but it didn’t work because neighbors couldn’t see it. Apparently now we can all see this same spotlight, the way our neighbors intend it. I’ve wanted exactly this kind of signal (during timed events) as I’m usually going to work when most (Americans) are getting off from their jobs. I’m unable to check in at all during that time. Let’s reiterate during open thread (when I’ll also be gone to a festival) Cheers Totbox- well thought out! 😀
A few neighbor-related questions, mostly because I’m curious. I apologize if these have been answered elsewhere, but I haven’t found the answers.
1) I’m confused by, “our Neighbor will be alerted (delayed many times) that they have one ‘stealing their gold’ and to go find them. You will see this too if one if dropped in yours.” Does this mean that I am supposed to get a message before a prospector appears in my town? I haven’t seen any such message even though I’ve been clearing prospectors from neighbors.
2) Is the number of bandits I see in my town the same as the number of bandits my neighbors see? If I clear them all, will my neighbors have bandits to tap? Or should I leave a few for my neighbors, like I would with buildings?
3) More generally, are the character jobs I see in my neighbors’ towns the same as the character jobs my neighbor’s had put their characters on? Sometimes it seems like all the characters are outside in my neighbors’ towns, but I don’t know if that’s because my neighbors picked those jobs.
4) Similarly, the locations of the characters in town can’t be the same as what my neighbors see, can it? The characters in my neighbors’ towns often seem bunched in a particular part of town.
1. Varies. You can customize your game settings and and your device settings to allow or not allow notifications from the app. That setting will impact if you see them or not.
2. What you see and what they see will always be different as far as bandits. No worries. You could have zero, but they’ll still be able to get there 3 regardless.
3. Again…varies. At times EA will code the neighbors view in your town to”show off” Characters and buildings. Kind of “free advertising” if you will. A way to make YOU want that item and possibly use donuts to get it.
4. See above. 🙂
Thanks for the information! I like knowing more about how the game works…
I think if your neighbor has set their character on a specific visual task, then that’s what you will see. I’m guessing that when you see them all clustered together is because they were all on a joint task in the same building (which they exit from when you visit, if you scroll there in time you can actually see this happening) in that case, you’ll see them doing random things assigned by an algorithm.
I’ll sometimes stage things for my Neighbor-eeno’s enjoyment. On open thread I might invite them over for a picnic at my Stonecutters compound. Right now I know neighbors are directed to my frontier town, so I’m animating the nearby militia that I created during the Malheur stand-off.
What’s the deal with the red medals ( beside the clues underneath the friends name) it doesn’t correspond with anything that I can find, and it doesn’t match up with the red medals on the leaderboard for wild west.
Leaderboard. Sorry I didn’t out it in the post as there’s really nothing to them of value. Just competition between neighbors. They change constantly and update so at times number above may not match full list in medal icon (the red medal tab) below.
Thanks Bunny, it’s clear now.
I assumed those were hoisting how many prospectors your neighbors have to give. I doubt they’re leaderboard points because they are degrees of magnitude off from the leaderboard listings.
A question about visiting neighbours
When I hit the neighbour button and it is listing hem all, underneath (as usual) is their clue count. There is something else that Is a mystery to me. Appears to be a medal with a pick axe on it.
Anyone know what it is?
Leaderboard. Sorry I didn’t out it in the post as there’s really nothing to them of value. Just competition between neighbors. They change constantly and update so at times number above may not match full list in medal icon (the red medal tab) below.
You can tap four bandits per neighbor if you get the last two bandits in close succession.
I’ve gotten up to 5.
I hope I can still remember this tomorrow night, when it’s neighbor tapping time again! 🙂
I’m thinking that it won’t help in terms of event currency, since 30 taps is 30 taps, regardless of where you get them, but I guess it’ll add to the $$ and XP (and maybe donuts?) one can earn.
Not true…although the bottom still says “10 pts for the next XXX taps” (i forget the exact wording), I paid attention when tapping this morning; the ‘extra’ taps still increase your $$ & event currency, but doesn’t affect that “10pts for the next XX actions” notification. So if I manage 5 taps in Town 1, when I get to Town 2 it still says “…for the next 27 actions” vs “25 actions”. So if you’re quick, you can get extra currency, both in-game & event. 😀
How do the bandit hideouts work? Do they just come along every couple of hours?
Yup…every 4hrs I believe…
If you tap on the Simpson, Flanders’ houses or whatever hideout you’ve unlocked it tells you how long until the next batch and it is four hours
Given that I have been unable to visit any neighbor without crashing (yes, I contacted EA, it’s a ‘known issue’) this is all kind of moot.
Any idea when this will be fixed? I want to continue on and I can’t get past the neighbor quest!! 😢
Is anyone else getting severe bottlenecks in their general store trades? I feel like I’m not getting any pick axe trades
I think it goes in cycles, like the rail yard tasks. At the beginning, it wanted almost all hats, so I was only making hats for the first couple of days and had a ton of pick axes stored up. But now it’s swung over to pick axes and my characters are working on getting those, instead.
Thanks for all this info. However neighbour actions still seem to be all over the place and not what I would have expected from previous events.
Since it appears to have settled down, I’m now getting event currency from my first 30 neighbour actions, but ONLY event currency. In previous events I was also getting $ and XP from these actions.
After my first 30 neighbour actions I’m getting $ and XP but the “payout” has changed. Before the event each neighbour action was worth $183 and 2XP. Now I’m getting $105 and 11XP. Nothing else has changed – I hit level 59 a earlier this year and have been on the max friendship level for a lot longer. Has anyone else noticed new neighbour action payouts since the Wild West Event hit?
Finally I’ve not had a single neighbour donut since before Tuesday’s update. Has the rogue FP messed with the ability to earn donuts from neighbour actions?
Once again many thanks for all the hard work you addicts put into this site. Without you I’d be even more lost!
The rogue FP issue has ended, and people are reporting receiving donuts
Thanks Alissa. What about the changed $ and XP payouts for neighbour actions and the fact that the first 30 give event currency only? Is that right. Are others reporting the same?
Has your bonus % for conform changed. If you just hit a new level that means that your requirements increased. You will require more points to hit the stars like if you went from 167% to 153%… you’ll notice it on ALL payouts.
Thanks Bunny. However my bonus % hasn’t changed since the event hit, and I’ve been on 5 stars and level 59 for several months now so I don’t think that’s the reason. The strange thing is that the $ payout went down from $183 to $105 while the XP went up from 2 to 11.
I’ve been signed out of my game by EA, and now it won’t accept my password to sign back in. WTH?
Try EA’s website. See if your password got changed. You can also reset it there…: Region Hannover/Schaumburg

As we continue to make adjustments in preparation for the upcoming 2021-2022 school year, please be advised that dates, as well as the process itself, may be adjusted due to the ongoing Covid-19 situation.

We appreciate your patience, understanding and flexibility.
Start of school information and instructions will be emailed to all currently registered families in mid-August. This will include dates and adjusted processes for the “new classroom” meet-and-greet, as well as information regarding the first day of school (Tuesday, September 7). If your child is currently on the waitlist for a classroom and has not yet been offered a spot, please feel free to reach out to jamie@happinesshill.org to inquire about any waitlist movement. We will continue to add students from the waitlist, as space allows, through January, 2022.
Current and Returning Families: Reregistration for the 2022/2023 school year will take place in February, 2022. (Specific dates to be determined.)

The platter sits more-or-less flush with the surface, where credit-card plastic pads work fine. Thinner platters may require compliant padding.
The solid model has locating pips at ±50 mm from the center and airspace below the platter for the drill bit:
The 1.16 inch hole spacing matches the Sherline’s tooling plate. The center hole seemed like a Good Idea, although it has no purpose right now.
The OpenSCAD source code is the same as before; just set
Layout = PlatterFixture; and it’ll produce the right thing.

Instead of a hole, one option would be to print a square projection about 1/4″ high that you could use an edge finder on to find the centerline of the platter when setting up the job.
I just jog around until the laser spot vanishes in a locating hole and get Close Enough in XY for what I need, although I like the idea of a definite edge in a visible location. A recessed square, rather than a projecting stud, seems less likely to attract errant tools.
My first pass at the locating holes turned out entirely too small: a 1 mm pit faded right into the top infill pattern!When you’re headed out to dinner with someone new and your pants rip getting out of the car, not even your emergency sewing kit is going to help you if you don’t have time to sew. Don’t stand up your date when you can just pull out your handheld sewing machine and patch it up in a few minutes. It’s great for travel or just to keep handy in case of any unexpected wardrobe malfunctions.

Not too long ago, my grandmother’s green thumb and love for a garden made our home a beautiful space. This garden has undergone several changes over the years – from a flowering paradise to a lawn to a wild area to a veggie patch and is finally home to a fish shaped fish pond now. But throughout its various avatars, honge, avocado, sampige, neem and coconut have silently stood on guard and become huge shade providing trees over the years.
Here I’ve got to mention that the 2 coconut trees we have were brought over from Chickmagalur (my grandmother’s hometown) by my great-grandfather and planted in the 1960’s. It’s yield is so bountiful that we have not bought a coconut ever. To celebrate the long awaited birth of my cousins 21 years ago, we planted an avocado tree. It is an absolutely massive tree and within 6-7 years of planting, it started giving us fruit – the usual shaped avocados that we see in the market. But from 2010 onwards it started giving us humongous avocados (each weighing in at 1 kilogram) which left us wondering what shot of growth hormone had been given!! The growth hormone was none other than our composting pile, which is less than 3 feet away from the base of the avocado tree. Naturally the tree roots picked up booster doses of all the nutrients and just got fabulous. For about 5 years in a row we got nearly 100 avocados per season!!
So I grew up surrounded by greenery that I had to do nothing to take care of and realised this only when I moved to my in-laws house where we did not have a garden. As there were so many adjustments and changes happening in that first year of married life, I didn’t realise that I was missing out on having a garden. But in our second year, my husband and I decided to give it a try and have a veggie patch. So my mother brought across various vegetable saplings from her garden and we set it up in our terrace space. We were not regular with watering the plants and found that we did not spend any time in the terrace because of a resident rat that we were terrified of. So you can imagine what happened – the plants did not survive and we felt horrible that we had killed them all.
I was so traumatised by that experience that I decided that we were not going to bring in any plants, until we were more capable of taking care of them – after all, they are living and breathing entities.
Fast forward to the summer of 2019. We had built on an additional space in my in-law’s house which made the terrace feel like a part of the house rather than a godforsaken space. While two solar panels dominated the space, plans to put in a few pots starred in my dreams. So I decided to reach out to a friend – Vandana – who runs UrbanMali – an enterprise that does urban gardening and more importantly they source native varieties of plants. Vandana suggested putting in a few hanging pots on the grill on our terrace along with a few ground pots. She also gave us the idea of having indoor plants. June 11, 2019 was a turning point for me as this was the day that the UrbanMali team came home and put in all the plants. My husband and I were proud owners of nearly 25 plants (both indoor and outdoor). We decided that we would start small and slowly increase the number after we proved to ourselves that we could keep these alive. We started watering them regularly and the ones on the terrace thrived.
However the indoor ones were clearly struggling and I couldn’t believe that we were going to kill another batch of plants!!! Several SOS’s to Vandana and reaching out to other gardening friends, helped me understand that the care the indoor plants needed is vastly different from the outdoor ones. Despite having grown up around greenery, I had never been wholly responsible for a plant and was a novice at this.
By the end of 1 month, my husband and I were very happy to note that we had killed only 2 plants out of the 25. By October 2019, the remaining plants had thrived and some even had baby plants. I was so thrilled – I bought more pots and started taking cuttings from the existing plants and potting them. We decided not to buy any more plants at that point but expand our garden from cuttings from my parental home garden and my aunt’s garden. All the cuttings rooted and we had nearly 40 plants.
In November we decided to be a little more adventurous and bought succulents. I foraged through our houses and found really cute cups, vessels, items that could be used to house the succulents. I studied up on the watering, nutrition and general needs of succulents (there were such differing opinions that I came across) and put all my learnings to the test. Which I failed miserably. The new year did not bring good news with regard to our succulents. Nearly 60% of them had not survived. Thankfully the remaining are continuing to do well – obviously they are the hardier variety.
We had been gifted an outdoor table with 2 chairs by a cousin of my husband’s on our wedding and had not used it for a long time. However during the lockdown in April 2020, I started to spend lots of time out in our small garden and we put the table and chairs into use. I sat out with my reading, embroidery and spent hours dreaming of the potential of our garden space if the solar panels were moved to another part of the roof. I didn’t have to wait long and by mid-August, the solar panels had been shifted and suddenly there was double the space to grow more greenery. It was so exciting!!!
My husband and I had grand plans of having one area as a herb patch, another as a veggie patch, then a flowering area, etc. I’m glad we came to our senses and realised that going simpler is still the way to go for us. So we decided to go ahead with hardy flowering plants and greenery. The UrbanMali team came back in the first week of September and put in a whole bunch of plants and creepers.
The timing of all of these projects could not have been better. We fell ill with covid just then and were quarantined at home. The terrace garden became my second home – I spent hours outside, soaking in the sun and enjoying the greenery. It was truly a solace for my weak body and tired mind. I started noticing all the various colours in our garden and spent my convalescence taking pictures of the plants, collating them by colour, etc and sending it out to friends and family. That’s when I realised that we have nearly 150 pots in our terrace and about 60 indoor plants!!! I’m amazed at how quickly our collection (and confidence) has grown. It has only been 16 months since we re-started our garden and we have over 200 plants. My family remarked that my grandmother’s green thumb has also been passed onto me, though it took some time to show up.
I’m sitting out in our garden as I’m writing this piece, with the early morning sun shining, birds chirping, a few butterflies flitting around and feeling an amazing sense of peace and contentment. I’m thrilled that after all the trials and tribulations, our garden story has such a beautiful happily ever after ending. Here’s hoping that all of you also take the plunge into growing some greenery – no matter how small a space you have.Derry Waters

How Dead is this Game?
(1/5) > >>
Clamp360:
So, I've been playing this since like 2012 casually on and off and it's been a really good time; it breaks my heart to come on here and see that the game seems to have died. I mean I'm not surprised, given its age and the circumstances surrounding its development it realistically should have died years ago, but there is still something disappointing about the fact that we'll probably never complete every medal and challenge. Anyways, I suppose my question is even if the forums aren't active anymore, how many of you guys still play the game? Are you playing casually or still going for those insane achievements? Personally I never grinded too hard or got too good, and my proudest achievement is just beating the game on UV.
thelaptop:
I won't call it dead because there are still folks who are playing it. But I will call it dead from a "new features/bug fix" angle.
I've been here since 2009. Life grinds on, and with it, priorities. The day that Kornel decided to launch the Kickstarter for Jupiter Hell is the day that DRL fades quietly into the background, partly because of the development time needed to get Jupiter Hell on the road, and partly because by declaring that project on Kickstarter (with references to DRL), it is a very public statement that would (and did) incur the C&D request of using the old name.
DRL is open source now, which means that folks can compile their own version and do the necessary bug fixes/development. But in many ways, it is a hot potato situation from the IP perspective; yes, the name is changed to not overtly reference and potentially mislead the provenance of the game, but there are still many entities and objects that are heavily referencing the source material that are just time bombs in disguise. Because of that, I believe that it is hard for anyone to take up the mantle to further develop on DRL.
That aside, the code base is old. We're talking Pascal levels of old. I can program in Pascal, and probably a few others who are around my age group. But most developers are more into C++, Java, C#, Python, JavaScript and other fun stuff. You might say, "but the game is mostly in Lua!"; yes, but some of the bugs are in the Pascal code itself, and it is not exactly obvious how to fix it. Old code eventually reaches a point where it is hard to maintain, especially when there is no champion for it.
As for whether DRL is still played by me, it's a hard and sad answer to say, not as much, inasmuch as I am still the Chaos Fanatic!. Remember what I said about how life grinds on, and priorities change? Yeah... that.
Also at this stage, my personal opinion is that more focus is/should be placed on Jupiter Hell to ensure that it is successful enough to keep ChaosForge going. It's a lot of eggs in one basket, but it is the choice of Kornel, and I believe most of us are trying to help him there. As such, I think much of the effort of playing/testing is on JH than DRL.
Except Tormuse. He's nuts (in a good way) and is always trying to win every dang medal/badge/achievement he can get. I can't even remember what he hasn't gotten at this point. =)
Clamp360:
Yeah, I appreciate the response. The game's development is absolutely dead, I was more wondering about the community. I hope people like Tormuse prevail in their endless quest for 100%, It would be a damn shame otherwise.
thelaptop:
Community-wise, ever since JH became a thing, most people started talking more about that on the Steam forums, which I am not a big participant of.
There used to be an IRC, but it was abandoned in favour of Discord.
All in all, I think in many ways, the community has "moved on with the times".
It's sad for sure, but well... it is the way it is.
I will keep lurking here though. Steam forums are terrible to work with, in my opinion. XD
Tormuse:

--- End quote ---
Heh, I was never going to get 100%. I'm just not good enough to avoid taking damage 100% of the time to get the badges that require it. (I mean maybe, theoretically, I could, but it would take more time and patience than I have) Besides... not that I do this for the fame or anything, but the fact that there's less interest in the game than there used to does dampen my enthusiasm for it a bit. There just doesn't seem to be any demand for me to keep pushing on to get 100%, so it's hard to keep that motivation to keep going, especially after all these years. I'm pretty pleased with my Everyman Angelic game, (and especially pleased that I recorded it!) :) but even that didn't get a heck of a lot of attention by the time I accomplished it, so it's probably just as well that I leave off on that high note. :)
Anyway, like Thelaptop said, people have just moved on to other things. (Especially Jupiter Hell) I actually haven't played DRL in a while, but I've played a fair bit of JH. (And got a few of the Diamond badges!) :D

Translators, lawyers, doctors and journalists, while still being paid for their specialized, creative and knowledgeable work, can make valuable use of the vast amount of information available, out of which special bits can be retrieved in just a few seconds using search functions.
In both consecutive and simultaneous interpreting, however, the act of retrieving information is still hampered by the fact that interpreting requires quite a big portion of — if not all — the interpreter’s attention. Looking up a term is not as trivial as it is when translating, writing proceedings or talking to a patient. So the profession of interpretation has probably not been affected as profoundly as others by digitization, at least not in its core activity. With an ever-increasing specialization of the events or meetings to be interpreted (anything less technical than the substances used for pest-protection in Indonesian rice production can nowadays easily be sorted out relying on everybody’s school English), interpreters, to a great extent, are still forced to rely on their memory. The preparatory work of a conference interpreter, however — which accounts for about half the working time — has changed dramatically.
With all that in mind, I am all the more intrigued by the concept of “digital dementia,” coined by the German neurologist Manfred Spitzer in his 2012 book, Digitale Demenz. I really enjoyed reading his The Mind within the Net back in 1999, so I was all the more keen on reading about digital dementia. Was it really true that, thanks to digitalization, not only are we forced to accumulate ever more specialized knowledge in ever-shorter timespans, but we concurrently suffer from shorter memory spans and decreasing memory capacity due to the constant distractions of the digital world?
A common criticism about digitalization is that people are becoming antisocial in the real world due to constantly being immersed in the virtual one. However, the same complaint has arisen for a long time against people being hidden behind their newspapers during breakfast. And now, with people reading the newspaper on a tablet computer or mobile phone, at least their faces remain visible. The same goes for interpreters in the booth staring at their mobile phones or tablets, apparently disconnecting from the world they are working in. In reality, they could be busy looking up a certain regulation relevant to the conference.
And what is more, the effect of seeing or perceiving something in real life can hardly be imitated in writing, but a well-made video or animation in many cases comes much closer than a written text. For example, the abstract character of a written text describing the functioning of a waste sorting facility is nothing like visiting the plant you have been reading so much about — and virtual tours are almost as good.
The downside of all this is the sheer amount of data made available every day and the impossibility of reading it all increases the possibility of distraction and addiction. But while the dangers of digital media seem to be higher than those of paper media, the potential opportunities of digital media are all the higher if being used the right way. In Spitzer’s 2012 book, there is some evidence as to how we as conference interpreters may possibly make optimum use of the potential of digital media.
In Digitale Demenz, Spitzer explains that when it comes to remembering information, there is nothing like direct social contact; discussing things with other people leads to deep and emotional processing difficult to emulate elsewhere. In other words, information can be remembered better in the long run if it’s been discussed with another human being. Digital resources such as Wikipedia and well-made company websites allow us to search for exactly the piece of information in exactly the moment we need it most — and not many weeks later in one of those interpreting follow-up sessions we all feel are so important but are still less motivating. Looking up stuff in the booth is great, but talking it through with your booth mate makes it even better, which is something interpreters tend to naturally do without anybody having told them it enhances their memory performance.
Handwriting and notes
Whenever you talk with conference interpreters about note-taking during the preparation process, at least one in ten will most probably tell you that they just remember things better if they write them down using pen and paper. The explanation goes roughly like this: “The words just travel through the pen up my arm, entering directly into my brain.” Spitzer explains that most probably this works when you’re learning how to write letters as a child, allowing the picture of the letters to be mapped in your brain with the trace of the pen. But this does not necessarily hold true for whole words, sentences and their content. Additionally, interpreters need to be able to pronounce, not to spell, deoxyribonucleic acid, and computers have speech output that can be very helpful in this.
So while there seems to be no harm in remaining paper-only, if you feel you don’t absolutely need the safety of a pen in your hand, you are not necessarily missing something vital and may well happily indulge in the manifold amenities paperless offices have to offer, such as searching documents and sorting glossaries alphabetically, sharing information with colleagues or simply avoiding excessive use of paper and having access to your documents any place, any time.
Note-taking is one thing when you’re preparing for an assignment and noting down mainly terminological information and conceptual information. Note-taking in consecutive interpreting is another thing. Interpreters’ notes are designed exactly for encoding conceptual relations. There is a very recent study conducted by a team of researchers in the United States (Pam A. Mueller from Princeton University and Daniel M. Oppenheimer from the University of California, Los Angeles) about the question of whether the instrument of note-taking (pen vs. keyboard) influences learning, which gives us some interesting insight. Students who had taken notes of a lecture using pen and paper performed better in answering conceptual questions than those who had taken notes using a laptop computer. Even though typing has the advantage that more information can be captured, which in itself is beneficial to learning, the downside — potentially outweighing this advantage — is that when typing, people tend to transcribe verbatim instead of synthesizing the content, even when being told to avoid verbatim transcription. This in turn leads to shallower processing and impairs conceptual learning. But, interestingly, what goes for conceptual learning does not necessarily apply to other types of knowledge. For factual knowledge, the advantage pen-users showed over keyboard-users only occurred when a week had elapsed between the lecture and the test. In immediate testing, there was no difference in performance of pen vs. keyboard users.
So I can still use my laptop computer while interpreting (simultaneously or consecutively) in order to note down some numbers, names or terms, be it for myself or for my colleague, while I rely on my brain for the rest of the job. But for “real” consecutive interpreting, pen and paper (or touchscreen!) plus strong note-taking skills are the method of choice.
One interesting thing Spitzer points out (and leads directly to the fact that Google makes us dumb) is the fact that our brains tend to forget the information we have written down for the mere fact that it knows it has been saved somewhere. All it can be bothered to remember is the place you keep the information. It is like those things to do that don’t let us sleep unless we write them down, or the name of a person you couldn’t think of and then it occurs to you three days later (your brain having searched for it in the background).
But what do we learn from this? Stop writing down things? No more terminology management, no note-taking at all? I’d say no; for one thing, this is the way our brain works, and how many facts and terms about beer brewery can you possibly squeeze into your head in a working day and have them available even under the strains of simultaneous interpreting or of having to take notes and remembering a speech?
This is where another active principle of learning, also mentioned in Spitzer’s book, comes in. Active thinking increases retention compared to mere reading. While we are not very likely to stop writing down things we want to remember, we may well improve our memory by making sure that we not only read the list of the most important terms of biological waste treatment but actively learn and pronounce them (possibly with digital assistance in the form of a program or app such as Anki), or try to actively explain the way a wind separator works to someone else and not just read about it passively.
Adults and children
learn differently
A big part of Spitzer’s book is dedicated to the effects digitalization has on children. He explains that in children’s minds, new structures are created when they learn, while adults integrate new information into existing structures. The more aspects of a given subject that are considered, the more points of connection there are to our mental structures. Furthermore, it is crucial to follow the hermeneutic circle (you understand a whole text by understanding the details and vice versa) in order to create profound knowledge structures.
In practice, if you limit your preparation and related online search activities in an unknown subject to checking vocabulary, you will remain on a shallow level of processing and not be able to integrate some loose pieces of information into the whole knowledge system. If you have no idea of balance sheets and just check equivalents for a list of words like contribution margin, breakeven point and accruals and deferrals, you are very likely to forget the words. However, once you have familiarized yourself with a given subject, punctually looking up a term, be it on the internet or in your own database, it will easily find its place in the big mental picture.
While the internet may encourage shallow information processing due to the abundance of information available, for those seeking deep conceptual information it has much more to offer than books. Apart from mere text and pictures, it provides links and relations, context and illustrative videos that come much closer to real-life experience than a book. So most internet resources, by their very nature, are more liable to generate good understanding than a plain dictionary, where brain comes after braid and before braise.
Although digitalization increases the pressure on interpreters’ knowledge acquisition, it also provides the instruments to cope with it. It may not do so as obviously as it does in other professions. But indirectly, there are many ways of harnessing digitalization to foster our mental resources and not let them decay. If we keep talking about things, challenging our memories and seeing the big picture, computers will help us a great deal while we are doing the real thing — thinking, understanding and learning by ourselves.Benoit Jurion

*1/2 Étienne Charry 36 ERREURS (Kindercore)
Free for the moment
from soundtracking French animation films and commercials, Étienne
Charry has opted to express himself on his own full-length by adhering to the
same abbreviated structure that characterizes his other compositional callings.
So these 36 cutesy whatchamacallits average 1:47 and add up to the latest
advertisement for hip from the continent (the French apparently still feel they
have a lot to prove). The tracks command a generous sonic spectrum, with
surf-guitar runs, hebephrenic sing-alongs, and just enough lo-fi to fool
listeners into taking them as something deeper than kitschy kicks.
Charry thinks he's being modest when he calls these numbers erreurs
("errors") -- as he puts it in the liner notes, "I know it doesn't conform to
today's market." But when he admits that "the songs could have lasted longer
but I was afraid of taking up your time," he doesn't realize that slamming each
one into the next to create one 53-minute station break is not just taking up
our time but wasting it. The impression that remains is of a cumulatively
annoying and self-satisfied whole. Which may suit hipsters just fine -- no use
in being moved by individual song forms. The rest of us will wait for a cooler
friend to wow us by tagging one of these tatters onto the end of a mix tape. -- Kevin John
*** Departure Lounge OUT OF THERE (Flydaddy)
"No more pressure, no
more pain/I want to feel like I'm alive again, older and wiser/Musical for
pleasure," sings Tim Keegan in "Music for Pleasure," Out of There's
opening number. His sweet resonant voice has an undertow of weary mournfulness,
suggesting that music as fun is a concept he's inadvertently lost.
Formed from the loose collective the Homer Lounge, which guitarist and frontman
Keegan (Robin Hitchcock's sideman and collaborator and a one-time Blue
Aeroplanes member) put together in 1998, Departure Lounge create delicately
psychedelic indie pop. Covering Kirsty MacColl's sugar-pop ode "They Don't
Know," they slow the pace to a tiptoe and strip the song down to an ethereal
wisp. They ditch feyness and polite introspection with a strung-out version of
the Homer Lounge clubland single "Disconnected" that's remixed by French DJ Kid
Loco; they get more electronically experimental with the tattered and nervy
"Starport," which is graced by keyboard player and multi-instrumentalist Chris
Anderson's plaintive oboe. Out of There acknowledges life's sadness
without losing sight of the hope and the glory. -- Linda Laban
*** Janis Ian GOD AND THE FBI (Windham Hill)
Ian was winning Grammys
with her combination of folk, country, and popular music before most of today's
"chick singers" were born. Thirteen years ago, she relocated to Nashville, an
unexpected move for a cerebral Jewish lesbian from New York with an FBI dossier
five inches thick, but it proved to be productive. Ian's been writing
mainstream country tunes of late, and her coming-out album, Breaking
Silence, produced unexpected hits for other artists -- "What About Love"
for Amy Grant and "Some People's Lives" for Bette Midler.
God and the FBI, her 17th recording, is packed with a dark humor that
she's seldom exhibited before. The funky title track, which could be a club hit
with a slight remix, details her life under the microscope of the FBI. Her sin?
Parents who had African-American friends, which was considered subversive in
the 1950s. There's also "Memphis," a love letter to Southern living delivered
as a duet with Willie Nelson, and the Dixie-fried grit of "Joline" (not the

**1/2 k.d. Lang INVINCIBLE SUMMER (Warner Bros.)
In concert, k.d. lang
sometimes introduces "Constant Craving" by saying, "Now I'd like to sing a
medley of my hit," ruefully acknowledging that such recent albums as the
neurotic All You Can Eat and the nicophilic cover set Drag
weren't the stuff of radio programmers' dreams. At times, her first album of
original material in five years seems a concerted effort to rectify this
situation. "The Consequences of Falling" is Ingenue redux, from its
atmosphere of might-be-requited longing to the opening phoneme of its hook. But
the centerpieces are two singles-in-waiting that comb beaches from Malibu to
Bahia for sun-dappled sounds. "Summerfling" opens with Surfaris-style drumming,
touches on bossa nova and Greek-restaurant music, then lands on a brief chorus
of vocal interplay à la "Good Vibrations." The slighter "It's Happening
with You," with its cheesy organ and classic disco strings, splits the
difference between '60s and '90s discothèquerie.
If its other songs placed lang's voice in such playful settings, Invincible
Summer might live up to its name. But on the album's mostly mid-tempo
second half, producer/William Orbit henchman Damaian Le Gassick grafts Ray
of Light-lite electroburbles onto the singer's customary strings and pedal
steels -- a compromise that will please neither classicists nor trip-hoppers.
Lang herself contributes to the overload with lugubrious, love-positive lyrics
that find her either overwhelmed by bliss ("Pull me under, eternal wave") or
addled into flaky philosophizing ("To know of love, sacrifice/Is a truth of
living life"). The best moments of Invincible Summer are buoyant, but
too many of these drowned-torch songs sound merely waterlogged. -- Franklin Bruno
*** Kottonmouth Kings HIGH SOCIETY (Capitol)
Orange County's
Kottonmouth Kings are six suburban white boys doing hip-hop, but on the group's
second disc their race is a conspicuous non-issue. That's because with these
guys, smoking pot is the only issue. They get more mileage out of the subject
than most: "Coffee Shop" is a love letter to Amsterdam; "King's Blend" and
"Size of an Ant" are aural fantasies about, respectively, winning the Cannabis
Cup and living inside a marijuana plant. The group's beatmaster, Brad Daddy X,
is adept at laying down sleek, mechanized grooves that borrow from early-'90s
G-funk while evoking the alternating bliss and paranoia of pot smoking.
The highlights here are party anthems like "First Class" and "Good As Gold,"
but the Kings also show an activist streak on the utopian "Peace Not Greed,"
which features a shouted guest vocal from TSOL frontman Jack Grisham. Their
finest MC, Jonny Richter, stands out on the narrative "The Lottery," the one
low-class fantasy on the disc that's not about weed. This is a band with their
heads in the clouds in every sense of the phrase, and an album with more than
enough blunted-out choruses and swaying rhythms to sustain their high. -- Sean Richardson
*** Sarah Dougher THE WALLS ABLAZE (Mr. Lady)
The world spins on a
perpetually uncertain axis in Sarah Dougher's universe. Friendships wax and
wane; conflict between lovers goes unresolved; connections are severed by
distance and demons that transform their hosts into strangers.
Building on the themes of addiction, denial, and recovery she first explored on
Day One, her '99 solo debut, Dougher -- who also plays organ with the
Crabs and Cadallaca (the latter of which she founded with Sleater-Kinney's
Corin Tucker) -- again investigates the often painful divide that resides
between the lines of what people say to each other. Or, as in the case of the
subject who's locked in an emotional prison ("The Old Way"), what they tell
themselves. With a direct, guilelessly expressive voice and a compact melodic
disposition that closely resembles Liz Phair's way with pungent mini-drama,
Dougher places her lean, fitful narratives in a spare musical setting that's
well suited to conjuring a sustained mood of prickly, post-punk restlessness.
Issued by the Durham label that's also home to feminist punks Le Tigre and the
Butchies, Walls is the kind of sinewy, Matadorian indie pop we haven't
heard in a while. In fact, if you didn't know that was guitarist Jon Reuter and
Sleater-Kinney drummer Janet Weiss supplying the chunky riffs and rhythm on
"The Scales," you'd swear Brad Wood was on the premises. -- Jonathan Perry
*** Toni Braxton THE HEAT (LaFace)
No longer arranged (but still
produced) by Babyface, who wrote her hits "Unbreak My Heart" and "Never Breathe
Again," Toni Braxton presents a younger, less pre-packaged version of her
romantic self on The Heat. By drawing her lyrics and melodies from other
sources, she frees her voice from over-reliance on showy drama as well as from
the breathless characterizations imposed on her by the success of "Never
Breathe Again." Here is a younger ("Gimme Some"), flirtier ("He Wasn't Man
Enough"), more plaintive ("Spanish Guitar," "I'm Still Breathing"), quietly
consoling ("Speaking in Tongues," an Isleys-like ballad) Braxton.
Acoustic-guitar accompaniment in "Fairy Tale" and (of course) "Spanish Guitar"
allows her to sing softly and delicately as she addresses her lover. A
different kind of surprise is "The Art of Love," in which Braxton breathes
sultry à la Donna Summer over a track drawn directly from Kool & the
Gang's 1975 spaced-out "Summer Love." You can definitely hear (and almost
taste) the mischievous grin in her voice as she whispers sweaty sex into the
music's wisps. -- Michael Freedberg
*** Wendo Kolosoy MARIE LOUISE (Indigo)
At 75, Congolese singer Wendo
Kolosoy is the great-grandfather of the music we know as soukous. With his
group Victoria Kin, he hit the scene in Leopoldville (now Kinshasa) in 1946 and
soon thereafter had a 78-rpm hit with the song "Marie Louise," which is
reprised here nearly a half-century later. Wendo languished in obscurity as
Congo music went international in the 1970s and '80s. But now, wonder of
wonders, he's back. The voice is big, a tad rough and wavy with age, but still
capable of a clear yodel-like falsetto, as on the humorous "Youyou Aleli
Veka."
This set of 10 swinging numbers invests the gentle, seductive sound of classic
Congolese rumba with the clarity of modern recording techniques. Before the
pummeling bass drum of soukous arrived, rumba singers crooned over lively, open
shaker-and-conga accompaniment, a stripped-down version of the old Cuban son
percussion, and that's what we get here. Lilting, melodious guitar playing
has always been a mark of Congo music, and Vulu Missy's picking here is
gorgeous throughout, whether she's chunking out low accompaniment passages or
crafting lively soukous leads as on "Soki Olingi Ngai." Wendo's improvised
vocal duet with Cameroonian veteran Anne-Marie N'zié, "Tokutani," is
particularly choice. -- Banning Eyre

The mayors of San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose are just some of the elected representatives planning to attend Monday’s swearing-in in front of the U.S. Capitol following the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend full of inaugural programming and a private oath of office ceremony Sunday.READ MORE: Bay Area Shoppers Looking For Deals Find Black Friday Is Not What It Used To Be
San Jose Mayor Chuck Reed, who has been at the U.S. Conference of Mayors this week, along with San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee and Oakland Mayor Jean Quan, will extend his stay at the nation’s capital to witness his first presidential inauguration.
“I’m expecting it to be crowded and cold,” he said about the ceremony set for Monday morning.
Despite the anticipated chill, which he noted other California mayors have also had difficulty adjusting to, he called the start of Obama’s next four years an “important national event” that “is something we do for the country and world.”
Concord resident Eric Mettner, 35, is heading to the East Coast this morning ready to witness his first presidential inauguration after he volunteered for the Obama re-election campaign in San Francisco last year.
“I’ve never done anything like this,” Mettner said.
While in D.C., he has plans to attend an inaugural dinner, see the historical sights and be part of the hundreds of thousands who will welcome Obama to four more years as president.READ MORE: Holiday Fair in Santa Clara Puts Focus on Local Crafts and Creators
His trip was made possible after he worked with his local representative, Congressman George Miller, D-Concord, to secure inauguration tickets, and garnered support from family and friends.
Through the generosity of his large following on social media, Mettner was able to afford the travel costs. Strangers pitched in between $5 to $100 to help him afford the once-in-a-lifetime trip, which he called a “bucket-list dream.”
Mettner said he is most excited about “being in the crowd” watching the ceremony, and seeing some of his favorite artists, Beyonce and Kelly Clarkson, perform at the ceremony.
He reflected on watching Obama’s first inauguration on TV in 2009 and that it brought him to tears.
“It’s incredible to go from watching the inauguration to being involved in the campaign to being part of inauguration.”
An openly gay man who recently came out as HIV positive, Mettner said marriage and equality rights propelled him to work on the Obama campaign.
He has already bought winter clothes to stay warm in his suit during the event, but he said “it’s not going to hit me until I’m leaving (San Francisco International Airport).”
“This is going to be more than just a trip to the inauguration,” Mettner said. “It’s a compilation of dreams and people believing in me.”MORE NEWS: COVID: Highly Contagious Omicron Variant Prompts New Travel Restrictions

Introduction
Salvador da Bahia, once the colonial capital of Brazil, is nowadays the capital of Afro-Brazilian culture. Some tourist brochures call it the ‘Black Rome’, ‘the biggest inheritor of African traditions out of Africa’, and ‘Cradle and home of African descendent traditions (including samba, capoeira and Candomblé)’. Candomblé in particular is often presented as the heart of this Afro-Brazilian culture.
The origin of the term ‘Candomblé is unknown, it seems to have appeared in Bahia in the first half of the nineteenth century in reference to parties of slaves and freed slaves (sometimes in the plural, Candomblés), and also in connection with the practice of sorcery (feitigaria). Some sources presumed that these activities had an African origin; the newspapers often complained about the noise of drums at Candomblé parties, and the charlatanism of the sorcerers; but from very early on, people of all social groups, origins and races came to the parties and made use of sorcery. For the editor of a newspaper in 1868, ‘these absurd Candomblés are so rooted, that I do no longer admire seeing Black people involved, when White people are the more passionate devotees of the cause’.
Of course, few among the white or almost white upper classes would publicly acknowledge their participation: to do so would be an embarrassment. Now and then the police disbanded the Candomblés and the sorcerers were put on trial, their instruments confiscated as ‘weapons of sorcery’. Nonetheless, it seems that Candomblé was never just an exclusive, secretive and resistant African affair: the sorcerers often had powerful patrons, people from across Bahian society took part in it. In fact, the sorcery of Candomblé was seen by many as the hidden force dominating the city, and writers like Marques or Joao do Rio affirm that ‘we are all ruled by the sorcerer’.
But when newspapers today talk about Candomblé, they do not denounce evil sorcery and outrageous parties. Instead, Candomblé is praised as African religion and cultural heritage. The objects of Candomblé are presented in museums as works of art. Participating in Candomblé is not an indignity, but something to be proud of. Intellectuals and politicians make their attendance at and even their participation in its rituals, both public and official. Gilberto Gil, musician and Minister of Culture, is also a ‘lord’ (ogan) in a Candomblé house.
How did Candomblé go from Sorcery to National Heritage? How did Candomblé become ‘Culture’? This question has not been properly addressed until now. Since its very origin, the literature on Candomblé has been obsessed with demonstrating the African origins and continuities of its rituals and myths. This tradition of studies, what I will call ‘Afro-Brazilianism’, has built an image of Candomblé as a ‘microcosmic Africa’ (Bastide 1978c), where the philosophical and artistic essences of the continent are preserved.
In recent decades Afro-Brazilianism has been severely criticised by social scientists interested in racial politics, who have argued that Afro-Brazilian culture is an ‘invented tradition’, and Afro-Brazilianist discourse a form of domination by the Brazilian elites over the black populations of Brazil. In transforming Candomblé into folklore, Afro-Brazilianism has imposed a ‘culturalism1 more concerned with the protection of an objectified cultural heritage than with racial politics. In Hanchard’s terms Afro-Brazilian culture has been ‘reified’: ‘culture becomes a thing, not a deeply political process.’
This book starts trom a different point: the question is not if this culture is ‘authentic’ or a ‘fiction’, but how Candomblé has become Afro-Brazilian culture. Encompassing these two discourses, we will see how Afro-Brazilian culture is neither a repressed essence nor an invention, but the outcome of a dialectical process of exchange between the leaders of Candomblé and a cultural elite of writers, artists and anthropologists in Bahia. In this dialectical process the cultural and artistic values of national and international anthropologists, intellectuals and artists have been synthesised with the religious values of Candomblé, generating an unprecedented objectification: ‘Afro-Brazilian culture’. At the same time, the leaders of Candomblé have recognised their own practice as ‘Culture’, and have become the subjects of their own objectification.
The impasse between affirmative and critical views on Afro-Brazilian culture is a result of their rigid and incompatible notions of ‘culture’. For the Afro-Brazilianist tradition, African culture is an original, unchanging ‘system of representations’ that has resisted slavery, and which is ritually re-enacted in Candomblé. For its critics, this notion of ‘culture’ is a fixed image, a false projection of imperialist reason: Afro-Brazilian culture is just a masquerade that hides the racial inequalities of Brazil.
But a culture is neither a fixed ‘system of representations’ nor a rigid ideological projection. Cultures are always in construction: they are not immanent and self-contained, but transient and relative historical formations. And yet, this does not mean that they are just artificial and false constructions. After all, what is the problem with ‘culture becoming a thing’? Cultures are indeed the result of histories of objectification—processes of recognition of identity and alterity. But processes of objectification cannot be reduced to reification. Objectification does not preclude politics, but in many ways it is the precondition of any meaningful social action: it is precisely because culture is objectified that it can be discussed, used and appropriated by social actors.
This book will describe this process neither as resistance nor masquerade, but as a historical transformation of practices, values and discourses: a cultural history. On the one hand, it is unquestionable that many African traditions are present in Candomblé; nevertheless it is also true that its ritual practices have incorporated the history of Brazil in what has been called ‘syncretism’. On the other hand, intellectuals have objectified Candomblé as Afro-Brazilian culture. But this objectification is not just an ideological fixed image, a reification: it has been actively appropriated by the people of Candomblé, who have assumed the discourses and practices of Afro-Brazilian culture as their own. This process of appropriation can be understood in very similar terms to religious syncretism; in a way it has been a ‘syncretism of Culture’.
Before going any further, I will explain in more detail what I mean by ‘Culture’ and ‘objectification’, and how the Afro-Brazilian case can offer a particular perspective on a more universal cultural process of our time: the appropriation of ‘Culture’…
…The solution to the ‘Negro problem’ for this elite was the ‘whitening’ of Brazil (Skidmore 1995). Deploying in a very particular way the eugenic theories of their time, they thought that by increasing European immigration Brazil would progressively eliminate its majority of Black people (Moritz-Schwartz 1993). Blacks and mulattos, as degenerate races, would inevitably die out, unless they improved their ‘weak’ blood with the powerful new ‘stocks’ of Europeans that were arriving en masse in Brazil. But in Bahia there was no significant influx of European immigrants. There was no work for them: nourishing agriculture, and later industry, were concentrated in the south, around Sao Paulo. Bahia remained poor and Black, lost in its past, with a dormant economy, a provincial life and a small population until the 1940s. This is the period that Gil and Riserio (1988) have called a ‘hundred years of solitude’, beginning with the end of the slave trade. In this ‘decadent’ context, after three brilliant centuries of international exchange of people and things, Bahians were left to themselves: there was no substantial immigration or change in Bahia’s population, and a very specific local culture progressively took hold. Bahian society was extremely traditional, and marked by the cultural history of its overwhelming majority of African descendants…

Certificate VignetteIf you’ve ever ridden a motorcycle you will know that the horn sound is usually pretty feeble at 100db and is more of a squeak pitch rather than a thunderous roar.
However there are aftermarket options that may give you that extra high note and will probably blow the feathers off the local pigeons too but won’t break the bank either.
Any search of your online favourite places will no doubt yield some interesting results for you to choose however there are a couple of things to consider first of all. What is Frequency and what is the Decibel rating?
The frequency (measured in Hertz) is a sound wave cycle completed in one second. A high frequency will complete more cycles per second than a low frequency.
We hear the frequency change as Pitch. It is our ear’s ability to recognise the frequency which is referred to as pitch. The most we can hear is just over 8000Hertz and the lowest can be in the region of 20Hertz however much of this depends on environmental factors and our age too.
Single motorcycle horns are set to a single frequency however there is some adjustability on the rear via a pitch screw that many are not aware of, however the change is minimal. Dual motorcycle horns are preset to a lower and higher frequency usually pitched at the C and D note which give it an overall much fuller sound.
Now the linear volume is measured in Decibels and this relates to how much pressure the sound wave exerts on the environment. The amplitude of the wave…or height of the wave determines the sound volume for the most part.
So when selecting a new motorcycle horn, you’ll be wanting to research what your original horn frequency and decibel rating is, then seek an alternative horn that will surpass your original.
Many rider buy new horns and are quite disappointed by the performance or even by the negligible difference or marked improvement, so knowing what you are buying will be key.
The next thing to consider is that for powerful horns of whatever description, they will probably need to be powered by a separate feed directly from the motorcycle battery via a dedicated relay. Whilst this is a simple process, it isn’t a mere plug and play and is required because the original wiring to the original horn may not have enough dedicated power to make the horn work properly.
The last thing to consider is the horn placement. You may have to make custom brackets to fit the horn or horns to your motorcycle and route the wiring the full length of the bike. The result from this is an ugly set up, especially when dealing with a dual horn system.
So the main challenge will be to try to find a way to make the horns blend in to the frame as much as possible, or some will one fit the high frequency horn from a dual horn system alone.
Whatever you choose, you will face the dilemma of compromising higher frequency and decibel ratings for aesthetics. Some horns will blend seamlessly, whilst others will be the blot on the landscape that will attract geers and sneers from any wayward onlooker.

DELICIOUS Low-Carb Loaded Baked Potato-Style Soup
This absolutely delicious low-carb loaded baked potato-style soup will easily become a family favorite recipe! This keto potato soup with radishes is full of veggies and flavor without all the carbs. Healthy comfort food at its finest!
Ingredients
- 8 strips uncooked bacon
- 1 lb uncooked light ground pork sausage
- 1 small yellow onion, diced
- 3 stalks celery, diced
- 1 c diced carrots
- 2 cloves garlic, minced or pressed
- 6 c chopped radishes (cut each radish into fourths - big hunks of radish are good!)
- 1 yellow potato, peeled and chopped
- 1 head broccoli, chopped*
- 4 c chopped kale
- 1 tsp thyme
- 1 tsp oregano
- 1 tsp parsley
- ½ tsp salt
- ½ tsp garlic powder
- Dash red chili flakes
- 4 c chicken broth**
- ½ c whipping cream
- Cheese for topping
Instructions
- Preheat oven to 400.
- Place strips of raw bacon side-by-side on baking sheet, place in preheated oven, and bake for 15-20 minutes (check at 15 minutes if you like your bacon less crispy). If you aren't using a very non-stick baking sheet like these amazing baking pans, line your sheet with foil before placing the bacon on it.
- After bacon is finished cooking, allow it to cool for a few minutes and then chop it up. Reserve half of it to add to the Instant Pot, and reserve half of it for topping after the soup has finished cooking.
- Turn your Instant Pot onto saute mode, and add the pork sausage. Cook until it's about halfway brown, and then add the diced onion and continue cooking the sausage until it's fully browned.
- Add in the garlic, celery, and carrots, and continue to saute for 2-3 minutes.
- Turn Instant Pot off. Add in the radishes, potato, broccoli, kale, seasonings, half of the chopped bacon (about 4 strips), and chicken broth. Lightly stir, place Instant Pot lid and lock in place, make sure the release valve is closed, and turn on to high pressure for 20 minutes.
- Once the Instant Pot is finished cooking, do quick release (this will probably take about 3 minutes), and then remove the Instant Pot lid.
- Add whipping cream, and then use an immersion blender to do a few QUICK pulses (not too many so you don't liquify the soup) to add some thickness to the soup.
- Serve soup in bowls and top with remaining bacon crumbles and shredded cheese.
- Enjoy with friends and family around your table!
Notes
*I always forget how much cooked broccoli kiiiinda stinks. However, one of my goals with cooking is to cram as many veggies in one dish as I possibly can. If you DO decide to omit the broccoli, then see this next tip:
**Just use 3 c of chicken broth (instead of 4c) if you omit the broccoli. You don't want the soup to be TOO liquid-y-.
1. Remember to factor in additional time - though the prep time is 20 minutes and the cook time is 20 minutes, it'll take some time for the Instant Pot to get up to pressure - probably about 10ish minutes.
2. You don't have to do the bacon on a baking sheet, but it makes a BIG difference when it comes to texture. It's so evenly cooked and perfectly crisp when you bake it on a baking sheet!
3. You don't HAVE to use an immersion blender (or other blender) in order to make this soup delicious, but I love using mine to add some extra creaminess/thickness to the soup.

Well about as dead as Jason Todd.
The Batman R.I.P. story arc concluded this week with (if true) the lamest superhero death ever.
Batman escapes being buried alive in a straitjacket only to die punching his way into a helicopter, which crashes into the water and explodes. Flash-forward 6 months and we see one of the men responsible bragging that Batman (and Robin?) is dead just before a Bat-signal shines down on him. Of course that Bat-signal could be from anyone, maybe even a new Batman.
Perhaps Dick will take up the mantle. After all, Barbara Gordon recently commented how the jaded Nightwing was sounding more like Batman. Another possibility is the return of Azrael, which has already been heavily hinted at with notes on Rip Hunter’s chalkboard reading “Jean Paul Valley Lives!” & “Azrael comes and goes.” Azrael’s reflection was even on the cover of Gotham Underground #8. And with Batgirl in the process of recruiting multiple people to fill in for the Gotham’s protector, can there be any doubt what’s coming…
Reign of the Batmen!
And just like in Reign of the Supermen! the real deal will eventually return to stop an evil cyborg batman (i.e. ReMAC). But Batman isn’t Superman. He can’t just soak up some rays and come back to life. He must still be alive but where is here?
Well the epilogue reveals that the phrase “Zur-En-Arrh” which triggered Batman’s psychedelic alternate personality “Batman of Zur-En-Arrh” originates from Bruce mishearing his father say “they’d probably throw someone like Zorro in Arkham.” Could this be a hint that we’ll be seeing Batman incarcerated at Arkham? Perhaps to prove that he’s not Batman while a substitute takes his place. There’s even a video game due out next year called Batman: Arkham Asylum.
Who’s the world’s greatest detective now?
Me that’s who!After long and much anticipation from fans, a Pokemon Presents livestream has finally been confirmed for broadcast on Friday February 26 at 10 am EST, 7 am PDT. The video presentation comes on the eve of the 25th Anniversary of Pokemon, of which celebrational events such as the McDonald’s Pokemon Happy Meals have already commenced.
The upcoming Pokemon Presents livestream is leaving fans holding their breath in the wait for what’s to come. Considering this is the 25th Anniversary of Pokemon, fans and individuals expect huge announcements to commemorate the milestone year for the franchise.
Popular speculation includes possible remake titles for the 2006 Nintendo DS games Pokemon Diamond Version and Pokemon Pearl Version. Consideration for this comes in acknowledgement of Nintendo’s and Game Freak’s long history of generational remake titles, including Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen Versions, Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver Versions, and the most relatively recent Pokemon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire. With respect to Generation III of Pokemon receiving the most recent remake titles back in 2014, fans naturally expect Generation IV to be next in this sequence.
While Pokemon Diamond and Pearl Version remakes have been the wider talk of potential announcements, the possibilities are far and wide with Pokemon, especially with regard to its commemoration of 25 years. Earlier this year, New Pokemon Snap was announced to launch for the Nintendo Switch on April 30, 2021, coming nearly 22 years after its predecessor, Pokemon Snap, released for N64. The Pokemon Presents broadcast may reveal more details about this upcoming simulation title.
There has also been some speculation regarding the Pokemon Let’s Go series, in light of Pokemon: Let’s Go Pikachu and Pokemon: Let’s Go Eevee, with contemplation of possible additions to this particular series of Pokemon games.
Regarding the slew of opinions and theories going around, these remain simple speculations. With so much anticipation and a wide array of potential announcements in light of the 25th Anniversary of Pokemon, the broadcast will tell all when it premieres tomorrow.Background: Clinical studies suggest that respiratory outcome of infants born preterm may be influenced by placental insufficiency and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets (HELLP) syndrome. If so, one could expect to see differences in lung maturation indices (lecithin/sphingomyelin (L/S) ratio and lamellar body count (LBC)) in the amniotic fluid. The present study investigates lung maturation indices of preterm small for gestational age (SGA) fetuses with or without abnormal Doppler ultrasound examination and with or without maternal hypertension/HELLP syndrome.
Study design: Retrospective cohort study of 76 neonates born in our center between 1997 and 2003 with gestational age (GA) <34 weeks, birth weight <p10 for GA and available results from amniocentesis. All analyses were corrected for potential confounders.
Results: The L/S ratio was significantly higher in the abnormal Doppler group as compared to the normal Doppler group (p=0.02). The L/S ratio was significantly lower in hypertensive pregnancies as compared to normotensive pregnancies (p=0.02). Subdivision of the maternal hypertension group showed a significantly lower L/S ratio in the HELLP syndrome group as compared to the normotension group (p=0.04).
Conclusion: The L/S ratio of SGA fetuses is significantly higher in cases with presumed placental insufficiency and significantly lower when pregnancies are complicated by HELLP syndrome. These observations are in line with the hypothesis that placental insufficiency accelerates lung maturation and with recent reports of poorer respiratory outcome in infants from mothers with HELLP syndrome.Homeless (2013)

Bournemouth boss Scott Parker has issued a fitness update on Ireland international Robbie Brady as the Dubliner nears a return to full fitness.
Brady has yet to feature for the Cherries since completing his move to the South Coast given his lack of match fitness since making the move to the Championship promotion contenders.
But Parker has allayed fears that may have been held regarding Brady, explaining why he has not yet played for Bournemouth.
Robbie Brady fitness update.
Speaking to the Bournemouth Echo, Parker explained why Brady was left out of their defeat on Sunday away to Derby County.
“I didn’t want to risk him [Brady] on Sunday, I just couldn’t afford to do that really. Hence why he wasn’t here,” he said.
“Robbie is doing very well. He is pushing on. He has obviously come in with not a lot of work due to circumstances at the end of the season.
/>
“We need to tread carefully with Robbie, we don’t want to take any big risks with him.
“He has brought a real energy and experience. He has fitted into the group very well, just like he has been one of us for a long time.”
Robbie Brady at Bournemouth.
In recent seasons, Robbie Brady has endured a challenging time of things on the injury front, something that led to his departure from Burnley in the summer.
While at the Clarets, Brady established himself as a key man under Sean Dyche after joining from Norwich City.
But it did not work in the end for him as he left Turf Moor at the end of his contract in June.
Scott Parker says Robbie Brady and Ben Pearson picked up “minor, minor knocks” hence their exclusion from the squad. #afcb
— Jacob Tanswell (@J_Tanswell) November 21, 2021
The former St Kevin’s Boys schoolboy has also not played a competitive first-team game since March, three months before he left Burnley.
Parker’s latest comments, however, comes as a boost to him as he nears his return to competitive football, and potentially Stephen Kenny’s Ireland squad again.
Read More About: bournemouth, robbie brady, scott parkerThough I'd like to say that if you're only going to read one long article on John McCain's health care plan today, it should be mine, the honest truth is you probably already know how I feel about McCain's plan to destroy the health insurance market. Instead, you should probably read Jon Cohn's deep and reported examination of what McCain's plan would mean for those of us with preexisting conditions. In my piece, I note that the Health Savings Accounts that McCain wants to encourage are "the logical extension of the modern health coverage marketplace: They're health insurance for people who don't need health care." Cohn shows how true that is for the entirety of the bill. Put slightly differently, if you believe the measure of a health system is how humanely and compassionately it treats the sick, then McCain's plan is not the plan for you. If your metric, however, is how much money it can save the well, then you might be more interested in what he's selling.View

Now the question is how can you get information about the criminal history of a person? The answer is simple and easy.
First you will have to go to the BOP website. You can then use the inmate locator to see if someone you know is in prison or to just check out convicted criminals records. For this you should have sufficient knowledge about the criminal like the criminal’s full name, his date of birth or you can find an inmate by ID number etc. If you have knowledge about other information then it is an added benefit for you as that can help you to find out what crimes a person has committed. The database that is available on the government website provides you with the list of all the crimes. If you are interested in how to find out the crimes a person has been convicted of at the national level then you can do a FBI record check on someone.
Or you can do a search in Google to check out someone’s criminal convictions by doing a online search.
Just enter the required information in the webpage that contains the criminal records like name of the criminal, date of birth etc. If you enter a wrong name, then a message will be displayed like “No match was found”. When the positive match is found, then you will get the required information on your email.
Then the next step is to contact your local law enforcement official in order to obtain extra information concerning a particular conviction and further details that will help you to find out why someone was sent to jail.
You will face some problems if you use only the first or last name to find out the criminal history like you may find many people having the same name. Then the question arises how you find out the particular criminal record. In such situation you can get the assistance of your local police department. The police provide you the exact information about whether an individual went to prison or not by using the fingerprint comparison.
Be careful while finding these records because some fee is associated with each record request. For accessing the criminal database the fee lies between $20 to $30 and that has to be paid to the state government. However, sometimes you can do a free background check on a person.;

A micromass culture (MM-C) system of primary immature chondrocytes for functional analysis of soluble factors involved in the maturation step of cartilage was previously developed. Ectopically expressed BMP-2 was shown to induce the expression of the Ihh and Noggin genes. Here it is demonstrated that, upon longer culture, secreted bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) further promotes the maturation step as judged by the induction of type X collagen and BMP-6 expression, which are known to be detectable in the later phase of cartilage maturation. Induction of all of these genes by secreted BMP-2 was not inhibited by ectopic expression of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) induced by retrovirus vector infection, although the same virus vector showed strong inhibitory effects on the expression of type X collagen gene or alkaline phosphatase activity in mature chondrocytes. These results suggest that the maturation-promoting activity exhibited by BMP-2 is dominant over the suppressive effect of PTHrP in immature chondrocytes. When the BMP-6 gene was introduced into the same virus vector as that used for BMP-2, it induced the same sets of genes (Ihh, Noggin, type X collagen and endogenous BMP-6) as BMP-2 did. These results also suggest that BMP-6 would autonomously maintain and/or promote a later stage of chondrocytic maturation.

Yes! I prefer this to changing my nickname on servers. Looks clean.11
Love this idea! Currently have my pronouns in my name which is a little intrusive, so I’d love a more subtle, but still easily identifiable solution!8
This is a great idea. Would help with college based servers.7
Talking in a big community server where you might not know everyone's pronouns can be difficult. You don't want to accidently misgender someone, especially if they are LGBTQ+. Having this option would help many people in different situations, whether it be casual conversation or business discussions, as well as making your LGBTQ+ server members feel like they have a safe and inclusive community to be a part of.7
I love the thought put into this, especially as someone nonbinary.6
yes please!
this feature would be useful for everyone, not just LGBTQ+.5
This is such a great idea. There’s honestly people I talk to every day and I don’t 100% know how to refer to them if/when I am talking about them. This would be a great solution to help ensure the safety and inclusiveness of discord!4
This sounds like a good idea! I think it would help a lot of people.3
great feature.2
I love this idea! I'd been worried about a discord-wide option because not everyone will be out everywhere, but being able to toggle it per server or even set it per server would be ideal.
There's so many discords that use reaction role bots or similar things to show pronouns, having a universal and built in way would help standardize and promote it.1
it should just be a role display feature, not necessarily a pronoun feature. could be used as one, of course, but could also be used for any other role type, to make he feature more useful to people who dont care about having pronouns displayed. obviously you would still be able to use it as a pronoun displayer0
I was about to make my own post when I saw this thread had already existed. I think it would be so useful (although not perfect) to save people the trouble of needing a bot to give them a pronouns roles, especially when Pronouns are an essential part of a person's identity. For those who don't want to have their pronouns revealed, they don't have to. People already have to open a person's profile to see what gender role they would have anyway. This would benefit everyone in the gaming community.0
This is a brilliant solution to a very important aspect of community. It's tidy and neat and is very accessible, and I love the option to display it only in certain servers. I really hope Discord picks this up!0
Just thought that this should be a thing, and a quick search revealed that others think this way too! Commenting to show my support for this idea, and specifically this wonderfully thought out version.0
Also wanted to chime in and echo this suggestion! Being a larger server-owner and community organizer, I have felt that a built-in, internal method for folks to easily indicate their pronouns would be extremely beneficial. Seeing as other social platforms (Instagram, LinkedIn) are also providing internal means for users to do this, it only feels natural that Discord tackles this feature as well.0
I think this would be great! The current solutions of including pronouns in your nickname or in your roles are clunky, or in the latter case can be overlooked, so I would like to see this feature fully integrated into Discord.0

Rome, 7 October 2021 – If we continue to lose biodiversity, the world’s most vulnerable people will not be able to adapt to climate change nor sustainably produce food, according to a report released today by the UN’s International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). The report also details the role that rural small-scale farmers play in protecting biodiversity.
Biodiversity Advantage – Thriving with Nature: Biodiversity for Sustainable Livelihoods and Food Systems outlines the risk to rural small-scale farmers – who make up the majority of the world’s poor and hungry - when biodiversity is compromised.
An estimated 80 percent of the needs of the world’s poor, including their ability to farm and earn incomes, are derived from biological resources. However, biodiversity loss is currently on the rise, with 1 million animal and plant species threatened with extinction, and 31 species declared extinct last year alone.
Despite standing to suffer immensely from any decline in biodiversity, agriculture is ironically the number one driver of biodiversity loss, primarily through expansion and intensification.
“We are at a critical juncture. If we lose biodiversity, we lose our ability to respond to hunger and climate change,” said Dr. Jyotsna Puri, Associate Vice President of IFAD’s Strategy and Knowledge Department which produced the report. “We know that large-scale agriculture threatens biodiversity. On the other hand, small-scale farmers protect our natural resources. When biodiversity is protected, and ecosystems are healthy and diverse, farmers are more productive and more resilient to climate change.”
Biodiversity supports food production through soil formation, land productivity, pest and disease control, replenishing ground water and pollination services. Biological features such as mangrove forests and coral reefs are barriers that reduce the risk of natural disasters. Improving agricultural biodiversity on small-scale farms results in healthy, productive soils which sequester more carbon, and makes an important cumulative contribution to carbon storage.
Published ahead of the UN Biodiversity Conference (COP-15) that begins on 11 October, the report also outlines how investments in biodiversity contribute to gender equity, women and youth empowerment, and nutrition. Drawing on case studies, the report shows how investments in protecting and enhancing ecosystems can increase benefits to small-scale farmers and the environment.
For example, in Kenya, restoring degraded forests has improved rain capture, boosting water supply and quality, and enhancing farmers’ productivity.
In Burkina Faso, a range of agroecological techniques and tree planting has improved yields, climate resilience and contributed to storage of over 1.7 million tons of carbon dioxide.
“If development investments do not take nature into account, our money will be wasted,” said Puri.
As part of its own increase in biodiversity investments, last month IFAD announced. – IFAD press releaseAverage bill 500

What does my typical bucket look like? (Like the one below haha, as I obviously took the photo on board) It’s generally got the following items:
- Bin Liners: the tiny ones for the bathroom bins. I tried “green” ones, but the problem with biodegradable bins is that when they get wet, they disintegrate or smell, like the ones I tried in Italy last year… If you have found an good alternative, please hit me up!
- Downy Spray: what would we ever do without it? Spray on your bed linen, tuck it in tight and goodbye iron! In the Caribbean Ace shops I’ve also found a thing called Grandma’s Wrinkle Releaser, tiny spray bottle, but potent! If you can’t find it, you can try making your own with your preferred softener (1 tea spoon) diluted in a spray bottle of distilled water (1 cup). Test it on a crew bed first though!
- Cotton Buds & Toothpicks: to get into all those hard to clean spots, ie sink drain holes, shower flooring cracks, toilet-floor joints, … any corners really! Throw in a toothbrush for good measure too!
- H20-Vinegar Spray: ah, the golden liquid that cleans a grant majority of surfaces, including wooden surfaces, glass, mirror, plastic… BUT NOT STONE, ESPECIALLY NOT DELICATE STONE! If you have any delicate, precious stones such as marble and granite, stay away with the vinegar as the acid in it will etch the stone and possible damage it irreversibly.
- Room Perfume: all yachts have their scent: a line of perfumed products they use around the yacht. I’m personally a big fan of Acqua dell’Elba. They have the regular diffusers, candles and room sprays. I used to use their Mare range but realised the blue liquid stained the reed diffuser sticks and as the perfectionists we all are, decided that was unacceptable and changed to Fiori instead. Greenie Point: They’ve got big refill bottles for the diffusers! Whoop whoop!
- Swiffer: They were on the yacht when I joined and as much as I tried, they never really convinced me (and consequently disappeared from the bucket) but what did convince me are the:
- Tack Rags: these wonderful sticky rags are often used on deck when prepping a sanded area before applying paint as it picks up all the fine dust (whereas swiffer IMO just moves the dust around) – hallelujah! Top tips: handle with gloves and don’t use on materials such as suede, use it on wood and glass rather. When using on glass don’t press to hard as the sticky stuff will simply transfer onto your surface, use it as you would gently caress your loved one.
- Squeegee: to quick-dry showers and floors
- Magic Eraser: to be used sparingly! This baby should only come out in emergency cases. A magic eraser is basically ultra-fine sanding paper so whatever material you are going to use it on, you will be sanding the top layer off, keep that in mind. I’ve used it on crew mess corridors and on guest glass shower doors but will try other methods first.
- Gamazyme BTC: as per Wilhelmsen’s website: “a unique biological active liquid formulation containing specialised bacterial strains, biodegradable low foaming chemical cleaners and anti-foam agents” BTC = biological toilet cleaner
- Gamazyme MSC: as per Wilhelmsen’s website: “a unique biologically active liquid formulation containing specialised bacterial strains and biodegradable chemical cleaners” MSC = multi-surface cleaner Ooh, and this one also works really well as a stain remover on clothes, bed and table linen.
Gamazyme Products
Okay, okay… These last two might seem like odd birds and I look forward to enlightening you about them… Gamazyme products are based on bacterial strains, I refer to them as my little creatures. So these active bacteria kinda like munch away at things like grease and anything organic really. When using these products on a daily basis you keep adding to your little creature zoo down in the drains and tanks which will help the tanks’ health (your engineer will thank you) and also help diminishing odours in general.

I hear the word shuttle and decide instantly that I am in. I then found out everyone was meeting at 8:15. crap, better hurry. I ran around, and managed to find clean riding gear, eat breakfast, drink some coffee, pack clothes for after the ride, load my bike and gear into the truck, the zoom out to the Helmken Park N Ride.
we gathered into two vehicles and headed to Duncan. wee! when we finally got to the top I was pretty excited. I haven’t ridden my Bullit in quite a while, and this was a good time to ride it. we quickly learned the trails were very sloppy. tires became clogged, and you could tell how fast you were going by how much mud your tires were throwing. the trails were steep, greasy, and fun. after the first run I was ready for the next.
our second run we started off on a different trail. again, it was steep, but this one had a shale base so traction was great (at least for me it was). we popped out on to a fireroad and were a little lost. since I had never been there before I relied on the rest of the group to lead the way. they did good though because we did find the trail we were looking for.
pretty much everyone had a crash of some sort. nothing serious, but somehow I had escaped. until “the incident” . I am not sure exactly how I did it, but while going down a steep pitch quite quickly, both feet slipped off their pedals, hit the ground, and then flew out behind me. there I was with my belly on my seat and both legs extended out behind me flying down the trail. I was braking for all I was worth, but I couldn’t stop. I hit a bump, got a little airborn, but managed to pull it together (still in the superman). I couldn’t do anything about my position, and I wasn’t gaining speed so I wasn’t too worried. eventually I wrangled my bike to a stop, laid it in the bush then proceeded to laugh for a few minutes. Jason was right behind me when it all happened and he was laughing pretty good too. the rest of the run was a blast (but uneventful).
we only got two runs in, but it was sure fun. in the summer that place would absolutely rawk. I can’t wait to get back there.
here are a few aftermath shots of my bike

Function of Tradition: The bolon is a warrior’s harp and was played to give courage to men going to the battlefront. It was played after the battle to celebrate the victory, and during the execution of captives who refused to surrender and swear allegiance to their new masters.
Reason for disappearance: The royal wars no longer exist. Those who ruled are no longer in power. The traditional social systems of Mandé have been replaced through colonialism, independence, and democracy. Those who had the power are now without. It is suggested that the individuals who worked with the colonial powers were actually people of caste, and have replaced the true nobility. Learning to play the bolon is not easy. The world of the bolon is dangerous. One must be well educated in the knowledge of plants and spells in order to navigate safely.LPN Inpatient- Float Pool

After six years, your CCJ will be removed from your credit report, so lenders won’t be able to see it when they’re deciding whether or not to lend you money. When the CCJ is removed, your credit score should go up too – making you an all-round stronger applicant for future finance.
How much will my credit score go up when a Judgement is removed?
Put simply: removing one default from your Credit Report won’t make much of a difference if you have additional defaults remaining. Only when all negative markers on your Credit Report have been removed will you begin to see any real improvement in your credit score.
Can I improve credit score with CCJ?
Settling a CCJ won’t improve your credit score straight away, but the older it gets, the less impact it will have. You might have to wait a couple of years to see an improvement due to settling your CCJ.
How many points does your credit score go up when you pay off debt?
The amount your credit score improves depends a lot on how high your utilization was in the first place. If you’re already close to maxing out your credit cards, your credit score could jump 10 points or more when you pay off credit card balances completely.
Will a CCJ ruin my life?
Having a CCJ against your name may mean that they’re not legally allowed to employ you, even if they want to. As a result, a CCJ could cost you your job and leave you unemployed.
Can you buy a house.
How many points is 2 CCJ on credit score?
The effect of missed payments, defaults & CCJs
A default is much worse, costing your score about 350 points. A CCJ will lose you about 250 points.
What is worse a CCJ or a default?
CCJ stands for County Court Judgement and is more serious than a default. It means that your lenders have gone further down the legal route to try and get their money back.

Hi, Dustin and Dan.
We've already responded to Jared, and it turned out that he uploaded low-resolution images. The resolution of the first 3D tour is '6912x3456' while the second one has half resolution; '3456x1728.' We assumed that he probably used a different method or device when stitching. Cupix does not compress or do any particular processing that will possibly bring down the original quality. As Dan said, if it's a problem of the stitching software from the camera manufacturer, we recommend using other stitching software such as PTGui(), or Hugin().
Thank you for your active participation in our Forum, and if you have any problems, feel free to contact us.
Best Regards,

Hi, Riley.
Thanks for writing in. If you want to increase the image quality, you need to use a camera with a higher resolution such as a DSLR camera. We drop the 3D tour quality in the editing mode and preview to improve your work efficiency; however, when your 3D tour is presented to the Web Player, it has the full image resolution. If you are not satisfied with the quality in the Web Player, the only option you can do is using another camera like we aforementioned.
In case if you want to take photos with a DSLR, here's a video link on how to capture 360º photos with a DSLR camera. >
Also, these sample 3D tours are taken with a DSLR camera for your information. >,

Sorry guys but I cannot give this to a client.U14 + U16 Boys Coach Wade Jean
Wade Jean heads into his 12th season at the helm of the Saint Michael's men's soccer program in 2021, and his 10th since returning to the institution for a second stint after also guiding the team in 2006 and 2007. The 2021 season is Jean's 22nd as a college head coach, having also coached at NCAA Division I Duquesne University for nearly a decade. In fall 2018, Jean began a four-year term on the NCAA Division II Men's Soccer Committee as the East Region's representative.
The Saint Albans, Vt., native also serves as the Saint Michael's Department of Athletics' tickets manager. Jean was instrumental in the creation in 2017 of the Community Cup, through which the Saint Michael's and Saint Anselm College men's soccer teams raise money for a local charity during their early-season, non-conference meeting.
The Purple Knights did not play during the 2020-21 school year, when 13 newcomers - including 11 first-years - joined the program. More than half a dozen rookies are set to come aboard in 2021.
The 2019 team was one of the youngest in program history, touting 10 first-years and nine sophomores to go along with only six upperclassmen. The Purple Knights broke out to a 3-1-1 start despite the inexperience before suffering five one-goal losses - including four against regionally-ranked foes - down the stretch. Saint Michael's capped the year with a 2-1 win at Stonehill College on Nov. 2, stunning the Skyhawks with two goals in the final 1:40.
Thirteen student-athletes competing in their first season of college soccer bolstered a young roster in 2018, when the Purple Knights started 3-4-1, including a 1-0 win over regionally-ranked The College of Saint Rose. Back-to-back 1-0 losses against Bentley University - the defending Northeast-10 Conference Championship titlist - and Southern Connecticut State University - a 2017 NCAA Tournament qualifier - followed, as six losses by two goals or less came down the stretch.
In 2017, the Purple Knights played 11 games decided by one goal or less, including extending their overtime record to 6-1-3 since 2015. Saint Michael's tied Saint Anselm College, 1-1, for the Community Cup while earning a 5-0 win against Bentley University, the eventual Northeast-10 Conference Championship runner-up. The Purple and Gold capped their season with a 2-1, double-overtime victory against regionally-ranked Southern New Hampshire University.
A 2016 team that saw six key players miss major stretches utilized 15 players who either were in their first season of college soccer or their initial season holding a critical role on the team. The Purple Knights started10 Championship - but SNHU later advanced to the NCAA Tournament Sweet 16. The Purple Knights posted at least eight wins in back-to-back seasons for the first time since 2006 and 2007, and claimed their best NE10 Championship five times in its first 19 seasons of league play. He promptly led the program to NE10 Championship berths both years at the helm, posting a 21-10-8 overall record and a 12-8-6 league mark. The 2006 squad's third-place regular-season showing was its best since 1988, and its NE10 Championship semifinal appearance was the program's first in 18 years. He was named NE, has Northern Vermont University-Johnson, NVU-Johnson, graduating in 1990 with a degree in elementary education. A four-year starter as a defensive midfielder, Jean was a two-year captain and led the Badgers to three Mayflower Conference titles. He also earned the Bryan Wendall Award, given to the individual signifying the most dedication to his college's men's soccer program. He was inducted into the NVU-Johnson Athletic Hall of Fame in fall 2018. Jean received his master's degree in health, physical education, recreation and dance from Illinois State in 1996.The irony is

LoloIf you’ve done a few running races, chances are you have your favourites. We asked our writer Olivia this question: ‘What are your 5 favourite half-marathon races?’ She had a hard time narrowing them down, but here are her top picks to inspire you to try new races, or to consider your own favourite events and why.
Plym Trail Half
The race
Plym Trail is organised by First and Last Running and there are four race weekends (offering a half option on both the Saturday and Sunday) per year, plus an extra Christmas race. The out-and-back route starts and finishes in Clearbrook, Plymouth, which is on the edge of Dartmoor. It follows the old railway line, which is now cycle route number 27. Alongside the half-marathon, there is also a marathon (which we reviewed here) that follows the same out-and-back route x2.
Why I love it
Plym Trail is slowly becoming my absolute favourite of these five half-marathon races – I truly love it. I love the small race field, the fact you can just turn up, park easily and wander to the village hall. I love the fact this race attracts regulars, which means you see the same runners every time you race. Plus everyone is super friendly, especially Davey the organiser. Davey is just a lovely guy; he makes you feel very welcome and part of the Plym Trail family.
I also love the route, as it’s so quiet, the scenery is stunning and the views in to the valley are spectacular. This is because you’re on the edge of the moor and the cycle route is quite high up. There’s one bridge you run over that’s really high – and I don’t like getting too close to the wall! Yes, the route is out and back, which doesn’t suit everyone. It’s slightly downhill on the way out, but I don’t seem to mind this. You can just switch off, let the legs tick off the miles and take in the views.
This race may not be for everyone because of the route and the small race field. But give it a go!
The bling
You’re rewarded with a goody bag filled with tasty treats, which is great for the drive home. You receive a beautiful medal with an animal linked to Dartmoor, plus these medals link together, producing an animal tableau. If you race both days of the weekend, you can choose a cap or a water bottle as a special extra.
Escot Christmas Half
The race
Escot Christmas Half Marathon runs alongside a marathon and is organised by Jolly Running. The inaugural event took place in December 2019. Over the weekend there’s also a fun run and a 10K, all held at Escot Estate in East Devon. The route consists of three and a bit laps, which take you through two woods and across the fields.
Why I love it
There’s something special about this half-marathon that I’ve never come across in a race before. Near the end of every lap there is a water slide – yes, a water slide – which assists in helping you to get to the bottom of the hill! The slide is optional, so you can just walk/run down the hill instead. I saved the slide for the last lap, as otherwise my wet bottom would have caused my fingers to go numb, closely followed by a cold body.
The slide was just so, so much fun and the gang had a laugh deciding on different ways to slide down it. There was also a bonus at the top of the slide – a feed station serving mulled wine and gin!
Bling
For your efforts you were awarded with an amazing medal where Santa slides down the slide. The goodies also included a mini local Christmas pudding and a Santa-themed neckscarf.
The race was superbly organised, especially as they had to overcome the atrocious weather. There were also a couple of food vans for pre- and post-race munchies, and the race started at 8:30am, which meant you were finished before lunchtime. Definitely a worthy pick for in my favourite half-marathon races!
Dark Valley Half
The race
As the name suggests, the Dark Valley races take place in the dark on a Saturday evening in November. They are organised by White Star Running and the trail run takes in the grounds of Moors Valley Country Park in Dorset.
The half is a two-lap route, with the 10K runners running just one lap. I would call the route an easy trail, as it’s not technical (even in the dark). Most of the route is on compacted paths, which makes it a great night-time beginner race. I experienced it after days of heavy rain, yet most of the route wasn’t horrendously muddy.
Why I love it
Well, it’s a White Star Running event, so I knew I’d end up loving it. But mainly I love it because it’s so much fun! I was nervous about running trails in the dark as I have a habit of failing over…
The word to describe this race is ‘party’ and that’s what it was. We were all having fun, and the marshals were partying away. Runners were dressed up in lights and florescent colours. Marshals were dressed up too; their marshal spot had lights and music, so there was a party on every corner and junction. As with all White Star Running events the feed stations were epic, catering for all tastes. So I ate a lot of Jaffa Cakes, but I wasn’t tempted by the beer or the gin.
Bling
As with all White Star Running races you receive a fabulous, stunning medal as a reward your efforts. Along with the medal we were given a bottle of beer and some tasty biscuits for re-fuelling.
The organisation is second to none and the marshals were the best I have experienced. They truly made the race for me, and turned it into an early Christmas party. I’ll be doing it again and hopefully the weather will be dry so that we travel to the park earlier and enjoy what the park has to offer. The park offers children’s activities, cycling routes, Go Ape and segways. As the race is on a Saturday, you could get there in time for parkrun and then explore for the day and join in the race at 5pm.
Heron Half
The race
The Heron Half is a relatively new race on the running calendar, and it runs alongside an established marathon race. Both are organised by Yeovil Town Road Running Club and takes place in the Somerset countryside around Yeovil. The race itself is on the flatter side of undulating and it’s run on country roads.
Why I love it
It holds a special place in my heart, because it was my first half-marathon after four years of injury. Plus I surprised myself by running sub two hours, which was just unexpected and the icing on the post-injury cake.
This half just felt great while I was running it, and maybe this was because I was so grateful and happy I was able to run my favourite distance. Everything just came together on the day. My injury didn’t play up, I felt amazing, the miles ticked by… mile 12 was my fastest mile! So I had to include it in my roundup of my favourite half-marathon races!
Bling
Having been out of the racing game for so many years, I hadn’t realised the change that had occurred with medals. They are now much bigger and more beautiful. This one is just stunning, plus this exquisite medal has a raised design and everyone loved it. The t=shirt is a thick good quality race t=shirt and I put it on straight away.
There are two other bonuses with this race: first the free parking, and second it has a country fair atmosphere with music, activities and food vans.
Taunton/Torbay Half
The race
I know that I’ve kinda been cheeky here and mentioned two of my favourite half-marathon races in one, but I couldn’t choose between the two! Plus they both begin with ‘T’… so I think I can get away with it!
The Taunton Half Marathon is a one-lap route that takes in the countryside surrounding the city. The race route is undulating with the three main hills all coming in the last 5K of the race. Whereas the Torbay Half Marathon is a two-lap route running from the seafront at Paignton to the seafront at Torquay and back. With it being two laps you get the pleasure of running the hills twice!
Why I love it
I’ve always loved Taunton, because I think I have happy memories about the race. Memories from going as a club and running with people who don’t run any more. The route through Somerset villages is pretty, and in a weird way having the hills all together is okay. Maybe I love it purely because Taunton is my lifetime half-marathon PB course!
Having only raced Torbay once, it’s made a lasting impression on me. Maybe I love it because, just like with Heron Half, everything came together on the day. I felt amazing and I was rewarded with a post-injury PB. Also I love being by the sea, and with Torbay you run between two beaches. It has proper hills – ie they are BIG hills! – which means you run up and up, but you get to run down them at speed.
Bling
Even though I love the Taunton Half, I haven’t run it since 2012. This is due to injury and other races clashing with the date. Not only are you rewarded with a medal, you now receive a technical race t-shirt too. This is the same as with Torbay.
These are my top five – well top six really! – favourite half-marathon races in the UK that I love and will return to regularly. We’d love to hear if you’ve raced any of these, and if they’re your favourites too.

Dear World Society Members,
As we approach the end of 2017 we hope that this message will find you in good health! The World Society and its leadership have been busy with multiple initiatives. We have good news to report.The Mission of St. Paul’s-on-the-Hill
Our purpose is to be a visible, welcoming and engaging community for individuals and families who seek a spiritual home.
For more than 175 years St. Paul’s has served the Ossining community. In it’s current pastoral setting with historic buildings, it offers a place for celebration, contemplation and examination of our lives as Episcopalian Christians.
The old St. Paul’s, now Calvary Baptist Church in Ossining
The History of St. Paul’s
During the first half of the nineteenth century, two events took place which have a distinct bearing on St. Paul’s story.
First, on the first plateau above the Hudson in the little village of Sing Sing (later Ossining, in Westchester County), a group of Episcopalians met in 1833 and build the first church of that denomination in the area. It was fashioned of local marble and named St. Paul’s.
In 1868, a breach in St, Paul’s congregation related to divided sympathies in the Civil War led to the founding of an offshoot of St. Paul’s, named Trinity. The new church was built on the more traveled Albany Post Road, which runs through Ossining where it is know as Highland Avenue.
The Second World War came and went, bringing to the town of Ossining (renamed in 1901 to distinguish it from the prison which had been build at the river’s edge) a rapid growth of population that fanned out into the open spaces back in the hills, from which main parkways led to New York City and the county seat in White Plains, amid the scenic beauty of the old estates which circled the little town.
One such estate was Torbank in the hills above the Hudson River. A family by the name of Donald had erected a mansion from the bricks and timbers of the old Customs House in New York City. Generations of Donald’s had farmed their estate, when lightning struck and burned their barns, with the exception of a tiny tool shed which had been built of brick and slate. When the Donald’s rebuilt, they built three farm buildings of brick and slate around a central courtyard to match the little tool shed and garden walls.
St. Paul’s-on-the-Hill, Torbank, Ossining
In the 1950’s, when developer David Bogdanoff created the housing development on what is now Ganung Drive on Torbank hill, he saw that the beautiful Georgian-type buildings of the old McDonald estate could be the heart of his development, and lend a touch of historic meaning to the new houses that he was build on the surrounding hillside.
It was family building of the Donald estate that became the new location of St. Paul’s, which was renamed “St. Paul’s-on-the-Hill.”New Zealand Medical Services in Middle East and Italy
2 NZ General Hospital, Helwan
2 NZ General Hospital, Helwan
When 2 General Hospital took over from 4 General Hospital on 8 October there were 472 equipped beds and 448 patients. During the following week two more wards were opened up, bringing the page 72 number of available beds to 559. It was fortunate that this increase was possible just at that time, for there was a steady rise in the number of patients due to the departure of a brigade of 6 Australian Division from Helwan and the need for the Australians to transfer their sick from their camp hospital; and also to an increase in the number of cases of dysentery from both the Western Desert and Maadi Camp, where the Third Echelon had arrived early in October. On 30 October there were 533 patients, of whom 160 were Australians. Medical outnumbered surgical cases on an average of about two to one.
The number of patients rose to a peak of 586 on 1 November, but the bed state fell steadily to 458 at the end of the month with an easing of tension for all departments. Most of the construction work in the hospital was then finished and the staff had become accustomed to hospital routine. Admissions for the month totalled 825 and discharges 863.
It was not until December that the theatre block was functioning. This block was well designed and of ample size to cope with all the work offering, though all the surgical work was concentrated at Helwan pending the erection of the operating block at Helmieh several months later.
The sanitary arrangements of the Grand Hotel building were quite unsuited to cope with a large number of hospital patients. Soakage and cess-pits were in use, some of them under part of the buildings, and these became overfull, offensive, and a danger to health. A new drainage system was put in and the drainage from the wards piped into a septic tank, and the effluent taken out into the desert three-quarters of a mile from the hospital. Two wards used for intestinal cases were still drained into larger cesspits to enable disinfectants to be used. Thereafter sanitary conditions were quite satisfactory.
In December, following the offensive in the Western Desert, men of many nationalities were admitted: 130 British, 72 Australian, 494 New Zealand, 3 French, and 215 Italian prisoner-of-war patients. Actual battle casualties were 73 Allies and 102 Italians.
In January large convoys of patients arrived following the battles of both Bardia and Tobruk. More Australians than New Zealanders were admitted for the month—426 as against 416. On 31 January the number of patients totalled 656. A transfer of 90 Australians to an Australian general hospital was made on 25 February and this left only 38 Australians. February's admissions totalled 658.
By March the rush of the work consequent on the January convoys had slackened to a marked extent, added to which the hospital was serving only New Zealand troops; and, of these, the majority were on their way to Greece early in March.page 73
The casualties from other forces admitted from the First Libyan Campaign and Tobruk included both light and serious cases. The closed plaster treatment was largely carried out at this period and sulphonamides were used both locally and parenterally. Little was done in the way of wound suture. The major fractures demanded much attention, and the presence of an orthopaedic surgeon on the staff of the hospital proved of great value. Very few deaths occurred among the battle casualties.
Of other surgical admissions, accidental injuries were relatively common both from road accidents and from games, especially football. Orthopaedic conditions of a minor nature were not uncommon, many being pre-war disabilities such as old osteomyelitic infections of the lower limb which were prone to break down in Egypt. There were also numerous cases of hammer toes, hallux valgus, and exostosis, many of which called for operative treatment.Overview of Pastoral Provision & Structure..

Since I travel a lot, this is an ongoing concern for me!
I also have to take care of my clothes, because who can afford to wear it only once, right? Who wants to ruin that gorgeous pair of white jeans?
After many laundry disasters like clothes shrunk and my favorite designer jeans coming out all stained, I learned that there is a better way to take care of my clothes and Tide is my #1 tool to accomplish that! Look at my brand new damaged Jeans? That was before Tide® PODS™ Plus Downy®, of course!!
So after many business trips, I developed a “system” and today, I want to share it with you:
1. I use 2x the Tide® PODS™ Plus Downy® for overwhelming loads, yes 2x, to ensure everything comes out clean and fresh!
2. The PODS go in BEFORE the clothes, this step is so important!
3. Then I select the heavy duty cycle for my after trip loads.
4. I separate dresses from jeans and other more durable fabrics
5. Dark and bright colors are washed together as well
6. The water temperature and cycle also need to match the type of clothes you are washing: darks with cold water and whites with hot.
To enjoy great cleaning results, use 4-in-1 laundry pacs to clean, brighten, fight stains and protect your clothes every time you do laundry.
Here is why I love Tide PODS® Plus Downy laundry detergent:
- It is the first detergent pac that helps transform the washing machine into a safe place that cleans, conditions and protects the clothing you love.
- It works with both high efficiency (HE) and standard washing machines.
- Its HE Turbo technology provides 6x the cleaning power in half the time*.
*stain removal of 1 Tide PODS® pac vs. 6 doses of leading bargain brand liquid detergent, base variant
- Cleans and conditions in 1 step
- Protects clothes from damage in the wash
- Dissolves in all temperatures

You are so right. I will never, I mean never forget when my mother in law thought she was helping with laundry after the birth of my son. She washed 4 entire outfits that were clearly marked dry clean only– ruined.
I love those cute little pods! I have 3 children under 5, and they messes they get into-MY goodness! At least once a week they come home from preschool with paint all over their clothes & hair. It’s washable, but still… I’ll have to try these little cuties on their clothes.
Tide pods are another way to simplify my never ending laundry pile! Love that it works great with any temperature.
We love Tide Pods! It’s all we use. Super easy and I don’t have to worry about spills.
We love love Tide pods! We use them all the time now and subscribe to them so we never run out. haha
I am all for making my clothes be in better shape longer! I just started using laundry pods and it is so simple to do laundry, the quicker I can do things the better!
I loves Pods! I started using it last month and I’m glad I did! Amazing!!
I have wanted to try the Tide Pods for some time. Unfortunately, my husband has some allergy issues with Tide, so we haven’t tried them. I think Tide is the best detergent out there, though.
Tide is actually my favorite detergent to use. Makes me excited about doing laundry.
We love our Tide pods! They are so easy to use and get out our tough stains!
Haven’t tried pods in my washing machine. Definitely worth a try. We have an HD machine but use a liquid.
Pods are the way to go. All the grease goes away asap
I love laundry pods, they make it so much easier to do laundry. It’s so important to find a detergent that keeps your clothes clean, especially when you stain something that you love!
I just picked up some of these Tide Pods today. I am excited to see the results this weekend.
My double laundry trouble is grease stains. I swear both my husband and son get greasy spots on their clothing all the time. I love using Tide Pods.
Love the pods… makes it easier for kids and me too! No measuring and spilling, just drop it in before the laundry
I love Tide and sometimes use two pods in a single load, myself. It depends on how much I’m putting into the washer. I love that they actually dissolve, too. I’ve had my fair share of laundry pods that don’t fully dissolve and I end up having to wash the load again. It’s such a waste of water, energy and time.
I love these pods. They are so nice to have. Just have to be careful with kids around. My girls know better thankfully. I think it’s great that they have pods now though because they are less messy.
Uniforms for school are our big challenge! We love Tide Pods – makes life a lot easier.

I need to try these pods. I agree, after trip clothes definitely need a heavy duty wash!
What to come do my laundry. It is very important to make sure you follow washing instruction on your clothing.
I need to pick up some Tide PODS® Plus Downy laundry detergent. I have two teenagers that sure know how to get their clothes dirty.
I really like that these pods simplify doing laundry so much. They’re an important part of our daily laundry routine!
I love Tide. It has always been my favorite laundry soap.
I only wash in cold so it is great that Tide Pods work well in cold. It is great that the fabric soften is put right in so you don’t have to add and measure.
Laundry is NEVER ending in our house! I am still trying to catch back up from our trip last week. I only use pods!
I need these in my life! I am super busy and I HATE laundry. These would help make laundry not be so awful.
Love love love pods! I often use both hot and cold water to wash my clothes. So it’s great to have a product that works with both temperatures.Daily Kabbalah Lesson – 10.19.14

AILSA CHANG, HOST:
The coronavirus outbreak has obliterated the sports calendar in the U.S., but one big event is on schedule. The NFL draft starts tonight. Of course, college football's top prospects won't gather in Las Vegas as planned. Instead, as NPR's Tom Goldman reports, they will take part in the NFL's first ever virtual draft.
TOM GOLDMAN, BYLINE: The NFL draft actually is the second recent example of sports marching on. Last week's WNBA draft, another virtual event, was a success even though there were glitches. When Chicago picked the University of Oregon's Ruthy Hebard, ESPN flashed to a living room where she and her family sat silently staring at the TV.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
RYAN RUOCCO: Ruthy was just waiting for the official announcement. I promise you she hadn't heard it yet.
GOLDMAN: The NFL's Peter O'Reilly is bracing for the dreaded satellite TV delays.
PETER O'REILLY: I'm sure we'll have some of those as well. And you just try to think through the sequencing of elements and shots.
GOLDMAN: O'Reilly is the executive vice president of league events, and he's been thinking through a lot in the run up to the draft, a three-day happening that's now become a massive undertaking. With all those involved in selecting players dispersed around the country, redundancy, O'Reilly says, will be a key to avoiding technological meltdowns.
O'REILLY: We not only have three different modes of communication to get a pick in or to communicate trades.
GOLDMAN: They also have three people from each of the 32 teams authorized to communicate with league officials.
O'REILLY: So if somebody went down - you know, a power outage given a storm at a certain home - the opportunity to have at least two other backup people to get that selection in.
GOLDMAN: The guys getting selected are being asked to do their part, too. Ezra Cleveland is an offensive tackle from Boise State who's gotten a crash course in video production. He's one of 58 prospects the NFL sent smartphones, tripods and lighting to record their big moments.
EZRA CLEVELAND: So there's an always-on camera that's going to be filming, like, the living room. And then the other camera, that's used for interviews after you get drafted.
GOLDMAN: The NFL hopes all the planning will make it easier to focus on the moments when hulking young men realize their football dreams. Twenty-one-year-old Cleveland isn't sure what he'll do, but he does predict spontaneity.
CLEVELAND: For sure no dancing - not sure on the crying. I don't know if it'll all hit me at once or not. We'll see.
GOLDMAN: We know how fans react on draft night.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: Boo.
GOLDMAN: Whether it's snarling New York Jets fans or everyone laying into the NFL commissioner, booing has become a highly anticipated draft tradition, and it will continue virtually. A campaign to raise money for COVID-19 relief asks fans to record their boos and post the video with the hashtag #BooTheCommish. Thanks to Colgate University senior Caio Brighenti, we'll know when there's cheering, too.
CAIO BRIGHENTI: My initial idea was just, you know, let me measure how angry or happy each fan base is during the draft.
GOLDMAN: Brighenti developed a computer program that will instantly collect online fan reaction, and he'll stream it live.
BRIGHENTI: I kind of had that idea before everything got shut down because of corona, so it ends up making even more sense now that there's no live audience.
GOLDMAN: Commissioner Roger Goodell, who'll announce picks from his basement, says he pushed to keep the draft on schedule because he wanted to provide hope. At least it'll offer a few days of diversion as NFL fans dream of how a Joe Burrow, Chase Young or Ezra Cleveland will help their team whenever they actually get to play.

Inmate Jail Records in Other Counties
Jail Records – Information About Those Who Have Been In Jail
Harlan County is located on the eastern bank of the Kentucky River and is the county seat of Harlan County. It is named after Thomas Hawley, a K.S. County judge who was one of the original settlers in what is now Kentucky. This area was an important point in the development of the state and contains many historical landmarks. The city of Louisville is just across the river from Harlan County seat of Russellville.
The process of retrieving these types of jail records can be done directly from the website or through the services of a private investigator. Both of these methods are fast and easy. The internet can be searched to locate information quickly and easily, without having to leave your home. Because they are available to the general public, it is possible for the general public to obtain their own jail records. There is no cost or obligation to use this method.
There is more than a little bit of controversy surrounding the release of jail records. Some people are concerned about the privacy rights of those individuals and organizations searching for the jail records. The United States Constitution protects the right to privacy of those individuals. Other people believe that access to these types of records should not be made public. There are questions that must be answered in order for us to know if these searches are ethical. Those who are promoting the idea that we should allow the general public to have access to these jail records are not necessarily doing so in a positive way.
By allowing the public to have access to these records, you could allow those who are interested to find out personal information about someone such as their name, age, date of birth, marital status and even past criminal activity. If someone has a previous marriage or is involved in criminal activity and has been convicted of a crime, this could be information that they would want to have known. It is also possible for someone to have multiple jail sentences and be on parole.
When it comes to this information being made available to the public, it is often up to each state’s regulations. These regulations will vary depending on which state the person was convicted of and where the offense took place. There may be a small fee associated with access to jail records. However, most states and local governments do not charge for the information. This information can help law abiding citizens feel more confident about the people they associate with and can help them make well informed decisions when it comes to hiring someone to work in their home or for their business.
There are some cases when you may wish to look into the jail records of an individual. For example, if you have reason to believe that your babysitter may be abusing the child that she is supposed to be caring for. In addition, you may want to check up on the person that is living with you or the individual that you are going to hire to either rent a room in your house or to live in your apartment. Jail records can reveal information that can lead to these instances.ACLU Points Texas ‘Travel Advisory’

User research is the soul of great products and services. After all, how else do you capture the minds of your customers and build them into your offerings? More importantly, user research planning helps you manage the process of engaging your customers and getting their outlook on how to improve your product.
In this article, we’ll explain the essence of user research in project management and how to plan and execute user research that tells you what you need to know about your customers.
Why does user research matter in a project?
User research isn’t just another formality you bother with to keep the wise men down at head office satisfied. It’s fundamental to the welfare of every organization since it helps you see your product from the eyes of your customers. Here are the key benefits of user research and user research planning.
1. Keeps your UX team focused on your core goals
Maybe your initial objective for a user research project was to assess why users are avoiding or underutilizing a particular feature you launched weeks ago. Along the line, perhaps a few users pointed out another feature they keep having issues with, and by the end of the day, your focus deviated.
Now, you’ve changed your focus to the new flaw users pointed out in your product. Eventually, you realize you have a lot of fragmented information about several of your product’s features but have failed to narrow down to the main initiative you kicked off the user research project for.
This is where a user research plan can help. A user research plan gives you a blueprint to follow. That blueprint, in turn, keeps you focused on your key objectives for the duration of the research.
2. Gives senior stakeholders an easy way to keep up with your research
C-Suite executives and other project sponsors may not be interested in the micro details around the user research you’re carrying out. In fact, they’re not supposed to be. All they need to do is get a general overview of where your research is headed and a breakdown of the resources needed to put the outcomes of your research to work.
A user research plan offers a 30,000-ft. overview of your user research that you can use to engage higher-level project stakeholders, without boring them with minutiae.
3. Saves your customers’ time and energy
Let’s assume you set up a user research session without a detailed plan. Existing customers are invited to share what they think should be improved in your product. And they do. But before long, you realize you’re essentially holding a chit-chat session.
Your conversations are not getting anywhere since customers just ramble on and on about your product and what they think you should do better. There’s no vision directing them to what you actually want from them.
At the end of each session, you have a lot of feedback that now requires a lot of work to segment, touching virtually every branch of your product.
A user research plan helps you narrow down to the particular issues you’re looking to fix in your end-user’s experience and gets users to share the feedback you need faster.
What to include in a user research plan?
There’s more to creating a user research plan than creating a new Word doc and drafting a bunch of questions. Just like user research demands a strategic, planned approach to get to the root of your UX pain points, it takes a process to create a user research plan that empowers you to ask questions that resonate with your customers.
Here are the key components of an ideal user research plan.
A background statement
This serves as a thesis statement explaining your current situation, the user experience challenges you have at hand, and how you intend to interview users to discover how your product can better serve them.
Stakeholders involved
A breakdown of the stakeholders who’ll be involved in conducting the research, their connection with the research at hand, as well as the teams connected with the research you’re about to undertake will also be required.
Research objectives
What do you intend to achieve by interviewing your customers? Do you wish to understand why they use a feature less? Do you seek a clearer picture of what they expect from your product or to better understand their frustration with your product or service? Define what each research session should help you achieve when you’re done.
Outline your research questions
Once you have a clear idea of the issues you’re looking to learn more about, the next step is to structure the tools that’ll help you do that. Compile a list of questions designed to visualize your product from your customer’s perspective and get an honest picture of what they think about it.
Questions like:
- How do you currently use the [specify] feature on our app?
- Do you use the [insert research subject here]? If yes, what pain point does it solve for you?
- Do you avoid our [insert product feature]? Why?
- What could we offer to make this feature more useful to your needs?
Research questions should be simple and specific. They should get customers to analyze how they interact with your offerings and share them as feedback.
Business objectives
Once you have replies from the user research, what do you intend to do with them in the broader context? Maybe you’re just compiling a report for senior management?
Or perhaps you’re trying to understand how to drive up usage for an underused feature?
Or you’re trying to get a particular product feature to become a major revenue driver?
When all is done and dusted, you should have defined the bigger picture goals your user research project must yield.
Timeline
How long do you expect the timeline for research to last? How will the process progress during that period of time? State that clearly.
Interviewees
Who are the participants you’re looking to profile? Here’s where details like gender, demographics, geography, and income level, etc. come into the picture depending on the types of users you’re building your products for.
A detailed plan serves as a guidebook for carrying out user research so you can focus your efforts on getting the best outcomes efficiently.
Managing user research planning with project management software
It’s important to note that user research planning is a form of project management. Whether you’re outlining the questions to ask or actually engaging with users, user research involves all the typical stages of project management.
You plan your targets, execute them, collect outcomes, and track results. Once you’re done, you can report all the data you’ve collected using a tool that’s easy for all stakeholders to access. Project management software, therefore, offers the ideal tool for managing the user research process from end to end.
A tool like Kissflow Project gives you one cohesive platform where your team can unite to manage the entire project management process.
With Kissflow Project, you can:
- communicate with stakeholders via chat, @mentions, and notifications,

Oct and an excellent time to plant conifers.
National Conifer Week, which took placer earlier this month, highlighted some of the many benefits of growing conifers in your garden.
Conifers are cone-bearing seed plants and include cedars, cypresses, firs, junipers, larches, pines, spruces, and yews.
Whilst being practical and useful, conifers are also visually stunning and can transform a garden into something quite magnificent.
They are a wonderful way of adding colour and shape to your outdoor space especially as many conifers change colour throughout the year.
With several hundred varieties of conifers available in the UK, there is one to suit every type of garden, and they are easy to look after.
They need good drainage and water to get them established, but once growing will need little attention as they are pretty disease-resistant and maintenance free.
In addition to conifers, another way to bring colour to the garden at this time of year is with autumn bedding plants.
One of the most exciting group of plants to brighten up any part of the garden is Heuchera.
Native to north America where their roots, know as alumroot, have been used in traditional medicines for years, Heuchera were originally grown for their flowers – dainty spikes of red, pink and white bells.
They carry their plume like flowers high above their crowns of leaves, but gardeners are now mainly interested in their foliage which comes in a variety of colours.
Heucheras grow in full or partial sun, in well composted soil and are fairly pest resistant.
They can be established as ground cover in many garden situations like under trees where grass could struggle.
October is often a time spent clearing up after the summer and preparing for the winter and spring ahead so there are plenty of jobs to do.
Plant some autumn colour and create a bird feeding area ready for winter.
Move tender plants inside or into a greenhouse to protect against frost and harvest autumn vegetables.
Plant spring flowering bulbs and prune tall growing roses.
Collect falling leaves and dead head all faded flower heads and remove any parts of plants that have died back.By registering for the event, Exhibitor agrees to be bound by the following terms and conditions.

04:38 PM | 20 Aug, 2015
GUJRAT (Web Desk) -Police have arrested four people in Gujrat for declaring a late non-Muslim spiritual leader as Prophet, BBC Urdu reported on Thursday.
Police have registered a case against them for spreading hate material and have got physical remand from the court.
According to Civil Lines Sub-Divisional Police Officer Gujrat Murtaza Gillani, some people distributed ads about prophethood of Fazal Masih on his death anniversary.
In the ads, Fazal Masih was declared Prophet of Allah which brought anger of local Muslims.
The arrested people include three Christian and one Muslim who is owner of printing press.

THE FUTURE IS HERE
The Australian Auto Aftermarket Expo will bring the future to the industry in April 2022 I am truly ecstatic to be able to announce to you that the AAAA will be bringing the industry back together again in 2022 with the official launch of the Australian Auto Aftermarket Expo (AAAExpo)! Co-located with the Collision Repair Expo (CRE), the AAAExpo is the nation’s only comprehensive exhibition for Australia’s $25B aftermarket industry. It is no secret we were disappointed to have to postpone the Australian Auto Aftermarket Expo, but we have been hard at work behind the scenes preparing this incredible industry event, with exciting new features and initiatives soon to be announced. Expo sponsorship levels and exhibitor bookings have been at an all-time high, which indicates the enduring interest and importance of face-to-face industry events and we are sure the Expo and its ‘The Workshop of the Future is Here’ theme will exceed expectations. Indeed, at the time of the official re-launch earlier this month, we already had 84 percent of our exhibitor vacancies booked out which just goes to show that the industry is excited to come back together again at the Expo. To ensure they aren’t disappointed, the show continues to evolve and the launch of a number of exciting new initiatives will build further value for exhibitors and attendees. While there are plenty of announcements to come, the new features I can tell you about now are: • The ‘Workshop of the Future Pavilion’ – featuring a display of state-of-the-art
equipment and technology as well as regular presentations from industry experts covering the very latest information on Workshop Management Systems, EV repair techniques, ADAS calibration and diagnostics and tooling including J2534 pass through technology. • The all-new 4WD Innovation Zone – a massive addition for the Expo which has been welcomed by the booming 4WD sector, providing a unique opportunity for companies involved in 4WD modification, accessories and tuning to promote their company through a trade only B2B platform. • A stand-alone seminar stage on the show floor – for the first time, this show floor stage will deliver a free comprehensive training and education program and enable exhibitors to showcase their latest products, technology and service offerings to a targeted trade audience. And that’s not all. As always, the show will bring together the industry’s best and brightest to showcase hundreds of the country’s leading companies all under one roof and alongside the latest vehicle repair and servicing equipment, parts, tools and accessories, new technology and
trends. With huge exhibitor demand, we expect over 250 of Australia’s leading brands to proudly display across 19,500 sqm of floor space at the MCEC. Other exciting components of the 2022 Auto Aftermarket Expo will include the Awards evening, a comprehensive training and education program, a modified and classic vehicle display area in the show concourse, celebrity appearances, interactive displays and competitions, plus lots more. With free entry available to all members of the automotive trade, the Expo is expected to see 10,000 visitors attend over the three-day event. This is an event run by the industry, for the industry, and after a challenging couple of years for everyone, we are more excited than ever to come together to celebrate, learn, conduct business and network. We can’t wait for April to open the doors and we will do so with the support of some valued sponsors, including Repco and SAPE Group (Sydney Automotive Paints and Equipment) which have taken up the Major Sponsor role for the AAAExpo and CRE respectively. We would like to thank them both for their strong and continued support. To learn more about the AAExpo and CRE, go to page 11 of this magazine or or

FINDING GOOD HELP If you’re finding it hard to attract and keep good, skilled employees, you’re not alone
Capricorn’s State of the Nation Report 2021 found 53 percent of Capricorn Members are very or extremely concerned about the skills shortage, with 43 percent naming it a top five challenge affecting their business. The harsh reality facing the automotive industry in 2021 is that qualified technicians are in short supply and, unless we urgently work to tackle the problem now, the situation is only going to get worse. How do we attract good people when, to take an example, the mining and resources industry (which is moving into a boom phase) can offer six-figure salaries? In fact, there’s a lot we can do—both at an individual business level and an industry level. Our biggest opportunity is to encourage a new generation of talent, as this is our pipeline for the future. But first, we’ll need a change of attitude. State of the Nation found less than half of us believe young people will find the automotive industry an attractive place to make a career. We must reframe our messaging around this, because automotive is a fantastic industry with lots of incredible opportunities and an exciting future. It’s time to start talking up careers in auto and stop talking them down. How do we make the careers we’re selling more attractive? We can start by creating workplaces with strong and positive cultures – the kind of places young people want to work these days. We can tackle pay rates, too. The opportunity here is to review charge-out rates for labour. Ensuring that we are charging what our skills and experience are worth means we can pay our staff more. If you were ever considering bringing on an apprentice, now’s the time to do it. Not just because there’s a lot of support available, but because our industry desperately needs them. We need new apprentices. Without them, this skills shortage will roll on and on, into the future, with no end in sight. The State of the Nation report is full of insights and advice to help you build a stronger business. If you are interested learning more about how you can benefit by joining Capricorn, I encourage you to email join@capricorn.coop to arrange a visit from your local Capricorn representative.

TOOLS TO HELP GROW YOUR BUSINESS From the AAAA
Whether you are running a small business or managing a large company, it is important to be armed with the information you need to make informed decisions for the health and growth of your business. The AAAA continues to invest in targeted market research and business tools for our members. Two important tools that can help your business are as follows. The AAAA Car Parc Data Tool is arguably the most powerful, and popular member research and growth tool for the aftermarket. It helps you better understand your target market, find new customers and grow your business. It offers national level data for manufacturers and distributors, as well as local area information for workshops and retailers.
The Workshop Health Check is a great, easyto-use comparison tool for workshops.
For example, if you are a workshop looking to move to a different location, or a retail chain wanting to expand to multiple locations, the Car Parc Data tool will provide insight into the demographics of each area, and the numbers and types of vehicles within those areas to assist business decisions.
The AAAA says it finds this tool is a great starting place for businesses wanting to improve efficiency or start to grow their business.
You could search for the average age and income of people in Newcastle or St Kilda, find out how many cars per household they have, the age of the Car Parc and the top models of vehicle in that area.
In only a few minutes you can find out how your business is tracking via a benchmarked report based on real industry data.

ASBESTOS SAFETY
The Asbestos Safety and Eradication Agency has recently published a brochure The brochure features a series of important information about asbestos safety in the automotive industry. Asbestos can be found in machinery parts in vehicles manufactured (or with replaced parts) before 2003. Inhaling even small amounts of asbestos fibres can cause serious diseases such as lung cancer, asbestosis and mesothelioma. Asbestos fibres can be released by friable asbestos material or by damaged non-friable material. If you suspect that a material may contain asbestos, you should have a sample tested by a National Association of Testing Authorities (NATA) accredited lab. Asbestos can contribute to an unsafe working environment, and workers who carry
out asbestos-related work must be trained in asbestos identification, safe handling and control measures. To read the brochure, go to For other related information, you can visit your State or Territory’s WorkSafe website.

ELECTRIC VEHICLE TARGETS ARE SEEMINGLY PLUCKED FROM NOWHERE
A new study commissioned by the AAAA shows a large gap between Government electric vehicle (EV) aspirations and what is likely to be the reality On current projections, the Australian Automotive Aftermarket Association (AAAA) says ACA Research predicts that the percentage of EVs on Australian roads would likely be around six per cent by 2030. In recent weeks, the AAAA has learned that at least one state government is planning to decline the registration of all internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles by 2035, a move that, on current projections, would see over 90 percent of car owners with no avenue to register their vehicles. AAAA Chief Executive Officer, Stuart Charity, said that while the AAAA and its members were supportive of greater EV uptake, Governments needed to have a more holistic mindset before announcing unattainable EV targets to score political points. “Governments and Opposition parties are good at announcing very ambitious EV targets without
giving much thought to the supporting services needed to make EVs viable – a lack of recharging infrastructure is the obvious hindrance, but little consideration has been given to what’s required to repair and maintain these cars,” Stuart said. “EV targets are seemingly plucked from nowhere with little rationale given, and as an industry we become despondent every time a new target is announced. “It’s easy to set aspirational sales target for EVs, but what we really need is an in-depth plan on what is required to achieve these targets and to support EV owners – this plan needs to be formulated in consultation with the broader Australian automotive industry. “There is specialist knowledge required to repair and maintain EVs, and by engaging and consulting with industry, we can commit to investing in the tools, training and skills to facilitate a more seamless transition to electric vehicles. “There are long lead times involved in doing this – Government can’t snap its fingers and expect that everything will be there ready to go in the background.” Part of a broader industry research project undertaken by ACA Research, the paper analysed industry trends in automotive service and repair workshops.
“Our research indicates that while the automotive industry is generally in good health and will continue to grow, it is critically constrained by skills shortages,” Stuart said. “Our data indicates that there’s an increasing demand for qualified technicians. Based on the growth of the car parc – which increases by about 325,000 vehicles every year – and the current market share of independent workshops, our industry will likely require a further 5,300 technicians by 2025. This is on top of the current shortage of more than 20,000 technicians. “This data doesn’t consider the added training that existing technicians would need to successfully work on EVs either. “Before Governments mandate EV sales targets, they need to provide our industry with as much notice as possible and engage constructively with us. After all, our members are automotive experts and would provide invaluable insight throughout the process.” For more from the AAAA, visit
ADAS CALIBRATION MADE EASIER Thanks to the Auto Innovation Centre
The Auto Innovation Centre (AIC) is proving its worth to automotive vehicle repairers and windscreen repairers, with a comprehensive Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) calibration solution.
“The AIC team are fully trained in ADAS calibration, and a large number of vehicles are compatible, with the service, usually only taking a few hours to complete.
Utilising the latest ADAS calibration tools from Hella Gutmann and the Robert Bosch Group, the expert AIC team can quickly recalibrate a wide range of new generation vehicles fitted with ADAS systems, including cameras and radars.
“With more and more new-generation vehicles fitted with ADAS systems as standard, ADAS calibration services at the AIC will form an increasingly crucial industry service moving forward.”
Supporting this capability on-site is headlight aiming and OBD diagnostic connectivity.
ADAS calibration is just one of the many service offerings the cutting-edge AIC provides to aftermarket businesses across the country.
“Industry feedback confirmed that windscreen repairers and collision repair workshops wanted an alternate ADAS solution, rather than the need to return to the original equipment manufacturer,” AIC Managing Director, Luke Truskinger, said. “The AIC invested in the latest ADAS calibration equipment to offer a high quality, fast and competitively priced alternative.
From the industry’s leading database of 3D vehicle scans to dynamic vehicle testing, product level testing, 3D printing plus a vehicle fleet and fully equipped workshop for hire, the AIC is setup to support a wide variety of aftermarket business needs. The Auto Innovation Centre is a cutting-edge
facility for the automotive aftermarket. The centre of excellence is increasing capability of automotive companies and aiding in new product development for local and export markets. Utilising the latest technology and equipment and providing crucial data and testing services, the AIC is transforming the automotive aftermarket industry.

Ariarne, who is a Team Bridgestone Australia ambassador for the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, was keen to return to Launceston, where her Olympic dreams were formed, and share her story at an assembly for St Patrick’s College Year 7-10 students, before spending time with the school’s swimming team. “Giving back to the community is something I am so passionate about, and being able to return to St Patrick’s and celebrate my Olympic Games success with them is important to help others realise that dreams are possible,” Ariarne said. “I wouldn’t be an Olympic Gold medallist without the inspiration from some of my heroes and the motivation of those around me, and I’m proud to be able to help inspire the next generation through activities like this.” This is the second community focussed activity that Ariarne has carried out in collaboration with 8

Bridgestone, in line with the ethos of its ‘Chase Your Dream’ campaign. Prior to the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, Ariarne conducted a motivational session with her other former school, St Peters Lutheran College in Brisbane, to inspire the rising swimming stars ahead of local competitions and conduct a workshop with two students – both of whom went on to win their events. “It’s incredibly rewarding and humbling knowing that sharing my own story can make such a difference to others, and shape how they approach going about fulfilling their dreams in the same way I did. That’s why I enjoy being part of Bridgestone’s Chase Your Dream initiative,” Ariarne added. “It’s great to have the support from and be able to collaborate with a company like Bridgestone that shares my passion for giving something back and wants to encourage others to chase their dreams.” Throughout Bridgestone Australia’s Tokyo 2020 activity, the tyre company has shown its commitment to making contributions to society though a number of activities, including the
refurbishment of a basketball court in Sydney’s west with Tokyo 2020 Medallist Joe Ingles and introducing a group of children in Perth to surfing through a surfing school with professional surfer Connor O’Leary. It has also contributed to a state-of-the-art Athletics facility in Adelaide and hosted an intimate training session with Sydney 2000 Olympic Gold Medallist Cathy Freeman, conducted a wheelchair tennis workshop in Melbourne with Rio 2016 Paralympic Gold Medallist Heath Davidson, and conducted the two inspirational school appearances with Ariarne.

ON TO THE NEXT CHALLENGE
In this column, AAAA Director of Government Relations and Advocacy, Lesley Yates, provides an update on the AAAA’s advocacy efforts We hardly had enough time to chill the beer when our Mandatory Data Sharing Law sailed in and out of Parliament. One day you are struggling to explain that a car has more coding than a 787 Dreamliner, and the next you have a brand-new Law that takes everyone by surprise: an overnight success in 12 years.
I will admit to feeling a little overwhelmed and exhausted, we hadn’t quite scheduled the celebration party for the June passing of the legislation and it looks like we need another miracle. Fair enough. But just like mandatory data sharing, ‘Operation Fix the Skills Shortage’ is going to be a colossal effort.
In the aftermath of the new Law, at an industry event I was told “well done, but now can you fix the skills crisis?” I get it. Lack of access to repair and service information and programming, that’s tomorrows’ problem.
This is going to take some pretty clever strategy and considerable combined effort, but just like with Mandatory Data Sharing, along with you, the AAAA members, we can win this battle.
Today’s problem is our members can’t get staff, are overloading their teams and soon will have to turn away customers. The skills challenge is real and every day it gets worse. We anticipate another 1,600 workshops by 2030 and that’s another 5,300 technicians. On current analysis, it looks like we already have a least one vacancy for every physical workshop and another 0.5 gap for mobile services. In 2021 we are short by about 30,000 technicians and when you factor in retirements and new technology demands, well, this is a problem that doesn’t go away and just doesn’t fix itself.
We have to work out the canniest and fastest way forward and then work it the way we worked the Mandatory Data Sharing message – find a solution that we can all believe in and then sell it by playing to our strengths. It feels cruel to have another mountain to tackle – but this time we know so much more about our political footprint, we know how to leverage our local relationships with MPs, and we know how to stay on message and doggedly push a reform agenda. When we combine our efforts we form a powerful lobby group, especially when you consider that there are an average of 169 workshops in every
Lesley Yates, AAAA Director of Government Relations and Advocacy info@aaaa.com.au Australian electorate. We changed the Law – actually we created a brand-new Law – and we are ready to tackle the next mountain. So, addressing the skills gap is our next challenge, but this time we are so much smarter and wiser than we were when we started Mandatory Data Sharing. We know so much more about how to make a difference and how to influence the political and policy agenda. So, buckle up people and be ready to join the fight, because here we go again!

CAN YOU MAKE AN EMPLOYEE GET A COVID-19 VACCINATION?
This question is being asked increasingly frequently in the current environment The Australian Government’s Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources has provided resources for businesses to better understand their rights and obligations regarding COVID-19 vaccinations for their workplace and employees. There are three main situations in which an employer may require an employee to be vaccinated for COVID-19. These are when: • a specific law (such as a state or territory public health order) requires an employee to be vaccinated; or • the requirement is permitted by an enterprise agreement, other registered agreement or employment contract (subject to antidiscrimination laws); or • it would be lawful and reasonable for an employer to give their employees a direction to be vaccinated, which is assessed on a caseby-case basis. The application of these requirements may vary from state to state due to pertinent state laws and public health orders.
Do you have some specific issues you would like to discuss? For legal assistance on requiring employees to be vaccinated, AAAA members can contact the AAAA Employer Assist HR hotline on 1300 735 306.

HIGH COURT CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE TO VICTORIA’S “FLAWED” ELECTRIC VEHICLE TAX Equity Generation Lawyers filed the case on the 16th of September
A High Court legal challenge to Victoria’s controversial electric vehicle tax by two drivers will argue that the State of Victoria lacks the constitutional power to levy a road user charge on electric vehicle drivers. The case was filed on the 16th of September on behalf of the drivers by Equity Generation Lawyers. In July 2021, the Victorian Government introduced a new tax which charges electric vehicle drivers between two,” Chris said. ,” Kathleen,” Jack said. “It discourages everyday Australians from switching to lower emission vehicles, prolonging our dependence on polluting oil.
“It’s bad for Victorians, it’s bad for the climate and we will argue that it is unconstitutional.” In the wake of the High Court Challenge, The Electric Vehicle Council is urging the Victorian Government to demonstrate its commitment to tackling climate change by scrapping the tax.,” Behyad said. “It is fundamentally unfair for the state government to punish Victorians who made the socially and environmentally responsible choice to select an electric vehicle over a combustion engine alternative. “People who buy EVs instead of ICE vehicles.” For more information, visit and

The show will bring together the industry’s best and brightest, and showcase hundreds of the country’s leading companies, all under one roof across 7 – 9 April 2022. With the theme ‘The Workshop of the Future is Here,’ and debuting a range of fantastic new initiatives and features, the Expo will be an unmissable event. The Expo showcases the latest vehicle repair and servicing equipment, parts, tools and accessories, new technology and trends, an Awards evening, plus a comprehensive training and education program. “We are excited to be able to move forward with our preparations for the Expo – an event run by the industry, for the industry,” AAAA Chief Executive Officer, Stuart Charity, said. “After a challenging couple of years for everyone, our industry is more excited than ever to come together to celebrate, learn, conduct business and network. “The automotive industry in Australia is undergoing unprecedented change driven by the complexity of the car parc, changes in vehicle technology and the changing capabilities and needs of our workforce and customers. “Vehicles with advanced driver assistance systems, pass through technology, embedded telematics (‘connected car’), and hybrid and electric powertrains are on Australian roads today.
“These vehicles will need to be safely repaired and maintained for their useful life, anywhere in Australia. “AAAE 2022 will bring together experts from across the industry to provide the very latest information and practical tips on how and when businesses will need to adapt to these changes. “The Expo aims to help visitors prepare for the future, to embrace and capitalise on the evolution of the industry, and the trends and technology that are rapidly developing.” The Expo continues to evolve, and the launch of a number of exciting new initiatives will build further value for exhibitors and attendees visiting the show. This years’ Expo will feature a ‘Workshop of the Future Pavilion’ which will include a display of state-of-the-art equipment and technology as well as regular presentations from industry experts covering the very latest information on Workshop Management Systems, EV repair techniques, ADAS calibration and diagnostics and tooling, including J2534 pass through technology. The launch of the all-new 4WD Innovation Zone is a massive addition for the Expo and has been welcomed by the booming 4WD sector. This dedicated area provides a unique opportunity for companies involved in 4WD modification, accessories and tuning to promote their company through a trade only B2B platform. For the first time, the Expo will incorporate a standalone seminar stage on the show floor, which will deliver a free comprehensive training and education program and enable exhibitors to showcase their
latest products, technology and service offerings to a targeted trade audience. Other exciting components of the 2022 Auto Aftermarket Expo include a modified and classic vehicle display area in the show concourse, celebrity appearances, interactive displays and competitions. “We are very excited to announce that Repco has thrown their support behind the show, taking out the Major Sponsor package for AAAE 2022, and we’d like to thank them for their outstanding support,” Stuart said. “We can’t wait for April to open the doors and finally welcome our industry back together. “We know visitors will have a fantastic time and arm themselves with the knowledge to thrive, ready for the exciting future that awaits.” The 2022 AAAExpo is gearing up to be the best ever. With huge exhibitor demand, expect over 250 of Australia’s leading brands to proudly display across 19,500 sqm of floor space at the MCEC. With free entry available to all members of the automotive trade, the Expo is expected to see 10,000 visitors attend over the three-day event. For more information and to register, head to or
STERLING PARTS RESPONDS TO CUSTOMER WANTS Following recent research, Sterling Parts is seeking to help customers save time and make more money Sterling Parts says it has observed that apart from its obvious impacts, COVID-19 has brought about some noticeable on the ground changes within the Australian Automotive Aftermarket Industry. Sterling Parts has undertaken research into the impacts of COVID-19 and emergent consumer trends over the past year by conducting surveys at multiple times between 2020 and 2021. After conducting this market research and listening to its customers, Sterling Parts says it has confirmed a significant trend and shift in preference towards digital engagement and online ordering. In response to this trend, the company has stated that it has accelerated its investment in online ordering and catalogue improvements. From this research, Sterling Parts has identified the importance for its customers to be
doing what they do best instead of spending time on the phone ordering parts. Sterling Parts says when customers order online, their orders go direct to its warehouse team’s RDS, taking out unnecessary human contact with their order requirements and all orders are then picked and packed in time for scheduled deliveries. Sterling Parts’ research has also confirmed that stock availability is even more important during these times. Sterling Parts says it works closely with its manufacturers to add new products to its range, and its warehouse teams are kept busy with multiple containers arriving on a weekly basis ensuring there is sufficient stock on the shelf to fulfil customer needs.
The company has also heard from its customers that they would like a greater degree of interactions with Sterling Parts. Hearing their feedback, Sterling Parts will be attending the 2022 AAA Expo in Melbourne where its team looks forward to spending valuable time with customers and promoting its range.

MOTORACTIVE WINS AGAIN
MotorActive has again taken out the SuperCheap Auto Retailers Choice Award Announced at the 2021 Supercheap (SCA) Auto Trade Partner virtual forum, this is the seventh, consecutive time MotorActive has triumphed over the many other suppliers to SCA – which as part of the Super Retail Group has firmly established itself as one of Australia’s Top 10 retailers. MotorActive notes that this is quite an achievement to be the award’s only recipient since its introduction in 2014 (SCA did not conduct awards in 2020).
This annual award is voted on by team members across the SCA store network. “We’re over the moon to win it again,” MotorActive’s Managing Director, Bruce Morrison, said. “I believe it’s a great reflection on our hardworking, long-standing sales force and the highly-engaged way they support and motivate the people at the sales coal face.” MotorActive National Sales Manager, Michael Hogan, echoed this point. “A huge congratulations to our retail team for their continued efforts, despite all the challenges we’ve faced directly from COVID,” Michael said. “The focus, dedication and representation of MotorActive and its brands has been first class, I’m very proud.” This is not the only award MotorActive picked up during the 2021 SCA Forum – it also scored the Outstanding Strategic Partner Award. “We were especially delighted to also pick up the Strategic Partner Award,” Bruce said. “This is of particular importance right at this point, as having a solid strategic view is really important to both our businesses as we come out of COVID.” MotorActive represents Meguiar’s, Mobil 1 and ColorSpec.

EXPLORING INDUSTRY TRENDS ACA Research takes a look at the latest trends in the Australian automotive space The past five years have seen significant change in the Australian automotive industry. From a new vehicle perspective, we have seen brands entering the market, and some muchloved brands exiting. Technologies have changed, with features such as ADAS becoming common-place, and vehicle servicing has continued its progression to a technology-led process. While these trends are exciting and play an important role in shaping the future of the industry, focusing too much on them can sometimes result in losing track of the fundamentals of automotive servicing. Going back to basics, the last five years saw the Australian car parc increase from 16.8m to 18.1m vehicles, as an additional 1.3 million passenger and light commercial vehicles came on road. This increase in the market led to significant growth in the annual servicing task, increasing the demand for both workshops and technicians. Pleasingly, the aftermarket has clearly risen to this challenge, with 1,700 additional workshops operating now compared to five years ago.
From an aftermarket perspective, this also means the average vehicle is getting older, which should shift more of the servicing task away from dealerships and into independent or chain workshops.
Figure Two. Source: ABS Census of Motor Vehicles
In addition to this, by mapping supply and demand against each other, we can project that servicing these additional 1.6m vehicles in 2025 will require an additional 2,300 workshops on top of those currently operating, staffed by 5,300 technicians and support staff. While we know that many chain workshop operators are targeting growth, achieving this outcome will require a concerted effort across the industry.
Figure One. Source: ABS Counts of Australian Businesses
With 24,600 aftermarket workshops now operating around the country, this provides jobs for almost 66,000 technicians and administrative staff. Despite this, we know that resourcing remains a challenge, with many of them actively recruiting for trained technicians. Furthermore, automotive apprenticeship completions are unsteady, which suggests this will continue to remain an issue for the foreseeable future. Our data supports this, suggesting that this trend is only going to accelerate, with the AAAA Critical Industry Issues Report forecasting growth of almost 10 percent in the Australian passenger and light commercial vehicle car parc over the next five years. Even though new vehicle sales have been inconsistent off the back of COVID-19 lockdowns and ongoing global new vehicle supply shortages, reduced vehicle scrappage means annual growth rates have held largely constant as consumers and businesses put off replacing existing vehicles.
Figure Three. Source: ABS Census of Motor Vehicles, ABS Counts of Australian Businesses, ABS Census of Population and Housing.
This projected demand is concerning given workshops already cite the shortage of trained technicians as one of the most significant challenges they face. Ultimately, while international borders will reopen and workshops will again be able to source skilled technicians from overseas, migration caps mean this strategy cannot fully solve the problem. This highlights the importance of the work being undertaken by independent and chain workshops, training organisations, and industry bodies such as the AAAA to increase the appeal and consideration of a career as an automotive technician, building the workforce of tomorrow, today.

ZF Aftermarket shapes new era of collaboration and reveals product highlights As part of a very different looking Automechanika 2021, ZF Aftermarket shared an increased offering for cars, commercial vehicles, trucks, trailers and buses, following the recent acquisition of WABCO.
improved brake actuation, replacing the vacuum brake boosters and, if necessary, the vacuum pump with its associated cables, sensors, switches and control units.
Enabling an attractive mobility experience for everyone, new products such as the WABCO Modular ABS Sensors and the TRW Electric Brake Booster for e-vehicles were presented at the Digital ZF Aftermarket at Automechanika 2021 event which was held from September 14 to 16.
With this TRW system, ZF Aftermarket says it is offering a genuine OE innovation at an early stage, which not only meets high comfort requirements and safety standards, but also supports the recovery of braking energy and thus the range of purely electric vehicles.
A key topic of the digital trade show was sustainability. Offering remanufacturing, repair and retrofit solutions to save materials and reduce emissions is one aspect of ZF’s sustainability roadmap and continuing to source green energy for its factories is another.
A software function also ensures that the vehicle is held securely in parking mode by the electric parking brake, meaning that a mechanical parking brake can be dispensed with.
For the first time, ZF Aftermarket will introduce the #greenaftermarket label for a range of TRW brake pads. The digitisation of mobility is picking up speed. As a result, customers’ individual demands for flexibility, speed and comfort are increasing. More efficient combustion engines, hybrid- or purely electric drives require modular and scalable solutions for the braking system. The TRW-branded Electric Brake Booster (EBB) uses a special electronic system to provide
ZF Aftermarket passes this experience on to its service partners - for example, in training courses on topics such as high-voltage drives.
Also announced at the Digital ZF Aftermarket at Automechanika 2021 event was the WABCO modular ABS Sensors., which significantly speeds up the repair process, reduces downtime and lowers costs.
Customer-centric, resource-saving, and costeffective, the latest WABCO product solves a common problem.
Thanks to the special flexibility in application, workshops no longer need to keep a large inventory of different sensors.
When commercial vehicles come to the workshop with a defective ABS sensor, a specific version of this part has to be ordered, which may not be in stock at the dealer. A modular ABS sensor concept which counteracts this problem has been developed for independent workshops. It consists of a short ABS sensor with the standard
Depending on just three parameters (sensor type, length, and connector), they can replace hundreds of variants with just a few products. A combination of two existing ABS sensors, ten extension cables and eight adapters can replace over 400 OE references. For more from ZF, go to Australian Automotive Aftermarket Magazine October 2021

TRANSPORT FOR NSW LAUNCH AI DATA MINING PROJECT The project is set to rate roads for safety and seeks to lower the death toll
In a world where people are embracing domestic road trips due to the impact of the pandemic, a recently launched initiative in New South Wales aims to use artificial intelligence (AI) to make our road travel safer. Transport for NSW (TfNSW) has established a timely project using cutting-edge AI to convert raw data from our roads into an international standard five-star rating system, as well as to potentially develop predictive algorithms for fatality and injury outcomes. The project is supported by the iMOVE Cooperative Research Centre and is being led by TfNSW and partners, including the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), the International Road Assessment Programme (iRAP) and geospatial data experts, Anditi. The project will deliver up usable data for 20,000km of New South W ‘AiR Australian Government is linking infrastructure funding to “measurable improvements in safety” and state agencies are setting network and
project-level star ratings before greenlighting public spending. The 2018-2020 National Road Safety Action Plan set targets for 90 percent of travel on national highways and 80 percent of travel on state highways to meet a three. IRAP’s Global Innovation Manager and Cities Specialist Monica Olyslagers is the project manager. She said the use of AI and machinelearning would significantly speed up the task of star-rating roads to enhance public safety. “Raising the standard of the world’s roads to a three-star or better standard for all road users will help to focus policy and investment. With crash costs typically halving with each incremental improvement in star rating the potential for threestar or better roads to save lives is significant,” Monica said.
In recent years, between 1,100 and 1,200 people have lost their lives to road crashes on Australian roads each year, and more than 40,000 have suffered lifelong, debilitating injuries. “The use of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to collect the data has potential to reduce costs and increase the frequency and accuracy of data,” Monica said. “Making faster and more affordable data collection possible means that safety assessments can be done on an annual basis across the whole road network.”,” Ian said.

FRANKFURT’S AUTUMN TRADE FAIR SEASON UNDERWAY Automechanika Frankfurt Digital Plus and the Hypermotion Frankfurt conference and trade fair were completed successfully in September Following a forced, one-and-a-half-year break, from 14 to 16 September Messe Frankfurt was finally able to welcome exhibitors and trade visitors to two of its own events at its home venue. Three hundred and eighty-eight exhibitors took part in the special Automechanika Frankfurt Digital Plus event and the Hypermotion Frankfurt conference and trade fair. Of these, 53 percent were present in person in Frankfurt, with the remainder participating online. Approximately approximately 25,000 interactions in all. The streams were viewed 21,000 times, while 1,600 video calls were made. “The trade fair engine has been started, and the mobility and logistics industry got everything underway,” Messe Frankfurt Member of the Executive Board, Detlef Braun, said. “Finally, exhibitors and trade visitors had the opportunity to get together in person again and make new contacts – both on site on the exhibition grounds and on the digital event platform with international industry players. “Following a long dry spell, the familiar trade fair feeling was quickly established – only this time it was with masks and a requirement that people be vaccinated, tested or recovered. It is a good warm-up for Automechanika Frankfurt and Hypermotion next year.” The concept behind both events – an inperson trade fair supplemented by the ability to participate digitally – was well-received by exhibitors and visitors alike. “I am delighted that we are back at Automechanika – in person,” SATA Managing Director, Albrecht Kruse, said.
“It is our most important trade fair. I think that the hybrid format of this year’s event has been a complete success, particularly for the international public that is unable to travel to Frankfurt, as it makes it possible for them to be a part of the action. “Even so, I believe that meeting with customers in person is extremely important.

COVER STORY
TERRAIN TAMER: INNOVATION MEETS OLD SCHOOL SERVICE On the surface, the Terrain Tamer story is simply one of a spare parts business that has grown to see international success
But at its heart, it is one of a company that has not only survived but thrived thanks to a consistent, ongoing culture of listening, problem solving and customer obsession. Coupled with an innate understanding of what is needed to take on the Australian Outback, this culture is what has driven five decades of innovation. When 24-year-old Frank Hutchinson and his business partner Don Kyatt started their company in 1969, they did so with little more than their computer-like minds for Parts Interpreting, and a few hundred dollars. But more than this, Frank’s acute will to serve and commitment to service would become the driving force behind what would eventually become the company’s true north, the Terrain Tamer brand. This emphasis on service was made clear to everyone who worked with Frank. Without the customer, there was no business, so when someone came in with a vehicle, they wanted to make sure they got the right part. If it wasn’t in stock, they would find it from somewhere and if they couldn’t get a new part, they would try reconditioned. If a part had failed, they looked at why and how it could be strengthened or upgraded. Frank’s ‘service first’ policy and determination to get whatever was needed, delivered as quickly as possible, was how he would repeatedly win customers to his business – customers like tour operator Bill King, who operated out of Melbourne and pioneered tours into the red centre in the
24
Australian Automotive Aftermarket Magazine October 2021
1960s and 70s, at a time when there was no Stuart Highway, no road houses or roadside assistance and more often than not, no other people in sight. There was no beaten track, and this meant taking his tourists through rough, uncharted terrain and private cattle station gates to eventually reach their destination of Ayers Rock (Uluru). Of course, with these conditions came breakages, and in the isolated and unforgiving outback, where a poor-quality part can literally be the difference between life and death, a need for something stronger and more reliable arose. When Bill King remembers the early days of his business, he recalls Frank’s dedication to customer service. “When I visited a dealer, I was just another customer, but when I went to Frank for a part, I was Bill,” Bill said. Frank’s determination to really talk to customers
like Bill, find out what they needed and create a solution, was the foundation of Terrain Tamer. And as the 4WD community grew over the years, the goal was to do the same for the problems of mine operators, cattle station owners and recreational drivers around the world. In the early days, others weren’t interested in creating parts that were stronger than OE, seeing it as simply trying to fix what wasn’t broken, but Terrain Tamer was. Innovation had driven them from the start and the ideas they had, that came from talking to their customers, watching how people actually used their vehicles and how mechanics did their work, was the future they envisioned for their business. Terrain Tamer invested heavily in overseas travel throughout the 1970s and 80s, allowing the team to meet with the OE manufacturers of the world and come up with solutions to these customer problems, essentially laying the groundwork for the future. The customers themselves couldn’t do it themselves, as it requires such a large-scale investment in tooling. The manufacturers couldn’t do it because they didn’t have the required understanding of the customer. And Terrain Tamer says the opposition couldn’t do it because they weren’t focused specifically on 4WD customers. It was only Terrain Tamer that had the critical mass needed to bridge the gap and bring the solution together. Everything that was done was grounded in dayto-day use, and the information that Frank had gathered from his customers, not just on what the Terrain Tamer team thought would be better. If it wasn’t going to improve the use of the vehicle, no one would want it and it wasn’t worth modifying.
COVER STORY
When Terrain Tamer introduced kits to its range, for instance, they were almost unheard of in the industry. Previously, overhauling a gearbox or transfer case meant sourcing a hundred parts separately, often from different suppliers. It was extremely easy to forget something and then be delayed while waiting for that last part to arrive. Terrain Tamer says it changed the game by putting together complete kits that included exactly what was needed for any job. Terrain Tamer knew from talking to its customers that for the recreational four-wheel driver, spending their time off-road and in the bush was a priority, not having to spend time fixing their broken-down vehicle. For mechanics, time is expensive, so when a car comes in that needs a wheel bearing adjustment, it is easy to go to the shelf and grab a Terrain Tamer
kit with everything inside, rather than missing one or two crucial pieces. When operators of 79 Series LandCruisers were experiencing an issue in the vehicle’s gearbox, where the short spline of the main shaft was prone to stripping, even in easy conditions, Terrain Tamer addressed the problem by designing a shaft with a longer spline, doubling the surface area. A similar issue with the vehicle’s input gear was where the inner spline was also stripping during use. By removing the spacer that was connected to the original gear and instead lengthening the inner spline, Terrain Tamer made a part that was far more hard wearing. Terrain Tamer’s modifications essentially made the gearbox three times stronger, provided a significant increase in the performance of the vehicle’s driveline and was the precursor for many modified parts to come.
The company was now putting its name behind parts that they had developed and created themselves. It was they who were now responsible for the quality of these parts and ultimately, the safety of customers. Terrain Tamer says this has meant that from the beginning, the rigorous research, development and testing that every part has gone through before it is able to bear the Terrain Tamer stamp has ensured that “every part is at least equal to original equipment and often far exceeding the standard.” Manufacturers are reportedly hand selected from the best in their fields in the world, often resulting in collaborative relationships where ideas are shared, ensuring parts that are created with Terrain Tamer tooling are of the highest quality and cannot be replicated by competitors, says Terrain Tamer. So many of Terrain Tamer’s solutions that are developed for the Australian market are then shared with the wider global market via the Terrain Tamer network across 80 countries. This allows for expensive tooling to be justified, and it is that connecting tissue that has grown the company to be as truly international as it is today, with 17 branches worldwide, and almost as many branches overseas as here in Australia, including Africa, Europe, New Zealand, PNG and Fiji. Today, the business remains independent and family owned, having carved out a unique international niche among the industries major corporations. This is in no small way due to Frank’s belief, right from the very beginning, that his company is not just a business of parts, but of people. The same culture that is ingrained in Terrain Tamer’s head office of innovation that stems from having had that deep connection to the customer, is replicated in each of those branches, and over 50 years on, Frank is often still last to leave each night as he drives the culture overseas. It stemmed from Frank all those years ago, but took up a life of its own when he trained the first generation of managers, who then trained the next generation, who have now been with Terrain Tamer for over 25 years. Frank’s son Brent has spent his life in the company, learning from those who have been there almost from the beginning, and is now the General Manager. As a result, Terrain Tamer’s people are those who listen to the customers’ needs by instinct and connect the need with the innovative solution, day in and day out. Terrain Tamer says it has been this culture that has propelled the company and the brand forward, decade after decade for 52 years, and ensures they will be of great service to the industry as they continue to be discovered by 4WD specialists around the world.

Diagnostic support cases range across a wide range of vehicle brands and are managed through the OEM-Trained Master Technicians who are experienced brand specialists. A recent IVS 360 case involved a Peugeot 2008 model year. The vehicle’s air conditioning was inoperable as was the air conditioning compressor. The IVS 360 Master Technicians supported the customer with the following advice:
Affected Vehicles: • Peugeot - All models (2005 - 2021) | Models where the Under Bonnet Fuse Box controls feed and earth to the Air Con Compressor • Citroen - All Models (2005 - 2021) | Models where the Under Bonnet Fuse Box controls feed and earth to the Air Con Compressor
Faults: The technician ran a vehicle scan using his DrivePro device and found the following DTCs: • B994 (0994) Air conditioning compressor clutch control fault: Short circuit to earth Body Control Module - BSI • B995 (0995) Air conditioning compressor displacement control fault: Short circuit to earth Body Control Module – BSI
Symptoms The technician accessed the IVS 360 live diagnostic support service from Opus IVS directly via his device for support and repair guidance. The technician explained to the IVS 360 team that alongside the inoperable air conditioning unit, the vehicle was also displaying various other symptoms. These included: 1. Air Conditioning inoperable. 2. Air Conditioning Compressor inoperable. 3. No feed to Air Con Compressor Clutch. 4. No / or bad earth to Air Con Compressor Clutch. 5. Varying supply voltage to the Air Con Compressor Clutch.
Possible Causes The IVS 360 team explained that the symptoms displayed were an indicator that there could be some faulty wiring between the under bonnet fuse box and the Aircon Compressor. They also suggested that these symptoms could be caused by a; 1. Faulty under bonnet fuse box. 2. Bad earth to the Aircon Compressor. 3. Varying supply voltage to Air Conditioning Compressor Clutch.
Repair Steps After identifying the possible causes for the fault, the IVS 360 team took the technician through some necessary steps to pinpoint the correct cause of the fault so he could conduct the necessary repairs. The steps provided included: 1. Checking for signs of water ingress to under Bonnet Fuse Box. The technician was advised to replace the under-bonnet fuse box if there were any signs of water damage. 2. Using the manufacturers’ wiring information, the technician was advised they should also check the wiring from under bonnet fuse box to Air Con Compressor Clutch and to repair any high resistances, or incorrect voltages. The IVS 360 team advised that Air Con Compressor Clutch supply voltage from under bonnet fuse box varies from 4v to 14v. This is normally caused by a bad earth to the Compressor and / or Under Bonnet Fuse Box.
Result After carrying out the provided checks, the technician found signs of water ingress and therefore replaced the under-bonnet fuse box. After replacing the unit all symptoms were resolved and the vehicle was returned to the customer.

AUSSIE FUEL INJECTOR COMPANY DEVELOPS WORLD-FIRST TECHNOLOGY XS Injectors has developed a game-changing piece of new technology called EXACT MATCH The Melbourne-based performance fuel injector business says this world-first technology provides performance vehicle tuners with tuning data that is exactly matched to each set of injectors, not based on data for generic flow rates. “Performance tuners know all too well that tuning modified engines after upgrades is a very precise business,” XS Injectors Managing Director, Simon Richards, said. “The smallest of margins can make a huge difference, especially when it comes to fuel delivery. “Even with the best technology, leading fuel injector companies might work with tolerances of up to nine percent between how their injectors perform against what the tuning data outlines in the files they provide to the tuners. “Well, that’s all about to change.” XS Injectors says the level of testing it has developed is like nothing before seen in the industry. Whilst the testing of fuel injectors is governed by International Standard J1832 and is tightly controlled, the allowable tolerances just don’t work for performance tuners who are looking for every horsepower, it says. XS Injectors explains that its injectors provide tolerances within one percent on flow rate and two percent on dead times and each injector has over 6,500 flow points recorded to create a flow profile. XS Injectors states that the result is the world’s most accurate performance fuel injector. Further, there is the added benefit of EXACT MATCHing each set of injectors, which is also part of the XS Injectors story. The key to an ultimate fuel injector, and therefore the fuel delivery tune, is having all fuel injectors working at not only exactly the same performance, but also adjusting the tune to match the flow rate. It is widely known that a set of 1000cc injectors generally never flow at exactly 1000cc; a set might all be tightly matched but could flow at 915cc or even 1001cc, explains XS Injectors. “As an example, say a set of eight injectors all flow at 943cc, the generic tuning data, that is provided from injector companies and used by tuners, 28
Australian Automotive Aftermarket Magazine October 2021
is likely to be calculated right on or at 1000cc,” Simon said. “In this example case, the tune would be off by 5.7 percent. Whilst high end tuners would continue to adjust the tune to get it perfect, this can take hours. “In this XS Injectors example, if all eight injectors flowed at 943cc, then the completely individualised tuning data file would be for that dedicated set complete with a 943cc flow rate. “The end result is perfectly tuned injectors without any need for further tuning adjustments!”
XS Injectors says that further to its revolutionary development of flow rate matching, the EXACT MATCH technology also provides the same enhancement for the deadtime performance of each injector. The XS Injector tuning files are also already adjusted to exactly match the deadtimes of each set. The EXACT MATCH tuning data files for all popular tuning software and ECUs are available for immediate download from the XS Injectors website: To access the files, simply type in the individual

Injector ID into the Data Download section of the website and the report and data files are instantaneously available. When asked why XS Injectors went to these lengths to develop this world-first technology, Simon explained: “Performance Tuners not only in Australia but around the world have consistently said they were looking for better and more tightly matched injector sets. “So, four years ago we decided to develop a system that surpassed anything on the market. “We employed a renowned engineer and a world
class data analyst to develop this new technology from the ground up. The idea was to take performance injectors to a new level and create a new standard for testing and tuning data.” Simon also backs his claims of XS Injectors’ game changing technology by offering another world first when it comes to the product warranty. “We have full faith in our product in both the development and quality, so all XS Injectors are backed by an unconditional lifetime warranty which I believe is not offered by any other performance fuel injector,” Simon said.
XS Injectors was founded by Simon Richards and his father Stewart, who can not only stake claim to being one of Australia’s first ever fuel injection specialists, but collectively have almost 80 years of experience in fuel delivery. According to those behind XS Injectors, this niche Melbourne company is about to take the world by storm and represents the ingenuity that is so globally respected from Australian performance businesses.

COMPLETE CLUTCH SYSTEMS From Australian Clutch Services’ ClutchPro
ClutchPro continues to develop its range of aftermarket clutch system accessories and components to incorporate as many components as possible for the entire clutch system, from the pedal all the way to the flywheel. ClutchPro is the standard replacement division of Australian Clutch Services and says it offers a comprehensive range of clutch kits and associated accessories including hydraulics, bearings, tools, forks and cross-shafts. With the range continuing to expand, ClutchPro is encouraging workshops to inspect all components in the clutch system for wear or damage when replacing the clutch to ensure optimum performance and durability for the new clutch assembly. “We always encourage technicians to check all areas of the clutch system for wear to ensure that the necessary components can be replaced whilst the transmission is removed from the vehicle,”
Australian Clutch Services Sales Manager, Colin Jevons, said. “By offering a comprehensive range of accessories and components, we are providing the opportunity for workshops to place an order and receive everything they may need in one go, saving freight and time for the customer.” ClutchPro says that components throughout the clutch system can have a major impact on the performance of the clutch and can often cause release issues.
bearing ends up operating on a different area on the guide tube and the pedal can feel uneven. “As a result, we suggest technicians inspect all key areas of the clutch system and if in doubt, give our sales and technical support team a call to discuss. “With an extensive nationwide distribution network and stock of popular components kept around the country, we aim to provide these components as quickly as possible to ensure the vehicle can be repaired and put back on the road efficiently.” For more information about the ClutchPro range of clutch kits, hydraulics and accessories, please call 1800 CLUTCH or visit
“We often see customers replacing a clutch only to find that the clutch itself had not failed, but another component in the system has caused the issue such as the hydraulics or a clutch fork,” Colin said. “Another common issue can be a worn transmission guide tube that can seem fine on the old clutch unit, but as soon as the new assembly is fitted and the installed height changes, the

the Noise, Vibration, Resonance and other disturbing harmonic signatures generated by the vehicle’s powertrain.
SGF says its Flexible Drive Couplings are fitted as Original Equipment to many RWD and AWD vehicles by vehicle manufacturers including Ford, General Motors, Chrysler, BMW, Mercedes Benz, VW and Hyundai.
When selecting a flexible coupling, SGF says you should remember each vehicle’s flexible coupling is unique and even if they are dimensionally similar, the harmonic (NVH) performance is different. Each SGF coupling is specifically tuned for each vehicle application.
The purpose of a Flexible Coupling is to: a) Effectively transmit rotational torque. b) Compensate for axial, radial and angular misalignment in the vehicle’s drivetrain. c) Be engineered to handle the operating and torque peaks of the engine. d) Be application tuned to eliminate or reduce
SGF says that with its couplings, you get the original; the same as fitted to the vehicle when it was built. SGF states that its product advantage and competency is based on its trademarked Tenpu fibre technology; a combination of unique cord inlays and rubber material that operate in tension load.
Unlike common rubber couplings that work with shear load or pressure load on the rubber, the tension load principle ensures that the cord inlays transmit most of the load, providing a better tolerance to shock loads and a higher power density ratio resulting in the ability to transmit higher torque with a smaller coupling. SGF Couplings are made in Germany. SGF says it has manufactured over 90 percent of OEM Flex Couplings for vehicles since 1946. Original SGF Couplings have the SGF logo/part number moulded or printed on the coupling itself. SGF says you need to just identify this number when replacing to ensure you are supplied genuine SGF. With driveshafts rotating in excess of 3000 RPM, SGF says you need to beware of potential NVH and safety hazards from inferior copy couplings.

DICTIONARY OF POPULAR SUSPENSION ERRORS: PART 2 The Bilstein Academy is seeking to clarify technical misunderstandings Recently, the Bilstein Academy supplied information to clarify and largely dispel some of the popular myths surrounding the suspension. However, it says there are still more dos and don’ts about shock absorbers and more to be covered and so in this article, Bilstein examines a popular test procedure for radial play on the piston rod, which does not necessarily lead to the desired result. It also clarifies what spring travel limiters can really do – and what they definitely cannot. Last but not least the Head of the Bilstein Academy, Rainer Popiol, gets to the bottom of the thesis that the “hardness” of a suspension system corresponds directly to its performance like a sports car. When it comes to checking the suspension, this scene is still widespread in the workshops: the mechanic checks the lateral play on the newly installed – or even old – shock absorber at the extended piston rod. “This is not a good idea, because there is an extremely long lever arm here, and thus poor support of the piston rod is guaranteed. The almost inevitable diagnosis is therefore too much radial play,” Rainer said. “In order to correctly determine any radial play that may exist, the piston rod/working piston must be in the design position of the vehicle/suspension. “This is the main working area of the damper and here the piston rod is guided and supported by both the locking package and the working piston. “It should be noted, however, that no standardised guide values exist, which makes an assessment difficult.” Bump stops are also much discussed, but this
does not refer to the existing pressure stops/ buffers, but rather to components for retrofitting. In forums, and to some extent also on the part of parts manufacturers, Bilstein notes it is often incorrectly claimed that these protect the suspension and body during the compression process. “Bump stops take away the necessary spring travel from the vehicle. They prevent the shock absorber from sensibly reducing the dynamic vibrations from the suspension. If the shock absorber rests on the bump stop, the driving behaviour is very hard and ‘bumpy;’ the car can hardly be driven sensibly,” Rainer said. “Thus, the opposite of the initial statement is more likely to be true: the bump stops do not prevent suspension parts and body from damage; these are rather overstressed and therefore wear out faster. “Regardless of such misconceived advantages, these components are mainly used in the following case: a vehicle was lowered and then a wider wheel/tyre combination with an unsuitable offset was installed. “The bump stops are then intended to prevent the tyres from grinding on the lower edges of the mudguards or on the rear side panel. But this motive also produces suboptimal results: for reasons of safety and performance, a fast vehicle should always have sufficient spring deflection. “Only in this way can the shock absorber do its job well and reduce vibrations.” Bilstein says there is another myth in the tuning environment: the harder the suspension is, the more it feels like driving a sports car. However, does this thesis really stand up to closer scrutiny?
“The often-quoted rule of thumb simplifies far too much and can therefore be considered wrong,” Rainer said. “The fact is: even a sports suspension must be balanced. Extremes are often counterproductive.” Bilstein says however that if the initial statement is put into perspective and supported by further measures, you can still come to terms with the argumentation. Of course, lowering the suspension can bring advantages for driving dynamics. It is correct that lowering of the vehicle’s centre of gravity, which must be precisely defined, reduces the tendency to roll and improves the driving dynamics with the maximum possible residual spring travel. When using sports springs, preferably in conjunction with suitable high-performance shock absorbers, a technically reasonable measure must always be taken into account: 40mm lower means 40mm less spring deflection travel at the axle. Bilstein says sufficient residual spring travel should, however, always remain available. It explains that when lowering the vehicle, the quality and performance of the components used is also decisive, stating that if, for example, the dampers are tuned too hard, this can have a negative effect on tyre traction. Therefore, it says not every car that looks extremely deep and sporty can live up to this promise in terms of handling. For more information, visit Photo: Copyright Bilstein 2021

BOSCH DOES AWAY WITH THE “CHARGING BRICK” World’s first electric car charging cable with integrated technology for flexible recharging without a control box Bosch’s new flexible smart charging cable with integrated control and safety technology does without the usual “charging brick” – as the bulky in-cable control box is colloquially known – when charging at a 230-volt power socket. This means the flexible smart charging cable, which celebrated its world premiere at IAA Mobility 2021, weighs less than three kilograms. Bosch explains that on average, this is a good 40 percent less than conventional charging cables with a control box. The high-tech cable saves not only weight but also space in the trunk: because it comes with adapters for Type 2 and household plugs,
drivers who want to be free to choose whether to recharge from a power socket at home or from a charging station on the road no longer need a second cable. “With this universal charging cable, Bosch is making electromobility even more customerfriendly,” Bosch Powertrain Solutions Division President, Dr Uwe Gackstatter, said. “We want to make the new cable standard equipment for electric vehicles.” Bosch expects to start selling the cable to vehicle manufacturers and drivers in mid-2022. The three-phase cable enables so-called mode 2 and mode 3 AC charging at up to 22 kilowatts. With the flexible smart charging cable, there is no need for a wallbox when recharging at home. The technology integrated into each of the plugs makes the recharging process safe and reliable. The type 2 connector at the vehicle end of the cable contains the components for controlling and monitoring the charging power. At the other end, the household plug with adapter houses the temperature control and a residual current device. This ensures that no overloading or overheating occurs even during regular recharging at a household power socket with up
to 2.3 kilowatts of charging power. If necessary, the safety technology deactivates the cable before the situation becomes critical. To be able to integrate the control and safety technology into the compact cable connectors, Bosch developers have significantly reduced the size of the electronics components compared to previous applications in control boxes. Here, they benefited from the miniaturization expertise that it is constantly developing within the company. “The flexible smart charging cable is a great example of how Bosch is using innovative hightech to make everyday life easier while helping electromobility achieve broader acceptance,” Dr Gackstatter said.

CATERAN PREMIUM TURBOCHARGER OIL SUPPLY LINE KITS
Particulate contamination of engine lubricating oil is a major cause of turbocharger failure The turbocharger oil supply line is a common place for particulate contamination to build up. In normal vehicle operation the metal oil supply lines are subject to heat transmitted via conduction from both the turbocharger bearing housing and the engine itself. Every time the engine is stopped and the oil inside the line stops flowing, the stationary residual oil is subjected to the transmitted heat and a small proportion of that stationary oil cokes and adheres to the inside of the metal line, particularly wherever there is a bend in the metal line. Built up coked oil material is extremely abrasive and will cause significant damage to the hydrostatic oil film supported bronze journal bush (bearing) and the main shaft of the turbocharger. Most turbocharger oil supply lines have an internal diameter of 4mm. Cateran says it is impossible to be certain that these lines are internally clean through the use of normal cleaning solvents and compressed air and should therefore be replaced whenever the turbocharger is replaced.

FACTORY APPROVAL VS MEETS OR EXCEEDS What’s the difference, and why you should care
Vehicle Manufacturers spend many millions of dollars and countless hours of testing and validation in the development of ever more technologically advanced engines. Many of these advancements are driven by the need to meet increasingly more stringent emissions standards, better fuel efficiency targets, longer and longer service intervals as well as the demands and reliability expectations of consumers. It is little wonder then that Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) have each introduced a proliferation of exacting and extremely specific oil specifications – unique to themselves. The days of being able to get by just from using an oil of the right viscosity are long gone.
Meet the myth Whenever an OEM develops a new formulation in conjunction with their oil partner, they make the specifications available to the broader market so that independent oil blenders and manufacturers can then formulate their own oil that meets the specification – that’s where ‘Meets or Exceeds the specification’ comes from. However, aftermarket lubricant manufacturers are not required to secure any explicit acknowledgment, sanction or approval from an OEM to make the claim their product “meets or exceeds” a particular standard. Nor is there any Australian standard, or peak body that independently issues compliance verification. Once you understand what’s involved in verifying an oil meets the factory specification – you start to wonder, how are the independents actually testing each and every individual oil? How exactly are they verifying compliance?
Factory approved With an increasing array of varying quality base stocks being introduced into the marketplace, many of the world’s carmakers have realised the need to run specific approval programs.
The OEMs are inherently reluctant to officially endorse any product they haven’t properly tested and approved – especially something as finely engineered as an engine oil. That’s why securing an OEM Approval is a very expensive and laborious process – it’s a much tougher benchmark to meet. To gain approval, an oil is submitted to the individual OEM, who conducts an exhaustive certification process that includes extensive testing of wear-and-tear, distribution on moving metal-to-metal parts, exhaust emissions, oxidation, fuel economy, heat stress stability, and so on. All in all, that’s about 600 gruelling hours of continued, real-world use, across multiple engines simultaneously – which is why it’s such an expensive process. There is no ‘blanket approval’ for a brand, this verification process is just for one specific oil, against one specific specification.
Buyer beware You will find many brands that have not secured OEM Approvals will sometimes use clever, or misleading language and labelling practices that, at a glance, indicates their non-compliant lubricant has OEM Approval. The buyer needs to beware and read the supplied information very carefully. Any lubricant that has OEM Approval is clearly marked in a very specific way.
Why does it matter? Anybody who owns a new Ford Ranger and is not using the correct specification lubricants are likely to know first-hand why it matters. In this particular application, non-compliant oil has been traced back to a litany of issues, from oil pump damage and injector failure to problems with the EGR cooler as well as DPF operation. It is all about the lubricant’s additives package, which can represent up to 30 percent of an oil – and by far the oil’s most expensive component. How these additives interact with the increasingly
complex systems found in modern engines is at the core of any OEM specification. Even two lubricants from the same brand, of the same viscosity, both carrying very similar approvals from the same OEM, may be subtly different to the point that prevents them from being interchangeable. The risk is poor performance, increased emissions along with premature wear, increased maintenance costs and possibly engine damage. The OEMs spend a lot of money and go to extraordinary lengths testing and developing specific lubricants and highly specialised specifications. After all, it’s their hard-earned reputation on the line. Mobil 1 says the only way to know the oil being poured into an engine will perform as necessary is to use an oil the OEM has tested and approved. It states using OEM Approved lubricants protects businesses and end users from purchasing lubricants with incorrect or misleading specification and performance claims. Mobil 1 and Mobil Super say they are proud to carry more OEM Approvals than any other lubricant brand sold in Australia. The OEM Approvals for every Mobil lubricant sold in Australia are listed on the individual Product Data Sheet (PDS) which can be found on the website. Mobil 1 warns you to keep in mind that the manufacturer’s standard is the minimum specification, not the maximum; stating that premium products such as Mobil 1 routinely far exceed any standard during independent, realworld testing.

GOSS FUEL VAPOUR VALVES TO THE RESCUE In the last decade, sales of diesel vehicles in Australia have experienced exponential growth To clean up the harmful exhaust soot emissions inherent with all diesels, many of these vehicles are fitted with a Diesel Particulate Filter – or DPF.
necessary for regeneration, the Fuel Vapour Valve (FVV) atomises and injects a small amount of diesel fuel into the DPF.
These DPFs collect 99 percent of all the soot and other small particulate matter from the exhaust, then burn it off by regenerating under certain conditions.
The FVV’s in-built glow plug ignites this vapour to generate the necessary high heat.
Unfortunately, many owners new to the world of diesel vehicles have not been educated in the operation of the DPF and how to look after it, such as the 80km/h freeway drive for around 20 minutes – once a week. As such, issues with DPF-equipped vehicles that only see short, stop-start, urban driving are very common – most notably blocked DPFs that will not self-regenerate. What’s not so well known, is that for the same reasons, Fuel Vapour Valves (fuel vapouriser system) also suffer the same issues. To get the DPF up to the 600 degrees Celsius
With the FVV operating in extremely harsh conditions, it’s quite susceptible to failure. Most commonly, its small outlet orifice becomes blocked. This slowly reduces the amount of fuel injected into the system, to the point where insufficient heat is produced for regeneration to occur. While some vehicles do present a dedicated FVV fault code, in other vehicles a failed FVV can throw a host of different codes. Therefore, the FVV should always be checked when dealing with any issues associated with the DPF and its operating system. In rare cases, some FVVs can be cleaned, however replacement is recommended to avoid any further issues.
Goss offers a range of direct-replacement Fuel Vapour Valves for most of the popular diesel vehicles found on Australian roads. Goss says you can check the easy-to-use vehicle application guide on the Goss website for the full listing. It states that as part of its expanding range of vehicle mechatronics, sourced from the world’s leading OES and AM suppliers, its FVVs will provide you and your customers with the genuine alternative.

AUTOTEST HEADLIGHT ALIGN
AutoTest says it is the most comprehensive headlight aimer in Australia The main purpose of your vehicle’s headlights is to improve visibility on the road when driving under low-light conditions. However, headlights aren’t just a suggestion— their use is a necessity, required by law during specific times of the day or under certain conditions. Newer vehicles often have daytime running lights fitted which are devices on the front of a vehicle, automatically switched on when the vehicle is moving forward. Day time running lights are beneficial in preventing crashes by improving the visibility of your vehicle to other road users and pedestrians. Your car’s headlights are an important safety device, and not all headlight types are the same. For some time now, carmakers have been fitting powerful LED headlights to their higher end models, while their cheaper cars get fitted with much more standard illumination. There is also a growing trend of road users installing aftermarket LED headlamps. AutoTest says installing such aftermarket LED
bulbs into OEM housings designed for conventional halogen units can result in dangerous glare for oncoming drivers and while LEDs can deliver more intense light at a higher end of the spectrum, some can also create a hazardous condition. Proper headlight adjustment is a necessary safety measure. Without proper alignment, you won’t get the full visibility while driving at night. Not only do misadjusted headlights illuminate the road ahead insufficiently, but they can also cause blinding of the eyes of oncoming drivers instead. Therefore, proper aiming of headlights is necessary if you want to keep things safe while driving. Proper alignment is important when installing new headlights.
AutoTest says it is the most comprehensive headlight aimer in Australia. It is supplied with assembly, operation, and calibration manuals and declaration of conformity.
Each headlight must be securely mounted and properly aimed so the beam pattern “cut-off line” complies with the regulations.
Features include a robust anti-tip base fitted with large castors for easy manoeuvring; laser pointer for easy positioning of the unit; digital lux meter and wide measuring window; and manual optic alignment visor for easy parallel alignment.
AutoTest says its AutoTest Headlight Align is a professional quality beam aligner suitable for all kinds of headlamps (high, low, fog including XENON and LED lamps).

VALEO’S INNOVATIVE IBSG 48V SOLUTION Reducing CO2 emissions and now available on the aftermarket With its iBSG 48V (Integrated Belt Starter Generator), Valeo says it has successfully risen to the challenge of increasing the performance of vehicles driven by internal combustion engines, while also reducing their fuel consumption with a technology destined to become more widespread on the market in the years to come.
Driving the development of electric vehicles As the regulations on CO2 emissions and pollution become stricter worldwide and a growing number of consumers turn to more ecological offers, carmakers and equipment suppliers need to develop products that are more sustainable. Stop-start technology, pioneered by Valeo with i-StARS in 2010, was an important step forward. Increasingly complex technologies have been developed since then in order to reduce CO2 emissions, including the 48V technology, which Valeo says will become indispensable in the years to come. Consequently, Valeo says electric vehicles and the 48V technology will dominate the market by 2030.
An ultra-high-performance system In 2017, Valeo started supplying iBSG 48V
alternator systems with built-in electronics as original equipment. As well as operating as an alternator and starter motor, Valeo says this system fulfils four additional functions that reduce fuel consumption and therefore CO2 production by up to six percent*. It recharges the battery to assist the engine and to supply power to the vehicle’s equipment and assists the engine when the vehicle is driving at a constant speed (on main highways, for example) in order to cut fuel consumption. It delivers a boost effect to the engine when accelerating and also allows the car to be in 100 percent electric mode over short distances. Made in Valeo’s plant in Étaples in northern France, which is one of the largest electric machinery factories in Europe, the iBSG system has now been fitted on several hundreds of thousands of vehicles, including Asian and European vehicles. With this system, Valeo says it is actively contributing to the electrification of vehicles. The Group produces 30 million electric machines every year, confirming its long-standing expertise in the manufacture of electric systems, while also
providing an effective response to the current environmental and legislative issues. The plant in Étaples currently produces almost 30,000 electric machines per day, and it is continuing to ramp up its capacity to produce 48V systems in response to the strong demand from carmakers. In May 2020, French president Emmanuel Macron chose the Étaples site to unveil his government’s plan to support the automotive industry by making it ecological and more competitive.

PENRITE ENVIRO BOX Saving money, space and time
Penrite says you can save thousands of dollars per year on disposal costs when using Penrite Enviro Box. Penrite Chief Executive Officer Toby Dymond was visiting workshops when he saw dumpsters overflowing with empty 20L drums and knew something needed to be done to help preserve the environment for future generations to come. That solution is Enviro Box, a ‘bag-in-a-box’ concept with a robust plastic bladder encased in a sturdy, non-waxed cardboard box. The product is dispensed via a tap, like a wine cask. Lubricant can be extracted by running through the tap into a jug and then dispensed into the vehicle, or hand-pumped directly into the vehicle. Since its release, Penrite says the Enviro Box has been embraced by mechanics Australia-wide. Research has shown that the reasons for the successful uptake include money saved on waste removal, the reduction in landfill waste and the way the Enviro Box stands aide in the effective organisation of workshops. Tony from Indy Automotive Repairs in Moorabbin, Victoria, is delighted with Enviro Box. 58
Australian Automotive Aftermarket Magazine October 2021
“This product is fantastic! We had to empty our general waste bin every week or so due to the amount of empty 20L plastic containers we were throwing out,” Tony said. “To empty that bin, it costs me $75. Now with Enviro Box, the box is crushed and put into the recycle bin. It takes me about six to eight weeks to fill that one and costs me six dollars to empty!” “Penrite is the first Australian owned and manufactured company to develop and distribute a solution to the plastic packaging for lubricants,” Toby said. “Each Penrite Enviro Box used will result in an 85 percent reduction in landfill waste compared to a 20L plastic drum.” You can even use the Enviro Box to refill a 60-litre drum. To further reduce cost and clutter in your workshop, the contents of an Enviro Box can be decantated into an empty 60 litre drum, thereby eliminating the need to order another 60-litre drum. This eliminates the expensive cost of disposing of a 60-litre drum by making it reusable, reduces inventory holdings as you can order an Enviro Box to top up, rather than replacing a whole 60 litre
drum; and allows you to avoid having to move a pump from one 60 litre to another mid service by simply refilling the existing drum. The Enviro Box range includes Penrite’s bestselling products, which have been in high demand to be available in the Enviro Box packaging since the concept’s release. The Enviro Box range now includes Engine Oils, Coolants, ATF and Gear Oils, Brake Fluids, Additives and Industrial products. “The range will expand again soon to cater for the growing demand in this new packaging. Penrite again leads the way, not only in quality product and superior customer service, but also packaging innovation,” Toby said.

PREPARING THE VEHICLE FOR DIAGNOSTICS Every time you grab the scan tool, the next step should be to connect your stabiliser Clore Automotive has introduced the Pro-Logix ET6100 from SOLAR, 12V 100A flashing power supply and 60/40/10A battery charger. The ET6100 is designed to provide stable power on demand, up to 100A, to a vehicle electrical system to support module reprogramming. It also provides a full-service battery charging capability from 10 to 60A to service everything from small vehicle batteries to Group 31 batteries. Programming and diagnostic operations require clean signals and a robust power. When these two boxes are checked, additional features and a solid build are icing on the cake, explains Matt Fanslow of Riverside Automotive in Red Wing, Minnesota. At Riverside Automotive, Matt is tasked with diagnosing several drivability and electrical issues that come through the door. “This means I possess many different pieces of equipment to accomplish the goal of accurately troubleshooting, then repairing, those concerns,” Matt said. Whenever a module is replaced or a firmware update is available for a symptom, the vehicle requires programming. This veteran technician says he enjoys fixing problems with firmware updates, and to do this with little headache he needs the proper
tools, including scan tools, hardware, and software. Another “too-often overlooked” piece of equipment in his bays, he says, is the battery maintainer. Matt says clean voltage is important when working with battery maintainers, but it’s also extremely important to be able to maintain the voltage level throughout the process. “During programming, some vehicles can pull some major current. A good maintainer will not only meet that demand but will maintain it (no pun intended) over the entire required period of time,” Matt said. Upon receiving the Pro-Logix ET6100, Matt was impressed with the look and feel of the tool. “This thing is heavy. Not ‘strain-your-back’ heavy, but it feels up to the task of surviving years of professional use. It’s a fair bit larger than my other maintainers, but this is also a full-blown battery charger as well,” Matt said. Other standout features and capabilities for Matt were the unit’s cables: “heavy cables with twistlock connections to the charger/maintainer and spring tension in the clamps.” In addition, the power output did not disappoint. “This thing puts out a legit 100 amps and stays there … no dropping off,” Matt said.
The busy technician appreciated that the unit is a true battery charger as well. “The ET6100 has algorithms to potentially save sulphated batteries and actually puts batteries through a charging process, rather than just hitting the battery with the steady voltage I select,” Matt said. Lastly, Matt was impressed with Clore’s “fast and friendly” support (available through Endeavour Tools in Australia). Though the equipment was intuitive and the instruction informative, Matt said he called the company “for fun” and was pleasantly surprised. “They answered all my questions and offered tips and tricks. They seemed like they cared – that goes a long way in my book,” Matt said. The ET6100 is available from all leading automotive retailers. For more information, visit ET6100 or call 03 9753 3800.
DIRECT INJECTION VALVE CLEANER New from JLM Lubricants
JLM Lubricants has launched a ‘trade tested’ Direct Injection Valve Cleaner for Petrol, Diesel, GDI and Hybrid Engines. JLM Lubricants, the global brand based in the manufacturing powerhouse of The Netherlands, has added to its roster of ‘trade trusted’ premium quality automotive aftermarket products with a Direct Injection Valve Cleaner (J03190) – a product designed for optimal use with the existing JLM Gasoline Direct Injector Cleaner. “This product works on petrol, diesel, GDI and hybrid engines,” JLM Founder and Managing Director, Gilbert Groot, said from JLM Lubricants’ headquarters in Amsterdam “However, we anticipate the greatest demand will be for GDI engines because it thoroughly cleans the valve stems and seats without requiring engine tear down. It also safely cleans the combustion chamber and piston crown. “This product differs from the JLM intake EGR Cleaner aerosol because of its ph value. As well as solvents, the product has an alkaline base with surfactants. 60
Australian Automotive Aftermarket Magazine October 2021
“As a result, the carbon deposits which build up on the valves, cylinder heads and injectors loosen faster and are easier to remove than comparable products which are 100 percent solvent based. “As we know, with GDI engines, small amounts of dirt from intake air can build up on valves within just 5,000 miles of driving. “At its most extreme, if left unchecked this can lead to pieces of carbon breaking off and burning a hole in the catalytic converter. “But before this the carbon deposits can cause pre-ignition, rough starting, and rough idling, even fouled spark plugs. With our new concentrated solvent and fuel detergent blend the carbon residues on the intake valves dissolve faster and are easier to remove. The engine is restored to correct operation at correct airflow. “With our one shot GDI Cleaner which cleans the inside of the injectors and the injector mouth, restoring fuel economy and lowering emissions, we are now offering the perfect combination high quality formulas to keep GDI engines clean and
performing to their highest specification. The motorist does not have to let carbon build up become a big issue.” For more information, visit

TRANSMISSION OIL COOLERS From Davies Craig
Davies Craig explains that its range of universalfit Davies Craig Transmission Oil Coolers are engineered to help drop transmission operational temperatures by as much as 33°c. It says the cores are strongly constructed and tested to withstand pressures of up to 150 psi, which it explains is crucial if you are wishing to give your automatic transmission extended life. Davies Craig offers two distinct transmission oil coolers; one to deal with pre-1990 vehicles is a fin and tube type called an Ultra-Cool, and the unique plate and fin designed Hydra-Cool to suit a wide variety of later model vehicles, including two/fourwheel drive SUVs and light trucks. The Ultra-Cool offers effective cooling for heat temperature transfer from the ATF. The HydraCool models are more compact, requiring 30 percent less space. Visually, the Ultra-Cool core matches the cooling tubes seen on older fridges while the Hydra-Cool core resembles a more modern alloy radiator core style with its plate and fin design. Davies Craig offers fifteen distinct combinations. If
your vehicle has a 24V electrical system, a Hydra 21 Plate Cooler and 8” ThermaticDAv Fan Combo (part #699) to suit is available. With a 20mm thickness, a compact 281mm length, and a fan diameter of 8” and a slimline 50mm depth, Davies Craig says this will ensure an incredibly positive air flow and cooling ability. For heavy duty 24v usage a 30-plate cooler with a 10” Fan (part #692) can be installed. The smallest Hydra-Cool weighs just 331 grams so there is no noticeable impost to a vehicle’s weight. At just 141mm in height, 281mm in width, and with 12-plate core plus a near 12000 BTU heat transfer rate Davies Craig says it’s an ideal starter for smaller vehicles. The 23-plate Hydra-Cool model, (part #623) at just 20mm thick and 281mm long, can be conveniently installed and simply mounted with the Quick Fit Kit provided adjacent to the engine radiator. The Ultra-Cool models are available in three sizes to suit four-cylinder vehicles (part #401); sixcylinder vehicles (part #403) and eight-cylinder vehicles (part #404) for automatic transmissions
fitted to vehicles before 1990. Davies Craig says the models make for a convenient installation, with the largest core able to transfer up to 10,800 BTU/hour. To complement your Transmission Oil Cooler and Thermatic Fan Combo, Davies Craig recommends the installation of a Davies Craig Digital Thermatic Fan Switch (part #0444) to ensure your Transmission Oil Cooler Combo performs at its optimum in all environmental conditions. All Davies Craig Transmission Oil Cooler Kits come complete with 3/8” hose, hose clamps and a Quick Fit Kit for universal fitting to most vehicles.

REPCO EXPANDS BRAKE PAD RANGE RCT and RCT Extreme are now available across common dual-purpose vehicles Repco has expanded its range of RCT and RCT Extreme brake pads with a focus on offering customers and fitters more choice when it comes to selecting the most suitable brake pad for common dual-purpose vehicles. Repco says it understands that people use their vehicles differently, something that is particularly common with SUVs. Where one person will use an SUV such as a RAV 4 as a high riding family car for school drop offs and commuting, another person may use the same type of RAV 4 for regular towing or driving in hilly terrain that exposes their brake pads to harsher braking conditions. To ensure the correct type of brake pad that suits the individual application is fitted, Repco explains it now offers both RCT and RCT Extreme across common dual-purpose vehicles. Repco states that RCT has proven to be a great brake pad designed for passenger vehicles driven under normal driving conditions. When used this way, RCT provides a great consistent pedal feel, with low dust and noise across a wide variety of vehicles. 64
Australian Automotive Aftermarket Magazine October 2021
RCT brake pads achieve this by using an advanced ceramic formulation along with Radial Chamfer Technology, Stop-Ready Stripe and Premium Silent Guard Shims. However, some applications require additional stopping power and will need to last in harsher braking conditions, which is where RCT Extreme is designed to perform.
technology as RCT but use a Heavy Duty Semi Metallic formulation, specifically designed to provide superior heavy duty braking performance. The result of this gives drivers a consistent pedal feel and less wear on high load applications while still providing superior general purpose braking performance during regular driving.
RCT Extreme was developed for heavy-duty 4WDs, Vans, SUVs, Utes and vehicles doing regular towing that need more stopping power.
To make sure your customers get the most out of their next set of brake pads, Repco encourages you to ask them how they use their vehicle and select the right RCT set of brake pads for them.

LOW-VISCOSITY ENGINE OILS Improving fuel efficiency and reducing CO2 emissions When Shell invested in and built the Pearl GTL plant – the world’s largest gas-to-liquids plant – along the coast from Doha, Qatar, in 2011, it was the culmination of hundreds of millions of hours’ work. In fact, it was such a pioneering project that it took one million hours (the equivalent of 500 years of full-time work for one person) to complete its conceptual design. Ten years later, and the decision to put that time and effort towards producing low-viscosity engine oils made from natural gas is paying off. There is a growing demand for lower-viscosity lubricants that allow engine pistons to move more freely and easily through lower friction. This shift is one of the key trends in the automotive lubricants market right now1 – a move that is especially significant for drivers and workshops in Asia Pacific (APAC), the region that accounts for 60 percent of the global motor oil market2. Shell notes that we are already seeing APAC markets move to lower-viscosity engine oils, for example adopting SAE 0W-20 lubricants (amid growing interest in even lower viscosities)3. But what is driving this change? It says one element is the fact that new cars generally use lower viscosities, which means that the adoption of low-viscosity engine oils will grow as older vehicles are replaced. Shell explains there are also many benefits of using low-viscosity oils made with GTL technology. Free of the contaminants inherent to conventional oils,
they can generally provide better wear protection and longevity. However, it says the main reason for the trend towards lower viscosity is the desire among drivers to achieve better fuel efficiency. “We are seeing consumers become more conscious about the amount of fuel they use,” Shell APAC and China, PCMO Technology Manager, Hu Hua, said. “Partly, it is a cost issue. The less they need to fill up the tank, the more money they save. Also, more drivers are paying closer attention to the sustainability of their vehicles. Improving fuel efficiency is an effective way to reduce the emissions each motorist generates – and aligns with the automotive industry’s wider decarbonisation goals.” Shell says this is where low-viscosity engine oils come in. Advances in these lubrication products (including GTL) are now having a meaningful impact in improving engine performance and fuel efficiency. For example, low-viscosity oils can work better in extreme temperatures. This essentially means that drivers can start their cars more easily in hot or cold conditions, saving on the fuel this process can often waste. “To support this growing trend, Shell is driving the development of effective low-viscosity motor oils,” Hu Hua said. “Engineered using our unique GTL technology, these lubricants provide 60 percent less friction4. This enables customers to drive more efficiently
and sustainably – saving up to two litres of fuel for every full tank5.” Shell says this is supported by the fact that simply switching to a premium low-viscosity oil can help to increase fuel efficiency by up to three percent5. And, with longer life, Shell says its passenger car lubricants reduce the oil consumption as well. It notes this all helps drivers to cut the cost of every journey they make while also reducing their CO2 footprint. So, it says, a million hours to create the plans for the world’s largest GTL plant might sound like a lot, but that is how long it takes when you are designing the future of passenger car travel.

RACKSBRAX ANNOUNCES NEW PRODUCT RELEASE The relatively new company continues to grow its product line RacksBrax has continued to expand its national dealer network while increasing its international presence with exports to 20 different countries. One of RacksBrax’s main focuses is on product development, and one recently launched new product is the XD Hitch for wing awnings. RacksBrax has designed the XD Hitch (XTRA DUTY) to allow wing awnings to be locked on or taken off roof racks in less than 10 seconds. These hitches are capable of supporting larger wing awnings with a load capacity of 20kg for each load point. RacksBrax says the XD Hitch complements its already very successful HD Hitch. Both products are manufactured locally using glass-reinforced, UV stabilised nylon to withstand Australia’s harsh conditions. RacksBrax has also released three new bracket designs. These include the HD L50 L bracket
measuring 5mm thick and 70mm wide. This black powder-coated L bracket is made from stainless steel and features eight different mounting options and is compatible with most roof bars and platform style racks. The new HD AB 0-15 short and long foot adjustable brackets have multiple mounting options, including 0° (vertical position) and 15° (off-vertical position) as well as height adjustments at 12.5mm increments. These brackets are ideal for mounting recovery boards using the RacksBrax HD Hitch and the HD Accessory Plate. These two-part, adjustable brackets have a load capacity of 20kg for each bracket and using the long foot adjustable brackets with platform style racks provides additional stability. Finally, the newly developed XD AB 0-15 short and long foot adjustable brackets have been designed to suit the XD Hitch.
These two-part brackets also come with multiple mounting options and a load capacity of 20kg for each bracket. The XD Hitch is compatible with most wing awnings, while the Long Foot is more suited to platform style racks. Stainless steel fasteners are included in all packs for fast and easy installation. The brackets come in either Double or Triple kits depending on customers’ roof rack configurations and load requirements.

The Redmax Solar Power Bank has a large 20,000mAh lithium battery which enables it to charge a mobile phone or other mobile devices multiple times before requiring a recharge. The power bank’s integrated short circuit protection, over-discharge and over-charge protection features make it one of the safest power banks in the market. R&J Batteries says you can leave out the guesswork by using the Redmax Multimeter to accurately measure electrical values in batteries, components and circuits. This compact digital pen type multimeter can measure voltage, current, capacitance, resistance, and more. The pen type design makes it easier to use when compared to conventional designs because the multimeter is integrated into one of the test probes. All batteries rely on a low resistance connection between the posts and terminals to ensure they can deliver maximum current to the devices they are powering. It is surprising how often battery performance issues are caused by a poor-quality connection at the post.
The Redmax Battery Terminal Brush has been specifically designed to thoroughly clean the inside surface of tapered battery terminals (both standard and small post) to ensure a high-quality connection every time the battery is changed. This terminal brush is manufactured to R&J Batteries’ specifications using stainless steel wire to resist corrosion. The taper of the brush matches the standard taper used in battery terminals to ensure full contact and efficient cleaning every time. The large handle makes the battery brush easy to hold and use.

with a maximum diameter of 26 inchs or 1400mm and has been designed to speed up the mounting and demounting process. “The position of the tool heads combined with our new control console provides the operator with the ability to change tyres quickly and easily,” Andrew said. “Tyre technicians can choose to raise the working height by 150mm as required.” The HD500 also features hydraulic controls, horizontal for tool use and vertical for wheel positioning, which Corghi says makes it one of the most user-friendly, heavy-duty tyre changers on the market. The load-bearing frame has been completely redesigned to increase rigidity and reduce bending when working on particularly heavy wheels. The gear unit has also undergone significant engineering updates that now deliver a wheel rotation speed of 9rpm, which represent an increase of more than 20 percent when compared with the previous model.
“The biggest change has been the addition of our top-of-the-range clamping jaws,” Andrew said. “They offer seven different clamping methods and are supplied with plastic rim support plugs in different thicknesses for perfect rim clamping. “A new gear unit, suitable for intensive and heavyduty use has also been incorporated into this new model.

GCG TURBOCHARGERS BRINGS FUNK MOTORSPORT TO AUSTRALIA Funk has established a reputation within the motorsport world GCG Turbochargers is now distributing Funk Motorsport Heat Management products. Funk’s on the ground experience from track days to drag strips, club race events to international race meetings have all served as key ingredients to developing new technological advancements for the automotive industry. In the decade of operating, Funk says it has quickly sprung to the top, working with companies through the highest disciplines of motorsport including the World Rally Championship, Formula 2, British Touring Cars, Formula Drift and many more. Funk Motorsport products are also utilised by OEM manufacturers across the world. From real experience it says it has produced high quality products tackling heat management and overcoming challenges faced on the track and road. GCG Turbochargers says Funk’s products have a thick, four-layer construction that when put to the test do extremely well at withstanding and dramatically reducing temperatures. It says this is because Funk has identified the 72

primary issues of common turbo blankets being the breakdown of the thread fibres under extreme heat, leaving the panels of the blanket to separate. Its research has reportedly led its team to design a unique thread for its product range which has proven to outlast all other brands; with the thread material durable and matching that of the rest of the blanket. Funk Motorsport has developed individual turbo blankets for specific applications, while the generic T3/T4 blankets are the stable of the range, with many OE fitment applications available from Audi to VW and “all car makers in-between.” Many commercial applications are also covered with turbo blankets for Holset/Garrett Motion and Borg Warner OEM turbochargers which can meet the current OH&S requirements for working in confined spaces like tunnel construction or specified job sites. “We at GCG turbos regularly receive requests for custom built turbos for motor enthusiasts; elevating turbocharger performance specs to meet the power
and air flow requirements to improve efficiency on the track and road,” GCG Turbochargers Australia Director, Brett Lloyd, said. “Coupling our custom builds with a high-quality product like Funk is sure to be a threat to racers and practical and reliable for those performance daily drivers.” Another industry leading innovation was the wastegate blanket, and while the turbocharger temperatures are controlled with a Funk Motorsport blanket, so now too are the smaller external wastegates used in many motorsports. Fitment is universal to wastegate size and covers 40mm -60mm applications from all aftermarket manufacturers. For more information, visit

DIVERSITY DRIVES GROWTH EXEDY (Japan) was founded in 1923, and its clutch manufacturing business and prominent brand name formerly known as Daikin Clutch is known throughout the world for supplying quality powertrain products Globally, EXEDY is committed to designing and manufacturing quality products that set the benchmark for reliability. “Our advanced engineering and patented innovations have made us the leading OEM manufacturer in the world for Clutches and other powertrain components,” EXEDY Australia Product Manager, Mark Davis, said. “EXEDY is also the undisputed world leader of performance sports and racing clutches.” Today, the global EXEDY Group has 44 operations worldwide and employs more than 18,000 people in 25 countries. EXEDY’s extensive product line-up includes manual clutches, torque converters, automatic transmission frictions, and industrial transmissions. EXEDY has a long and successful history in Australia that extends all the way back to 1986 when four knock-about blokes banded together to start Clutch Co Imports. In the later years, a fifth founding member came on board in Sydney. For the next decade, they toiled, and in 1995 Daikin Clutch Japan came to Australia, looking for a local partner. They joined forces and Daikin Clutch Australia was born. “Before joining forces with Daikin Clutch Japan, the guys were selling various brands of product,” Mark explained. “But the founders knew they were onto a good thing, and EXEDY quickly became the primary focus.”
Today EXEDY Australia employs more than 50 people and has offices in Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane. They stock more than 4,500 SKUs covering everything from passenger, commercial and agricultural vehicles as well as performance upgrades and heavy-duty kits for those 4WD enthusiasts who like to get off the beaten track. But of course, shifts in consumer buying habits have thrown up challenges for clutch manufacturers in more recent times as more and more drivers choose automatic transmissions. “Today, many new passenger vehicle models don’t even offer a manual option,” Mark said. “And a lot of younger people don’t necessarily want to drive a manual car, so the biggest challenge we are facing today is that the clutch market is in decline.” To combat the slowing shrinking size of the clutch market, Mark and his highly experienced team have looked further afield, adding new products that appeal to their customer base. “We know our customer base intimately and this mutual trust and respect provided us with unique insights when we started to investigate potential opportunities to diversify our product offering,” Mark said. In 2017 EXEDY acquired Driveline Auto Parts, a leading supplier of automatic transmission components, allowing EXEDY to expand its presence in the automatic transmission aftermarket.
Mark Davis, EXEDY Australia Product Manager
When purchased, Driveline Auto Parts had operations in Perth, Adelaide, and Sydney, and under EXEDY’s ownership, its footprint has expanded to cover Melbourne and Brisbane. “The acquisition of Driveline Auto Parts has provided us with the opportunity to distribute an impressive range of automatic transmission parts,” Mark said. “While the clutch market is shrinking, the automatic transmission re-building industry is growing, so the integration of Driveline Auto Parts into the EXEDY business is a critical piece of the puzzle for us moving forward.” The second big move EXEDY Australia made to tackle the shrinking clutch market has been the launch of the AISIN brand in Australia. In parallel to growing its core clutch kit business, EXEDY recently expanded its product offering with the introduction of the AISIN brand. The AISIN range includes cooling, drivetrain, clutch kits, hydraulics, lubricants, and more. “AISIN is a subsidiary of the Toyota Motor Company,” Mark said. “They have a huge product range that is primarily suitable for Toyota applications, but with the popularity of the marque in Australia, there’s a nice synergy with the AISIN brand.” AISIN is one of the world’s leading OE manufacturers for Japanese, European and American vehicles. The extensive range of quality AISIN products is now available in Australia through EXEDY’s vast network of dealers and distributors.

MEMBER FEATURE targeted towards promoting its four-wheel-drive performance clutch range. “We’ve joined forces with the talented editorial team at 4x4 Australia Magazine as the official clutch partner in their highly coveted 4x4 of the Year program,” Mark said. “Four-wheel drives are a huge part of our business. Whether it is Mitsubishi Triton, Nissan Navara, Ford Ranger, Toyota Hilux, and even some of the Chinese vehicles like Great Walls, they are just super popular right now.” Mark also believes that, to some degree, the increased popularity of 4WDs has been driven by regulatory bodies. “Authorities are coming down harder on modified vehicles,” Mark explained. “I think a lot of those guys that would modify their Commodore or Falcon are now transitioning into the four-wheel-drive sphere, where they can still modify their vehicles while avoiding the headaches when it comes to dealing with the authorities.”
“The range of AISIN replacement products is expanding quickly,” Mark explained. “Many of these are the same parts supplied as OE to major Japanese vehicles manufacturers such as Toyota, Daihatsu, Mitsubishi, Hino, Isuzu, Fuso, Suzuki and also to European and American brands.” One of the biggest trends in new vehicle sales in Australia has been 4WD and SUV market growth. “There is no doubt that Aussies are 4WD crazy at the moment,” Mark said. “With the unfortunate demise of the Holden Commodore and the Ford Falcon, dual-cab utes are fast becoming Australia’s new family cars.” The latest offerings from all the big players in the
Dual Cab 4WD market are much more comfortable than their predecessors. However, they still deliver serious off-road performance and a large towing capacity making them the right choice for families looking to explore more of Australia. “There is no doubt that the global COVID-19 pandemic has also helped drive 4WD sales in Australia,” Mark explained. “All forecasts show that when we come out of lockdown that more than ever, Australian’s will be holidaying locally, and Dual Cab 4WDs are just the ticket.” To leverage this increase in new 4WD sales, EXEDY has launched a campaign specifically
While the future looks bright for EXEDY, it’s certainly not without its challenges. EXEDY is investing heavily in research and development to overcome these challenges while also refining the distribution model. “While I can’t reveal too much at the moment, globally, we’re investing heavily into the development of products for hybrid and electric vehicles,” Mark said. “It’s a little early to say too much at the moment, but there is no doubt that’s where the future is headed. “There’s been a lot of changes in the industry, and that directly impacts distribution. “As a result, we have developed a multi-channel strategy to reach end-users.” You can find EXEDY products at a wide variety of brake and clutch specialists, independent auto supply stores, and of course, large national chains like Burson Auto Parts, for example. EXEDY says it proudly identifies quality and service as its number one priority. This, combined with an industry-leading range and an extensive distribution network, has ensured on-time delivery and has fortified the business for many decades. “Our strength is our people. We have an amazing team, all of whom work hard to provide exceptional quality, service, promotion, and after-sale support. We pride ourselves on those elements within the business,” Mark said. “Of course, the AAAA helps us deliver on these promises. “It’s a terrific organisation.

Electric Vehicles are coming to Australia and coming in fast Carcadia reports this year, total EV sales grew by 151 percent as opposed to 22.4 percent for total new car sales. Carcadia explains that most charging stations in Australia do not supply a charging cable and so offers an EV charging cable to the market. With this cable, you can charge your EV or PHEV on all Type 2 home or public charging points at 32(7.2kW) amps. This cable also works with 16 amp cars by down-rating automatically, making the 32 amp version “future proof.” The cable is five meters long and made out of a flexible lightweight rubber, making it very easy to store and transport.

RAZORBACK 4X4 SEAT COVERS Industry-leading 4WD interior protection
Razorback 4x4 says it is the fastest-growing seat cover company in Australia, offering interior protection accessories for a wide range of 4WDs and SUVs with options in neoprene, canvas and a unique premium neoprene. Seat covers are an essential part of owning a four-wheel drive, ensuring that the seats they’re protecting keep their full value and the interior is kept spotless. Razorback 4x4 says its covers are manufactured in a state-of-the-art OEM facility that supplies the majority of seat covers through car dealerships nation-wide and are in a unique league of quality. Razorback states that it offers “the highest-quality neoprene on the market,” with their own proprietary material blend reportedly resulting in a feel and fit unlike any other. The company explains that the 30 percent rubber component is more than double industry standard, resulting in a form-fitting cover that’s comfortable for long drives. It says its canvas covers are made of a custom automotive-grade material rather than the stiff, uncomfortable awning canvas it reports is found in a lot of competitor’s seat covers. All of Razorback’s seat covers are tailor-made for each individual seat, rather than using a universal pattern. The covers are designed to hug the curves and contours of the seat, including allowances for relevant cut-outs, lumbar supports and electric seat controls.
Razorback says quality in design and materials are at the forefront of everything it does, with all products being almost completely waterproof and highly UVtreated, resulting in covers designed to survive the rigours of touring and the Australian outback. Every seat cover is also APV-T airbag tested, and certified to all strict ADR regulations. Each cover has an engineered airbag seam designed to break in the unfortunate event of airbag deployment. Razorback says it has thousands of standard units in stock to avoid long wait times and still has a quick turnaround on custom made-to-order products, stating that this gets the product in the hands of the customer sooner while setting it apart from the rest. Razorback also has the the capability to support fleets, wholesalers and retail stockists with small to large volumes and custom branding. For more information, visit

Those residing in warmer climates will also encounter increased difficulty when it comes to removing tree sap, tar, and bird droppings and if left, the residue can cause paint discolouration and staining.
before use. Then spray directly on to the affected area(s) and let the solution react. Next, with a microfibre cloth, wipe the area lightly until stains are removed and the surface is clean. Then wipe the surface dry with a clean cloth.
Bar’s Bugs explains that its Bug and Tar Remover has a fast acting, super penetrating formula with Nano technology which allows it to restore and protect paintwork quickly and safely.
For best results, avoid using on hot surfaces or in direct sunlight. For those super stubborn stains, Bar’s Bugs says an additional damp cloth will help banish them.
It is safe to use on chrome, metal, paint, and plastic, so Bar’s Bugs says you can feel free to use it on painted surfaces, bumpers, windows, grills and headlights.

HIGH QUALITY PROTECTION TGC Orange Nitrile Disposable Gloves
The Glove Company has experienced significantly heightened levels of demand for its highperformance nitrile gloves throughout the pandemic. The extreme increase in demand for protective gloves has created an ongoing nitrile glove shortage. During the nitrile glove shortage, The Glove Company says most companies prioritised making lightweight medical gloves. However, The Glove Company continued to prioritise its TGC Orange Nitrile Disposable Gloves as it says it knew the Australian automotive industry needed high-performance chemical resistant nitrile gloves to continue to work safely. Higher quality heavier gloves are harder to manufacture during these times because you need more raw nitrile to make the same amount of gloves.
The majority of medical examination nitrile gloves weigh approximately three grams or less. In comparison, high-quality long term protection gloves such as TGC Orange Gloves weigh approximately up to two to three times the weight of medical gloves. One TGC Orange Glove is essentially like wearing two or three lightweight gloves. TGC Orange provides the wearer chemical protection up to two to three times that of a regular glove. When you combine that with The Glove Company’s custom formulation of Low Sweat Surface Modification with in the TGC Orange Nitrile Glove, it says you have a glove you can comfortably and safely wear for extended periods. TGC Orange Nitrile Gloves are an ultra-tough 6.5gram nitrile construction that offers the wearer excellent chemical and puncture resistance. The Glove Company says its IP formulation of TGC branded nitrile gloves are known across the industry as the leader in high quality hand protection. The strong, reliable, and fully textured nitrile material protects wearers in a variety of tough working conditions. The hi-vis orange colour provides a further benefit as you can quickly see any cross-contamination
and an in-depth chemical resistance guide is available for higher risk environments. The nitrile material features a micro-texture from the fingertips to the palm of the glove, making it easy for the wearer to handle grease, fuel and brake fluid. There are 100 ambidextrous gloves in a box, and sizes range from XS to XL. The Glove Company says if you need a reliable, strong, comfortable glove in these times of supply disruptions, you should try TGC Orange Nitrile Disposable Gloves. For more information, visit

MEGUIAR’S WHOLE AUSTRALIA’S NEWEST FLOOR COVERINGS ARRIVED CAR AIR RE-FRESHER HAVE for Aussie vehicles by the automotive ODOUR ELIMINATOR Engineered aftermarket industry expert, Vandapac Company Ltd Kill nasty odours at the click of the trigger Just like your clothes, socks and sheets, your car’s interior soaks up all manner of objectionable odours, especially those extra pungent ones like cigarette smoke, pet-smell, perspiration, food waste and trade gear along with all manner of musty and mouldy aromas. Most automotive air freshener’s simply mask these obnoxious odours. Being a premium automotive car care specialist, Meguiar’s says it attacks these stubborn odours in a completely different manner. It says its specifically engineered aerosol mist, Meguiar’s Whole Car Air Re-Fresher Odour Eliminator, takes advantage of the car’s air conditioning system to move through the ventilation system to reach every corner of the interior seeking out and targeting odours at the molecular level – permanently eliminating them. With four scents to choose from – Black Chrome, Citrus Grove, Fiji Sunset and New Car Scent – you get to decide what pleasant fragrance is left in its place.
Maxliner Floor worldwide for dependability. thousand sets globe.
Liners are said to be renowned their durability, quality, and Every year, over five hundred are reportedly sold across the
A tailored fit and finish Floor Mats are traditionally a flat mat sold to cover up some of the carpet in your vehicle. While some OEM mats are designed for the car, many mats sold through high-volume retailers are one size fits all. You may even need to trim them to install in some vehicles. Maxliner Australia says its engineers have used the latest CAD technology to offer perfect fits and finishes on every set of MaxPro Floor Liners.
Floor liners which stay in place Maxliner Australia says its R&D team designs its liners to use a vehicle’s existing retention system. Using the retention system ensures MaxPro Floor Liners don’t move around while driving or getting in and out of the car, stopping any mishaps while driving and protecting the vehicle’s flooring better.
Easy to clean When most people think of floor mats, they picture the standard carpet mat with a rubber backing. The carpet tends to pick up dirt and debris, which can be annoying and time consuming to
clean. Maxliner Australia says one of the best things about the MaxPro range is you can take them out, give them a spray with the hose, let them air dry, and get them back in without having to touch a vacuum.
Stop dirt from getting anywhere near the interior Your shoes collect sand, gravel, dirt, and other debris from the job site to the campsite or even just down at the beach. On carpet mats, this debris can get rubbed in and ruin the fabric. Maxliner Australia says its liners are made from a high-quality semi-flexible material with ridges and are tough enough to withstand dampness, mud, or other dirty matter on the bottom of your shoes and live to drive another day. Maxliner Floor Mats are available for Australia’s most popular utes, 4WD, and SUVs. Maxliner Australia says it is so confident in the design and engineering of the MaxPro range that it offers a lifetime warranty.

INTRODUCING THE NEW AUTEL TBE200 To use, after giving the interior a thorough clean, position the one-time-use canister centrally within the cabin – atop the console works great. Now, with the engine running and the airconditioning set to recirculate, max cold and high fan, engage the canister’s trigger, close all the doors and let the odour elimination technology go to work. It takes around 15 minutes for the Meguiar’s Whole Car Air Re-Fresher Odour Eliminator to empty and finish its odour killing mission. After which, you can reopen all the doors and air the interior out for a further 10-15 minutes. Meguiar’s says you will be pleasantly surprised that even the toughest and most pungent of odours are now replaced with the fresh, pleasant fragrance of your choice when using this product.

FLAT BATTERIES LIKELY AS SUMMER APPROACHES The upcoming warmer heat will mean an influx of frustrated customers with flat batteries Hot weather can increase the temperature under the bonnet, accelerating the battery corrosion. It can also cause water to evaporate out of the battery’s liquid electrolyte, decreasing the battery capacity, and causing its life to be shortened. There are also more demands on the battery as cooling fans and air conditioning get switched on in the heat. CTEK, which says it is the world’s leading supplier of battery charging technology, recommends a full battery health check on each vehicle that comes into the workshop. By checking the health of a battery, it says you can support your customers by ensuring they are not caught out when the good weather arrives, and family road trips begin. It says workshops are best placed to be fully equipped with an up-to-date battery tester, ideally incorporating a printer facility so that you can print out a report on the condition of the battery. Complemented by a battery charger, such as the CTEK PRO25S, workshops can test, charge and condition a vehicle’s battery during other vehicle work, which is a chargeable service.
The process in three easy steps is as follows: 1. For each vehicle that enters the workshop, the battery is tested. A professional battery tester, like the CTEK PRO Battery Tester, should be used and a report printed. If the battery voltage is below 12.6 volts, this is a critical voltage and the workshop should ring the customer and recommend a battery service 2. Step two is to charge the customer’s battery using a professional battery charger like the CTEK PRO25S ensuring they have complete peace of mind when out on the road that they have a healthy battery. In some cases, the battery will need to be replaced meaning more revenue for workshops, and most importantly, customer satisfaction. 3. When the customer returns to the workshop to collect their vehicle, it is important to show them the printed report from the professional battery tester both before and after the battery charge to prove the voltage has increased in the customer battery.
The PRO25S also has a dedicated Lithium mode, with a specially developed Lithium charging algorithm. It’s also very simple to connect, spark proof and reverse-polarity protected to protect the user and also the battery. Designed to ensure easy handling in the workshop, it’s lightweight and portable. A rugged, impactresistant casing means the PRO25S can also handle the toughest environment. It also comes with a two-year warranty. The CTEK PRO25S starts from AU $600 RRP, and is available to purchase from Repco stores nationwide. For more information, visit Australian Automotive Aftermarket Magazine October 2021

KEEPING AUSTRALIANS CHARGED Century Batteries’ range of battery chargers and maintainers are keeping Aussies on the road
In many parts of Australia, motorists are currently faced with movement restrictions which can change on a daily or weekly basis. Their vehicles can go from being driven multiple times per day, down to perhaps just one or two essential journeys per week. There are obvious benefits to this behaviour – including reduced wear and tear on the vehicle, and the cost savings associated with using less petrol. But when it comes to the vehicle’s starting battery, the news isn’t so good. Car batteries are happiest and return the longest service life when they are kept at full charge, or as close as possible to it.
But like most battery powered devices, if a car battery is left dormant and unused for any length of time, they can begin to lose charge and drop down to voltage levels which can begin to cause permanent damage. Add to this the possibility of motorists doing shorter, less frequent trips – giving the vehicle’s alternator less time to charge the battery – and it doesn’t take a genius to work out there’s going to be a problem eventually. There’s no such thing as a ‘good time’ for a car battery to fail – if it happens in your garage or driveway at home it is a huge inconvenience, but if it happens out on the road people can end up being left stranded. This is why being able to arm motorists with the knowledge and tools required to better take care of their vehicle’s starting battery should be a key
aspect of any business specialising in vehicle maintenance or auto electrical services. Century says its range of battery chargers and maintainers take the guesswork out of looking after any 12-volt lead acid battery – from starting batteries in cars and 4x4s, all the way through to boat, deep cycle and motorcycle batteries. The most popular model, the CC1206, is perfect for charging batteries rated up to 120Ah, and features a patented nine-stage battery charging and maintenance profile. Simply put, Century says once the charger is connected to the battery it is a true ‘set and forget’ item – firstly by fully charging the battery and then switching into a ‘float charge’ mode to maintain it until the next time the vehicle needs to be driven. For more information, visit or contact your Century Batteries Specialist on 1300 362 287.

COMPLETE HEADLIGHT RESTORATION RANGE From Invision Sales
Whilst many cars’ headlights are heavily damaged and require a full restoration that includes fine grade sanding, many suffer from mild damage that are still functional but have a slight amount of yellowing. This yellowing looks pretty bad on a nice clean car and if not treated will continue to deteriorate. To meet the needs of these two levels of damage, the Invision Headlight Restoration program is now clearly divided into two categories, Mild and Heavy. As the names suggest, Mild is for slightly damaged headlights while Heavy is for badly clouded ones that need the full process. The Mild kits include convenient sachets with presoaked applicators for both Yellow X cleaner and the UV Clear Coat. These make it fast and easy to service a slightly damaged headlight. 90
Australian Automotive Aftermarket Magazine October 2021
A full headlight restoration restores badly damaged headlights by removing the layer of discoloured plastic and smoothing it back to its original state. The final step is to apply the new protective gloss UV coating that effectively restores the headlight to as new condition. This coating is unique to the Invision system and is said to deliver long lasting protection. The Invision Headlight Restoration Program has five kits in the range. The Mild range includes a one car DIY (HRK05) and ten car trade pack (HRK05TP). The Heavy range includes the one car DIY (the new look HRK01), 10 car Trade (HRK02) and 50 car PROKit (HRK03). The kits include all cleaners, sandpaper, polishing cloths, UV resurface coating and detailed instruction sheets.

20+ YEARS OF PIONEERING NEW AUTO A/C PRACTICES The Refrigerant Oil Company explains it pioneered the use of PAO-based oils in refrigeration 20 years ago Now, it states it is pioneering PAO-based lubricants for thermal management in hybrid and electric vehicles. The Refrigerant Oil Company says it is doing so because the users of the products found they recognised the advantages of the stability, purity and lubricity of polyalphaolefins (PAOs) for the industry; stating that the electrical properties of PAO make it suitable for high voltage electrical systems. The Refrigerant Oil Company says there are many reasons you should consider using PAOIL is suitable for the use in hybrid and electric vehicles (AA series is preferred but PL series may be used). • PAOIL has a high Viscosity Index meaning the oil maintains its viscosity and lubricating properties at high operating temperatures. • Unlike other lubricants, PAO is nonhygroscopic: it does not readily absorb moisture. • The special packaging and equipment needed
with other oils to ensure moisture does not enter the refrigeration circuit along with the oil is not necessary with PAOIL. Due to the inertness and inherent stability of PAO, PAOIL has a five-year shelf life. PAOIL is also available with an added UV dye to help with leak tracing. PAOIL is universal: you need to stock one, rather than carry many different types of oil. Safe to use: PAOIL is a non-hazardous, nontoxic product which is safe to have around the workshop. It is safe on painted surfaces, so no worries if accidentally spilt on vehicles.
PAOIL you can buy in bulk (PAOIL is available in 1L, 5L, 10L and 20L container sizes) and with its five-year shelf life, not worry about the oil being unusable a couple of hours after opening.
PAOIL PL series offers the same positive properties as the PAOIL AA series, meaning it can be used as a complete oil replacement for A/C systems.
Ariazone/PAOIL products are currently used in workshops in more than 40 counties worldwide.
• • • •
The Refrigerant Oil Company says that by using
Workshops do not need to stock multiple types of oil when using PAOIL, since PAOIL is suitable for use with a wide variety of automotive compressors and refrigerants. As such, The Refrigerant Oil Company says PAOIL helps you to save money. Ariazone and The Refrigerant Oil Company are fully Australian-owned companies based in Melbourne at the Global Headquarters, and part of the ROC Group.

DIRECT REPLACEMENT AC PARTS
Tridon offers an extensive range of Heater Fan Resistors and Air Conditioning Pressure Switches Tridon says its range has been extensively researched for maximum market coverage, so there is no need to go to the dealer to purchase high quality, direct replacement air conditioning parts. Fan resistors are designed to operate the air conditioner/heater fan speed inside the vehicle. They operate by controlling the current flow to the fan motor, in turn changing the speed of the fan. Problems with heater fan resistors are common in many cars. Some things to look out for are a lack of air flowing; working on high or low speeds only; running constantly or not working on a particular speed. In some cases, a failed fan resistor can cause a heater fan to stop working completely. Constant adjustments to the fan speed generate wear and tear on the resistors terminals, which in turn leads to shorting, or the resister being burnt out resulting in eventual failure. 94

Air con pressure switches also require replacement over time, as the air conditioning may cease to function, or a vehicle fault light will appear. They are a safety device that is fitted to all modern air conditioning systems. Placed in line with the cooling pipes, they monitor the air conditioning system pressure. If the pressure rises to dangerous levels, or if there is a sudden drop in pressure, it will shut off the compressor. This prevents damage to internal air-conditioning components and also to the compressor. Tridon explains that its range of air conditioning switches has been comprehensively researched to provide a broad coverage of high-quality OEM replacement parts. It says these have been developed to meet or exceed original equipment manufacturers
specifications, making them direct replacement for the original switches in the vehicle. If you’re experiencing a problem with the air flow in your vehicle, you’ll definitely want to get this problem diagnosed and fixed. Live application data is available for all Tridon parts on Tridon Part Finder for the most up to date new vehicle applications. All applications are also available on major trade electronic catalogues. For more information, visit or call 1300 362 263.

CABIN FILTERS FOR EVS A broad range is available from Bosch
Last year, the numbers of newly registered electric vehicles rose dynamically due to government incentives, the expansion of the charging infrastructure and a growing environmental consciousness.
For increased comfort and health protection
As a result, electric cars and plug-in hybrids are also of increasing importance for workshops.
Cabin filters with an activated-carbon layer ensure increased comfort and health protection inside the vehicle cabin.
Featuring a market coverage exceeding 90 percent, the Bosch range includes cabin filters for most electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles on the European market. In view of the changing aftermarket business concerning electric vehicles, Bosch says its broad range of cabin filters provides workshops with good chances for additional turnovers. Cabin filters protect the vehicle interior and the vehicle occupants against fine dust, aerosols, bad smells, allergens and bacteria – even in case of electric vehicles. Bosch recommends replacing them ever 15,000 kilometres or at least once a year, especially prior to the pollen and hay fever seasons.
As discussions on nitrogen oxides, ozone and fine dusts in cities around the world continue, the air quality inside the cabin is also of increasing importance.
Specially matched filter layers of Bosch activatedcarbon filters reliably absorb harmful and foul-smelling gases and filter the air separating pollen and fine dust. On top of this, Bosch says FILTER+ also provides additional protection for allergic sufferers. Equipped with a special anti-allergy layer, Bosch says it even lastingly neutralises allergens and bacteria and states that moreover, it also efficiently separates fine dust down to 2.5 micrometers in size. This allows reducing allergic reactions of vehicle occupants such as sneezing, irritated, reddened or watering eyes – especially during the pollen season.
In addition to this health protection, Bosch cabin filters also reduce the amount of deposits on the air conditioning system, thus supporting its energy-efficient operation. Including the broad range for electric and hybrid vehicles, Bosch offers workshops more than 600 different types of cabin filters thus achieving a market coverage of 95 percent. Adding new vehicle applications, this range is annually expanded. Bosch says that by using high-quality materials and by means of thorough processing, it ensures consistently high product quality which results in cabin filters optimally fulfilling their tasks.

HAVE YOU CHOSEN THE CORRECT AIR CONDITIONING CONDENSER FAN? Davies, Craig says the choice can be as simple as looking in our own backyard
For 50 years, Australian-owned Davies, Craig has been manufacturing Thermatic Electric Fans in Melbourne. In that time, it says it has transformed the cooling capabilities of thousands of vehicles’ radiators and AC Condensers with superior cooling efficiency, low current draw and high-level air flow/fan force. Front-line workshops are making the choice when it comes to air conditioning condenser fans for their customers and Davies, Craig says there are aspects of this choice that need to be considered carefully. It says the two major factors one needs to consider when making an electric fan choice are a) fan strength/force, Cubic Ft/Min (CFM) or ft3/min cubic feet/minute; and b) low current draw. If the electric fan you are about to select does not give you this information, Davies, Craig says you should not buy it. The AC condenser is the major component and functions as a heat exchanger for the AC system, converting the refrigerant from a gas to liquid so it can flow through the AC system. A great amount of heat generated can only be expelled if a strong efficient electric condenser fan is deployed to remove this heat quickly and efficiently. If the condenser becomes too hot, it
will not convert the refrigerant into cooled liquid form.
large volumes of air while utilising very low current draw.
The electric fan must always keep the AC condenser cool so it can continue to efficiently convert the gas into liquid and keep the AC system operating correctly.
The models offered include 8”, 9”, 10”, 11” Brushless, 12”, 14” slimline, 14” and 16” High Performance in both 12v and 24v configuration. All models can be set up to function efficiently in either a ‘pusher’ or ‘puller’ application.
The more heat you remove from the condenser, the cooler the air in the cabin. A defective or inefficient electric fan can cause problems with the entire AC system. Davies, Craig says its range of Thermatic Electric Fans have proven, certified CFM ratings and move

ROBINAIR A/C SERVICE UNITS With Deep Recovery for high refrigerant recovery rates The Deep Recovery function of Robinair A/C service units reportedly increases the refrigerant recovery rates and reduces servicing times. Almost all vehicle manufacturers recommend specific service intervals for air conditioning systems. A/C servicing includes functional and visual inspection as well as refrigerant replacement. During the standard procedure, the compressor of the A/C service unit recovers the refrigerant and stores it in its own tank. In doing so, up to 95 percent of the refrigerant is recovered in several steps and the remaining refrigerant is released through the venting outlet of the vacuum pump during the vacuum phase.
Due to this particular loss of refrigerant, resulting in an increased environmental impact and a timeconsuming procedure, Bosch says an optimised function has been developed: Deep Recovery.
Robinair A/C service units with Deep Recovery Robinair AC1234-7i, AC1234-5i, 34988NI and AC1x34-3P service units are already equipped with the Deep Recovery function. In a second recovery stage after the standard procedure, the vacuum pump extracts as much of the remaining refrigerant as possible. Depending on the A/C configuration and its operating conditions, this allows recovery of up to 99 percent of the refrigerant. In the subsequent vacuum phase, only a very small amount of remaining refrigerant is released into the atmosphere. Bosch says that especially in the case of expensive R1234yf refrigerant, this means a significant cost reduction. Another advantage of Deep Recovery is the fact that the vacuum pump starts dehumidifying the air conditioning system as early as possible, during the refrigerant recovery. For workshops this means additional time savings when performing A/C services, significantly
reducing any additionally required vacuum phase. A/C refilling can thus be started earlier.
Recovering more refrigerant more effectively and protecting the environment In this manner, the Robinair A/C service unit performs two phases (refrigerant recovery and A/C system vacuum) in one stage. Waiting times for pressure build-up are also reduced during Deep Recovery and Bosch says that thanks to this resource-saving procedure, the loss of environmentally hazardous refrigerant is minimised as well.

AN AUTOMOTIVE JOURNEY! From preparing a Datsun Sunny to being the GM of Sales ANZ at one of Australia’s leading aftermarket companies, Shane Jeffreys has had quite the journey The Disc Brakes Australia General Manager of Sales ANZ was drawn to the automotive industry after helping a mate prepare a car to compete in club level motorsport.
license and heading for the beach as a young guy, with no air conditioning and wound down windows – it was the perfect introduction to motoring,” he says.
It was during this activity that Shane Jeffreys discovered the camaraderie amongst car people.
Shane gained his work ethic at a young age while helping out in his father’s business.
“I’ve always been drawn to the automotive industry for several reasons. But I would have to say the number one reason is the people,” Shane explains.
“I was still at school. I was working with my father in a kitchen business. During school holidays and weekends I would deliver kitchens to job sites. I remember the ridiculously long hours I worked back then. When we were busy it was nothing to do 16-plus hours a day,” he says.
Shane had been tinkering with mechanical machines long before helping his mate to build his race car engine. He grew up in country New South Wales on the mid-north coast where he loved the rural lifestyle, which included mucking around with motorbikes on his Dad’s acreage. “For 10 years I worked outside the automotive industry when a good friend of mine was building an engine for his Datsun Sunny to take part in NSW Improved Performance Racing Association (IPRA) racing,” Shane said. “Many evenings and weekends were spent preparing this vehicle and I was just helping where I could. When the season started, I recall being at the track when one of the competitors suffered a mechanical failure and everyone pitched in to get him back on the track for the race.” His mate’s Datsun was not the first time he had experienced the iconic Japanese model either – his first car was also a Sunny. “It was a 1979 Datsun Sunny; I swear I washed the red off that car literally. I still recall getting my

Shane moved to Sydney when he was 17 and soon found a job which took in his passion in the automotive industry. “After moving to Sydney when I was 17, I bounced around a few jobs before I found a job with a Bridgestone Tyre dealer in Waitara (Jobsons Tyre and Mechanical),” Shane reflects. “Originally I was hired as tyre fitter, fitting tyres and doing wheel alignments. I was soon given additional responsibilities, which involved me filling in and running other stores in the network when managers where away.” A career move to GUD Automotive (RYCO filters) in 2010 was the impetus to take his career to the next level. “GUD Automotive is an amazing place to work under some passionate and knowledgeable leaders and alongside some of the best people in the industry,” Shane explains. “I have had and continue to have the opportunity
to learn from amazing people in the automotive industry.” He believes it was his “hard work and determination” that has been the keys to his career success. “Starting out as a young guy for me it was all about work ethic; working harder than the others; putting my hand up for additional work (on the weekends) and when I was asked to deliver a result, I made sure I exceeded that expected result,” Shane says. “Work ethic and attitude are attributes that can’t be learnt, you either have them or you don’t. Growing up as a kid my father and grandfather were great role models of this.
TRADE TALK “I still enjoy getting out on my mountain bike for a ride through the national parks; however, not as much as I would like.” Shane believes DBA is well positioned to continue its strong growth both domestically and internationally. “We are experts in stopping things, so nothing is stopping us from applying our expertise to a whole range of products and industries,” Shane says. Nationally Disc Brakes Australia services all major trade suppliers, stocking DBA product in their stores, delivering orders directly to stores, and via their online offshoots, while braking specialist workshops nationwide also play a major role in the distribution of DBA product. Shane says the business strategies that set DBA apart from its opposition are its technological innovations and patents which have been developed for over 40 years, including Kangaroo Paw ventilation, T2 and T3 slot designs, Thermal Graphic Heat Paint stripes, high carbon materials and DBA’s two-piece rotors, to name a few.
“Without a doubt, attitude is what drives you. It is what motivates you when things do not work out the way you want them to.
“We love spending time with family and friends when we are able, and we also enjoy getting away and exploring with the kids.
“Skills can be taught and practiced to perfection, but attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference.”
“As my boys are getting older I would love to spend more time at the race track or a car show on a weekend with them sharing my passion for all things cars.
Shane is proud of his status as a family man. “I am blessed to have a very understanding wife that allows me to travel when needed for my work or for a weekend at Bathurst!” he grinned. “My Wife Nicole and I have two boys, Corbin (six-years-old) and Logan (three-years-old) and number three is due to join us in December.
“Over the years my hobbies have changed with the arrival of my two boys. During our current state of restrictions, simulator racing has been a great way to relax and unwind or taking the radio-controlled cars to the local park with my boys for hours of entertainment.
He states that continuing to grow Australian manufacturing capabilities when many competitors only import product from overseas was a key decision in defining DBA’s principles and its growing braking expertise, making the company what it is today. Shane sees other competitive advantages of the business as providing distinct “Good, Better, Best” product tiers that cater to each section of the market. “We offer a braking solution to everyone. The Street Series offers superior quality over OE for the standard consumer. Then when you look at the performance end of the rotor range, we have the ideal choice for both 4x4 and performance vehicles in our one and two-piece rotor technology,” Shane explains. Shane is conscious that customer communication and education are DBA’s main challenges for the future. “We need to be aware of other brands who claim to be offering similar products or braking expertise, but they don’t have Australian R&D or manufacturing capabilities like us,” he said. “We really utilise our own learnings to help educate our customers on braking developments, supporting their needs, and offering the leading range in Australia. “Disc Brakes Australia was the first to take replacement rotors to the Australian aftermarket and has been the industry leader since day one. “I am determined to play my role in ensuring that the company stays at the top, both locally and internationally.” To learn more about DBA, visit Australian Automotive Aftermarket Magazine October 2021

CONSUMER LAW
ADDRESSING UNCOLLECTED VEHICLES
The failure of a customer to collect a vehicle after an assessment or service can hamper the conduct of business and take up valuable space So, what options are there for the business in such a situation?
Uncollected goods legislative regimes, in 2020 New South Wales and Tasmania updated their legislative regime. It is hoped that some of the more complex uncollected goods legislative regimes will similarly be reviewed and modernised to assist businesses to operate with efficiency. Importantly, this article provides general information and a general overview only of disposing of uncollected vehicles. If your business has an uncollected vehicle at its premises, contact Industry Legal Group). Industry Legal Group recommends that the business obtain the home address, email address
110
Australian Automotive Aftermarket Magazine October 2021 while • If there is a dispute regarding the charges in respect of the vehicle, or the customer is refusing to pay the business for other reasons, then it is very likely the uncollected goods legislative regime will not be appropriate to address the circumstance (please contact Industry Legal Group for further information). • In the majority of circumstances, the vehicle may only be disposed of by public auction. • Generally, the business will be able to retain outstanding amounts, reasonable storage (from the date the notice is sent) and the expenses of the business in relation to the sale of the vehicle. It is important to check the relevant legislative regime to ensure the business is only retaining amounts allowed under the relevant legislation. • If the amount of the proceeds of sale remaining after the charges of the business are deducted cannot be returned to the customer, it must be deposited with the authority specified in the legislative regime. • Generally, record keeping of particular
information is required under the legislative regimes, additionally, we recommend the business keep detailed records of the disposal of the vehicle. • Industry Legal Group. Alternatively, if you have previously received an uncollected goods fact sheet from Industry Legal Group and wish to refer to the fact sheet to dispose of another uncollected vehicle left at the premises of your business, please contact Industry Legal Group first to check for any legislative changes to the uncollected goods regime in your State or Territory. If there are legislative changes, Industry Legal Group can provide you with an updated fact sheet.
Takeaways The key takeaways if there is an uncollected vehicle at your business premises are: • contact Industry Legal Group to discuss the situation, to obtain a fact sheet/information relevant for your State or Territory, and/or check for legislative changes; • make sure you use the correct disposal process; • obtain the home address of your customers for each service.

HR
IS SUPERANNUATION PAID ON OVERTIME? The Superannuation Guarantee (SG) is the minimum amount of superannuation an employer must pay to avoid the superannuation guarantee charge The SG rate is currently 10 percent of an employee’s ordinary time earnings (OTE). Generally, payments in respect of overtime are not OTE. However, the difficulty can be in identifying and distinguishing earnings in respect of ordinary hours of work which are included in OTE from payments expressly referrable to overtime hours which are excluded from OTE.
Superannuation Guarantee Ruling According to SGR2009/2 (Ruling), which is not legally binding but explains the meaning of OTE as defined in the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 (SGAA): Overtime payments 41. Payments for work performed during hours outside an employee’s ordinary hours of work are not OTE. 42. This is so whether the payments are calculated at an hourly rate or the employee gets a specific loading, or an annualised or lump sum component of a total salary package, that is expressly referable to overtime hours as remuneration for overtime hours worked. 43. However, some employees, particularly some managers and professionals, receive a single undissected annual salary within a remuneration package that recognises in a nonspecific way that the employee may often be expected to work more than the ordinary hours of work prescribed. The whole amount of salary payable under such a package is OTE, unless overtime amounts are distinctly identifiable as mentioned in paragraph 42 of this Ruling.
Meaning of “ordinary hours of work” and “overtime” The SGAA does not define “ordinary hours of work.” However, the Ruling explains that an employee’s ordinary hours of work are the hours specified as their ordinary hours of work under the relevant award, agreement and/or contract. Any hours worked in excess, or outside of the span, of the specified ordinary hours (i.e. overtime) are not part of the employee’s ordinary hours of work. In Bluescope Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd v Australian Workers’ Union [2019] FCAFC 84, Chief Justice Allsop found: “The meaning that best reflects these considerations and the text, context, purpose and history of the provision is earnings in respects of ordinary or standard hours of work at ordinary rates of pay as provided for in a relevant industrial instrument, or contract of employment, but if such does not exist (and there is no distinction between ordinary or standard hours and other hours by reference to
rates of pay) earnings in respect of the hours that the employee has agreed to work or, if different, the hours usually or ordinarily worked.” The earnings in respect of ordinary hours of work need to be distinguished from the payments expressly referrable to overtime hours. It is expected that the overtime hours are remunerated at a higher rate or otherwise identifiable as a separate component of the total pay. An employer and employee may enter into an employment contract which includes an overtime payment as part of an annualised, or lump sum, salary package, or requires the employee to work more than the ordinary hours stipulated in an award (for example, 40 hours instead of 38 hours). If, under the employment contract, the earnings in respect of ordinary hours of work and payments expressly referrable to overtime hours are distinctly identifiable, then it is likely overtime hours worked outside of ordinary hours of work are not OTE. Identifying payments expressly referrable to overtime hours depends on the circumstances and may even vary between employees employed by a business.
Examples The examples provided below are adapted from the Ruling: • Example One: An employee is employed under an award that stipulates that ordinary hours will not exceed 38 per week and hours exceeding this will be overtime paid at time-and-a-half for the first three hours, there is no employment contract. The employee worked 38 hours and is requested to work a further three additional hours on a Saturday. In these circumstances the 38 hours are ordinary hours included in OTE and the superannuation contribution is paid only on those earnings. It is assumed for the following two examples that the relevant award provides that a full-time employee’s ordinary hours of work will be an average of 38 hours per week: • Example Two: The employment contract provides that the employee will work 42 hours per week, 40 of which are expressly identified as ordinary hours (paid at a certain rate) and two of which are expressly identified as overtime hours (paid at a higher rate). In these circumstances, the 40 hours are likely to be included in OTE and the superannuation contribution paid on those earnings. Payment in respect of the two overtime hours is not OTE. • Example Three: The employment contract provides that the employee will work 42 hours
per week at the same hourly rate without any distinction between ordinary hours and overtime hours. In these circumstances, the 42 hours are likely to be included in OTE and the superannuation contribution paid on those earnings.
What does this mean for businesses? If a business does have employment contracts in place for employees, the business should consider if there is a risk that they are paying incorrect superannuation contribution amounts or paying more superannuation contributions amounts than required. Where annualised or lump sum payments are in place for employees under an employment contract, there is a risk that superannuation contributions will be payable on the entire annualised or lump sum amount if the earnings in respect of ordinary hours of work are not sufficiently distinguishable from payments expressly referrable to overtime hours under the employment contract. It is prudent for businesses to obtain relevant advice if they: • are unsure they are making the correct superannuation contribution in relation to their employees; and/or • would like to take steps to provide greater certainty around making superannuation contributions.

HOW MUCH IS THAT JOB REALLY COSTING YOU?
Information is key when it comes to both short-term and long-term business profitability When you get down to the granularity of job management, accurate records help you determine where a project went customised job costing reports and clear gross profit goals, you can make data-driven decisions by knowing: • Are jobs delivered on budget? • Are we within our target profitability margins? • Who are the most profitable and least profitable clients? • Which clients do we need to re-price?
• Do we have operational inefficiencies? • Are there employees / contractors with certain trends on jobs? • Who are the most productive employees/ contractors? • Where are we seeing time leakage?

EBAY DOMINATES MARKETPLACE SALES OF AUTO ACCESSORIES A car or truck part sells every three seconds on eBay.com.au The continuing digital evolution of the automotive industry is well embodied in the eBay marketplace with an estimated AUD $15.7 billion of car parts and accessories sold globally across its various country sites including ebay.com.au Alongside prominent sector retailers including Supercheap Auto, Sparesbox, Online Auto Parts and Autobarn, a substantial amount of eBay’s automotive category sales is sold by small to midsize retailers and merchants. Zellis () Chief Executive Officer, Tim Davies, says this is a huge opportunity. eBay launched in Australia 22 years ago initially as a peer-to-peer auction website, and underwent

Australian Automotive Aftermarket Magazine October 2021
a massive transformation about 10 years ago, onboarding manufacturers and retailers to satisfy consumer demand for specific brands and products. Today, many of the top Australian retailers have their own eBay stores including BigW, The Good Guys, Country Road, Peters of Kensington and many more. eBay is today home to over 40,000 business sellers. As Australia’s most visited shopping site and with nearly 12 million shoppers visiting eBay every month, and two out of every three Australian adults having bought something on eBay in the past year, it remains the largest online marketplace in Australia. Today over 90 percent of products on offer are brand new, fixed price. Over the past few years, there has been an explosion of marketplaces in Australia including Amazon.com.au, Kogan.com, Catch.com.au, Mydeal.com.au, and Ozsale.com.au, to name just a few. The popularity of online marketplaces is perhaps best understood by comparing them to a shopping centre as opposed to a standalone shopfront.
As consumers ourselves, it often makes more sense to visit a shopping centre to browse a range of retailers rather than driving all over town to visit a series of individual shops. That’s why the online marketplaces are gaining so much popularity, and even more so as pandemic restrictions and lockdowns encourage more of us to shop online. eCommerce sales volume has roughly doubled in the past 18 months, and Tim says the experts are forecasting that of the estimated $11 billion to be spent by Australian consumers in the lead up to Christmas 2021, around 48 percent of it will be online.

ACS’ TOOL HIRE PROGRAM Supporting workshops nationwide
The Australian Clutch Services tool hire program was introduced to the market over two years ago and was developed to support customers around the country with access to Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT) removal and installation tools as well as specialised tools for more conventional clutch jobs. The tool hire program has proven very successful in the market with many ACS distributors taking advantage of the program to help expand their offerings for their own customers. “The tool hire program has been a great success in the market and is helping to support workshops with this transition into DCT servicing and repair,” ACS Sales Manager, Colin Jevons, said. “We have received great feedback on the program and have continued to revise the offering and process to keep everything as simple and efficient as possible for our customers around Australia.” The tool hire program is available with the purchase of any applicable ACS clutch kit and includes a range of popular tools, predominantly
focused on dry and wet type DCT removal and installation. These tools suit various applications from Volkswagen, Audi, Hyundai, Kia, Renault, Ford, Alfa Romeo, Fiat and Jeep. “Most of the replacement clutch assembly units for dry dual-clutch transmissions require both a universal tool and also a specialised tool for that particular vehicle,” Colin said. “We have the universal tool and a variety of these specialised tools available in the program to avoid workshops having to go out and purchase these to complete the job. “If they find they are regularly replacing these units in a specific vehicle type, we also offer these tools for outright purchase.” Australian Clutch Services has been investing heavily into its DCT program to help support the Australian aftermarket with the components required for this popular transmission type. “Our DCT program continues to grow and evolve as the new car market changes,” Colin said.
“We have seen a major increase in the number of workshops taking on DCT work and now offer a range of complete replacements kits for dry or wet style transmissions, gearbox service kits, dualmass flywheels, replacement accessories and the tool program. “These products fall under our standard replacement brand, ClutchPro, and offer OE level quality and performance.” For more information on the ClutchPro DCT range or tool hire program, please visit

CONNECTEDNESS NURTURES GROWTH
Anthony Ryan, the owner of Peninsula Auto Spares, joined Parts 4 Automotive in August 2019 Peninsula Auto Spares can trace its roots back to 1992 when Alan Green, an experienced parts interpreter, decided to go it alone. Alan grew the operation over some 20 years, but in 2012, when retirement proved too attractive, he sold the business to Anthony. As the name would suggest, Peninsula Auto Spares is located out on the peninsula in Clontarf, Queensland, near Redcliffe. While several automotive franchise groups courted Anthony following the collapse of the Combined Auto Group, he chose to remain independent. When Anthony was invited to join Parts 4, he says he was impressed with its buying power and commitment to helping members remain independent, so in 2019 he took the plunge and joined the group. “We haven’t looked back since,” remarked Anthony. “While it’s not mandated, after joining the group, I made a conscious effort to buy through Parts 4 preferred suppliers because I think for a group like Parts 4 to thrive, it needs support for all members.” Anthony says he has been impressed by the value of belonging to a larger buying group and is undoubtedly reaping the rewards.
“Having a central team negotiating with suppliers on your behalf is powerful,” said Anthony. “Before I joined Parts 4, so many of these suppliers said, ‘Anthony, you’re already on the best possible price, as good as anyone else. The best possible price’ but after I joined Parts 4, it was amazing to watch the prices reduce.” “I guess you should never trust a salesperson,” he quipped. “And the rebates don’t hurt either.” Parts 4 members have the opportunity to participate in an attractive rebate program. “The Parts 4 rebate program is easy to manage. All I have to do is support our preferred suppliers, pay within their trading terms, while the team in the Parts 4 office looks after the rest. I just get an annual check. It’s that easy.” Like many of the Parts 4 members, Anthony values the camaraderie fostered by the group as one of its most valuable assets. “I really like to bounce ideas off other Parts 4 members. It’s nice to know that there’s a group of like-minded people out there who have your back and are willing to help out if you need assistance,” Anthony said. Parts 4 Automotive members enjoy frequent regional meetings, in addition to being invited to
an annual, national conference and trade show, so there are plenty of opportunities for members to connect. “Honestly, I think Parts 4 is great for independents. The support you get puts us independents on the map,” said Anthony. “As a Parts 4 member, I’m part of a big picture, and it gives me that ability to compete at a higher level. As a small little shop, I know I couldn’t do it on my own.” Parts 4 Automotive has more than 80 members across Australia, all of which enjoy the benefits of being part of this powerful buying group while at the same time remaining fiercely independent.

FNQ STORE SETS THE STANDARD
Autobarn’s recently opened store in the Townsville region is the retail chain’s biggest and a sign of things to come as the organisation continues its growth Autobarn’s freshly opened store in the Far North Queensland regional center of Townsville is its biggest ever and is one that the business hopes will set the future standard for one of Australia’s leading automotive parts and accessories outlets. “We recognised that Townsville has a large population with circa 200,000 people in the greater area,” Bapcor Retail General Manager of Operations, Luke Rich, said. “Our old site wasn’t in the right part of town and the opportunity presented itself to get an A-grade site within the Domain Centre, which is one of the best Home Maker Centres in Australia.
“We consulted with McCartney Design to take the work we had begun 12-months earlier on Autobarn Bayswater to the next level. “The brief was about developing a design to cater for new and extended ranges with an emphasis on Touring, 4WD and Workshop Tools. “As such there is greater than 250m2 of space dedicated to 4WD, which includes 10 Bull Bars on display, working driving lights, suspension, winches and a fully kitted out Toyota Prado built by the team on display. “We have also expanded ranges in many of the traditional areas Autobarn is renowned for such as Sound and Vision, Car Care and Lubricants.” Luke says the locals have reacted extremely positively to the store since it’s opening. “The feedback has been overwhelming, and it is a credit to our store team for delivering on the service promise. “This was reflected in our Grand Opening celebration sale that broke all previous opening
records for Autobarn. We have high expectations for the store’s results, and so far, we’re on target.” He believes this store will set the standard for many future Autobarn outlets. “We really do think we’ve nailed the 4WD and Touring section of the store and are now in the process of retro-fitting some of the new stores built in the last 12-months with elements of our Townsville store,” Luke said. “This also includes fixtures, fitting and some of the newly developed signage highlighting key messages such as our ‘Low Price Guarantee,’ ‘3-Easy Ways to Shop’ and our ‘Professional Fitting Onsite.’” The new store is located at Domain Central, Tenancy B06/103 Duckworth St, Garbutt Queensland.

SUMMERNATS APPROACHES
Organisers say “there’s a billion good reasons to look forward to Summernats in January” Summernats organisers say they were excited to hear the ACT Chief Minister recently announce a path forward to the return of large events in November and December, and stand in full support of the Government’s plans to safely reopen the ACT. Vaccination rates are expected to be above 90 percent by December, and borders between New South Wales, Victoria and the ACT are expected to be open. Given that, organisers say they can’t see any reason why Summernats 34 shouldn’t go ahead in a COVID-safe format. “We congratulate ACT Health and Government on keeping the latest outbreak well under control and getting ACT vaccination rates at the highest level nationally,” Summernats Co-Owner, Andy Lopez, said. “The ACT reopening plan is a document of hope, and provides the perfect platform for the 2022 ACT event season. “This will enable the return of Summernats, Big Bash, Super Rugby, NRL and Enlighten, as well as many other important local community events.”
COVID has decimated tourism and hospitality in the ACT, with many operators at the brink. A recently commissioned economic impact study shows that Summernats has brought $750m into the ACT economy over the last 30 years, and more importantly, will inject a further $250m over the next seven years. That’s a billion reasons why Summernats, and destination events like it, are so important to the recovery of the ACT tourism and hospitality sectors. The $30m that Summernats will generate at the 2022 event will be the perfect kickstart to the tourism economy recovery, providing jobs and surety for accommodation, hospitality, national attractions, and other local business. Andy said the Summernats team has been in contact with ACT Health, Venues ACT, Access Canberra, Visit Canberra and the Chief Minister’s Office throughout the COVID ordeal. “We’ve been working with all parts of government with the number one aim of delivering a safe, fun and sustainable event when the conditions are right. The right conditions are coming, and the
work needs to ramp up now so we’re ready to go in January,” Andy said. Summernats presented ACT Health with a 200-page COVID Safe event plan (prior to the current outbreak) demonstrating high levels of compliance and readiness, using lessons learned from the team’s safe delivery of festivals in New South Wales, Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia during the pandemic. Andy says the plan simply needs to be finessed to match the current conditions. The Street Machine Summernats 34, proudly supported by Rare Spares, is scheduled to be held across Thursday 6 to Sunday 9 January 2022 at Exhibition Park in Canberra. For more information, visit
GCG TURBOCHARGERS NOW DISTRIBUTING FORGE MOTORSPORT UK IN AUSTRALIA The products of the UK tuning company are sought after by track and performance enthusiasts GCG Turbochargers has announced it is now a distributor for the UK brand Forge Motorsport. Forge Motorsport is one of the top aftermarket tuning product providers in the UK, having climbed its way to the top from entering in major competition events and conducting research and development programs to produce world class products. Forge, being a worldwide brand, has established positions in the UK, Asia, and America and offers an extensive range of vehicle specific intercoolers, turbo blankets, induction kits, turbocharger actuators, oil catch cans, exhausts, carbon intake systems and silicone hoses.
GCG Turbochargers says Forge has developed a reputation among hot hatch owners for the use of silicone for their hoses which have reportedly proven to be more durable than the plastic alternative, lasting the extreme conditions that occur on tuned engines. The products also come in a variety of colours, elevating the engine bay and providing synergy between the mechanics and kerb appeal. Steering into a new direction, Forge has recently taken hold of the Japanese and Korean tuning market with products specifically for the A90 Supra and the Kia Stinger. “Since connecting with the owner Peter Miles at SEMA in 2017and learning about his Company’s ethics, I have watched Forge develop a world class brand which made the decision of becoming a distribution partner some three years later an easy transition,” GCG Turbochargers Australia Director, Brett Lloyd, said. This exciting news offers opportunities for the Australian aftermarket industry, making it easier for locals to purchase and access the Forge product range. GCG has invested extensively in a
stock holding for local distribution and support of the local tuning scene. “We understand our customers and want to provide them with access to valuable products that enhances their cars performance and visual appearance. Forge complements our brand and values, fitting in nicely with our current product range, and at a fair value,” Brett said. Since launching the products on the GCG Turbochargers website, the company says it has seen huge interest in Forge, demonstrating the brand’s popularity and demand locally. “We’re looking forward to seeing cars sporting the Forge range, hearing about the engine build process and stories from the tracks. We also cannot wait to return to the show scene to allow customers to touch and feel the product,” Brett said. For more information, visit Australian Automotive Aftermarket Magazine October 2021

BEAT THE HEAT
The company offers an extensive range of transmission coolers Automatic transmissions include a number of rubber seals and other components that are sensitive to high temperatures and changes to the heat cycle. This is the main reason why heat is the number one cause of automatic transmission failure. The more the transmission’s heat cycle is reduced, the longer the seals and other rubber components will last. Lowering the transmission temperature also maximises the transmission’s oil life. As the largest manufacturer of 4WD and tradie ute transmission oil coolers, Wholesale Automatic says it fully understands the negative effects that heat can have on automatic transmissions. It says the best way to mitigate the effects of heat on an automatic transmission is by using a quality manufactured oil cooler kit specific to the vehicle.
FRAM 4WD FILTER KIT RANGE EXPANDED Providing maximum performance and durability on and off road
Filpro Automotive has expanded its range of Fram 4WD Filter Kits with multiple new applications and also an extended range of filter kits which now include cabin air filters where required. Filpro Automotive says it makes for the complete servicing solution, packaged conveniently in the one box with one reference number. Each Fram 4WD Filter Kit includes: • Air filter – providing superior protection for strenuous driving conditions. The advanced filter media has been stringently tested and has an increased dirt holding capacitysurpassing ISO 5011 testing standards. • Fuel filter – serving a vital function in today’s modern tight-tolerance engine fuel systems. By removing rust and dirt particles from petrol or diesel, fuel filters protect fuel pumps and injectors from rapid wear and failure. • Oil filter – ideal for drivers who push their vehicles, whether in stop and go traffic, by towing, or driving in extreme weather conditions. A blend of cellulose and synthetic
microscopic fibres provide an ideal balance of dirt-trapping and dirt-holding capacity, whilst providing optimum oil flow to the engine. • Cabin air filter (where required) – allowing travelers inside the vehicle to breathe cleaner air by filtering out pollen, allergens, exhaust fumes, dirt and dust that enter the vehicle through the cooling/heating system. Filpro Automotive says Fram Cabin Air Filters can eliminate up to 98 percent of these impurities. To find the right filter fitment, visit to use the online catalogue tool.

TERRAIN TAMER EXPANDS PARABOLIC LEAF RANGE Wholesale Automatic designs and manufactures a full range of oil cooler kits in Australia to meet the needs of its customers, especially those who tow, go off road, or carry any type of load. All of Wholesale Automatic’s coolers are mounted on heavy duty, one-piece folded brackets that have been dual coated with zinc and finished in Mannex Black. Every kit is engineered to withstand rough surfaces, including corrugated roads. Each cooler is ready for DIY install and comes with everything required, including full colour stepby-step fitting instructions. Wholesale Automatic does note that a cooler kit should not be used when the mounting bracket has been made from stainless steel. It should also not be used if it has not been made as a single piece mount bracket. The company warns to always avoid mounting systems that include two-piece mounts or very flimsy straplike brackets.

The innovative range now includes Toyota Landcruiser 70/73/75 series applications
Terrain Tamer says it has recently expanded its range of Parabolic Leaf Springs to now include Toyota Landcruiser 70/73/75 series models, utilising the same impressive parabolic design as the popular springs previously released for Toyota Hilux and Landcruiser 76/78/79 Series, Ford Ranger, Mazda BT50 and Mitsubishi Triton. Terrain Tamer says its Parabolic Leaf Springs’ unique design offers the best of both worlds, helping the spring to flex while still providing the strength needed to bear the weight of heavy loads. It explains that this is particularly useful in 4WD applications, carrying excessive load on the driveline or when challenged with difficult terrain, as the flex allows the spring to give a little when the driver hits a bump in the road. It says the design allows the differential housing to rotate with the springs and effectively provides a smoother ride, reducing the shock transferred to the crown wheel and pinion. Terrain Tamer states that standard leaf packs stay set with almost no flex at all, and the same force would cause more shock to the vehicle and driver.
Essentially coupling a more comfortable ride with a strength not afforded to traditional comfort springs, Terrain Tamer’s parabolic springs are well suited to vehicles close to their GVM. They contain fewer leaves than regular leaf springs and get their name from their tapered parabolic design, meaning the spring is thicker in the centre and thinner toward the ends, rather than the usual linear style. Terrain Tamer says this design eliminates the weight of often heavy, thick, traditional leaf packs, dramatically reduces the unsprung weight of the vehicle and frees up weight for heavier loads or towing. Through extensive research and development, Terrain Tamer says it has found that the new shape provides better axle articulation, as well as almost no interleaf friction, allowing the spring to compress or extend with ease without touching each other until there is a reasonable load on the vehicle, up to 500kg.

FORMULA 4X4 AND 4WD 24/7 PARTNER UP Formula 4x4 and 4WD 24/7 have extended their partnership for another year Formula 4x4 has been part of 4WD 24/7 since early 2019 and some of the first interactions can be seen on the Fulcrum Suspensions YouTube channel where the Formula 4x4 lift kit range was fitted to Graham Cahill’s Isuzu D-Max and tested on Australia’s toughest tracks. Formula 4x4 is backed by the knowledge and experience of Fulcrum Suspensions. The Formula 4X4 range was developed by Fulcrum Suspensions locally, and entered the market with a focus on affordability, comfort and performance. Formula 4x4 is designed specifically for Australian conditions, ensuring they perform in all harsh Aussie terrains, as well as for everyday on-road travel. Formula 4x4 says it is always expanding its product range and is constantly on the hunt to improve its existing products. Formula 4x4 says it has recently released a range of newly engineered steering dampers which cover a range of older 4WDs that were in desperate need of a comfort solution. It says that now when purchasing a Formula 4x4 lift kit you can get the complete package, receiving both front and rear Formula 4x4 big bore shocks, plus a brand-new Formula steering damper. Formula 4x4’s current range of products reportedly include industry leading lift kits and many more other products. The lift kits include Formula 4x4 shocks, leaf springs, torsion bars, ReadyStruts and also utilise one of a kind SuperPro bushings specially
designed for Formula 4x4 shocks. Formula 4x4 states that its lift kit is a onestop complete upgrade package for anyone’s four-wheel drive. Formula 4x4 states that securing the latest partnership allows 4WD 24/7 to continue to utilise and demonstrate how valuable, affordable, comfortable, and strong the Formula 4x4 range is. Showcasing Formula 4x4’s capability in real-world situations and performing to the highest standards, Formula 4x4 states that its lift kits have already given 4WD 24/7 a true understanding of reliability and that this partnership will strengthen it even further. Formula 4x4 says it is thankful to maintain its partnership with 4WD 24/7 and hopes they can both continue to provide Australians with outstanding entertainment and suspension solutions.

AEROKLAS EXTENDS CANOPY WARRANTY The warranty period now spans four years
Aeroklas has announced its customers can now enjoy an extended warranty on the company’s canopy shells and paint. The previous warranty of three years has been extended to four, giving customers an even longer guarantee on the canopy products. Aeroklas states it was the first company in the world to offer Engineered ABS Double Shell Canopies to customers. It explains these canopies are rated as having a higher impact resistance than standard canopy designs and can reshape after impact. The inner and outer shells are moulded together to double the strength and durability of a single-skinned canopy for extra safety and peace of mind. Each shell is manufactured through a process of thermoforming and crafted from a single piece of ABS – acrylonitrile butadiene styrene – to eliminate any joins and the weaknesses associated with this. During product development, pendulum testing of up to 200kgs was carried out, with Aeroklas reporting there was no structural damage to the shell. Aeroklas says the high performance of these canopies has given its team a high level of confidence in the product line.

POWERING AHEAD
Garrett Advancing Motion is driving its business forward by investing in motorsports Garrett Advancing Motion Australia has been a part of the motorsport fraternity for 40-plus years. The potential of turbocharging in the racing environment was recognised as early as the 1920s and 30s when compressor cars, which used supercharger technology, competed against each other. Today, turbos and e-compressors help to turn power into podium positions and deliver enduring success at some of the most famous race events in the world, such as in Formula One, IndyCar, the FIA World Rally or 24 Hours of Le Mans. From back in the early days of drag racing to supporting the Nissan Skylines and Ford Sierras upsetting their rivals in the Australian Touring Car Championships, to today working with some of the largest professional teams globally, Garrett Advancing Motion has played an important role in this journey. From the Ferrari Formula One team to the 24 Hours of Le Mans winning Toyota Gazoo Racing, Garrett is well-placed in the upper echelons of the sport. In fact, the last 22 winners at Le Mans have done so using Garrett Turbochargers. Garrett also supports plenty of local teams here in Australia, including PAC Racing, Ben Bray Racing, JET Racing, Castle Hill Performance Racing, Mad Mike and Promaz – just to name a few. Clearly, Garrett Performance Turbochargers can be found in most areas of motorsport, with Garrett Advancing Motion constantly releasing new performance turbochargers and looking to propel its race partners to quicker times on the track. “We are always looking to prove the high reliability, performance and quality of the Garrett turbocharger,” Garrett Advancing Motion Pacific General Manager, Aftermarket, Paul Carlsson, said. “At the same time as working with the professional race teams we have also supported many of the up-and-coming race teams that are just starting

“Every successful racer starts from the ground up. At Garrett Advancing Motion, we are here to help competitors become great brand ambassadors for us and for the entire motorsports industry, wherever it ends up taking them,” Paul said. “We understand racing can be an expensive habit and that’s why we created a tiered program that will help ease some of those stresses, especially as racers graduate through the tiers. “For Boost Fraternity members,! “A purchase is also not necessary to be part of Boost Fraternity, but you do have to run a Garrett Motion Turbocharger!” For all your Garrett motorsport and performance turbocharger requirements, contact your nearest Garrett Official Performance Distributor.

HERSHEY'S KISSES Holiday Candy Cane Mint Cand...
ViewI’ve been painting on paper lately. I’ve also been doing a lot of collages. It’s fun to include pressed flowers, magazine images, other paintings, found objects, and various types of paint.
I went through a difficult time in the 90’s, I basically didn’t leave my apartment for about two years. During that time I did a lot of art. Most of it was collages. I plastered a huge wall corner to corner with my collages. I ended up throwing it all away. I sometimes have dreams of those pieces, haunting.
Anyway, the collages I am doing now hopefully won’t cause anyone nightmares! They look very nice framed and are easy to transport, I will add prints of these to my new Etsy shop, in the very near future!I joined a new group last year and a friend leant me his group tabard so that I could jump right in and start playing without having to worry too much about new kit (it’s amazing what just a tabard will do for your kit if you join Highguard at Empire LRP).
Well, it’s not too long until the first event on 2017, so I’ve been locking myself in my sewing room and making mountains of new kit for the new season. Part of this was taking a look at the tabard I was leant and realising that while ripped eyelets look pretty cool, they aren’t actually going to last that much longer. Something needed to be done.
Matt wrote a while back about the idea of being ‘coolthentic’ at LARP. He argued that things should ‘feel original but look familiar.’ But how do you make things look familiar? I think that part of looking familiar is taking practices from the time and putting them into our modern costume. No, I’m not talking about slavishly hand stitching every seam even when you can’t see it. And I’m certainly not talking about things like weaving your own fabric.
But certain things do make costume feel familiar. For instance, the arm scythe in a garment (if you look at the clothes you’re wearing right now, there is proberbly a seam that joins the sleeve to the tors0 – that’s basically the arm scythe). On older garments you tend to have a very small, right arm scythe, but it’s placed further in towards the centre of your body. Your shoulder joint would be in the sleeve in a medieval garment, whereas in modern garments the sleeve starts after your shoulder tip finishes. You proberbly don’t even realise when you look at a garment if you’re not into sewing your own costume, but an old fashioned sleeve placement could well make your brain think ‘that’s old and in keeping with the period we are vaguely playing’, even if you don’t realise that your brain is doing it. It feels ‘not modern’.
Back in 2012 WRAP determined that on average here in the UK each person creates 70kg of textile waste a year – that is throwing away clothes and so forth. Apparently we send £140 million of used clothes to landfill each year. I mean, I don’t know about you but that statistic horrifies me (especially as I rarely buy myself new clothes). With modern technology it’s so easy to make fabric and clothes. We have massive mechanical computerised looms that churn out any kind of fabric you can imagine, and factories full of people on low wages using incredibly fast machines to piece garments together for cheap sale.
I’m entirely sure that this won’t come as a surprise to you – but a few hundred years ago this wasn’t normal practice. Fabric was handmade and expensive. Garments were regularly re-cut and re-sewn in order to make new fashions. Skirts with massive amounts of fabric were reused as things like altar cloths after the wearers death. And clothes would be repaired as well as reused.
So with that in mind, I set out to make the repairs to the tabard visible. I mean, not rough and obvious. I wasn’t going to repair the tabard by stitching it up with a ball of twine or anything, but I also decided not to use any particularly modern materials. Normally, for instance, I’d use fusible tape to stick fabric to the back of a rip and then invisibly stitch the patch down and the rip closed. I just didn’t bother hiding my stitches. I whip stitched a patch of linen that didn’t match in colour to the back and I let my stitches show on the front in a roughly matching thread. It’s not in-your-face-obvious, but up close you’d certainly see it if you were looking. These are battlefield repairs that are suitable for the look of the nation (other nations might just get new clothes I’m sure…).
And I tried to preserve as many of the metal eyelets in place as possible so that when I added my own they were visibly different. I have even started oversewing them in an almost-matching thread so that they are more secure for the future. Upgrades! Of course something nice about this is that the matching tunics that the group initially bought all those years ago will start to all become different over time. They will all gain natural wear and tear in different ways – heavy shoulder armour would wear at a tunic differently to the wear from scouting through the forest. And these changes should be embraced, with garments modified to fit the wearers needs!
So basically, I think you should embrace repairing your garments when it fits into your nation and group briefs! It will help the garments read as more familiar to the time period that you’re trying to create (specifically, it will help reinforce that you are not in ‘our world today’ where we throw away clothes rather than repairing them). And of course this doesn’t just apply to medieval fantasy either – I’m pretty sure that many dystopian and post-apocalyptic worlds would benefit from a bit of natural ageing on costumes too. Even if you have to help it along yourself before a first event…
It’s with huge thanks that I mention Lauren from The Midgard Seamstress here. Not only did she create the gorgeous original group tunics, but she is rarely too busy to talk costume in a field. And of course it’s testament to the quality of her work that the tunics are only now starting to show signs of wear that need repairing after quite a few years of regular use in a field!

[…] time I think about making a similar LARP costume I’d also consider breaking and repairing some of the pieces, which adds an extra layer of depth to something that is supposed to look […]
Nice neat work… I like the way the stitches fade in to the blue of the outer tunic cloth.Views

Originally posted by myheartofmusic. Well, at least almost all of you. Because while Dean was the epitome of grumpy old man, Jack on your side was the epitome of happy-go-lucky. Because not only was he not tired in the least bit, he was also the only one to not have gotten beaten up or covered in some weird substance like the rest of you. She had been a tough one and until it was all over, things had gotten pretty mess. Dean was the living proof of it, just with one look; completely unlike Jack.
Lucky indeed and certainly happy. Dean, aside from getting the rest of it like blood and weird substances, had gotten part of what you were covered in at the moment. Especially not when you were itching to get away from them the soonest possible for… personal reasons. Keep that up and my heart will nearly burst with all the sibling love that I just might have to hug you till yours does too!
All I can think about is getting this off of me right now, as it is. The idea of a show and a bed sounds divine right now. You were practically raised by your brothers, you did love them more than anyone, and in a world and a kind of life where you could lose them so easily you should want to spend as much time as possible with them.

How do you convince a 68 year old farmer that there are things about farming which he does not know? Or, he is not doing it the right way?
No matter the age and experience, making someone accept new ways of doing things or adapting to a new way of living life is not an easy task. To go deeper into the issue, 'new' has always been scary, there is a different set of challenges and risks associated with anything 'new' that people are not aware of and prepared for, hence they will resist to it. It is a human nature and throughout history 'new' has always had a tough time in receiving acceptance from people used to a certain way of doing things or living lives. Anything 'new' has always had a rough beginning. Similar was the case for us during the initial phase of Small Agro-Farmers Income Improvement Project (SAFII). SAFII is a three year project aimed at increasing income from agriculture for small land-holding subsistence farmers from earthquake affected areas of Sindhupalchowk district. As mentioned earlier, the project was initially received with a lot of skepticism. Skepticism, not in the form of frowning faces or questions regarding the methods that we wanted to introduce. For most of us, Nepalis, saying 'NO' has always been a struggle, we just don't do it. Or, we do it our own way. The same was the case for us during the initial phase of this project. But there are few exceptions, while convincing most of our participants was such a struggle for us that it frustrates us till date when we look back at those days, there were few who believed in us and gave us their time and energy. Now, after 8 months of continuous efforts from our team especially the field team, our farmers are slowly opening up to the techniques that we want them to adopt. At present we are working with 20 farmer groups (FGs) with an average of 20 members per group who have committed themselves towards meeting the objective of this project. We would like to dedicate this post to our participants who have accepted us with open arms and laid their trust in our team. We would also like to thank our project team and other stakeholders for their continuous effort and 'never-say-never' attitude which helped us in changing the mindset of our participants.
The picture here is a reflection of our journey. As much as it motivates us, we are also aware that this is just a small step and there is a lot more to achieve in the days to come.Our training is created for individuals of any age and has adopted an exceptional pathway to dental consideration.

Karla Hagel
I couldn’t be more grateful for Dr. Pooja and her team. My 5 year old daughter needed a major dental procedure done, including a tooth extraction. I worried about my daughter having a negative first experience with a dentist ...and having long term affects. Dr. Pooja is highly knowledgeable and and was thorough, patient and attentive to mine and my daughters needs. Even after such a major dental procedure (that would make even an adult anxious) my 5 year old left the office with no tears and loving the dentist! Thank you!
Dorothy Thompson
Great facility with friendly staff and professional doctor. Dr. Pooja explained the treatment plan in details which made me feel very reassured. I referred my entire family to come to see her! They really seem to care about the well-being of your teeth.

Had a great experience at Apple Dental Care. Dr.Pooja took time to explain each procedure in detail and allowed me to decide if I wanted to proceed with the treatment. No forced from any of staff members to book any further treatments. Very relaxing and calming environment. Very friendly front desk.

Tete Marantika better known as dj Mass Destruction is born on 02-10-1985 in Apeldoorn. His passion for music starts at a young age due to his father who always played the gitar. He decided to put his son on gitarlessons. But he soon found out that he didn’t like it. Soon after that a friend came to him on the primary school with an Hardcore CD. At that moment his love for electronic music was born. When he was sixteen years old he went to Innercity and saw Marco V in action, then he realised that’s what he wants to do. So he asked his mother for some decks and a mixer. Feeling uncertain for a long time with this music, because he still didn’t know what he really wanted to play. Untill the day came that he saw Rude awakening for the first time at Club r_AW, it was a mixture between techno and hardcore. On that moment he found out what kind of music he really wanted to play.

Today we welcome back Dr. Wendy LeBorgne in part two of her amazing interview in which Wendy shares with us her nerve wracking TED Talk experience when she spoke on the topic of vocal branding and how your voice shapes your communication image. In this episode, Wendy describes the element of the voice which impact authentic and engaged communication. She believes that our voice is our most important communication asset which is unique to us and all our life experiences create our vocal story, by understanding and maximising our communication strengths. This can lead us to successful and inspiring communication outcomes in all areas of our lives. Wendy describes how she helps others, including politicians, fortune 100, CEOs, presenters on network television, podcasters, and film actors discover and empower their authentic voices. We also have a little fun with my voice as Wendy breaks down the five key elements of voice that come together to create our personal voice brand. Without further ado, let’s go to today’s episode.
Dr Marisa Lee Naismith 02:43
So I see that you have your glass of wine there, and it’s fine, because we’re going to get to a fun part of this interview. Now I have a coffee, and you have your Wine.
Dr Wendy LeBorgne 02:55
I mean, I have a big glass of water to!
Dr Marisa Lee Naismith 02:58
I have a bottle of water. So we’ve let everyone see what we’re up to. I’d really like to talk about your TED Talk. Because when I was looking into your background and doing a little bit of stalking on Wendy LeBorgne, I came across your TED talk, and I went ahead and watched it. I loved it, what you had to say was really interesting. And I just thought it was it was fantastic. So the topic of the TED talk was vocal branding beyond words, how your voice shapes your communication image. So I would love to know, and I’m sure our listeners would have heard this come about how did you become a TED talker?
Dr Wendy LeBorgne 03:54
Um, it was a bucket list item. No, I, for me, it truly was and it was something that as I embark on this next phase of my career, where I take voice to the next level, or what I hope to take to the next level and and give back to people is empowering their voice so that they can be heard. And so taking the art and the science of voice is what I wanted to talk about. And so voice brand, you know, what people people talk about personal branding and all that. And what I think people for me, which seems so basic, I guess I’ll say yes, yes, what your voice is the single most important aspect of communication. From my perspective. You can put on all the makeup in the world, you can do your hair, you can have the best clothes, but if you open your mouth to speak and you can have the best speech written, but if you open your mouth to speak and it is not congruent with everything else, people will See through you in a moment. So finding and empowering that authentic voice. And from a science standpoint, what do we know what draws us to some voices? What makes us turn off some voices. And so I decided, I’m gonna apply to do a TED talk. And I applied and I was accepted. And those might have been the most 12 terrifying minutes of my life.
Dr Marisa Lee Naismith 05:27
I was to say, were you terrified?
Dr Wendy LeBorgne 05:31
So, you know, I’ve performed all over the world, and I am not I love getting up and talking in front of people. I love presenting and singing and all of those things. I will say the TED stage is a little lonely. It’s you in a spotlight, and you have no no, you know, I’m very used to talking. Yeah, there was, there was probably, I don’t know, maybe five or 600 people in the audience at the time. And then there’s there’s cameras, right? Because they’re filming this. And there’s a big, big clock, which counts down like 12, 11. Like you have time. And so there’s that staring at you, and you don’t have any notes. So the challenge for me, and when I and I’ve worked with TED speakers since then, like coaching them on their presentations and their voice how cool you know, I think it is, and it’s been a joy, that you need to sound like it’s the first time you’ve spoken those words, right? It needs to sound conversational, but it’s completely completely rehearsed. Because you know, you have to get from point A to point B, in 12 minutes, that whole arc. So that was challenging. But for me, I knew what those five elements of voice brand were. And that’s what I wanted to talk about. So yeah, it’s, it’s been pretty amazing. I, I haven’t, I don’t go back and watch it. But I know that it’s had some good traction.
Dr Marisa Lee Naismith 07:05
So how is the voice the single most unique thing about us? What is it about the voice in rather than, say facial expressions? Or body language? Or the words themselves? Why is it the voice? Do you feel?
Dr Wendy LeBorgne 07:25
Well we see this also across species, it’s not just, it’s not it’s not unique to humans, right? Any of us, you and I even go back to a mother and babies cry. You can hear five babies cry if you’re a mom. None of those babies cries bother you except your own. And you can you identify with a cry, right? So yeah, the initial sound of voice, you know, if an animal is in pain, yet by hearing it cry, yeah, you know what I mean? Sometimes you could tell when animals are mating by the fact you right? So it is voice that we hear it is its sound that we hear, right? And so as humans. The there also then the neurobiology of voice, the hardwiring from the brain, the emotional centre of the brain to the voice, the laryngeal muscles, impact tightness. So if all of us, most of us, at least have had the experience, where you get angry, or you get upset, and you are trying really hard, like you, you have to say something hard, or you’re having a fight with your spouse, whatever it might be. And that you get that burning knot in your throat, and there’s your voice, people can tell you’re going to cry before you ever cry, even though you’re trying your darndest not to because it’s hardwired. So there’s this emotional connection. So this is immediate empathy. And we have these mirror neurons in our brain where they like to mirror what we see what we hear. So if I smile, oftentimes you’ll smile right back, right.
Dr Marisa Lee Naismith 09:06
I just did!
Dr Wendy LeBorgne 09:13
So when when we hear if we hear a happy voice, we heard a sad voice. Even if we don’t sound that way back. We actually empathise with what we’re hearing. Yes. Um, and we hear this in music too, right? Like, loud, loud, makes us feel one way. Soft. makes us feel high pitches, low pitches, fast rhythms, slow rhythms. So for me, as a musician, as as somebody who, who has spent my whole life immersed in music, it is the musicality. We know. We all have our own aesthetics, right? Yes. And we You and I were talking about this. Yeah. It’s kind of our Pre interview it’s like, yes, you know, I love and Australian accents, I think it’s, you know, I wish I had that and, and there are there are vocal turn ons of what we are we tune into, and things that are really detractors. And so when you develop your voice brand, when you think about your voice brand, those things play into it. Also, I think what’s uniquely human is that all of the experience of our lives fold into our vocal story, how tall we are, how short we are. That your tongue, your tongue takes I mean, all of those things, create your authentic vocal story. Wow, what an even though I always ask clients that I’m working with, who do they like listening to? Who are their kind of vocal role models from speaking or singing standpoint? I don’t like people to imitate voices. Because that is not uniquely authentic to them. Yeah, right. Yes. So it’s about you being the best voice you can be. And we can all be better at what we do. Because this is a system like anything else. Yeah, it also takes practice to get to that point. I think great speakers don’t they’re not just born great speakers. They, we learn more by our failures and our successes, oftentimes, absolutely. Yes. And it’s hard to get up and speak and use your voice.
Dr Marisa Lee Naismith 11:36
Yes, I’m hearing you, girlfriend. All of those things, right? Yeah, yeah. Now, there were five key elements that you spoke about in your TED Talk. And they’re really interesting. Would you be able to break those down for us and give us examples of how they influence or don’t influence or the perceptions around some of those things?
Dr Wendy LeBorgne 12:03
Sure. So they are quality? And so I’ll I’ll do those individually, because it’s probably Yeah, so quality quality is what I like to think of is the hoarseness or the clarity of the voice that actually comes from the vocal fold level. So, you know, we talked about a pathologic voice versus a healthy voice or not, you know, a normal voice. We’re drawn to interesting. We talked about this earlier, too. Yeah. Yeah. So, so many very famous voices have just a little bit of coarseness or a little bit of an edge to them or something that’s unique about them. Think about the voices. You love to listen to. Right? Yeah. Male or female?
Dr Marisa Lee Naismith 12:47
Yes. Yes.
Dr Wendy LeBorgne 12:48
So it’s, it’s the inherent quality. And sometimes that can’t be changed. From you know, I don’t necessarily want to take a clear voice and make it hoarse. Let’s just say, similar. Similarly, I don’t always want to take a hoarse voice and make it clear because sometimes it gets people jobs, because they have an interest in quality. From an physiologic standpoint, hoarseness, especially in women and men and not just one, but think about it from a minimum. How do people get hoarse voices usually? Are they over? You know, are you are you a girl? Are you a good girl? Are you a bad girl?
Dr Marisa Lee Naismith 13:37
Oh, oh, Well, I don’t know sometimes good girls can think and talk like this too.
Dr Wendy LeBorgne 13:48
But that’s, but that’s a pitch. That’s pitch. Right? Like, if you’re talking horse. Yeah, we sometimes think like smoking, drinking, partying, oh, they’re high on people. Right? Right. And it’s an unconscious thing sometimes.
Dr Marisa Lee Naismith 14:06
So the people that make the phone calls,
Dr Wendy LeBorgne 14:09
They are sometimes they are, you know, we know biologically that women when they are when they’re ovulating, they oftentimes have a change in voice quality. And men don’t necessarily recognise that but as species like they do like it, it has to do with how procreation, you know, like how it happened, because you get a little edoema on your vocal folds, you sound a little huskier when that happens as well literally happening at the level of your vocal cords. So anyway, that’s a little bit of the quality, show intense intensity of voice loud and soft, right. So intensity is something we can measure in decibels. loudness is the perceptual correlate of intensity. So and then Based a lot on our biases, right? So I come from a large Italian family. And we talk loud over people all the time. When I moved to the middle of the country, people are quieter. And so I that loudness gets seen oftentimes as aggressive, right? Because of biases.
Dr Marisa Lee Naismith 15:21
Yes. or people think that you’re really outgoing. And out there, that’s what I get, because I come from the Italian family background too. And yet people think, Wow, she’s really full on.
Dr Wendy LeBorgne 15:38
Absolutely. And then you go the opposite direction. And if people talk really softly, like this all the time, then we get the impression that they don’t know what they’re talking about. They’re not confident, but they might just be quiet people. Sure. But that’s the perception. So these things all together, and I parse them out into five components. But it’s really the interplay between the five that we get the that voice brand. So it’s it’s quality partnered with intensity, partnered with, let’s take rate of speech next. That’s how fast or how slow you talk. And people are often told, well, slow down, you’re talking too fast. But if all of a sudden, I slow down my rate of speech with you, it starts to feel condescending, right, that I am talking down to you.
Dr Marisa Lee Naismith 16:37
Yes, it does. And it also sounds like it’s very boring to listen to as well. You think this person lacks energy? Or generally?
Dr Wendy LeBorgne 16:50
Yes. So yeah, we can absolutely get that. And when we combine that with lack of frequency variability, I need you to get this done today. Like that’s very slow. It’s also pretty monotone. There’s a frequency and we’ll jump to in a second.
Dr Marisa Lee Naismith 17:10
Yeah. And you know, what my response would be if someone asked me to do that, in that way, I would say you have no hope.
Dr Wendy LeBorgne 17:24
And conversely, if somebody talks really fast all the time like this, it makes them sound like again, they’re not. They’re almost over excited. It’s the intensity is really, a girl can be aggressive. So if you partner the fast speech with loud, I need you to get this done today. Like, it’s like, oh, my God, like, okay, whoa, get back, right? Like the house is on fire. Those are the, those are the exact same words, if a one’s fast one, so some we think about, again, voice brand, if I talk slowly, but I batch it up here. I need you to get this done today. Like that’s a very different feel than changing it all up. So it’s, it’s a variability. For rate. It’s the fast and the slow combined. Yes, that makes an interesting speaker, right? Yes. Yes, I need you to get this done today. So it’s slow. And then fast, right? That is so cool. So we combine these things, but it’s just like music. It’s just like music, right? If I go with the rhythm, that’s not exciting. If I’m doing this, it makes it feel a little bit more energised. But what’s exciting to our ears, yeah, is this. It’s that variability and rate and roll that we that’s interesting. Absolutely. The fourth thing is frequency, which is the overall overarching pitch of your voice. I separate this out from intonation, because I think of intonation is the melodic line, that’s the fifth element. But pitch is generally how you’re generally low. So if I’m talking to you up here, like this, depending on where you are in the world, and in the country, that’s gonna feel very different than if I talk to you down here like this. And, you know, it’s simply changing laurendeau height, it’s changing my pitch, but your perception of me?
Dr Marisa Lee Naismith 19:26
Yes, absolutely. And can I just butt in for for a second, because what you shared on the TED Talk, was the fact that after the 1960s, women’s overall pitch lowered, as the women’s rights movement started to amp up, and women’s started to fight for their rights. They didn’t want to feel as vulnerable and so the pitch lowered for women.
Dr Wendy LeBorgne 19:59
I think you’re was partly that, and also for the first time and again, I’m not a sociology professor of any stretch. But when you look at this and we look at what is happening in the culture for the first time, women were coming to the table and sitting with men, we know that men who have lower pitched voices. Make make Well, here’s the thing. They make more money they father more children, they hold positions of higher leadership.
Dr Marisa Lee Naismith 20:30
I need to ask one question. If they father more children with the look, the lower the pitch, I want to know how many children Barry White has?
Dr Wendy LeBorgne 20:40
I don’t know!
Dr Marisa Lee Naismith 20:42
It must be a lot.
Dr Wendy LeBorgne 20:46
Yeah. But you know, they, evolutionary wise, they, they, they made it more frequently. So women came to the table, and we’re like, they consciously or unconsciously recognise this. But if you’re talking up here like this, it wasn’t being perceived as being taken seriously. And so unconsciously, it probably drifted. In general, at least in the United States, in the southern part, southern part of the country. women’s voices are still like, well bless your heart like, Oh, yeah, a bit higher. Yes. A northern. Yes. Yes. You’re so righteous. Fascinating.
Dr Marisa Lee Naismith 21:22
That is so fascinating. And yeah, that that speaks for itself there. But if if I think to the people that inspire me in terms of women that I listened to, you can’t go past Oprah. And and also Brene Brown, their pin bit their pitches is quite low.
Dr Wendy LeBorgne 21:47
Right? Absolutely. Absolutely. Yes, absolutely. But what I will tell you, is that they also have what I would consider vocal variability. Right. So that goes to intonation. So depending on what you want, if it is, if it is huge emphasis, we might drop the pitch. Yeah, I need you to get this done. today. Right. So then I hopped back up, so I temper that with a higher pitch, right? Yes, um, but you know, that I’m serious. Because, or it could go the opposite. I need you to get this done today. Like, it has a very different feeling, right? And so, you know, if we just talk pitch, so these are women that, you know, you talked about two women, Bernie brown and Oprah, who have this amazing command of their voices, they, um, they do and whether it’s conscious or unconscious, I would, you know, obviously, Bernie Browns work is all around vulnerability. And, and so we see that I see that when I listened to her when I listened to her work. I do not know her personally, I’ll know someday. But but but what we hear when she talks about vulnerability, we hear vulnerability in her voice, we do write that we hear authenticity, and what she’s saying, I don’t ever feel when I’ve listened to her on her podcasts or her books. I don’t ever feel that the voice is affected. Same thing with Oprah right? And so, but Oprah also has some acting training and, you know, she, we see her, you know, you watch her and like, the colour, probably we see this voice. She She is, I would suspect has some different voice training that maybe somebody like Bernie Brown, I don’t know, but I would suspect. I but I do think going back to the vocal authenticity. We just can’t copy somebody else and you can’t go, okay. I want to emphasise that word. Like it sounds completely ridiculous, right? Like, you’ve got to find what that authentic voice to you is. Yes. And I believe you, you know, your voice is because it is so tied to emotion. Mm hmm. hugely, hugely vulnerable. And is not that men don’t have vulnerability. It’s different. And certainly in this year of COVID, we’ve seen empathy all over the place. Yes, we do. But when when women get excited about a topic at work, or their kids, whatever it might be, their voice often gives them away. Because how do you become passionate and how do you become passionate about something and not start to get a little sometimes clever or women can’t always maintain that stability, some that we hear it with men too. But women tend to be seen as more vocally vulnerable sometimes. And how do you temper? You know, one of the things that I work on with my clients, I have a lot of women executives and women clients that want to empower their voices. Yeah. How do you convey passion without being overly emotional? And how? Because you, you know, a true to self. Number one, you got to know why, and how, and what you’re saying, Be, you need to practice it, but not to the point that it is void of emotion. Yeah, but there are, there are things that we can control, we can control breath, we can control heart rates, to a certain degree. So we know those things are going to amp up or whatever, when we’re put in high pressure situations. So anyway, but that’s slightly off topic of what we were talking about. But no, it is the interesting, it’s, it’s the authenticity that we have to find that I that I work to find with individuals and clients, whether they’re singers or speakers, or CEOs, or you know, pastors pastors are huge. Your goal is to connect with your congregation, right? And it’s not just the words, but where do you inflect? What words are most important? How do you modify that? Yes,
Dr Marisa Lee Naismith 26:33
It is a fine line. Like to be perfectly honest, when it comes to this podcast, for example, and I do my solo round episodes. Like I listen back, because I like to do my first initial edit myself before it goes on to my assistant. And I die. Sometimes I listen to my voice. And I think Do I really sound like this? I mean, we all don’t like our own voices. And then we do have those biases. Because the people that I listened to were generally Americans, a lot of the the Americans, the ones that the amazing thought leaders that are out there that I love listening to. And I think, Well, you know, I just want to sound like those. I sound silly with an Australian accent. And yet you shared with me that you’d love the Australian accent and the British accent because we sound more intelligent. And yet, as an Australian, I feel sometimes I sound ridiculous. So it makes it really hard to find that authentic self, when you are judging yourself to put a product out there. So how do we how do I measure that? What would be your advice to me? If you’re listening to my voice? What would you advise me to do?
Dr Wendy LeBorgne 27:59
So first of all, we’re always our own worst critics. Right.
Dr Marisa Lee Naismith 28:03
Yes.
Dr Wendy LeBorgne 28:04
One of the exercises that I take my clients through is some voice vulnerability, right? How many of us also like to stand naked in front of the mirror? We are really good at pointing out all the flaws, right? Yeah. So listening back to yourself is like standing naked in front of the mirror, but from a voice perspective. And so you cue into all of those things that you that you hate about your voice, we are so self critical. Instead, what I like to do is help people get a 360 degree view of their voice. So I say to you play your voice for five people that don’t know you. And I want them to rate your voice. And then you write your voice on that same segment. Right. So when we, when I work with clients, that’s what we do, right? I have external people. And the things that my clients here are generally not at all, you know, you can we have, you know, ratings, is this person intelligent or dumb, right? They just have a slider skill and you and you would raise your voice. Now I’m just making this up. But you might say, you might slide towards like, I don’t feel like I sound intelligence. And everybody else is like at 75, and you’re at 25. And so why are you perceiving yourself that way? When nobody else does? Yes. So those types of things, because I think it’s important to be self aware, but not self, not overly self critical. Because there are some inherent things that we can’t change. But some of those things that people that are unique to you are the things that you should enhance. Yeah, because yes, that’s what continues to make you unique. Yes, we can’t, we can’t control other people’s biases, right, like minds in American bias. Yours is an Australian bias. Yeah, you know, so that’s where I go. Okay. What do you like about your voice? What have people told you from a positive standpoint about your voice? That I have a lot of energy when I speak? Mm hmm. I sound passionate when I speak. Okay. That I speak well, all right, whatever we take, right. So if I were to analyse that, you know that you’re energetic when you speak, you have a moderate to fast rate of speech, you can slow down if you need to. And if I slowed that conversation down, we can do that. You You mirror. Yeah, right. So yeah. So but the energy comes from rate of speech, right? The emotional connection, I think, if just because I know you a little bit and know some of your musical background, you’ve got great intonation patterns, right? So people, people connect with that emotionally. Because when you get excited, your voice goes up a little bit. And if you want to talk about Sirius, it goes down. So that’s inherent to you probably because of your musicality
Dr Marisa Lee Naismith 31:30
The italian culture, would you say?
Dr Wendy LeBorgne 31:35
Say that one more time?
Dr Marisa Lee Naismith 31:36
The Italian culture as well?
Dr Wendy LeBorgne 31:40
Yeah, absolutely. And, and then the third thing, you Oh, that you You didn’t say articulate. But I will say that you are, we don’t hear. There’s not mumbling in what you say. There’s not a lot of ifs, ands or buts. Haha. So people perceive that as being coherence, easy to understand, versus all of a sudden somebody signing on here like this, you really can’t really understand what the saying is. Right? And so we don’t hear that. And yet, so if so if those are the three things that work really well for you, let’s work on enhancing those to the next level, right? As opposed to going, I hate the pitch of my voice, or I listen to myself and I sound Uber nasal, whatever it is that you are critical of. So if I were to say to you, what are you most critical of in your voice? When you listen to it? What do you not like about your own voice?
Dr Marisa Lee Naismith 32:40
Well, maybe the pitch. Sometimes I don’t like the pitch.
Dr Wendy LeBorgne 32:46
Do you think it’s too high or too low?
Dr Marisa Lee Naismith 32:48
Well, sometimes I think it’s too high. And then sometimes I think it’s too low. And it’s trying to find that place where you think, okay, sitting there, I don’t sound unintelligent. And then sitting down here, I don’t sound too authoritarian or boring, either. It’s trying to find that place. And it’s when I don’t worry about it. That’s when it’s fine. Mm hmm. Yeah. And the other thing is, when I say words, I have I’ve found since recording myself a lot, is, if I have words that have a lot of L’s, or a lot of N’s, I found that I get I find I get stuck on those words. So I think there must be like, a little bit of something going on somewhere that whether it’s the tongue or the something’s going on, where I’m getting stuck.
Dr Wendy LeBorgne 33:48
And so those L’s and the N’s are something that you can absolutely work on, you know, we if we work together, I would load sentences with ns, ns and else, no one knew Norman’s nickname, like we…
Dr Marisa Lee Naismith 34:02
I’m stuck already.
Dr Wendy LeBorgne 34:04
Yeah, that’s something from an articulatory standpoint that we go, okay. This is now going to the vocal branding gym, right? We say okay, these are the things you do really well. Let’s maximise those with some exercises. These are the things where you struggle, let’s work on decreasing the detractors. I don’t think that we ever eliminate our detractors. But you know, Spanx were made for a reason. It’s to decrease the detractors, right. I need a speck on my voice. Right now. Right. I know that there are things that we can do to minimise our detractors in what we do. Yeah. So but we want to eliminate them. And that’s, again, that is part of our vocal story, right? That is part of who we are. And that is okay.
Dr Marisa Lee Naismith 35:01
And how far can we go by trying to change and without controlling, losing our authenticity, and also where we could run into voice pathologies, because we get so caught up and uptight about all these things.
Dr Wendy LeBorgne 35:23
And that’s what I really, really, really try to shy away from because we went is you you said this already, you’ve already answered your own question when your voice is the best is when you’re not thinking about it. Yes. Right. And so when I work with any speaker, it is about, your voices is your best when you’re talking to your best friend, when you’re having a conversation about, Oh, my gosh, did you hear what happened today? You are engaged, you’re passionate about the topic. It is authentic to you as the challenge comes when the stakes are high, right? You need to get venture capital from somebody, you need something from someone else. And so your voice becomes the medium for you to do that. And so becomes inauthentic because we have all of these other layers. So not that you can talk to your venture capital firms like you talk to your best friend, but you want to have some, but you want to have some of that in there. Yes. Because absolutely what we want to do business with people. We don’t want to do we do right, so yeah, he’s got to be approachable. Yes, yes. So that’s really important.
Dr Marisa Lee Naismith 36:36
Yes.
Dr Wendy LeBorgne 36:37
So when people get all tied up in their voice, it is terrible. So it is about the conversation. There is no perfect voice, there is no right voice. It is not one size fits all. And I kind of say this laughingly. But if you have a St. Bernard, and he wants to look like a greyhound, you can put the St Bernard on the diet all you want, but he’s only ever going to look like a skinny St. Bernard, he’s never gonna look like a greyhound. That’s so he can be the best beat St. Bernard, he could be right. And so when we talk about vocal authenticity, and talk about our voice brand, those elements remain true. Regardless of the brand, the voice brand. It becomes about maximising the great things. Yeah, minimising your detractors, and being authentic to who you are. And you have, in order to do that, you have to be vulnerable. Because you have to try things with your voice. We’ve all had the experience when we know things vocally go really badly. I’m coming out of a meeting. Yeah, you’re like, Oh, my God, my voice just totally cracked. That did not go the way that I planned. My job then becomes ago, okay, why did that not work for you? what went well, what went wrong? How do we fix that for next time? You can’t. And it’s like performance anxiety for a singer. Once that happens, you there is a process to get back out on stage again. Because we know that performance anxiety exists. And so to work through that you actually there’s a process to work through it. And similarly, when a when a meeting goes badly when a speech goes badly, when a conversation goes badly. We need to learn from the experience not be panicked, that it’s going to happen again.
Dr Marisa Lee Naismith 38:37
Yes, my biggest takeaway from what you’ve said, is about being true to yourself, in all situations, isn’t it like being your authentic self, and that’s something that I’ve worked really hard at, for a number of years now. And, and having that courage to turn up as the person that I truly am in any situation. And I know sometimes we’ll go into a meeting my husband and I have to go to see a bank manager or accountant or a legal person. And he can’t believe some of the things that I say. I say yet, but you know what? I’m being true to me. And this is how I I feel that I need to say them. And I think that’s something that we as we mature and it’s through life experiences. Isn’t that something that we do start to find our authentic voice and our uniqueness by love a cup and be true to yourself every day? And in every situation that you’re in?
Dr Wendy LeBorgne 39:48
Yeah, so two things that I think about that as we as we’re sort of thinking about wrapping our conversation up you is one your authentic self has changed. Oh, Time, because you’ve had more life experiences, yes. So that we our voices change over time reflective of that. So if you’re trying to embody what you were at 20 vocally, I want to sound vocally youthful. That’s not gonna fly at 40. Right? So we have to think about that. Um, the other thing is that people, most people inherently know this, or we learn this. But some people don’t know this, there are communication rules. So, okay, you, you need to know when you should use language in this way, or what are the rules of communication in a social situation, versus in a boardroom? versus in the bedroom? Like, those are all different communication rules that are fairly well established in the literature, like, not new, and we generally learn them from babies moving forward. But if you don’t know the rules of the game you’re playing. It’s very hard to win at the game, right? It’s not about winning or losing.
Dr Marisa Lee Naismith 41:10
but it is a game. It can be a game, and there are situations yeah.
Dr Wendy LeBorgne 41:17
Oh, yeah, absolutely. So we think about that. So it is a lot of multifactorial things going into how we use our voice to communicate. Yeah. And the factors that go into it.
Dr Marisa Lee Naismith 41:29
No, that was that was so interesting. But in wrapping up the TED Talk, can you do the sexy voice for us?
Dr Wendy LeBorgne 41:43
Sure, i might need to think, you know, I think it was “I need you to get this done today” I think that’s what I said. So, sexy voice was. So you lower your pitch, you get slightly so so. So the frequency is lower? Yeah, the the talk is the the speed the rate is slower. It is highly intimated or have high inflection. From a quality standpoint, it’s not totally clear, it’s slightly breathy. And the intensity, the loudness is usually soft. So it’s becomes I need you to get this done today. Right. So it’s low pitch slightly breathy, highly intimated. Right. Versus I need you to get this done today. That feels totally different. Right? same word. Yeah. same person.
Dr Marisa Lee Naismith 42:37
Well, that was “I need to get this done today”. Is that right?
Dr Wendy LeBorgne 42:44
Yeah. Cool. That’s it.
Dr Marisa Lee Naismith 42:45
I’m getting close.
Dr Wendy LeBorgne 42:47
You’re getting close?
Dr Marisa Lee Naismith 42:48
I think if I said that to my husband, I don’t know. He probably run them. He thinks an alien has stolen me and replace me with somebody. Okay, so Wendy, what do you up to moving into the future?
Dr Wendy LeBorgne 43:07
Oh, gosh, I’m so private consulting, you know, with clients, corporations. So that’s the corporate side of what I do. I also am doing the vocal athlete side where I am working on getting on my artists and keeping them healthy and well on stage for the longevity of their careers. And then being a mom and being your wife, I am working on a another book and some some workshop series that people can work on their voice brand. So I’m working on all of those things a little bit at a time. incred. So feel free, feel free to reach out to me if this is something that interests you. Absolutely find me. Well,
Dr Marisa Lee Naismith 43:53
we’re going to share all this information in the show notes. You, I will receive all the links from you that people can go to if they wish to find you or learn more about your work or listen to your TED Talk. Because we need to get that up to a million views. So everybody hates to go and watch the TED talk and ask five of their friends to go and listen to it as well. So we need you.
Dr Wendy LeBorgne 44:23
Thank you thank that
Dr Marisa Lee Naismith 44:24
up to a million views. So what happens when we get to that? Because we’re about 400,000 at the moment.
Dr Wendy LeBorgne 44:31

Dr Wendy LeBorgne 45:13
Oh my gosh, I think just how they work together. Both they as as parents and also running a business together. I think that takes a lot. The older I’ve gotten, the more I respect that yes, I’m their belief in me to be my own person, even when I know I tested them. limits and what I did. Yeah. And just constant I think, just constant love, like love is love is love is love. So yeah, beautiful.
Dr Marisa Lee Naismith 45:42

Liminal Spaces began as a series of conversations between the founders. What started as an ongoing exchange of experiences, ideas, visions and hopes for the electronic music scene eventually evolved to the wish of co-creating a new space for electronics music. With deep roots in the night scene of Copenhagen and Tokyo, the founders finally found a home in Pumpehuset for the concept, which will act as the canvas for a series of events, focusing on high quality electronic music, lights and visuals.

BOULDER, CO. (August 21, 2019) – Camber Outdoors honors the life and legacy of its co-founder, Ann Amelia Krcik, through the newly named Ann Krcik Professional Mentoring Program. Women participating in this initiative develop workplace, community and career connections that shape the future of the outdoors as demonstrated by the “Speed Mentoring” networking session during this year’s Outdoor Retailer Summer Market.
The Ann Krcik Professional Mentoring Program is a cross-company, cross-industry mentoring initiative in the active-outdoor industries that facilitates one-on-one learning and leadership development between director/manager-level and executive-level women.
“The relationships developed between our mentors and mentees are extremely valuable,” explains Sasha McGhee, Program Manager for Camber Outdoors. “Research shows that professional mentor relationships improve employee inclusion, engagement, retention and overall career outcomes and ultimately results in more diversified leadership teams. Ann believed in the power of mentoring and how it elevates women in their careers. I’m so glad her legacy lives on through the success of the program. Since 2014, 150 women have participated as mentees in theis program. And in a typical year, 25-35% received promotions within a year of completing the program. More than 33% are now at Director level and above.”
Mentorship was at the core Ann’s contribution to so many men and women in the industry, a topic she continuously championed. Starting in the customer service department of The North Face in the 1980’s, Ann was herself mentored by then-Director of Equipment Sally McCoy as she moved up to become Director of Marketing Operations. After more than six years at The North Face, Ann and her friend Carolyn Cooke launched the Outdoor Industries Women’s Coalition (OIWC), now known as Camber Outdoors. Close to 23 years later, Camber continues to help achieve equality for all women in the outdoors workplace through innovative and thought-leading programming and initiatives, including an industry-wide job board, community events, industry keynotes, leadership webinars, and mentoring.
Throughout her career, Ann asked, “Who is missing from the leadership table? Whose voice would help us make better decisions?” She believed the broad inclusion of individuals and industry leaders drove smart and effective business decisions. Through her mentoring, she helped new and diverse voices to the heard.
“The learnings I took away from The Ann Krcik Professional Mentoring Program have had a tremendous impact on my career and personal growth,” said Morgan Makowski, Marketing Director at Hydrapak. !”

The bill, which seeks to set out a framework for the establishment of a medicinal cannabis industry in The Bahamas and the regulation of the handling of the plant, would give power to the Medicinal Cannabis Authority to approve persons or entities applying for a license.
The five types of licenses are: a cultivation license to allow growing, harvesting, drying, trimming, curing or packaging of cannabis; an import license to allow for the importation of cannabis seedlings and cuttings from any country in which it is lawful to do so for the purpose of cultivation; an export license to allow for the export of locally cultivated cannabis, cannabis materials, cannabis products or medicinal cannabis to a country to which it is lawful to export; a manufacturing license to allow for processing and manufacturing of cannabis materials, cannabis products, or medicinal cannabis; a research license to allow for the conduct of scientific research relating to the development of medicinal cannabis; and a transport license to allow for the transport of cannabis, cannabis materials, cannabis products or medicinal cannabis in The Bahamas.
Each license costs $10,000 and in the case of the transport license – which covers up to three vehicles – any additional vehicle would cost $1,500.
The licenses granted would be valid for a period of three years, according to section 31 of the bill.
That application process involves the completion of an application form, proof to the satisfaction of the authority of the eligibility of the applicant, a nonrefundable $1,000 application fee – $2,000 for two or more licenses applied for at the same time – and a police character certificate.
Applicants for licenses must also submit a survey plan of the land on which they are to be situated, along with any limited company or partnership legal documents.
The authority would determine whether to grant or refuse any license applied for and can refuse licenses if it deems the person applying is not a fit and proper person.
The determination of whether a person is fit and proper is based on the financial status or solvency of the person, the educational or other qualifications and experience of the person; the ability of that person to carry out a regulated activity competently, honestly and fairly; and the reputation and character of the person.
Other reasons an application would be refused include: if the granting of the license would be inconsistent with The Bahamas’ international obligations; the authority is not satisfied on reasonable grounds of the suitability of the location or the proposed security arrangements at the premises; in the case of an export license, the applicant does not already have a cultivation, manufacturing or research license; or the license fee has not been paid.
License holders would not be able to transfer their licenses to another person, according to the bill. Applicants may renew their licenses no later than one month before their expiration at a cost of $1,000. A variation of a license would cost $750.
Prime Minister Dr. Hubert Minnis announced in the House of Assembly on Wednesday that he had been presented the Medicinal Cannabis Bill, 2021 and would distribute it to Cabinet within the next week before it is tabled in Parliament.
In February, the prime minister announced that the government would decriminalize small amounts of marijuana and establish a medicinal marijuana industry. At the time he touted the legalization of medical marijuana as an opportunity for Bahamian entrepreneurs.
The Bahamas National Commission on Marijuana has estimated that it could be a thriving $50 million per year industry..

This is Tarantino’s best-ever opening and might even bode well for that Basterds prequel, if we thought he were actually serious about it.

We debated calling it Terrific Chocolate Fudge or Fantastic Chocolate Fudge, but landed on Extraordinary. Our base chocolate recipe is used in many of our other offerings. We don't make fudge in a pan in the fridge or using a mass-manufacturing machine like a lot of these other Etsy producers. We make it the old-fashioned way...the Mackinac Island way...using a giant copper kettle and marble slab.
You really can't go wrong with this fudge, and nobody will call you basic for getting something so classic. 1/2 pound of creamy fudge - dice it up for a unique platter at your next party. Eat some now, freeze some for later!

Leesa is a more recent entrant into the budget foam mattress business; however, Leesa also found itself a large and loyal market very quickly.
The rapid success of both companies is because both sell an excellent-quality foam mattress at a rock-bottom price.

Mattress Construction: Leesa vs Casper
Leesa
The Leesa Original LSA200.
LSA200 foam provides several advantages for the Leesa mattress, including:
- LSA200 foam offers the cooling and comfort of latex foam, but it is more durable.
- LSA200 foam provides a softer bounce than Casper, which is better for sleeping.
- LSA200 foam is breathable, which keeps the Leesa cool and moisture-free at night.
- LSA200
The open-cell foam (Casper calls it Airscape foam) in the Casper's top layer helps to keep the mattress cool and provides a nice bounce – a bit more than the Leesa, which makes the Casper more friendly for amorous couples 😉
A second zoned memory foam layer provides three zones of varying-density foam that supports your hips with a firmer foam to provide better support and gives your shoulders a softer foam so they sink a bit deeper. This makes the updated Casper a good choice for side sleepers.
The bottom layer is made of high-density foam, providing support to the top layers of the mattress.
All together, the three layers bring the mattress thickness to 11 inches, an inch taller than Leesa.
While not 100% natural like Leesa, the memory and foundational foams in the Casper are Certipur certified.
Comfort & Firmness: Leesa vs Casper Original Foam
Leesa's comfort level is medium-firm.
On a scale of increasing firmness from 1 to 10, the Leesa falls between a 6 and a 7, which is perfect for most people.
Casper Original Foam
The Casper comfort level rates a slightly firmer 7 out of 10.
Comparing the two, the Casper does feel slightly firmer, especially if you are on the light side.
Casper's use of zoned foam in their second support layer makes this the slightly better choice for side-sleepers.
Sleeping Experience: Leesa vs Casper Original
Leesa scores very well in all of these areas.
Their patented LSA200 foam provides excellent cooling power, while Leesa's middle memory foam layer works to keep the sleeper comfortable and adequately supported.
Where the Leesa mattress really shines, however, is in body contouring (also called compression support). Leesa's memory foam layer seems overall Original type of foam used on top.
Where the Casper mattress excels, however, is in temperature control. The open-cell latex used in the top layer is exceptional in dissipating heat away from the mattress.
Warranty and Returns: Leesa vs Casper
Both mattresses are about the same on warranty and return policies. Buying from either Leesa (or Casper) is a no-risk experience.
Leesa Original Original vs Casper offers an in-home setup service that costs $150 on top of the cost of the mattress.
Casper
Casper ships mattresses via UPS Ground in the United States and via UPS Air in Canada. Shipping is free but only to contiguous states. Hawaii and Alaska customers pay for shipping. provides in-home setup services for a small fee (currently not available because of COVID-19).
Leesa Is The Right Mattress For You If:
I recommend buying the Leesa over the Casper, if any of the following apply to you:
• You share your bed with a fidgety partner. Leesa is better at inhibiting motion transfer than Casper.
In my overall rating, I give the Leesa mattress a very high rating of 4.6 out of 5.0.
Casper Is The Right Mattress For You If:
I recommend getting the Casper instead of the Leesa if either of the following describe you:
• You prefer a bouncier mattress. The top layer gives Casper a better bounce that makes it a great choice for sex.
I give the Casper a slightly lower 4.5 rating overall, mainly for the materials used in their construction and the firmer/bouncier feel, which I don't appreciate.

Can I get split queen mattresses in either brand ? I have an adjustable split queen mechanism and frame and want to adjust each side independently. Each would be 30×60 inches.
Thank you.
Cheryl Faxon
No, sorry – neither mattress offers a split configuration.
It seems you recommend the Leesa for side sleepers when discussing the individual mattresses, but at the end recommend the casper for side sleepers?
Thanks for catching this. I’ve adjusted our review to make things clearer.
To be honest both mattresses are great for side-sleepers – but for different reasons.
Leesa is softer and therefore contours and holds your body better.
Casper uses zoned-foam in its support layer, which and supports a side-sleeper’s profile quite nicely.
The main difference between these 2 mattresses (for a side sleeper) is the general feel: Leesa is softer and more memory-foam like. Casper is firmer and more supportive.
Hi! Is the Leesa discount lower now? When i click your link the total price with discount is $505 for a twin.
Thanks for pointing this out. Yes, Leesa recently updated their discount pricing scheme.
The new Sleepdelivered offer is 15% off – we’ve updated the prices above to reflect this.
FWIW, our 15% discount is 50% better than their current advertised discount.
My husband and I have very different likes and needs for mattresses. I am a back sleeper and require firm with Excellent wear for sag. I also require cool materials because I become warm at different times of the night. My husband likes a softer mattress and he is a side sleeper. He is tall and turns alot at night so I want the least amount of motion transfer. Can we get different twin beds and use the same frame? I see above you cannot use the split configuration but is that only for adjustable bed frames?
Yes, of course – you can buy two Twin XL mattress and use them in place of a king. Just make sure your bedframe has a spine that runs down the middle of your frame from head to toe, so it will support the inner edges of your two mattresses.
(A standard Twin bed is 39″ wide and 75″ long and a standard King bed is 76 inches wide and 80 inches long. Therefore two Twin beds are not equal to a standard king bed. However, two Twin XL are equal to a King.).

One of my favorite villains is The Red Queen from Tim Burton’s Alice in Wonderland and so I decided to make some cupcakes inspired by her fondness for hearts. I’ve made two different cupcakes both perfectly suitable for Valentine’s Day or any other day of the year. 😉
Red Velvet Cupcakes
Ingredients:
- 1 Duncan Hines (or any brand) Red Velvet Cake Mix
- 3 eggs
- Oil
- Water
- Gold Foil (or heart-themed) cupcake liners
Directions: Make cupcakes according to package directions. Pour into cupcake pan lined with gold foil or paper liners. Bake as directed. Let cool.
Cream Cheese Frosting:
Ingredients:
- 1 (8 oz) brick Cream Cheese, softened
- 1 stick Butter, softened
- 4 cups Powdered Sugar
- 1 teaspoon Vanilla
- 2-4 tablespoons Milk
Directions:
Place softened cream cheese, butter and vanilla in a large bowl and blend with an electric mixer until smooth. Slowly add in powdered sugar, one cup at a time, blending after each. After all of the powdered sugar has been added, thin out the frosting by adding the milk, one tablespoon at a time then mixing until the consistency you desire has been reached. Set aside.
Chocolate Hearts
Ingredients:
- 1/2 cup chocolate chips or Wilton Cocoa Melts
- 1 teaspoon vegetable oil or shortening
Directions:
See Cupcake #2 below.
Assemble the Cupcakes
Cupcake #1:
Cut out a small heart shape from a piece of paper or card stock.
Place it in the center of your cooled cupcake. Lightly press it down so the paper sticks to the top.
Using a sifter or spoon, sprinkle powdered sugar over the entire surface of the cupcake.
Now carefully remove the heart-shaped paper from the center of the cupcake. You can use a toothpick to help pick up the corner.
Ta-da! Your cupcake is complete! Wasn’t that easy? Now let’s move on to the second cupcake. Cupcake #2: Fill a gallon-size freezer bag with cream cheese icing. Cut off the tip making a 1-inch wide opening at the corner of the bag (or use an icing bag). Squeeze the bag while making a circular motion to create the mound on top.
Next, place a piece of wax paper on top of a plate. Melt 1/2 cup of chocolate chips with 1 teaspoon oil or shortening in the microwave (in 30-second increments). Stir well. Place into a squeeze bottle or quart-size freezer bag and cut off the tip creating a narrow opening. Gently squeeze heart shapes onto the wax paper. Place the entire plate of chocolate hearts in the freezer until hardened.
When the chocolate hearts are set, gently peel them from the wax paper and insert into the center of the frosting mound on each cupcake.
Isn’t that cute? Now you have 2 options of cupcakes to make for Valentine’s Day! Or you can make these cupcakes for your next Mad Hatter Tea Party!! And even on your Un-Birthday!! (Which is tomorrow by the way.) Enjoy!
Happy Valentine’s Day!! “I need a pig here!”MCPS Covid-19 Information

The Lord was gracious,
right from the start.
When He made you, the woman,
to fill my heart.
He knew I couldn’t be,
out on my own.
But needed a godly woman,
to fill my earthly home.
I needed a help-mate,
to share the burden of life.
Encouragement and godly wisdom,
stored up within my wife.
Through the good times and the bad,
I haven’t always been there.
But it always was so difficult,
when it came time to share.
But through it all, I’ll have you know,
I wouldn’t change a thing.
If I was asked to do it all over,
I’d still offer you my ring.
So take heart, my dear, and cherish this thought,
I’m not all that I need to be.
But always remember, I’ll never give up,
because God’s still working on me.In no particular order:

Following the promise in that blog post, I’ve adapted the same topology using Cisco CSR1000v images for routers and IOSv L2 images for switches. There isn’t much to say about this topology since mostly is matching the original INE’s one for routers (including the configuration files) and the major difference is the utilization of virtual switches.
Since we’re using virtual switches, the configuration files for switches are still different. I’ve adapted these ones to match the interface names of IOSv-L2:
Real Switches – vIOS-L2
Fa0/1 - Gi0/0 - SW1 only connection to bridge Fa0/19 - Gi0/2 Fa0/20 - Gi0/3 Fa0/21 - Gi1/0 Fa0/22 - Gi1/1 Fa0/23 - Gi1/2 Fa0/24 - Gi1/3
For convenience, the switches topology looks like this in EVE-NG:
For routers, the interfaces stays the same since we’re using CSR1000v images.
Here is how the network topology looks like. No surprise here, just added for convenience:
If you don’t have the CSR1000v image added to your installation of EVE-NG, please download it (Cisco.com is a good starting point) and add it following these How-to:
HowTo add Cisco Cloud Service Router (CSR1000V NG) Denali and Everest
or
HowTo add Cisco Cloud Service Router (CSR1000V) – for pre Denali or Everest images.
If you’re curious I’m using csr1000v-universalk9.03.12.03.S.154-2.S3-std image when testing for this lab.
Before sharing the download links, a word of advice.
It may be that CSR1000v images are more stable and support all features when compared with IOSv-L3, however this comes with a cost in term of resources. Each node has by default 3GB RAM assigned and I wouldn’t recommend trying to decrease it.
Once the nodes boot up, the actual used RAM will be less, but still you need more resources to use CSR1000v.
My recommendation for 10 routers using CSR1000v images would be at least 16GB RAM assigned to the EVE-NG virtual machine. The same if you’re using EVE-NG on a bare metal machine.
Last but not least, somebody asked me when I’m going to provide the same topology with 20 routers.
No need. You can extend the default topology with as many devices as you want. The modified configuration files for labs with 20 routers are already modified and present in the archive you download. Just add the missing R11 until R20 devices.
If you encounter errors that are critical, please let me know and I’ll try to correct them.

'Cynthia' was known for seducing her targets – even her British spymaster was infatuated. So was she the war's greatest unsung hero?
Infatuation, as Bond creator Ian Fleming knew so well, is the elixir of espionage. Mixing sex and spying himself on naval-intelligence duties during the war, Fleming visited Washington to hear about a femme fatale who was securing sensational secrets from Britain’s enemies in then neutral America. Yet he wanted more than just stories about the seductress spy. ‘His main objective,’ noted her handler, ‘was to meet her.’
Fleming never got to. Against all the rules, that handler – a married British intelligence officer who rose to the highest ranks, advising prime ministers over 40 years from the Second World War to the Falklands War – had already fallen for the charms of his own agent, who was code-named Cynthia. It would cost him the advancement of his career – he was told that he would never run MI5 or MI6 as a result. But he didn’t care, as his soon-to-be-published (anonymous) memoir makes clear. His own infatuation with Cynthia – real name Amy Elizabeth Thorpe – made this a price worth paying.
Cynthia was electric from the moment he met her. Known occasionally to eschew knickers, she allowed her skirt to ride up as she crossed her legs nervously in his office, auditioning for a role that would have her target the Axis diplomatic corps, winning first the trust then the adoration of men with top-secret information to betray.
Cynthia was 30 years old when they met, ‘restless and reckless’ with a marriage and a string of lovers already behind her. She had discovered that passion and secrets went naturally together, deploying charm to find and help a lost lover during the Spanish Civil War, and seducing Michał Łubieński, the chef de cabinet of the Polish Foreign Minister, in the run-up to the German invasion of 1939.
As a result it was she who, her handler notes, ‘was the first to confirm that the Poles finally had succeeded in deciphering some German Enigma traffic’, leading to a meeting in which they explained their methods to Britain’s famed cryptographer Dilly Knox.
It soon became clear she had many of the essential qualities of a spy. She was possessed of almost unthinking courage, volunteering to be dropped into occupied France. She reserved a particular venom for the Nazis: ‘I hate the Germans, their Stukas machine-gunning refugees in Poland…’ She also had what US spy Allen Dulles (who later became CIA director) described as ‘an absolute determination to succeed in her mission, plus a streak of ruthlessness… hallmark of most of the really successful men I know’. But, said her handler, ‘it seemed clear that what Cynthia loved above all was the glamour and sheer excitement of being a secret agent.’
And yet with her establishment upbringing she had seemed destined for a conventional existence.
Born in November 1910 to a distinguished member of the Marine Corps, George Thorpe, and Cora Wells, a socialite, she grew up on her father’s postings to Cuba and Hawaii before returning to the East Coast bourgeoisie. But by then the smart-set mould had been broken; Betty, as she was known, was the focus of the teenage attentions of boys her age but already seemed distant from them. Her fragmented, far-flung childhood matured her beyond her years, leaving her a self-confessed loner.
When she met Arthur Pack, a British diplomat twice her age, he seemed to offer an exotic escape from childish things. Yet soon she was pregnant, married and forced to give up her baby to foster parents, to avoid the scandal of having a child that was obviously conceived before marriage, a deadening sequence that killed any attraction. ‘My mistake,’ she said, ‘was being just 20 years old. I had graduated cum laude from college but, in reality, I knew nothing about anything.’
When Pack was posted to Warsaw, she caught the eye of an MI6 officer there, Colonel Jack Shelley, who reported that while her husband was ‘rather a dull dog’, she was anything but, particularly after Pack suffered a stroke and was invalided home to Britain. She stayed on and began an affair with a Polish cavalry officer in a forest cabin after a riding lesson, the seduction fuelled by champagne and caviar. He was killed in the German invasion. ‘End of story,’ she said.
By then, in any case, she had moved on to Łubieński. Shelley didn’t care, as long as she kept passing on to British intelligence what she learned on the pillow. But others in the embassy felt differently, and she was packed off to London to rejoin her husband.
Soon enough though, their split became final – while Pack was posted in Santiago, she headed back to the East Coast, where Shelley’s file on her eventually fell into the hands of the man who was to become her handler, and lover.
He remains anonymous, but the veracity of his and Cynthia’s espionage exploits is vouched for by former British ambassador to Washington Robin Renwick, who knew him personally. Together, Cynthia and her handler cooked up a series of covert capers that almost defy belief.
Their targets were the German, Italian and Vichy French embassies, all in Washington. Posing as a society journalist, she attended a blizzard of parties and diplomatic soirées, and before long had ensnared Admiral Alberto Lais, naval attaché and former head of naval intelligence in Italy.
Besotted with her, he was soon ‘talking of divorce and of settling down with her in the US after the war’. But if he ever wanted to stay in America, she suggested, he would need to show the authorities ‘he could really be counted on’. She asked for the Italian naval-code books. He refused. But he did reveal the identity of a cipher clerk at the embassy who then handed them over for a huge bribe.
The code books allowed Bletchley Park to check and verify its efforts and a telegram of congratulations for Cynthia arrived from Knox. A little later, in March 1941, thanks to Bletchley intercepts, an Italian fleet in the Mediterranean was hunted down by the Royal Navy and blown to smithereens at the Battle of Cape Matapan.
It was a triumph that resounded through intelligence circles. But Cynthia and her handler were to top it, this time targeting the Vichy French in Washington. Naked but for a string of pearls and a pair of heels, she distracted a security guard while a professional burglar purloined the Vichy naval codes from a safe (an episode described in an extract from the handler’s memoir, below). Once again, Knox, ‘for whom Cynthia by now had achieved legendary status’, sent congratulations.
In late 1942, the codes proved their immense worth during Allied landings in north Africa, allowing codebreakers to decipher messages sent to and from an admiral commanding Vichy forces in north Africa instantly, assuring victory and sparing the lives of many Allied soldiers.
In the end, however, the Vichy operation ensnared Cynthia herself. Her target, press attaché Charles Brousse, whom she convinced to turn against the regime, asked her to marry him, and she agreed. Together they moved to the Pyrenees after the war, where they lived in a castle with walls so thick ‘log fires had to be lit even in the summer’.
Still, Brousse knew better than to chain his wife to rural life, and occasionally she flitted to America and Paris, where she picked up the thread of her affair with her old spymaster. Even in ‘retirement’ she was able to introduce him to Count Alexandre de Marenches, who eventually became head of French foreign intelligence. Soon afterwards, she called her lover to say that she had been diagnosed with cancer and had not long to live. She died in December 1963, aged 53.
At her memorial service, in America, her handler slipped into the back row. Afterwards, however, he found himself standing before her bereaved husband. ‘She always told me how much she loved you,’ he told Brousse as the men shook hands. ‘She loved you too,’ the widower replied.

The Spy who charmed me... In an exclusive extract from his forthcoming memoir (being published posthumously), Cynthia’s spy handler recounts how the pair stole naval codes, which would later help the Allies land successfully in Vichy-controlled French north Africa
As I walked into the room, I encountered the faint scent of an expensive perfume. Cynthia stood up, smoothing down imaginary wrinkles in her impeccable skirt, to greet me with a handshake and a smile.
She was wearing a cream silk shirt and jacket with a skirt shorter than what passed for normal at the time, barely covering her knees and not covering them at all when she crossed her legs. Careful make-up, blonde-ish hair and wide-set eyes completed an extremely attractive picture.
She was very nervous. Did I mind if she smoked? Of course not. I leaned forward with a lighter as, with a slightly trembling hand, she placed a cigarette between her lips.
‘I think we might have something for you,’ I said.
‘That would be wonderful,’ was the reply. No longer nervous, she was glowing with excitement.
A few days later, at my request, she was back. I explained that a key task assigned to me was to target the German, Italian and Vichy French embassies by whatever means we could. I wanted her to help with this… ‘Leave it to me,’ was her confident reply.
[We received] instructions to do whatever we could to help get hold of the Vichy French naval codes, a demand that became more urgent after the United States entered the war, as thoughts started to be entertained of a possible landing by the Allies in Vichy-controlled north Africa.
Cynthia started at the top by asking, as a reporter, for a meeting with the French ambassador, who however, turned out to be the most unpleasant kind of Vichy supporter. But the meeting had been arranged by the press attaché, Charles Brousse. Before long, she was getting on famously with him. A minor nobleman on his third marriage, he regarded himself as an expert on food and wine and, by extension, women. Twenty years older than her, he had won the Croix de Guerre as a pilot, flying over the German trenches in the First World War.
The problem was that Charles could tell her all about gossip in the embassy but had little access to any sensitive information, let alone the codes.
By this time, Charles was thoroughly disillusioned with Vichy… [He] was quite wealthy in property in France but had little in his US bank account. Cynthia, who by now had told him that she worked for US Intelligence, offered him a monthly subsidy.
She asked Charles directly for his help in acquiring the Vichy French naval ciphers. His objections were purely practical. They were so well protected that he considered it impossible. But he provided Cynthia with details of the layout of the embassy.
We had ruled out the idea of a burglary as too difficult as the embassy at night was patrolled by a security officer. But Cynthia said that if the operation had a really competent burglar on their books, she would like to discuss the problem with him.
Cynthia was introduced to an American burglar who claimed to be at the top of his profession. He warned, however, that unravelling the combination to a well-protected safe required patience. It could take hours; and he would need to crack the combination to the door to the cipher room as well as that to the safe in which the books were held. More time would then be required to photograph them. How was this to be achieved when the embassy was constantly patrolled?
It was Cynthia who came up with a solution. Her plan was for Charles to tell [the guard] that he was having an affair with her. This had to be conducted very discreetly, as he was still married. He proposed to bring his lady friend, plus champagne and a light meal, into the embassy after hours. They would have supper in the embassy’s waiting room [close to the corridor leading to the cipher room], which conveniently had a large divan. If the security guard would cooperate, he would be well rewarded by Charles.
Charles agreed to try this, taking Cynthia to the embassy well after hours, having forewarned the guard. The guard, keen on the promised reward, stayed away from the entrance area and waiting room. This stratagem was repeated on a second occasion.
On their third assignation, the burglar entered the building admitted by Charles. Cynthia guided him to the steel door of the cipher room. There followed over two hours of tension as he struggled with the combination. When this finally was mastered, he showed Cynthia how to unlock it in future, then attempted to unlock the safe. Time was running out when he had at last done so. There was no time to photograph the cipher books and they then had to withdraw.
[On the fifth attempt] Charles once again told the guard in advance that he must not be disturbed. The burglar was let in through the window to the waiting room. But Cynthia’s instinct told her to take some additional precautions. While the burglar worked, this time quickly, to open the safe, she stood at the entrance to the waiting room… and removed all her clothes, ending up wearing only her pearls and high-heeled shoes. She also told Charles to get partly undressed.
It was just as well that she did, as the watchman suddenly appeared, waving his torch around. Having caught a glimpse of her undressed – and, in a real, not simulated, panic, exclaiming ‘Oh la la!’ – he switched it off with profuse apologies and left.
The books were dispatched to be photographed. With Charles and Cynthia in a state of high anxiety, they were not brought back until 5am.
The negatives of the copies of the code books were handed over to US Naval Intelligence and dispatched to Bletchley in the care of a King’s Messenger on an RAF aircraft. I received effusive thanks from Dilly Knox and congratulations from [celebrated senior spymaster William] Stephenson, for both of whom Cynthia by now had achieved legendary status.
The landings in north Africa took place at the end of the year, aided by the signals intelligence to which Cynthia had made a decisive contribution, as the naval codes she had acquired enabled the instant deciphering of the messages sent to and from the Vichy forces in north Africa. The intercepts had revealed the state and dispositions of the Vichy naval defences, the crumbling of the Vichy defenders’ morale, and the precise moment at which they might be prepared to sue for peace.
Cynthia was told formally that her efforts ‘had saved a lot of Allied soldiers’ lives’ [and described as the] ‘greatest unsung heroine of the war’.
And yet she was still not considered ‘respectable’. Even her friends regarded her as unscrupulous, which she [took] as a compliment, given the cause she had served.
Cynthia had signed up to do as much damage as she could to the Germans. Respectability had nothing to do with it. It was true that she was by nature an adventuress. She loved the sheer excitement of spying and of being a femme fatale.
Yet she had principles which she would never compromise. Her success as a secret agent came not just from her looks and intelligence but from a determination to do as much damage as she could to the Nazis… and stop at nothing in doing so.
Abridged extract from A Spy Called Cynthia. Note from the book’s editor, Robin Renwick: ‘Cynthia’s family were adamant that she did not have an affair with the author… Whilst I cannot vouch for the personal aspects of this story, I can guarantee the accuracy of this account of the exploits of Cynthia as a secret agent of British intelligence in the war.’BuyDomains posted a sweet ROI today on their sale of Bixer.com.

It sported tidy newly-married clothes. Secretarial blouses, skirts and tights. Polo shirts and weekend jeans (his mother still laundering the boiler suit). Undies that showed we minded – elastic firmly in place and lace on display. Socks paired uniformly. Linen from the only bed hung on the banister. Shirts draped over radiators. Hand-wash delicates caringly spread on a nifty bath-top drier.
Fast forward a couple of years. The knickers have grown bigger to accommodate developing bump. The bras are impressive – in size if not in drama. Lace ratio has diminished and pant elastic thinned to drooping point. The cheap and cheerful bed clothes have lost vibrancy. Voluminous maternity dresses hog the airer, jostling for space against faded denims and work-a-day clothes. Comfortably lived in.
A semi-detached house – with garden! A family on the cusp of blooming mayhem. Tiny wee socks, smaller than pegs. Doll-sized button-down vests. Blue. White. Pastels. Cradled broderie anglaise. Soft baby cardigans gifted with love and kissed by the breeze as they flutter above the over-long grass of an un-tended garden. Embraced on either side by parental wear that will not require ironing and forgives baby posset. No hand-wash delicates here. Boxer shorts usurping the arse-out Y-fronts. Knickers – practical. Bras unhinge at the front.
And then comes the deluge. Pastels in pink next to bright-comic-strip, little man Ts. Cot sheets and bed sheets and changing mats. Romper suits, romper suits, romper suits. Toddler denims, dungarees, precious blankies. Cot sheets and bed sheets and changing mats. Bibs. Teddy-bears. Messy-play aprons. Sweatshirts emblazoned with diggers, princess duvet covers. The day-glow yellow washing line sags under the strain. Tumble drier is mentioned. Cot sheets and bed sheets and changing mats. Small socks lodged in filters. Potty training pants and jeans, pants and trousers, pants and joggers…
Move to the farm. Muddy coats, dog beds, wet woollen socks. Boiler suits! Bed sheets and bed sheets and pillowcases. School uniform – too soon! Little white collared shirts. Grey trousers, grey jumpers, grey, grey, grey. Airtex tops. Yards of Rayon. Tumble drier. PE kit. Dog towels and bath towels and washable door-mats. Nylon blazers, track suits, hockey skirts, football socks. Jodhpurs, leotards, shorts. Sweaty underarms. Horse hairs. Whipped and snapped by the wind gusting over the fields. Dusted with chaff. Dried and rained on and dried over again.
A single favoured shirt rotates alone in the tumble drier. Essential wear. Specific pants. Modified tartan school-skirts. Rock band Ts, designer labels, rude words. Black denim. Black, black and black. Hoodies, team kit, man-sized shirts. Strap tops, mini-skirts. Pastel trainer bras. Tailored white blouses, elbow-out blazers. Single socks of unknown ownership. Bed sheets, mascara stained pillowcases. Duvets and towels. Sleeping bags, hockey kit, rugby tops, riding clothes. Dog beds, numnahs, horse rugs. Buggered washing machine. Miniscule strings of lacy thongs. Wafts of over-used aftershave. Smudges of make-up.
Magical washing which hung itself, oddly pegged and abandoned to wilt. Eye-brow raising underwear. Skimpy dresses. Term-sized laundry bags coming home to roost. Unfamiliar clothes. University sweatshirts. Famine or feast for the washing machine. Rarely time for the washing-line. Four sets of bed sheets, three sets of bed sheets, two…
Summer-holiday clothes, bright and blousy. Khaki shorts, linen dresses, golfing trousers. Two sets of boiler suits. Yoga pants, walking coats. Dog beds and jodhpurs. Celebratory wine-splattered tablecloths. Garden cushions. Trainer socks. Winter holiday sun-dresses. Swimming suits, evening wear. M&S reliable pants. Lace on display.

7.3.2.5776bliss is the opposite of stress
for the adult, playing is a break from work. for the child, playing is serious business. we’re all adults here (i know, i know) so i’m talking about taking a break from work. play offers the adult most allure as a way to destress, especially now with stress levels hitting all time highs everyday.
but if you’ve been following me awhile you’ll know that i don’t believe in the concept of ‘de-stressing’. because
the opposite of stress is bliss
but first…
what caused that stress?
not going into an elaborate analysis of the subject here but suffice to say that an inability to achieve desired outcomes is the main culprit. thus work deadlines, sales targets, data collection, even my newsletter subscriber count can be stressful.
it’s vital that you understand this completely. towards that extent it’d be a fun game to write out a list of all the unvanquished villains in your life. the ones who still taunt and tease you endlessly. the ones whose very existence stresses you out.
write about them. draw them out. enact them. give them names. remember every super hero needs his arch nemesis and the rest of the super villain gang. wouldn’t be much fun as super hero otherwise. make your own most wanted list with mug shots and darts sticking through them.
aim for bliss. nothing less
any person teetering on the verge of a burnout is often looking for relief more than jubilation. listen you me now, don’t you settle for less. you deserve nothing less than sheer unadulterated bliss. yeah, that’s my new favorite word now.
we’re gonna form a squad of super heroes now who will help you vanquish the villains. many hands make light work, so all you need now is many hands. since you’re not an Indian god, that’s out of the picture. instead let’s recruit some fun folk on our crusade.
think of every single memory ever that screams bliss. the feeling of sand sinking beneath your feet as the waves recede into the sea. swinging on the tyre hanging from your treehouse. riding a rollercoaster for the very first time. skinny dipping in a freezing mountain stream.
make a list of these memories. name them. put a picture to each (draw it out or use stock photos) and pin it on your wall. write poems associated with those memories. call the people who shared them with you and relive those stories of yesteryear. put together your bliss deck.
play before you fight
so now that the battle lines are drawn and the troops are ready, it’s time to fight. except it’s not. we’re not going to pit our wits against each other. instead we’re gonna take a vacation to play. think of it as playtime. but it’s still a vacation. only a micro one at that.
pick any one blissful memory from that deck of bliss cards you had pinned on the wall. let’s say it’s the feeling of sand beneath your feet card. go out and find some sand. i don’t care if you have to buy some from the hardware store nearby. get some. put it in a pit or just spread it on a sheet. now stand in/on it and close your eyes.
visualise that memory. imagine those exact moments that led to that state of bliss. remember the feeling. allow the memory to flow through you like you’re in that experience right here right now. let that sand beneath your feet remind you how real this is. feel each grain of sand teasing you with those very sensations.
depending on how comfortable you are with visualisation and imagination, you could take a micro ‘bliss-cation’ for 5-20 minutes. if you feel incapable and you want expert help, find a child to join you in the game. as you both close your eyes and you’re narrating the episode to the child to visualise, you’ll find yourself immersed deeper than while alone.
before you dismiss or scoff at this concept of a micro vacation, of the deck of bliss cards, i want you to try it for a week. let me know how it goes. it will get easier by the day and exponentially more effective. waiting to hear what you have in your bliss deck and how your vacation went.Job Description

At this stage, one of the hardest decisions that a developer has to make is whether to go with a mobile game publisher or to continue embracing the indie life and go solo.
A mobile game publisher can help you in so many more ways than you can imagine for a share of your game’s revenues, offering you their expertise on valuable services like distribution, monetization, app store optimization, and more.
There are many publishers but the reality is that for every mobile game publisher out there, there are hundreds and thousands of games being built by indie developers on a daily basis and the competition is very high.
Below is everything you need to know about how to choose your mobile game publisher and how to maximize your chances of getting one.
How to Get a Mobile Game Publisher?
Build A Great Game
This might seem like stating the obvious, but it’s clearly easier said than done. If your game isn’t up to par, then no matter how hard you try, no mobile game publisher will take it.
If you’re building the game as a hobby or passion project, that’s great, but at the end of the day you need to treat it as a business. The more interesting and addictive your game is, the higher its chances of success and consequently getting signed by a mobile game publisher.
It would also definitely be a plus for publishers if when you’re pitching your game, you already had a business model, an idea of where your game can go, and the return on investment from the publisher’s point of view.
Tips for building a great game:
Has a unique selling point.
Has to be stable.
Simple and appealing to both adults and children alike.
Continuous, never ending, or has many levels.
Know your audience and cater to them.
Simple scoring system with targets or achievements that players chase.
Define Your Objectives
You need to know what you want to get from a mobile game publisher. Each mobile game publisher can help you in different ways and you don’t want to feel like the services they’re offering isn’t worth the percentage of your revenue they’re taking.
You have to clearly define your objectives out of this partnership and you need to choose a publisher that compliments you and your game and excels at what you don’t do very well.
Some of the main objectives of having a mobile game publisher are:
Development: Helping with the development of the mobile game or overcoming technical difficulties.
Planning: Taking your game and creating a product strategy around it as well as how it can grow and develop over time.
Costs: Funding the game development process and maintenance costs.
Publicity: Handling the marketing, advertising, public relations, and even social media efforts for you.
Distribution: Reaching other demographics and markets.
Monetization: Monetizing your game or choosing the best models, strategies, and ad networks for it.
App Store Optimization: Pushing your game up the charts or getting it featured on the app store.
Localization: Translating your game into multiple languages to appeal to different audiences and global markets.
Porting: Helping expand your game’s support to other platforms. Most publishers require that your game is initially at least available on iOS — if not, your chances drastically decline.
Other: Quality assurance, data analytics, community management, customer support, etc.
Approach
Once you’ve defined your objectives, you need to find a mobile game publisher that matches your needs. However, it’s not as easy as just picking one and that’s it. Also don’t expect to build a game and have the publishers flock to it.
You will have to approach multiple publishers to increase your chances, so go crazy. You can check out the top 63 mobile game publishers in 2020 for options of publishers to approach.
Some of the top mobile game publishers are:
Things to check before approaching a mobile game publisher:
If they’re a good fit for your needs and objectives.
If your game is a good fit for them based on their portfolio. Some publishers only specialize in specific types of games and if they’ve already had experience publishing similar games to yours, then chances are that they will have a better understanding of how to maximize the return on your game.
The publisher’s working style with developers.
Their previous experiences with pushing games up the charts and maybe even getting them featured on the stores.
The number of games that they publish on a regular basis. This will give you a sense of how hard the competition is as well as their level of commitment, and how much time and attention they will be able to provide you if you partner up.
Money Matters
You need a game that can make money, simple as that. It would be best if you already have your game monetization strategy in place when approaching a mobile game publisher. However, even if you don’t and you need their help with that, then you at least need a game with the potential to earn revenue in some way.
This is definitely one of the biggest make-or-break factors on which a mobile game publisher would base their decision. You can check out our 2020 mobile game monetization guide for how to turn your game into a gold mine.
The most popular mobile game monetization models are:
Free Vs. Paid Games
In-App Ads
Freemium/In-App Purchases
Be Prepared
Once you have everything set and you’re ready to approach, it’s time for your first communication with the publishers. You need to pitch your game in the best way you can because this will determine whether they’ll want to proceed with you or not. Your pitch will most likely be refined over time, through trial and error.
You could put blood, sweat, and tears into developing your game, but if you can’t put all of that into words and sell it in an e-mail, then all of your work might go to waste.
Tips for your pitch e-mail:
Include the game title in the subject and not just a generic “Game Submission”.
Keep the e-mail simple and straight to the point.
Add your game logo to make it memorable.
Include a fact sheet about your game including title, description, storyline, key features, supported platforms, MSRP, expected launch date, and any other details the publisher might want to know at first glance.
Attach a 30-60 second trailer for your game.
Attach screenshots and a game play video/demo to show how the game will actually look like to the end-user.
Explain your needs and what you expect out of your partnership.
Provide your contact info.
Be Patient
There are many games out there and only a handful of publishers, and an average mobile game publisher receives at least a few dozens of pitches on a weekly basis. So if your mailbox doesn’t get filled up with responses right away, don’t stress about it and give them some time.
Just because they haven’t gotten back to you immediately doesn’t mean that they’re not interested. In fact, a lot of publishers like to take their time with the games they like so that they can go through everything in your pitch to make sure that they’re making the right decision and so that they can compile thoughtful feedback before signing your game.
Be Flexible
In most cases, when the mobile game publisher gets back to you, they will have a lot of questions. If they’re truly interested in your game, then they’ll have tons of feedback and suggestions on how to improve it with aspects like gameplay, monetization, graphics, and more. You need to understand that the publishers are the ones with experience in that domain and they’ve worked with many games who have flopped and others who have gone to the top of the charts alike, so they know what works and what doesn’t.
This is a partnership and you have to consider everything that they propose and discuss it with them. If you believe that your game is perfect and you don’t want to change anything about it, then getting a publisher is probably not for you.
Deal Terms
Once it’s a match for both you and your mobile game publisher, the final step is to agree on the deal terms. At this stage, you need to make sure that everything is absolutely clear from both sides and you’re both in agreement about what to expect from the other.
Don’t be shy to ask questions to avoid any confusion or issues in the future and make sure to go over all of the terms and the fine print before proceeding with the partnership.
Things to consider:
Expected work and ROI.
Transparency regarding revenue and costs.
The split cut in terms of revenue or product.
Conditions in case the game flops.
Conditions in case the game thrives.
Terms for future plans including sequels or downloadable content (DLCs).
Termination terms from both sides.
In Conclusion
You don’t need a mobile game publisher for your game to be a success. However, in many cases, they increase your chances of reaching the top 100. If you end up deciding to go with one, you need to choose a mobile game publisher that you’ll be comfortable working with and that treats your relationship as a partnership, because at the end of the day you both have the same end-goal of promoting your mobile game as much as possible to succeed.

We have been thinking of you, and hope that this note finds you very well. We wanted to take a moment at the end of our fiscal year to let everyone know what we’ve been up to since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Since our office was closed to visitors on March 13, Vtape’s staff has continued to work, mainly remotely, and with occasional on-site visits as required. Our goal has been to keep the organization operating smoothly and reliably, so that we can offer the full range of distribution services to artists and clients in as straightforward a manner as possible. Staff can be contacted by e-mail, or by voice mail at 416.351.1317.
Festivals, galleries, and educational institutions have been coming to us for content, and for guidance around fees for on-line events and exhibitions. We are doing everything we can to facilitate inclusion of your work in distanced exhibition initiatives, new public programming experiments, and on-line learning and curriculum development, while also ensuring that you are always fairly paid when your work is used.
Daily, we are in communication with our colleagues in the media arts sector across the country and around the world, working closely with festival organizers and programmers, curators, educators, and other arts administrators and advocates who are helping us to navigate this unique historical moment.
Our programming has gone on-line, with screenings on our website weekly since early April. Yaniya Lee’s program fractured horizon – a view from the body is available until September 10th. After that look for the Curatorial Incubator v.16: Living In Hope, which will roll out starting September 11th. Our most recent talk – a conversation between John Paul Ricco and Adam Barbu – was on Instagram Live and is still available on our Instagram page (vtapevideoart). Tune in when you have a minute.
The pandemic shutdown came partway through a major multi-year initiative for Vtape to complete the digitization of every analogue video in our catalogue. Although this work was interrupted for a period, it has now resumed, and we should be able to complete the digitization of every Vtape artist’s analogue materials within the next two to three years. This project will ensure that all of the analogue-era works we represent will be accessible for online preview, and available for presentation and acquisition, in perpetuity. Curious about how we do this? Kim Tomczak is happy to answer your questions: kimt@vtape.org.
Vtape stands in solidarity in the fight against racism. We stand with our artists and the challenging, authentic voices their works represent.

DeFi Direct AMA Invites Users In
The DeFi Direct Discord is open and kicked off an AMA on Friday, Nov. 19th, at 19:00 UTC. Head of Growth for DeFi Direct, Drew the Ace, led Rafiki, Chief Marketing Officer of ApeSwap, and Quile, Editor at BSC News, through a rousing chat about Decentralized Finance and the general health of the crypto industry.
The talk began highlighting the recent updates from the Wen News Ser campaign by ApeSwap.

Hopefully, the NFBs can be a new source of fun for ApeSwap fanatics who have been priced out of the incredibly popular Non-Fungible Apes.
“One of the most enjoyable listens I have had in a while,” said Mostafa Salem, DeFi Direct Events Coordinator. “Really need to do these conversational events more often.”
Future talks and events are expected to be recorded and uploaded to the DeFi Direct YouTube for future reference. The technical team at DeFi Direct confirmed in the Discord Channel that this first round had some difficulties in figuring out how Discord functions.
The inaugural AMA under the new parent company of BSC News is the first in what is expected to be a bonanza of events on Discord. If you think BSC News has been top of their game event-wise, just wait till you see what is coming for 2022.
“That was awesome!” exclaimed Rafiki in a private message following the event. “We should have a[nother] spot here soon.”

Synopsis: For a veteran of Delta Force, the details of civilian life are never as they seem. Especially the love letters.
A mountain of mail had spilled over on my desk when I returned with coffee. ‘Tis the season for updated medical forms.
With a sigh, I sat and started sorting interoffice mail from the fat white envelopes given to parents to return the annual health paperwork. At the bottom of the stack was a thin, cream envelope.
I scanned the hall outside the clinic. Snatching the envelope, I hurried into the back treatment room and studied the penmanship. My first initial and last name, in loose cursive letters.
I closed my eyes, sniffing the envelope along the seal. Woodsy…like pine. My hands shook when I slid a finger under the edge and opened it.
Unfolding the paper, I frowned. I haven’t seen one of these in years. The paper’s different, but the formatting’s right …my eyes fell on the end.
Wishing to be yours,
J.
I stiffened. It has to be from Captain Davis. I read the letter again, committing it to memory before tearing it up. From my lunch I grabbed an apple, taking small bites of it with each mouthful of paper.
Why didn’t they tell me I was reactivated? Unless…maybe there’s a mole. Lots of military brats go to school here…
“Alex?”
I jumped up, finding myself face-to-chest with a polo that read Coach Mula. The last few paper bits fluttering towards the floor.
“Jason!” I stooped down to grab up the scraps. “Sorry, I was doing some filing.”
His eyebrows shot up. “Interesting system.”
“Oh. The old documents have to be destroyed. HIPAA and all. What’s up?”
He held out an Epi-Pen. “New pen for Jana. The old one’s expired. She’s never needed it. She’s only ever gotten hives and swelling at the sting spot, but I figure better safe than sorry. Blame the health teacher in me. I also keep one in my office, with some Benadryl melt-aways.”
“Those are good precautions.”
“Hopefully they’ll always be just that.” He smiled. “You coming to the game on Friday?”
“I’m not sure.”
“Well, if you do, let me know. Friends of the coach get reserved seating.”
“Thanks.”
“My number’s in the directory. Call or text.”
“Okay.”
When he left, I pulled out my purse, unlocked a hidden compartment and retrieved my secure phone. I fired off a text to Captain Davis, my former Delta Team leader. I locked the phone in my purse and returned to the waiting piles of envelopes.
After the lunchtime medication administration rush, I stood in the back room, straightening up. The door banged open when Jason hurried in, carrying his daughter. “She came to see me in during lunch, said she was feeling off-balance and then collapsed.”
“Bring her in here.”
He laid Jana on the cot in the treatment room. She closed her eyes and rested her hand on her forehead. “There was the weirdest flickering in my vision. Like a prism, with rainbows on the edges.”
Jason sat next to her head, his face tight, hands clasped. I attached a blood pressure cuff and did a quick history and exam.
“It sounds a lot like a migraine, but I’m not allowed to diagnose her.” I placed a hand on Jason’s shoulder. “I think she’ll be fine. Call her pediatrician. She can stay here for the rest of the afternoon. It’s only two hours.”
Jason’s face softened, the tension draining out of him. “Thanks, Alex.” He looked down at Jana. “You okay if I head back to class?”
She offered a small smile. “Sure, Dad.”
“Jason, I’ll meet you out front.”
He nodded and stood, kissing Jana on the forehead before he left.
I glanced down at Jana. “Any chance you’re pregnant?”
“What? Gross! No way!”
“I have to ask. Migraines are common in pregnancy, and you couldn’t take any ibuprofen. I’ll be right back.”
Jason stood by my desk, his arm crossed. He had physique of a runner, a strong jaw and thick blonde hair. He caught my stare and my cheeks flamed.
“Can we talk?”
My heart fluttered. “Of course.”
Jason glanced over my shoulder. “Maybe outside?”
“Sure.”
He held the door open to the empty hallway. My heart rate picked up when I passed and caught a hint of cologne: citrus, pine and leather.
Jason rubbed his neck, eyes downcast. “I really appreciate your help. Jana’s…well, I think she’s going through something. Her coach said she’s not running very well. She may be trying to get some attention.”
“How’s she been at home with you?”
“Pretty good. And this’s the first time her coach has ever said anything about her focus.”
I raised my eyebrows. “Why do you think she’s trying to get attention?”
He flushed. “I think it’s been tough for her lately…stuck with me for her teen years. There’s a lot I don’t know how to talk to her about.”
“I imagine that’s hard for both of you.”
“Very.”
“I can see if she’ll talk to me?”
Jason’s shoulders relaxed. “That’d be great.”
I laid my hand on his arm. “I’m sure you’re doing fine. I’ll offer, but don’t be surprised if she won’t open up to me. I’m still pretty new here, and I’ve only seen her a couple of times.”
Jason covered my hand with his. “Thanks. Even if she doesn’t say anything, at least she’ll know that she can come to you.” He squeezed my hand, a surge of electricity shooting from my fingers to my chest.
“I, uh, better get back in there. Oh, can she have a dose of ibuprofen?”
“Yea, sure.”
“Thanks. We’ll come to your office after school.”
“Great. Thanks again, Alex.” He hesitated a moment, trapping me with his emerald eyes. I shifted and flashed a small smile. He cleared his throat, smiled back and headed off down the hall.
That evening I sat at the dining room table, staring at an “Access Restricted” warning. It popped up when I tried to log in to the network used by my Delta Force team. Strange. Why wouldn’t my account have been reactivated?
On the secure phone, I sent another text to my team leader, then scooped up surveillance notes, organized them by possible targets in the main office with “J” names and stowed them in a floor safe. In the bedroom, I plugged in my unsecure personal phone then double checked the Glock 9mm in the wall safe.
The unsecure phone buzzed with a new text. I unlocked it and the message popped up.
Thx again for taking care of Jana. She’s been fine all evening. Seems much happier.
Glad she’s feeling better. She knows where to find me. Have a good night.
U 2.
I silenced the device. J? Maybe he’s the op target. Jana’s not trying to get his attention, Jason’s trying to get mine! I wonder who he’s with?
I readied for bed, running through the events of the day. I replayed my conversation with Jason again, remembering the tingle of excitement when I touched his arm, and again when he squeezed my hand. Stupid. I can’t believe I didn’t think of him right off the bat. Now I’ve acted like a schoolgirl with a crush and have to keep it up. Hm. Or maybe that’ll work to my advantage…
I drifted off, devising ways to get closer to Jason and gather more information for my team.
The next afternoon, I sat at my desk, making reminder calls to parents for medication refills.
“Alex, help!”
Jason hustled towards me, carrying a limp Jana in his arms.
“What happened?”
He laid Jana on the treatment bed with an Epi-Pen and package of Benadryl. “She was stung, here.” He held up her red, swollen hand.
I moved to Jana’s head and tapped her chest firmly. “Jana? Open your eyes!”
Jana moaned. Her eyes fluttered.
I sprang into action, checking vital signs and listening to Jana’s heart and lungs. “Did you use her Epi-Pen?”
“Yes. And she had two Benadryl melt-aways, about ten minutes ago. She’s never reacted this bad before. I called 9-1-1 and brought her down here when she started to get sleepy.”
“It might be the medicine. She’s not wheezing, no angioedema – sorry. Swelling in her mouth. She’ll probably need some steroids.” The blood pressure cuff beeped. “Good. BP’s normal. The Epi’s helping.”
Jason sat heavily on the foot of the bed. “I don’t know what she was thinking, swatting at a bee.”
“She probably wasn’t.”
He turned to face me and took my hand with his free one. My body responded, heart fluttering, conflicting with my instinct to pull away. I forced a smile. Act natural.
We jumped when the door banged open.
“Hello? EMS!”
A swarm of people filled the room. I gave my report while someone tended to Jana and another talked with Jason. Jana was transferred to the ambulance stretcher.
Jason stepped and engulfing me in a hug. “Thank you again.”
My stomach tightened. A flush spread across my cheeks at the stares of the emergency personnel. I offered him a small smile, butterflies filling my chest. Jason moved to the side and fell in line to follow the stretcher. When it rolled past, a hint of a smile played on Jana’s lips.
I narrowed my eyes, kicking myself for getting caught up in Jason’s show of affection. Could Jana be involved?
I signed my last chart from the day’s visits, closed the program and sat back. My purse rested on the desk, secure phone hidden inside. There’d been no response from Captain Davis, so I followed protocol and sent one to the commanding officer.
Checking the hallway first, I stepped into the treatment room and retrieved the phone. Finally! A response!
A shadow crossed over my shoulder. I spun around, slipping the phone into my waist band. “Jason! You startled me.”
He placed both hands on my arms, his grip tight. “I came back by to get my car and saw your light was on. Thanks so much for taking care of Jana. And me.”
I gave him a weak smile. “It was nothing. Just doing my job.”
“No, it was more than that.”
“I, uh-” My stomach flip-flopped, then remembered Jana, smiling as the she was wheeled out. I steeled myself. “Of course, Jason. Any time.”
His hands moved up, grazed the skin of my neck, and then cradled my face. He lowered his face and pressed his lips to mine. The pounding of my heart and tingling of my skin made fighting the urge to move my body closer impossible.
Jason deepened the kiss, his eyes closed. I moved my left hand up and around his neck, the other grabbing for an IV line lying nearby.
Our lips parted. He pressed his forehead to mine. “I’ve wanted to do that ever since I met you.”
“Mmm.” I slid my left hand down to his chest.
He started to pull back, lowering his hands. I snatched the other end of the IV tubing and wound it around his wrists.
“What the hell?”
“I could say the same to you,” I hissed. My right foot swept behind him, bringing him crashing to the floor. From the treatment desk, I grabbed the Benadryl melt-aways he’d left earlier and shoved several in his cheek. He tried to spit them out, fighting the IV line that restrained his hands.
“Hold still or I’ll knock you out!” I maneuvered him to his side and put one foot in his armpit.
“Jesus! All you had to do is say no when I tried to kiss you!”
“Oh, I’m on to you, Mula. You and your daughter.”
“Lieutenant Newman!”
I snapped to attention at voice my commanding officer, Major Finske. “Sir!”
“Lieutenant? I thought you were a nurse?” Jason looked from me to the major.
“What’s the meaning of all this, Lieutenant?”
“Sir?”
“Your messages. You’ve got all the teams at Fort Bragg in a tizzy. What’s going on?”
“Sir, I…uh…I was responding to my team activation letter.”
“You’re old team’s deployed. And nobody’s been reactivated.”
I cocked my head. “They’re deployed?”
“Yes, Lieutenant. Now, you better show me the letter you received.”
“Well, Sir, I, uh, I followed protocol and destroyed it.”
“How destroyed?”
“Very.”
He sighed. “I guess we’ll never know your source. It didn’t come from us.”
“What letter?” Jason’s speech slurred when he spoke.
I glared at him. “A love letter showed up in my mail on Monday. Same format we used to use to communicate when my Delta Force team was activated for an assignment. Before cell phones and texting were widely used.”
“Your Delta Force team? That’s badass!”
I crossed my arms. “Anyhow, the letter showed up, signed by a “J.” We used the first initial of our target or suspect in the signature. You and Jana kept crossing my radar. I figured you were the target.”
“What about my letter?”
“Excuse me?”
“Yeah, it’s right…here…” Jason struggled against the IV tubing for his back pocket. He pulled out a folded piece of paper, identical to the one I had eaten. His was signed “A.” I snatched it and started reading, the major moving to read it over my shoulder.
“What the devil,” I mused.
“That’s not from us,” Major Finske added. “There aren’t any operations here.”
“Jana.” Jason yawned. “I think she’s playing matchmaker.” His voice trailed off and he gazed up at me with a goofy grin. “You’re so pretty.”
I looked up. “Oh, shit. Sorry, Jason. It’s the Benadryl.” I moved to untie the IV tubing, then stood and faced Major Finske. “Sir, I’m very sorry for the mix-up.”
“I understand, Lieutenant. Know that if we reactivate you, you’ll get an official notice first. I’ll leave you to straighten things out here. I’m be available if there are any…administrative wrinkles.”
“Yes, Sir. Thank you, Sir” I held my salute while he moved towards the door.
Jason yawned loudly. “So, what now?”
I crossed the room and sat down next to him. “Now I apologize profusely and get you home. Is someone with Jana?”
“Yup. Her grandma.”
“And she’s okay?”
“Fiiiine. Seemed all better by the time we got to the ER.”
“Good. I’ll take you home in your car and get a cab back here to mine.”
“Mmm, sure. But what now?”
“I already answered that.”
“Nooo, what now, you and me? I liked kissing you.”
My face burned. “I liked it, too.”
“Can I do it again sometime?”
I bit my lip. “Yea, I think so.”
“Are you gonna tie me up again if I do?”
I grimaced. “Sorry about that.”
“No, really. Will you tie me up again? Cuz that was hot.”
“Um, we’ll see how you feel about it without a heavy dose of antihistamine. Maybe we should start fresh?”
He grinned and drew me close. “Nah, I think it makes for a good story.” I moved into him, smiling when our lips met.

If you’ve read my last two blog posts you’ll know that backlight is the central pillar of my approach to lighting both day exteriors and night exteriors. Daylight interiors are no different.
For day exteriors your backlight is the sun. For night exteriors it’s usually the moon. For day interiors it’s windows.
On the location recce I’d agreed with director Ben Bloore and production designer Sophie Black that we were going to shoot mostly towards the bedroom’s window. Given that the bed was the focal point of the scene, this decision was also cinematographically sound because it made for the most depth in the image, the window being in a dormer that distanced it from the bed.
To punch up the natural light coming in through the window – which was on the second floor – I had my crew clamber up on the flat roof of the extension and erect our Arri M18 on a double wind-up stand. Luckily the geography of the room and the blocking permitted the M18’s light to hit Tina’s face as she lay in the bed.
Sophie had dressed a floor lamp in next to the bed, which gave me the perfect motivation to clamp a dedo to the bedframe, uplighting Phil’s face. The cool M18 coming in from the rear right and the warm dedo coming in from the rear left picked out the actors’ profiles nicely, as you can see below. This is a kind of cross-backlight set-up, as explained in Lighting Techniques #2.
Immediately above the camera position there was a skylight with a roller blind. By opening or closing the blind I could effectively increase or decrease the level of fill in the lighting. For most of the scene I chose none. Some would argue that it’s best to add fill and then crush it out in post if you don’t like it, but I like to make decisions on the set wherever possible, to deliver the most cinematic image straight out of the camera.
To soften the scene I pumped in lots of smoke. Col had kindly gifted me a Magnum 650 (to fill the smoke machine void in my life since my Magnum 550 packed up last year) and we let that baby rip in that tiny little room! The smoke helped add to the sense of decay and reacted beautifully to the curtains being opened mid-scene.
That’s all from the set of Crossing Paths. I believe the edit is now underway, and I look forward to seeing how this lovely little short film turns out.

After a number of TV shows, films and her bold avatar in a few adult OTT series, she is now doing back-to-back projects where she is readily experimenting playing varied characters.
“To break the girl-next-door image on TV, I made a switch to OTT with bold shows like Gandii Baat-4, XXX and Mastram. And now, none of my shows are in that zone,” she says.
Jain adds, “Instead, I am playing a don in the series The Prayag Raj, a powerful rural girl in Raktanchal-2 and am seen executing a heist in my current series in Lucknow followed by film Aafat-e-Ishq, a horror episodic and murder mystery Death Tales.”
For now, the young actor plans to stay away from bold content. “I took that path to break that simple TV image. I feel I took a right step on right time and dabbled in OTT. I did try bold and adult content but it was very selective and aesthetically done. See, there is a very thin line between unnecessary skin show and required bold content! My hard work fetched me back-to-back projects and today I am in a happy space. I have been continuously working in pandemic since last year’s unlock phase.”
The actor has many projects lined-up for release. “My last release was Twisted and most of my new films and series are completed. Mega series Dongri to Dubai is also up for release. With every project, people will get to see a different side of me as an actor,” she says.
Jain is currently wrapping a project in Lucknow and Ayodhya. “All I can tell at this stage is that it’s a small desi version of Money Heist where we target a bank. It’s all about greed and money,” she says.
This is her second project in Lucknow since pandemic. “Since I am also a singer, so I have performed here earlier. Then, last year, I came for the shoot of Prayag… and now for this OTT series. So, it has become a third home for me after my hometown Indore and Mumbai. Earlier, I was also in Varanasi for the shoot of Raktanchal-2.”
Jain also did a music concert in Indore this year. “I am not finding time for singing, as right now all my focus is on acting,” she adds.In the modern world there are about 100 thousand museums, but this is an approximate figure, since it is simply impossible to count all the museums in the world - there are countless them. Therefore, they allocate largest museums in the world. Such a gradation is correct and most understandable.
Let's start with the oldest and most unique museum called the Louvre, which is located in Paris. The Louvre has existed since 1793. The exposition of this large museum is very rich, and is designed for a wide range of people.
The second largest museum in the world is the British Museum, located in London. It is a little older than the Louvre and has existed since 1753. The museum is truly unique. It presents a significant number of paintings by English artists, as well as foreign ones.
The largest museums a lot, and consider all of them in one article will not work. Therefore, it will be easier to list all the major museums, especially since each of them is on our site, and you can easily read information about the museum. Choose the museum that interests you - the list is huge.

Former Inter forward Pietro Fanna discussed the derby between Inter and AC Milan tomorrow as well as the Nerazzurri’s moves in the transfer market in an interview with Italian media outlet TuttoMercatoWeb.
“Conte’s team is back and I hope they’re the favourites on Sunday night. On the market they looked for what they wanted and there was, in fact, the need of reinforcements. The team that’s building themselves on the pitch and off is strong. And if you want to aspire to the highest levels it must be just so.”
The 61-year-old Italian then spoke about Danish midfielder Christian Eriksen and what he will bring to the team.
“At Udine I thought he would make more of an impact. But you can’t judge from one side and Conte knows him well, so he’ll certainly have a chance to grow up and settle in well. I hope for the good of the league that Inter can beat Milan and that they can fight for the Scudetto until the end. It would be good for the league.”
Inter are currently 2nd in the league after 22 games, three points behind rivals and league leaders Juventus and one point ahead of 3rd place Lazio. The Nerazzurri have drawn three out of their last five games, winning the other two. They have achieved nine points since the start of the new year, two less than the Rossoneri.
AC Milan are 9th in the league but have been experiencing a period of incredibly strong form since the arrival of Swedish veteran Zlatan Ibrahimovic. They have earnt 11 points since the start of the year, under the guidance of coach Stefano Pioli.Ukraine 2010 10 Hryvnia's Potter sUNC Silver Coin

Although growing a healthy bonsai tree takes patience and precision, it’s not as daunting as it seems. Understanding a few basic components of bonsai tree fertilizer will ensure your tree grows healthy and strong.
This bonsai tree fertilizer beginner’s guide breaks down the most important things you need to know when caring for a bonsai.
Bonsai Trees and Fertilization
Plants absorb nutrients from soil to grow, depleting the soil over time. For cultivated plants, fertilization replaces the natural processes that replenish these nutrients in the wild. While fertilization is important for all plants, it’s particularly essential for delicate bonsai. Because they are planted in shallow containers, bonsai can easily deplete soil of the nutrients essential for growth.
The Big Three
Most commercial fertilizers contain three primary elements: nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Each plays a fundamental role in plant growth:
- Nitrogen: Plants absorb more nitrogen than any other nutrient. This nutrient fuels new growth and is essential for plant health.
- Phosphorus: Plants need phosphorus to transfer and store energy. Phosphorus also aids in the process of photosynthesis.
- Potassium: This nutrient strengthens and fortifies plants, helping them resist disease and grow strong root systems.
Liquid vs. Solid Bonsai Tree Fertilizer
Bonsai tree fertilizer comes in two forms: liquid and solid. The best fertilizer for bonsai trees will contain the “big three” nutrients, though liquid and solid fertilizer each have their own benefits:
- Liquid fertilizer: Liquid concentrate is a fast-acting way to replenish nutrients. However, liquid fertilizer leaches from the soil with each watering, so it’s important to stick to a regular schedule when using liquid fertilizer.
- Solid fertilizer: Also known as granular fertilizer, solid fertilizer is spread on the surface layer of soil. This slow-release approach diffuses into the soil over time and requires less upkeep, but there is a much greater risk of burning your plant’s roots with solid fertilizers and it’s more difficult to know when to reapply your slow-release fertilizer.
Organic vs. Synthetic Bonsai Tree Fertilizer
Both organic and synthetic fertilizers will provide your bonsai the nutrients it needs to grow. Organic fertilizer is derived from natural sources like manure, fish, or seaweed. Synthetic fertilizers are chemically formulated.
While some people find natural, organic fertilizer appealing, others prefer the higher nutrient concentration in synthetic options. As long as you follow the product instructions, your tree will be happy either way.
Urea-Free Fertilizers
For growers who decide to use synthetic fertilizer, we recommend avoiding products that contain urea, a synthetic chemical widely used in fertilizers to replenish nitrogen. Because of its extremely high nitrogen levels, urea can be detrimental to delicate bonsai trees growing in limited soil.
Our Foolproof Gentle Liquid Fertilizer Method
One way to eliminate guesswork is to apply a gentle fertilizer every time you water your tree. We recommend.
When Should I Fertilize My Bonsai Tree?
Regular feeding is important for a healthy bonsai tree, but the frequency will change with the season. Generally, trees should be fertilized from early spring to autumn, with some species requiring intermittent feedings during non-growing months.
Fertilization Schedule for Different Tree Types
- Tropical and subtropical: These trees should be fertilized weekly during the growing season. They will grow year-round and should be fed monthly from fall to spring.
- Deciduous bonsai: These trees should be fertilized weekly during the growing season. Once their leaves fall, fertilization should stop as the tree has gone dormant.
- Conifers: These trees should also be fertilized weekly during the growing season. During the winter months, reduce the feeding schedule to once or twice a month as they do not go fully dormant and will continue to use nutrients.
An easy way to balance feeding and watering schedules is to add a gentle 3-3-3 fertilizer to your watering can before each use. Since you will also adjust your watering schedule with the seasons, this ensures your tree receives a proper dose of nutrients year-round.
When shouldn’t I fertilize my bonsai?
Never fertilize a tree that’s under stress. A stressed tree is one that is sick, newly repotted, or in need of watering (always water your tree before feeding). If repotting, wait at least a month for your tree to re-establish before reintroducing fertilizer.
Can I overfeed my bonsai?
Yes! That’s why it’s important to understand the basic components of bonsai tree fertilizer. Over-fertilization can harm your tree’s roots and present visibly on other parts of your tree. Symptoms of overfeeding include:
- Yellowing or dying foliage
- A crusty layer of fertilizer on topsoil
- Slow growth or leaves that drop early
If you suspect you’ve overfed your bonsai, remove any visible fertilizer and flush your plant and roots with water. Trim any damaged foliage and wait at least a month to resume feeding.
Bonsai Tree Fertilization: A Beginner’s Checklist
- Step 1: Read the directions. First and foremost, always follow the instructions that accompany a new bonsai tree.
- Step 2: Choose your bonsai tree fertilizer type. Use the guide above to select an approach that works for you. We recommend a gentle liquid solution for use with every watering. Buy liquid urea-free fertilizer online.
- Step 3: Create a feeding schedule. Use the guide above to determine a schedule based on your tree type and growing season.
- Step 4: Monitor your plant. Keep an eye out for signs of over- or under-fertilization and note what your tree responds well to. Log your observations and modify as needed.
- Step 5: Be consistent! When you’ve found an approach your plant responds well to, be sure to stick to it.

No Downtown Inglewood stop, doesn’t connect to Green Line, that’s now consider the C Line, What the H is going on in City hall. Inglewood announced back in 2018 that they were creating a Monorail-like system that would runs 1.6 miles, from Market Street/Florence station to Sofi Stadium with only one other stop which is in front of the Forum. It won’t even connect with the anticipated Clippers Intuit Dome, major fail Inglewood, major fail. First off, this should have been constructed as the Sofi Stadium was being built. Have you been to a Rams/Chargers game, are trying to travel thru Inglewood on a Game Night, yea don’t do that. Mayor Butts has secured $380 million for the project but is relying on the infrastructure bill to provide sufficient funding for that project that is exceeding $1 billion. But why no stop at Manchester and Market? Century and Prairie?
While construction was originally anticipated to occur over a 45-month period between 2022 and 2026, the revised project is expected to be built over a period of 46 months between January 2024 and November 2027.
Ground Breaking for Inglewood People Mover pushed back to 2024Unlocking the Value of College Real Estate By: Elizabeth P. Levin | Grace D. Winters July 27, 2020 – Inside Higher Ed Manatt Real Estate partner Grace Winters and associate Elizabeth Levin authored an article for Inside Higher Ed on the significant financial challenges the COVID-19 pandemic has created for many higher education institutions, and how these institutions can consider monetizing the institution’s real estate assets. In the article, the authors note that the physical campuses of colleges and universities may help these institutions absorb the new costs associated with building virtual campuses, saying, “administrators may be able to turn to creative real estate ownership structures, common in the commercial real estate world, to create an infusion of cash for the institution without selling a cherished piece of the campus to an unknown developer to turn into an office park.” Read the article here.There's no getting around it: for most of us, the desire for a flat stomach is real, and many exercisers crank up their tummy exercises - cue sit-ups galore - in a bid to achieve a toned torso.
But that plan isn't always the most effective. When it comes to the best stomach exercises for building a strong, stable core - the type of middle to power up the rest of your workouts and daily life - forget crunches.
You need to dig deeper, in motivation and muscle, to achieve a sculpted, flat stomach.
"The core isn’t one muscle; it’s a relationship between a number of muscles that cover your whole trunk, connecting your hips, spine, neck and shoulders," says performance coach Brett Klika. "The rectus abdominis, or 'six-pack' muscles, are only part of it."
It means many of those super-targeted ab exercises leave much of your core out of the picture – and neglecting it can in fact slow your progress.
Obviously, it pays to look beyond the aesthetic when boosting core strength, as it's crucial in the everyday health and mobility of your body. "Some of the strongest people in the world don’t have six-packs, but they can lift a lot or perform tremendous feats of athleticism," says Klika.
A strong core is a major factor in staying free from injury – particularly in the hips and knees, says Michelle Arent, director of training and conditioning at Rutgers Center for Health and Human Performance in the US.
With that in mind, let us school you in the best stomach exercises you can do from the comfort of your own home.
Option one: 10 Stomach exercises to do as a workout
Do: Repeat the circuit 3 to 5 rounds, dependent on desired outcome (and energy levels).
1. Commando Plank
Do: 60 seconds
a. Begin in a high plank with your core engaged and your feet hip-width apart. Hold for 30 seconds. Keep your spine neutral.
b. Keeping your core engaged, lower your left forearm on to the floor, then your right so you’re in a forearm plank. With your back flat, push through each arm to return to a high plank. Repeat for 15 seconds, finishing in a high plank. Struggling? Just think of those abs.
2. Downward Facing Dog
Do: 10-second hold
a. From a high plank, hinge at the waist to push your weight back through your heels until you arrive in a downward-facing dog: legs straight and arms outstretched in front of you, hands shoulder-width apart.
b. Hold for 10 seconds, pushing your hips back over your heels to feel the stretch in your hamstrings and the backs of your arms. Return to a high plank and repeat five times.
3. Flutter Kicks
Do: 3 20-second reps
a. Begin lying flat on your back on a mat, palms face-down underneath your glutes. Core engaged, raise both your legs in a straight line until they’re hovering above the floor.
b. Keeping your abs braced and legs straight, rapidly kick your legs – right and left alternately – up and down, stopping just above the floor each time. Make sure that your lower back doesn’t lift off the floor at any point.
4. Cross Crunch
Do: 10 reps per side
a. Lie with your left hand behind your head and your right arm outstretched at a 90° angle to your body, right palm facing down. Engaging your core, raise your right knee and crunch over to your right side until your left elbow touches your right knee.
b. Reverse the movement until you return to the start. Done your reps? Switch sides and repeat, crunching as hard as you can.
5. Russian Twist
Do: 20 reps, using a 5kg weight (or heavy books)..
6. Partial Sit-Up
Do: 40 reps
a. Lie on your back, knees bent and feet tucked under a weight (or get your PT boyfriend to stand on them), stretching your arms out in front.
b. Using your core to lift you, reach for your knees with a short, swift movement – lifting only your head, shoulders and upper back off the floor. Reverse and repeat, feeling the burn in your upper abs.
7. Swiss Ball Press-Up and Knee Tuck
Do: 20 reps
a. Begin in a high plank position with your feet placed on top of a Swiss ball. Bracing your core for stability, lower into a press-up and come back up – pausing at the top of the movement.
b. Engage your abs and keep your feet on the ball, draw your knees in towards your chest, pause and then reverse to your starting position. That’s one rep – keep going.
8. Upward Back Bend
Do: 10-second hold
a. Begin lying face- down on your mat. With palms on the floor by your shoulders, keep your elbows tucked into the sides of your body and raise your chest off the floor by pushing into the ground with both hands.
b. Drawing your navel towards your spine to protect your lower back, bend your upper body up and back as far as is comfortable – tilting your head and chest upward at the top of the movement. Hold for five breaths and release.
9. Stability Ball Pass
Do: 10 reps
a. Begin lying on your back, arms stretched out above your head, holding a Swiss ball in between your hands. Squeezing your abs, lift your upper body and raise your legs until you’re able to pass the ball from your hands to your feet at the top of the movement.
b. Squeezing either side of the ball with your feet, simultaneously lower your legs and upper body to the floor. Pause at the bottom, then reverse the move, passing the ball back to your hands.
10. Side Plank Dips
Do: 60 seconds each side
a. Lie on the floor on your left side, with your left elbow resting on the ground and right leg stacked on top of the left. Squeezing your core, thrust your right side upwards into a side plank, raising your right arm above your head.
b. Dip your left hip down to the floor, then raise it back to a side plank position. Repeat as many times as you can in 30 seconds. Now switch sides. Hurts, doesn’t it?
Option two: 3 Tummy exercises to do as a finisher
These staple exercises are the most effective and efficient way to hit your core muscles. Incorporate farmer carries and deadlifts into your strength workouts twice a week and do bird dogs every day.
[Tip: When you're confident in the latter - and your form is spot on - hold a light weight in the raised arm.]
1. Farmer Carry
Do: 3-4 sets of 4 reps
a. Hold a dumbbell in each hand and stand with your feet together and shoulders back.
b. Staying tall through the spine and keeping your core engaged, take 10 steps forward, turn around and take10 steps back. That’s one rep.
Need home weights?
2. Deadlift
Do: 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps
a. Stand with your feet hip-width apart and place a dumbbell in front of each foot. Hinge at the hips, keeping your back flat and neck neutral, until you can pick up the weights.
b. Drive through your heels and brace your core to stand, lifting the weights and squeezing your glutes at the top.Then slowly lower the weights back down to complete the rep.
3. Bird dog
Do: 3-4 sets of 10-15 reps.

There is no finalA bi-partisan coalition of 20 Alabama House lawmakers, including Republican House Speaker Mac McCutcheon, have co-sponsored a bill to legalize and regulate medical cannabis. Republican State Rep. Mike Ball introduced the bill, HB 243, on Wednesday. But Ball, who is a former agent with the Alabama Bureau of Investigation, also wants lawmakers to re-up a pair of laws authorizing cannabidiol research and permitting patients with severe seizure disorders to access certain medical cannabis products.
Politician Behind CBD Laws Proposes Bill to Legalize, Regulate Medical Cannabis Industry
In 2014, Alabama took its first steps toward the broader legalization of medical cannabis by passing Carly’s Law. Carly’s Law, which Rep. Ball sponsored, authorized a University of Alabama, Birmingham study on the use of cannabidiol (CBD) oil as a treatment for seizures. “The research is paying off,” Ball said. The UAB study focused exclusively on conducting clinical trials on children suffering from debilitating seizures. So while Carly’s Law did not include any wider legalization of CBD oil or cannabis, it did provide children participating in the study with access to non-psychoactive CBD oil.
In 2016, after some failed attempts to legalize medical cannabis the previous year, Alabama passed Leni’s Law. Leni’s Law decriminalized.Every industry evolves with time. Business is no longer conducted the way it used to be a few decades ago. Your business needed to have a physical existence in the form of an office or store. Now all you need to do is consider yourself a company and, if you know what you are doing, start offering a product or service. This change has been brought by technology in the form of digital marketing.
Marketing is one of the oldest professions and has always gone side by side with every business. Almost every company spends the biggest portion of its budget on marketing. It, no doubt, takes a lot of resources, but this is what brings customers and keeps the business running. Digital marketing is a branch of marketing that uses the internet to achieve the same goals. Every businessman should know how he can utilize digital marketing to his benefit to help him succeed faster.
Helps You Attract Online Customers
Through digital marketing, you are able to build an online branch of your business. It initially includes creating a website and some social media pages. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is used to bring traffic to the website, and Social Media Optimization focuses on increasing following and engaging your prospects on social sites. You can “click for more” information on social media marketing and its benefits. You are able to attract prospects and convert them into customers using digital marketing.
Easy Customer Service and Engagement
Providing customer service was an expensive and challenging job in the past. Now you can do it online through a blog and social media pages. Right customer service ensures that they keep returning to you, and it gives you an edge over your competitors. It keeps you connected to them. So if they have any issue or complaint, you get to learn about it right away and solve it before it becomes a problem.
You Learn About Your Prospects
Twenty-first-century businesses run on data. They gather a lot of data, analyze it, and make a decision based on the information they extract. The most meaningful data you can get is about your prospects. If you don’t know your audience, you can’t connect to them. You should know things like their interests and buying power to sell your product or service effectively. Digital marketing helps you learn everything you need to know about your prospects to run effective campaigns.
Best Way to Increase Brand Awareness
Brands have it easy. Most of their customers choose brands because they have heard their names in good terms. You also need to do the same. It takes time to build a reliable and trustworthy image, but you need to get recognition first. You have to let the world know that your business exists. This goal is achieved through increasing brand awareness, and there couldn’t be a better way than digital marketing for it. You can run a search engine and social media advertisement campaign to reach your target audience within minutes.Design experience gastronomy/hotel
Either as an “extended living room” or to gain new impressions, gastronomy and hotels certainly serve as places to relax during our daily routines. Places where we can either rest or gather new and exciting experiences.
Atmospherically, the interior design of the rooms and venues plays an essential role in the experience of not only the guests, but also the staff.
Therefore, anyone who wants to leave their guests with a lasting impression can have his restaurant or hotel designed by MasterPlan A, via uniquely drafted wallpaper designs, astonishing colour concepts, and captivatingly beautiful interior.
We are looking forward to turning your venue into the new local secret of your area!in: Civil Society
Video From Partos Innovation Festival – Shifting Power: (Net)Work in Progress
On the 8th October, Partos organized its annual Innovation Festival. A key panel was on “Shifting Power: (Net)work in progress.” This panel was organized against the background that there is a growing understanding across the sector that in order to build genuine and effective civil society partnerships, (aid) systems change is fundamental. Therefore, new collaboration platforms have been created to link actors of change and connect different systems change and shifting power initiatives.

Yes, backward. The hinges were on the wrong side and the handle was on the other, equally wrong, side. DH had to send them away with instructions to reverse the door and bring back a new one. Lord knows how long this will take...
Yesterday I worked from 5 p.m. to midnight working on a "deck." A deck, for the uninitiated, is Big Corporation-speak for a Powerpoint presentation full of charts and commentary. I had to finish said deck by end of day so that it could be e-mailed out to LA in time for copies to be made for a meeting taking place on Wednesday.
I felt pretty good about it by the time it was done but exhausted. I am way too old for this kind of thing. "Why," you may ask, "were you working on it at the last minute?" I have an easy answer for that. Because it is mentally impossible for me to focus on any big project until I absolutely, positively, have to get it done. If there is even a day to spare, it is too much. I know I have "a whole day" to work on it. So I don't.
This is how I have always functioned and I've managed to make it to 53 without becoming a colossal failure, so it is unlikely I am ever going to change.
I spent my high school years ensconced in my little den typing up lab reports and research papers on my old manual typewriter at 2 a.m.
I spent my college years during the last week of the whole semester, pulling all-nighters and pounding out English papers directly onto the typewriter from my notes.
I even had devised a clever color-coding system for organizing my papers. I took the scribbly notes that I had taken when I did whatever research I had managed to do (how on earth did anyone do research before the Internet???) and I'd circle various sections of notes in different colors which signified whether it was the beginning, the middle, or the end, or if I was feeling more adventurous, different colors pertaining to different topics. It was my way of doing an outline, which of course was way too much planning for me.
Of course now it's all I can do to read my own writing, so when I take notes for the neighborhood association meetings or the park conservancy, or the Historic District Review Board (I'm on that too, did I mention that?) I take my laptop computer with me and take notes that way. Not only can I read them afterward but they're already typed up.
When I was cleaning out our old house, I found a lot of my notebooks from high school and college, and was amazed at how large, loopy and flow-y my handwriting was. You could actually read it. Years of typing into computers have totally atrophied my handwriting abilities. Now I make these illegible scribbles that are impossible to decipher even five minutes later.
Speaking of our old house, my mother has reported that the man from her church whom we had been working with to clean out the house had gone over there and finally removed the rest of the detritus that was strewn about, and gotten rid of any remaining unwanted furniture. He had even managed to sell my father's piano for $400, which he applied to the cost of the cleanout, bringing it down to a very manageable figure. Bless him, I never could have finished cleaning the place out myself.
I feel a little sad that my father's piano is going to strangers. I had hoped a friend would take it so I could visit it occasionally. We have our own piano and neither of us actually play it anyway so it didn't make sense for me to take it. But the piano always reminds me of my father since every night when I was growing up, after the news and the Johnny Carson monologue were over, he would sit down for about 15 minutes and just ramble through old songs he knew. He was an excellent pianist, but despite his early training in classical music, he really preferred to play old pop songs like "My Funny Valentine," "It Had to Be You," "My Restless Heart," or anything by Noel Coward. I hope the piano will find a good home and someone to appreciate it.
Now our last step is to turn the keys over to the bank and be done with it. It only took us 5 months to clear it out! A friend of mine at work's father passed away in April and somehow she and her sisters managed to clear out the entire house and sell it by June. I don't know they managed that but of course having 3 siblings helping probably made a difference. Large families do have their advantages, I guess. But I remind myself, I had my own room the whole time I grew up, so being raised as an only child also has its perks!

I'm just the same. I find the more time I have to do something the less I do. In my working life I always worked more efficiently under pressure. It must have been a wrench to say goodbye to your fathers piano but good to know that the music will continue even if with anothers hands. Take care and enjoy your memories

Yet another teaching tool for Saxon! This series of DVDs is done specifically for Saxon math. Taught by Art Reed, a former curriculum advisor in the home school division of Saxon Publishers, these DVDs teach concepts in an interesting classroom-type setting. Students view Mr. Reeds lessons Monday through Thursday, and then take their test on Friday.
Mr. Reed doesnt go through the actual problems found in the texts, but if you have a student who just needs a thorough explanation of each lesson, these DVDs work. You can tell by the length of some of the lessons that the explanations are a little more detailed than other supplemental teaching aids. I enjoyed watching the lessons with Mr. Reeds relaxed presentation, as he encourages and reassures the students that math doesnt have to be hard.
Each level of the series begins with a short introduction which explains placement and the Saxon methodology. There is a session for every lesson found in the Saxon textbook, and students will need to read the information found in the text before watching the video. Everything Mr. Reed presents in his sessions comes from the lesson in the text, and he also mentions alternative methods along with interesting comments. Lessons range in length from 5 to 25 minutes depending on the concept. He offers step-by-step instruction of the daily concept with samples for clarification. Mr. Reeds explanations are simple and make sense as he draws on a whiteboard and gives pertinent illustrations. This series is a good alternative for the student who responds better to a person making the presentation as opposed to just reading about it. ~ Donna

“’either way’ is a song about perseverance and hope,” Arden says. “No matter what happens, good or bad, one thing you can be sure of is the sun rising the next day. I love thinking of things this way because it makes it feel like we are all alright. Nobody really knows what they’re doing in this life, we are all trying our best.”

What is FLAC? My name is Olivia Wilson. I am 28 year old.The Patriot Post® · Bloomberg's Attack on Man Who Stopped Church Attack
Loyal Patriot Post readers are familiar with the heroism of Jack Wilson, recently honored by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott for taking down a murderous psychopath in the West Freeway Church of Christ last month. Richard White, an armed member of the church’s security team, and church member Tony Wallace were killed, but Wilson’s quick response and accurate aim ended the would-be mass killer’s rampage after six seconds.
Yet Democrat presidential hopeful Michael Bloomberg, a staunch anti-gun activist with an armed security detail, criticized Wilson, saying that Wilson shouldn’t have been armed.
This is despite the fact that the caught-on-video incident in that church was held to only six seconds due to Wilson. Contrast this to the Naval Air Station Pensacola terrorist who had as long as 10 minutes — a window of opportunity 99 times longer.
Why is that? Because Bloomberg’s preferred “gun-free zone” policy was in place at NAS Pensacola per U.S. Navy regulations. While the death toll was lower there, we have seen higher death tolls in other “gun-free zones” like Parkland and Sandy Hook.
We have also seen this pattern after those horrific events. Bloomberg and his well-funded gun-grabbing organization demanded bans on the AR-15 and other modern, multi-purpose semiautomatic firearms. This is despite the fact that such bans do nothing to prevent those atrocities. In fact, there is a strong case to be made that Bloomberg’s preferred policies actually make these attacks worse.
That truth, as well as support for the Second Amendment and a determination to ensure that millions of law-abiding Americans are not punished for crimes and acts of madness they did not commit, lead Patriots to oppose those bans. For fighting such injustices, they’re called all sorts of names. “White nationalists” was the Leftmedia smear from prior to Monday’s march on Richmond. Other slurs include “child killers” and “domestic terrorists.”
Elizabeth Warren and other Democrats complain that gun control has failed due to “corrupt lawmakers” and the NRA, on whom Warren at least wants to sic the IRS. Incidentally, Warren also declared opposition to concealed carry, the very policy that halted the West Freeway Church of Christ shooting in only six seconds.
It wasn’t the only case, either. As we have noted over the years, the immediate introduction of armed resistance prevented or mitigated other tragedies in St. Cloud, Minnesota; Clackamas, Oregon; and Garland, Texas, among others.
In the face of this evidence, we cannot help but marvel that Bloomberg and Warren dismiss Jack Wilson. Why do they want to create more helpless victims? Because they are would-be tyrants bent on gathering power rather than defending God-given rights.
Update: Wilson blasted Bloomberg over his mindless criticism, saying, “Had we operated by his standards or his wishes, the carnage would have been significantly greater because the individual still had, after the shooting, still had seven live rounds in his gun and three more in his pocket. Even though the police department did arrive in roughly two minutes from the time the first call went in, by that time, you know, the carnage would have been much, much worse.”Gender equality policies, nursing professionalization, and the nursing workforce: A cross-sectional, time-series analysis of 22 countries, 2000-2015

Resum
Background: Nursing professionalization has substantial benefits for patients, health care systems, and the nursing workforce. Currently, however, there is limited understanding of the macro-level factors, such as policies and other country-level determinants, influencing both the professionalization process and the supply of nursing human resources. Objectives: Given the significance of gender to the development of nursing, a majority-female occupation, the purpose of this analysis was to investigate the relationship between gender regimes and gender equality policies, as macro-level determinants, and nursing professionalization indicators, in this case the regulated nurse and nurse graduate ratios. Design: This cross-sectional, time-series analysis covered 16 years, from 2000 to 2015, and included 22 high-income countries, members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. We divided countries into three clusters, using the gender policy model developed by Korpi, as proxy for gender regimes. The countries were grouped as follows: (a) Traditional family ¿ Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain; (b) Market-oriented ¿ Australia, Canada, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the United States; and (c) Earner-carer ¿ Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden. Methods: We used fixed-effects linear regression models and ran Prais-Winsten regressions with panel-corrected standard errors, including a first-order autocorrelation correction to examine the effect of gender equality policies on nursing professionalization indicators. Given the existence of missing observations, we devised and implemented a multiple imputation strategy, with the help of the Amelia II program. We gathered our data from open access secondary sources. Results: Both the regulated nurse and nurse graduate ratios had averages that differed across gender regimes, being the highest in Earner-carer regimes and the lowest in Traditional family ones, with the exception of the nurse graduate ratio, which was the highest in Market-oriented countries. In addition, we identified a number of indicators of gender equality policy in education, the labour market, and politics that are predictive of the regulated nurse and nurse graduate ratios. Conclusion: This study's findings could add to existing upstream advocacy efforts to strengthen nursing and the nursing workforce through healthy public policy. Given that the study consists of an international comparative analysis of nursing, it should be relevant to both national and global nursing communities.

Native American students from the Havasupai tribe in Arizona have brought a lawsuit against the federal government for failing to provide necessary education support, the Associated Press reported yesterday.
“The U.S. government has dismally failed” in its responsibilities to Native students, according to the lawsuit, filed Thursday with support from the Native American Disability Law Center. The suit demands that the government improve basic general education, special education, wellness and mental health support for students, and inclusion of Native communities in school decision-making. Only an estimated 20 percent of Havasupai Elementary School students end up graduating from high school, according to the complaint, which connects those students to a nationwide crisis for Native communities.
Havasupai Elementary is controlled by the federal Bureau of Indian Education, which oversees 183 schools across 23 states.TUAS POWER SUPPLY'S STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR CUSTOMER PORTAL (CUSCARE)

A Federal High Court, sitting in Jos, in the central Nigerian state of Plateau, on Wednesday adjourned hearing till 23 October, in a case of contempt of court filed against immediate past Chairman of Nigeria Football Association (NFA), Aminu Maigari.
Maigari and three others were dragged to court for flouting the orders of the court.
Yahaya Adamu, a football stakeholder and three others on Sept. 19 obtained an interim injunction retraining Maigari, the NFA, and State Football Associations from conducting fresh election to replace the executive led by Mr Chris Giwa.
The plaintiffs through their counsel at the hearing on Wednesday in Jos, sought for an order of court to jail Maigari for flouting that order.
The judge, Justice Ambrose Allagoa, however, adjourned further hearing to allow the plaintiffs’ counsel to personally serve the defendants with the contempt of court order.
Allagoa in adjourning the matter said that the court could not grant the prayer of the plaintiffs’ counsel to commit the defendants to prison in their absence.
He said that the court had no proof that they were personally served with the court processes as was contained in the order.
The plaintiffs’ counsel, Mr Habila Ardzard had argued that the act of the Magari-led faction in conducting a fresh election on Sept. 30 which produced one Amaju Pinnick as alternate NFA chairma contravened the court order of Aug. 29.
The plaintiffs’ counsel prayed the court to commit the defendants to prison for disobeying that court order.
He attributed their inability to appear in court for the hearing on Wednesday as a sign of belligerence, “they elevated themselves above the order of this honourable court.
“I urge my Lord to commit the defendants to prison or in the alternative, issue a warrant of arrest, but we are more inclined to their committal to prison.’’
According to Ardzard, they were duly served through substituted means by pasting at the gate of the NFA headquarters in Abuja in the case of the first and second defendants.
“In the case of third defendant, he was personally served through the Secretary, Plateau Football Association (PFA), Yakubu Dalyop for the PFA and the other 36 Football Associations, including FCT “he said.
However, counsel to Magari and the NFA, Mr Damon Dashen, said that he only put up an appearance in court to protest that his clients had not been served with the contempt of court order.
He said that there was no provision on the form 48 and 49 for substituted means of service and asked for an adjournment which the court granted. (NAN)

The Offcuts 2017 calendarsare in stock! We're really excited about this. We even put out a fancy press release.
Keeping the momentum up after last year’s wildly successful first calendar, Offcuts 2017, Calgary’s finest stripped-down charity calendar, is officially off the presses and ready for purchase.
Once again the irreverant 12-month calendar is a celebration of Calgary’s restaurant and food scene, and also twelve of the fellas that infuse that scene with their winning personalities. They bravely let the clothes fall to show that they are more than just pretty faces. They also have big hearts that aren’t too proud to bare it all for a good cause.
Last year, taking inspiration from a shirtless chef calendar created in Edmonton, Knifewear and Kent of Inglewood owner Kevin Kent decided it was high time the ‘handsome’ men at the helm of Calgary’s restaurant industry should share a similar shirtless fate.
“I love that we have been able to capture an audience for this calendar and this cause,” said Kent, who was Mr. August last year, but has given up the modeling career this year. “The entire production of the calendar is donated, so we are in turn able to donate 100% of calendar sale proceeds to Brown Bagging for Calgary’s Kids. Last year that totalled $33,000!”
Once again production costs have been provided by Knifewear. Also, photographer Jeremy Fokkens donated his time and expertise to shoot all 12 months of Offcuts in unique locales around town, from the show room of J. Webb Wine Merchant to the Crossroads Farmer’s Market to a wheat field at an undisclosed location. The Offcuts models are hopeful that Calgarians will once again gift to their friends and family the Offcuts 2017 calendar this holiday season, (or possibly adorn their own office wall with it, if deemed work-apropos) knowing their $20 purchase will feed 20 hungry local school kids a healthy lunch.
“We are experiencing an enormous increase in the number of kids in need of a healthy lunch across our city,” said Tanya Koshowski, executive director of Brown Bagging for Calgary’s Kids. “The awareness and support from this incredible group of chefs and food experts will ensure that our community will continue to have the resources needed to feed and care for every child who is hungry at school.”
The coveted calendar is already available for purchase at Knifewear and Kent of Inglewood, as well as all of the fine restaurants and retailers the 12 Offcuts represent: Highwood Crossing Foods & Farm, Master Meats, Eats of Asia, J. Webb Wine Merchant, Cafe Gravity, Double Zero Pizza, Belvedere, The Silk Road Spice Merchant.
Join Offcuts for our launch party November 18th. Meet the Offcuts models (and partake in some barbeque provided by “Mr. August” Michael Allemeier): J. Webb Wine Merchant Ltd., 520 77 Avenue SE (near the Calgary Farmer’s Market), November 18, 5 p.m. to 8 p.m.Based. Some sites even promise “scientific formulas” to create perfect matches, making it sound as if the odds of finding true love are all but guaranteed. Unfortunately, though, just like that certain someone who fails to call for a follow-up date, there are indications these sites don’t come through on their promises.. Dating sites don’t use controlled studies, for example, which would be nearly impossible. These issues haven’t stopped promoters from making outlandish, unproven claims, such as the bizarre one from GenePartner, a site that says its matchmaking abilities are superior because it incorporates users’ DNA: “Now, hard science is making it easier to find true love. A new matchmaking system uses DNA to help find your dream date, and it’s redefining what it means to be compatible.”
Flawed though these sites are, many singles still view them as the best option. And while you can’t put a price on love, you can at least try to spend your money on dating sites in the smartest way possible. With prices ranging from totally free to $60 per month, how can you get the most for your money with online dating services? Some strategies:
Limit your time and your choices. You might assume that the more choices you have, the greater your chances are of finding that one ideal mate. This actually goes counter to psychological research on decision-making. Whether it’s picking a T-shirt from a range of 20 different colors, or finding an online match among thousands, “choice overload” has been proven to lead people to make worse choices. In studies, people tend to make smarter, more sensible picks when selecting from a smaller batch (6 to 10) compared to dozens or options. With a dating site, what’s likely to happen is that you’ll closely scrutinize the first few profiles that pop up in your search, but after that, your brain gets tired. You start skimming, and the search becomes somewhat random. As a result, you may ignore or skip past perfectly good choices that pop up later. To avoid this problem, limit your searches in terms of profiles and time. Each person works differently, but it’s probably unwise to scan through more than two dozen profiles in a single sitting. If you can’t recall a single thing about a profile seconds after checking it out, it’s time to take a break.
(MORE: A Mom’s Work Is Worth $113K Annually. Or Maybe About Half That)
Match up with the right site. One easy way to narrow your options is to choose your site carefully. Large dating sites with upwards of 2.5 million users (eHarmony, PlentyofFish, Match, True) promise more potential dates, but because they are so generic you may have less of a chance of finding someone who shares qualities that you value. It’s OK—good, even—to have fewer choices, so long as they’re better ones. Niche dating sites might be just the answer. If you’re highly educated and seeking a highly educated partner, Right Stuff Dating (“The Ivy League of Dating”) may be right for you. People who want to date British guys may, naturally, want to check out DateBritishGuys.com. A special breed of single might instead be drawn to FarmersOnly.com (“Because city folks just don’t get it”). For help finding and getting a feel for various dating sites, check out resources from Real Simple, OnlineDatingSites.net, ConsumerSearch, and Consumer Rankings.
Keep an open mind. Don’t assume right away that someone who misses out on a supposedly key quality (like height) should automatically be eliminated as a prospect..
(MORE: Millennials Are Biggest Suckers for Selfish Impulse Buys)
Don’t buy into the “scientific method” hype. The formulas that sites use don’t stand up to scientific scrutiny. You’re better off using a site that allows you to interact with potential partners sooner than later, particularly if you are able to meet them in person. People often form erroneous impressions from online communications. Once formed, these impressions can lead to shattered expectations when you actually come face to face. So, scary as it may seem, try to meet your online choices in person asap. The truth is that you can’t substitute a scientific formula or digital communications for the vibes you get when you actually meet someone in the flesh.
The bottom line? If you want Cupid’s arrow to strike you from the online dating cloud, don’t be sucked in by false scientific claims or millions of dating choices. Select the sites that make the most sense for you, don’t overwhelm yourself with too many options, and don’t waste your effort and money on extensive profiling. Know what you want before you log on, but allow yourself to be surprised when the seemingly not-so-perfect choice turns out to the one who rocks your world.

With the country facing record deficits and runaway spending, many different programs and policies can rightly come under scrutiny.
One such program is the billion-dollar F-35 program. A petition has recently begun to make the rounds highlighting the absurd waste contained in this program, which it calls “the poster child for what’s wrong in Washington.”
The cost alone of this program would be enough to take a second look. With a price tag of $1.5 trillion over the its lifetime, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is the most expensive weapon program in history.
But, unsurprisingly, it gets worse. The petition points out that the jets, which were conceived to fight Soviet fighter jets, are “nearly useless against the security threats of the 21st century” — and, adding insult to injury, the F-35 doesn’t even work. The development “has been plagued by design flaws, technical failures, and a host of other problems that mean even under the best circumstances, the F-35 is years away from meeting minimal operational standards.”
Congress and the Pentagon, urged along by a host of special interests and lobbyists, are pushing forward to keep buying more broken planes that will require billions of dollars in repairs before they can ever be used in combat. This type of profligate spending is absolutely unacceptable in any circumstance, particularly the current one.
It is important to keep in mind that all spending should be on the table for reduction and that big spending drivers should be considered regardless of relative value involved. However, instances like this one are stark reminders that America’s sacred cows are not so sacred. And they are also reminders of why the Coalition exists in the first place. With powerful special interests urging expansion of such flatly ridiculous uses of money, it is absolutely vital for us to place that much more pressure on elected officials to Reject the Debt — not buy more broken planes.

This post first appeared on Russia Insider
Capable of reaching speeds of 3,600 miles per hour or more, hypersonic weapons will "revolutionize military affairs in the same fashion that stealth did a generation ago and the turbojet engine did a generation before," according to a study released Tuesday by the Air Force Association’s Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies. In other words: Hypersonic weapons could very well redefine the rules of modern warfare.
Not surprisingly, the US Air Force has called for a massive investment in hypersonic weapons development. These weapons would give the US an incredible edge over any potential military foe:
The race is on. And it's very, very fast.
Once realized, the incredibly fast projectiles would allow the U.S. to strike targets deep in enemy territory, even if it were defended by anti-air systems, simply because of their speed would cut hours-long transcontinental flights down to minutes. The weapons also could lessen the threat to U.S. airmen, since piloted aircraft like fighter jets or bombers would be able to do their job faster.
But the US isn't the only country developing hypersonic weapons:
China and Russia are already investing in the technology, the report notes. Beijing has conducted at least five tests of its Wu-14 hypersonic strike vehicle in the last two years. That platform consists of launching a rocket to the upper atmosphere, then releasing a glider that reaches hypersonic speeds upon descent.
Meanwhile, Moscow plans to tests its new hypersonic weapon by 2020.
As we reported last month, Russia already has plans to.
However, the upgrades are expected to be completed until 2022.
But even with its far larger budget, the Pentagon projects a similar timeframe for its own hypersonic weapons program:
The authors [of the US Air Force study] envision an air-launched medium-range hypersonic strike weapon in the 2020s; a more-capable offensive, intelligence-gathering weapon in the 2030s; and an “eventual goal of a persistent, reusable hypersonic” aircraft in the 2040s.
Russia's ability to keep up with the US in hypersonic development could be critical to deterring future provocations by NATO and the west.
In other words, we are beginning a new, hypersonic arms.The decision has been taken as a direct result of the recent cut to interest rates by the Bank of England, to a record low of 0.25 per cent. While Zopa claims not to be “as closely tied to the interest rate as high street banks”, adjustments have nonetheless proven necessary.
The rate that Zopa delivers to its lenders is, of course, inexorably linked to the rate charged to its borrowers. And that latter rate was the first to fall, as the platform took steps to remain competitive while maintaining a “high standard of borrower”.
Zopa says that many banks have already cut rates by more than 0.25 per cent, which has led to “a surge in new lenders” for the platform. Investors have been queuing an average of 10 days to put money to work in Zopa’s Classic account over the past few weeks. Part of the reason for lowering borrower rates is to maintain the balance between borrowers and lenders on the platform, an equilibrium that Zopa calls “essential”.. But rates did not fall for all of the platform’s risk bands in July, despite the fact that a cut to the base rate was seen as a near-inevitability for the better part of the month. This simply goes to show that there is more going on behind the scenes than meets the eye, and that the end rate delivered to investors (who have exposure to multiple risk bands) is the product of a complex blend of different rates and risk categories.
Whether or not Zopa’s peers will follow suit remains to be seen..

Although 2013 didn't have a headline grabbing weather story like 2012, when Sandy pounded the area; or 2011, which was the wettest year on record; or 2010, with its record hot summer and two 20-inch snowstorms, this year set a number of records for warm low temperatures. Additionally, it had two extended periods of extreme precipitation, one wet, the other dry. Here are the ten or so most noteworthy events:
- The coldest temperature of the year, 11 degrees, occurred on Jan. 23 - the coldest reading in two years. The hottest temperature of the year occurred the afternoon of July 18 when the high reached 98 degrees. This was the same day as 2012's hottest temperature (when it hit 100).
- On Feb. 8-9 a snowstorm dumped 11.4". As much as this was, the City escaped the 20-30 inches that fell in parts of Long Island and southern New England. This was New Yrk's twelfth snowstorm of ten inches or more since 2000.
- March's coldest temperature was 27 degrees, which was the mildest minimum temperature in March since 1973, when the coldest reading was 30 degrees.
- In a little less than two months (May 8 - July 3) 19.55" of rain poured down in the City. Then in the fall there was a 60-day stretch (Sept. 23 - Nov. 20) in which less than an inch of rain fell - the third longest such streak since 1950. These two periods more or less cancelled each other out as the year ended up somewhat below average in precipitation.
- The three-day Memorial Day weekend was the second chilliest since Memorial Day became a Monday holiday in 1971. Saturday was especially chilly, with a high/low of only 54/45.
- On June 7-8 tropical storm Andrea dumped 4.77" of rain over 33 hours. This was the second earliest tropical system on record to affect the New York metro area.
- A seven-day heat wave between July 14-20 was the longest in 11 years. It has the distinction of having the warmest mean temperature of any heat wave of seven days or more. Very sultry low temperatures were responsible as there were eight days in a row between July 16-22 with morning lows of 75 degrees or warmer, another record.
- Just 0.36" of rain fell in October, making it the driest month since August 1995.
- in a 10-day period between Dec. 8-17 temperatures were eight degrees below average and 8.6" of snow fell from four snow "events".
- The temperature soared to 71 degrees on Dec. 22 - just the ninth time a 70-degree reading occurred in December. Furthermore, the day's low of 61 was the mildest low temperature in December on record. Then three days later the mercury dropped to 19 degrees, making this the area's coldest Christmas Day since 2000.The impact of technology in SMEs is self-evident. Research demonstrates that receiving imperative technologies is a standout among the most critical perspective to forward business alongside ease, high-speed internet with sensible advanced smartphones, tablets, and other associated gadgets has changed the manner in which enterprises work together.
Most of the SMEs, usually unaware of the latest technological opportunities. Only 2% of them utilize digital technologies for their business growth. So it’s a big loss of opportunity for SMEs in today’s era.
Challenges faced by SMEs in adopting the latest technologies
The key business objectives of any SME incorporate enhanced revenue development, expanding worker efficiency, and procuring more clients, which can be effectively tended to by innovation. Fortunately, SME’s contribute a sufficiently expansive piece of worldwide business for these products and services to be appropriately reconfigured. In any case, given the gigantic number of solutions on offer, the challenge lies in choosing the correct innovation for their business needs. Recognizing business regions that can most profit by technological overhauls and afterward investigating the accessible digital and technological solutions are vital to keeping up an aggressive edge in the commercial center.
Top tech trends forming SMEs

- Artificial Intelligence: Often comprehended as a value-added CRM tool, AI is said to change the business procedure, taking into consideration upgraded digital marketing techniques, sales forecasts, and data analytics. Numerous small businesses may even now consider AI excessively complex for their necessities, yet the individuals who have connected machine learning for existing client information have found examples and patterns that they, generally, would have been neglectful of. These opportunities and productive choices have helped SMEs accomplish quicker industry-development to the detriment of the opposition who haven’t embraced AI yet.
- Augmented Reality: AR may right now appear to be a fun technology, yet it is relied upon to change small businesses in numerous businesses including realty, retail, travel, and medicine in the near future. The capacity of AR technology to coordinate with this present reality, permitting clients a perspective of enhanced conceivable outcomes progressively is the thing that makes this solution alluring with undiscovered potential as demonstrated by smart businesses that have executed AR technology and attracted new clients.
- Cashless Payment Systems: Easy installments from clients is the main thrust towards a cashless society. The future of small businesses depends on receiving mobile payment tech advancements, for example, mobile wallets, in-applications, and person to person (P2P) payment choices. Not exclusively do ceaseless security updates of online payment technologies hold validity, however, they likewise help to improve different business forms and the general consumer loyalty for SMEs.
- Ongoing moves to Mobile-based Commerce: The exponential development of smartphone users makes having an outstanding on the web nearness basic for private ventures. As an ever-increasing number of purchasers resort to their telephone for communication and shopping, making an experiential connective stage for clients is basic. A plan of action that incorporates a dynamic web application with integrative tools, for example, GPS-related marketing, chatbots, and live stream recordings will inevitably prompt such organizations outpacing the opposition.
- Block chain Technology: Essentially an electronic letter, this technology could be the truly necessary response to the special needs and difficulties of private companies. Empowering the maximum transaction security and privacy without including a third party for approval, it gives the additionally preferred standpoint of cost reserve funds. By tolerating digital mode cash payments (digital currency), SMEs is managed more prominent speed and straightforwardness in different procedures.
A large number of these tech trends are yet to become mainstream for SMEs, however, research is embracing one of these trends makes obvious results by raising representative and client commitment, causing a relatively prompt effect on income and development. This advanced age has been an extraordinary equalizer for business, however for small and medium enterprises to compete with associations, SME leaders should viably benefit from receiving the ‘right’ technology at the ideal time.
Awesome post! Keep up the great work! 🙂As organizations increasingly adopt multi-cloud, hybrid cloud, and edge computing, their applications track, store, and analyze sensitive user data across a wide range of environments. To ensure compliance and the privacy of individuals using applications, the data needs to be protected throughout its lifecycle.
We encrypt filesystems and storage drives, and use SSH protocols to keep data at rest and data in transit safe even if stolen, rendering it useless without cryptographic keys. However, data in use is typically unencrypted and vulnerable to attacks and exploits.
To keep applications and data protected at runtime, developers are increasingly turning to Trusted Execution Environments, often referred to as “secure enclaves”.
What are Trusted Execution Environments?
Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are CPU-encrypted isolated private enclaves inside the memory, used for protecting data in use at the hardware level.
While the sensitive data is inside an enclave, unauthorized entities cannot remove it, modify it, or add more data to it. The contents of an enclave remain invisible and inaccessible to external parties, protected against outsider and insider threats.
As a result, a TEE ensures the following:
- Data integrity
- Code integrity
- Data confidentiality
Depending on the vendor and the underlying technology, TEEs can enable additional features, such as:
- Code confidentiality – Protection of algorithms considered to be intellectual property.
- Authenticated launch – Authorization or authentication enforcement for launching verified processes only.
- Programmability – Access to TEE-programming code from the manufacturer or other secure source.
- Attestation – Measurement of origin and the current state of an enclave for tamper-proofing.
- Recoverability – Roll back to a previous secure state in case a TEE gets compromised.
These functions give developers full control over application security, protecting sensitive data and code even when the operating system, BIOS, and the application itself are compromised.
How Does a Secure Enclave Work?
To understand how TEEs work, let's look into Intel® Software Guard Extensions (SGX).
With Intel® SGX, the application data is split into its trusted and untrusted parts. The trusted parts of the code are used to run the application inside a protected enclave. The CPU denies all other access to the enclave, regardless of the privileges of the entities requesting it. Once processed, the trusted data is kept inside the TEE and the information provided to the application outside the enclave is encrypted again.
Enclaves are created and provisioned through hardware commands enabling memory page creation and addition, as well as enclave initialization, removal, or measurement.
The platform’s firmware uses its configuration settings to set up the area for the TEE. Once the extensions are enabled, the CPU reserves a section of DRAM as Processor Reserved Memory (PRM). The PRM size can be specified through the firmware tools.
Then, the CPU allocates and configures the PRM by setting a pair of model-specific registers (MSRs). Next, Enclave Page Caches (EPC) are created inside the PRM, containing metadata with base addresses, enclave size, and data security information.
Finally, the CPU creates a cryptographic hash of the enclave’s initial state and logs other states that follow. This hash is later used for attestation through cryptographic keys and hardware root of trust.
Once initialized, the enclave can host user applications.

How Secure are Trusted Execution Environments ?
To best explain how secure a TEE is, we first need to address the rings of CPU privilege.
Encryption keys were traditionally stored within the applications, at the ring 3 level. This model jeopardizes the secrets protected within the application once it is compromised.
With modern architectures, rings of privilege go beyond the kernel and the hypervisor, extending to System Management Mode (SMM) and Management Engine (ME). This allows the CPU to secure the memory a TEE uses, reducing the attack surface to the lowest layers of hardware and denying access to all but the highest levels of privilege.
Another key to the functionality and security of a TEE is attestation. Through attestation, the entire platform and the enclave are measured and validated before any data is shared.
For example, an enclave can request a local report from itself or another enclave on the same platform and use the report for data checking and verification. Similarly, a remote verifier can ask for the attestation report before requesting any sensitive data from the enclave. Once trust is established, they can share session keys and data through a secure channel invisible to external parties.
Since unencrypted secrets never leave the TEE, secure enclaves protect data from:
- Other applications on the host
- The host OS or hypervisor
- System administrators
- Service providers
Even the infrastructure owner and other entities with physical access to the hardware cannot reach the data.
Secure Enclaves in Confidential Computing
To enable safe and standardized processing of private workloads across different cloud environments, the Linux Foundation formed a community called the Confidential Computing Consortium (CCC) in 2019. Since its founding, CCC members have been working to accelerate cloud computing adoption and enable open collaboration.
Thanks to the high levels of data protection they offer, hardware-based secure enclaves are at the core of this initiative.
Through confidential computing supported by TEEs, organizations can keep everything from a single cryptographic key to entire workloads protected while their applications are being used.
Why Should You Adopt Confidential Computing?
Today, secrets extend well beyond passwords, encompassing highly confidential and irreplaceable information such as medical records or biometric data.
Confidential computing offers businesses a competitive advantage by protecting this data and preventing financial loss or reputation damage. However, there are other use cases for this evolving technology.
Multi-Party Computation
Confidential computing lets organizations process data from multiple sources without exposing its underlying code, intellectual property, or private client information to the parties they partner with. Competition or not, governmental organizations, healthcare, or research institutes can leverage this feature to collaborate and share insights for the purpose of federated learning.
Finance and Insurance
Leveraging confidential computing, financial institutions prevent fraudulent activities such as money laundering. A bank can share a suspicious account with another bank in or outside its network to audit it and minimize the chances of false positives.
Insurance companies can use a similar approach to prevent fraud. They can share a suspicious claim between one another for pattern recognition. With the sensitive data stored in an enclave and data records shared between different sources, results can be obtained without any confidential information being revealed in the process.
Conclusion
Enterprise tools for enhancing security are constantly being developed as confidential computing evolves. This stimulates the adoption, growth, and security of cloud computing, unlocking its full potential.
By offering unprecedented protection of sensitive data and code during execution, Trusted Execution Environments allow organizations to strengthen their security posture and leverage future-ready technology today.:

About Ashley:
Ashley is an amazing mom to three girls ages 9, 7 and 4 and wife to Nathan, former realtor, current adventurer. She is also a Marriage and Family Coach, where she takes families from surviving to thriving with realistic actionable steps to step out of reaction and live with intention.
Five months ago my family and I launched from Nashville, TN to travel around the United States in an RV indefinitely. We made the intentional decision to not simply wait for “one day”, but embrace the beauty of life around us and take a hands-on approach to learning (and life) with our kids.
Ashley enjoys hiking and exploring the outdoors, and am a fan of walking barefoot as much as possible. She also loves blogging for her blog Mama Says Namaste.
What I do well as a mom:
To quote Dr. Seuss, “a person’s a person no matter how small.” I make it a point to validate my child’s feelings and meet her where she is emotionally. I’m also good at teaching my child how to act respectful towards other people and practicing being love versus being right.
What I learned from another mom:
Pick your battles. Not every single situation is worth a full blown teaching moment, and sometimes letting my child wear the fairy dress in the middle of winter is worth it for the time we spend playing together vs. battling.
Lesson learned from my child:
To soak in the little moments and see things from a different point of view. When you hone in on one tiny thing – an ant, a flower – you can silence the craziness around you and focus in on the little things that mean so much – in nature, and in life!

I just came across a great OpEd piece in Kolkata’s Anadabazar Patrika in which the writer has cited a nice story. The story goes like this: when the moon voyagers led by Neil Armstrong were rehearsing their space journey in a desert of western America in 1969, they met a man who belonged to the indigenous community of that country.
The indigenous man asked them, ‘Why are you going to the Moon of all places? Moon is the abode of the God!’ The astronauts, now knowing tried to convince him about the new discovery that the human race was about break, but he wasn’t very convinced. He requested them to take a message from him to God. If they met God on the Moon, they should pass on his message to Him. They agreed and he gave them his message.
The message was very interesting; it said, ‘Dear God, please don’t believe what these people are saying about discoveries; they are actually going there to occupy land.’
I can clearly see where this man was coming from. He belonged to, whom we call the Red Indian or Native American tribes and had known and experienced how all their lands were occupied by the foreign settlers and how the settlers had hunted down both humans and other species in order to be successful in their occupation.
When I try to browse through the history of us, the humans, since the possible beginning, it is indeed mired with our history of occupation and destruction, it is our history of killing other species and razing the nature to the ground in order to ‘develop’ our living conditions. To us, it has always been our survival; and in order to do that, we destroyed anything that came on our path.
In the name of discoveries, our seafaring ‘heroes’ were not actually satisfying our thirst for going beyond our every-day world, but they were seeking for newer opportunities which truly can be translated into ‘greed’. The narratives that we have been glorifying since the invention of telling tales only reflects our greed for expansion. As the world’s fantastic resources that were unfolding before us, we thought that those resources were unending; we thought other species mustn’t share those resources; we thought all those were ours as we started calling ourselves ‘homo sapiens’ – the wise man.
In the beginning, in ancient time, as the ignorant men, we noticed that the Nature was way mightier than us and we started bowing the Nature as our God and thought that all those resources were God’s blessing for us and we – and only we – had the right to exploit them. After thousands of years of ceaseless exploitation of those resources, as wise men, we thought we should no longer remain a slaves of that Nature, we must conquer it and bring it to its knees.
With that ‘wise’ thinking, we had begun to invent mechanical and technological tools in order make the Nature submissive to us, to kill other species that didn’t surrender to our desires, wiping out civilizations that couldn’t serve our interests and that when the genocidal instincts crept into our psyche. It was at that moment, when we had turned into genocidal species, perhaps, we lost the last string that connected us to the other species and other fellow wise men. We started thinking that most humans were not wise, only a few were wise; and so, we invented methods through which the ‘most’ would serve the ‘few’.
We engaged those ‘most’ in felling trees, in filling up the rivers and waterbodies, in slicing up the hills and mountains, in grabbing lands, in erecting sky-high buildings to replace the mountains and in firing bullets against each other.
After all these thirsts for newer discoveries, after all these adventures, after all these thirsts for blood, we the ‘Human God’ saw there was nothing else to achieve as the mightiest force on earth and we became depressed. That depression, perhaps, led us to invent an international day for protecting the earth’s environment. As the God we perform all the rituals to observe the day in an utter helplessness and knowing fully well that it is possible to reverse the condition, but we aren’t capable to achieve the reversal.
Now our Godliness is failing in all corners of the earth which we had conquered with our valiant boldness; we did not spare an inch in our mad run for exploitation. Now our oceans are filled up with garbage that we create, our lands are infested with the poison that we invent, our rivers are run dry or are busy consuming the God’s excreta which too is corrupted by the food adulterated by thousands of chemicals, millions of people across are still starving, the last outposts of forests are about to disappear.
We the Human God don’t know where to go from here and we’re depressed – not because we want to go back to the Nature God, but because there’s nothing more to occupy.

Mira Levenson isn't as excited about turning 12 as she had hoped. Sure, she finally got a cell phone. But her beloved Nana Josie is dying of cancer. She ordered a casket to paint and it's delivered in the midst of Mira's birthday party. Then, she gets her period for the first time. Also on her birthday. She doesn't want to tell her mom (because she'll make a big deal out of it) and her best friend Millie (because she'll get a ton of questions). For the first time, she is keeping a secret ... and feeling more self-conscious than ever. Especially around the always glib Jidé Jackson.
To her surprise, Jidé and his best friend Ben Gbemi join her and Millie in Literature Club, a before-school group led by visiting author Pat Print. Turns out they are the only four members! In the writing group and through the assignments Pat Print gives them, Mira starts to express herself with more confidence. Through her classmates' writings, she begins to learn not just about their personal stories, but more about the world.
Parent Perspective:
I would have devoured this book in middle grade, and I did the same as an adult. Mira's narration has the perfect pitch for a young girl developing into a woman. The fears, the shifting moods, budding hormones, the push-pull of still wanting to be kid-ish and yet wanting to grow up, too.
This is Mira's story, but Nana Josie takes center stage. She is cool, stoic, strong, and a major reason I love the book. Josie offers a strong female presence and while hers is a story of death, it is refreshing in its presentation. The author neither sugar coats Nana's hospice experience, nor does she try to create "false humor" in an attempt to keep the story light. On the whole, the Levenson family is realistically portrayed. I like how Mira's parents and siblings each had space in the story to grieve in their own way for Nana Josie.
Pat Print, the other strong female role model, added a lovely non-family perspective to Mira's journey and sense of being. Last, I thought Mira's friendships with Millie and Jidé were healthy and wholesome. Millie was a life-long friend, yet you could see the relationship changing. Her budding romance with Jidé unfolds nicely. It is awkward and a bit corny at times, but that doesn't mean it isn't realistic.
Yes, the story has sad moments; yes, you will likely shed a few tears; and yes, you will be really glad you read this book. Then you'll rush to find someone to share it with!
NOTE: This book was previously called Artichoke Hearts. The name has relevance to the story and you may see reviews referencing that title. It is the same book.
Mira is a wonderful narrator who shares a story that is vivid, poignant, realistic, and hopeful.
Nana Lisa is dying of cancer. Mira has her first period and uses direct, realistic language to describe her experience. Not gory, but some young readers may not be comfortable - or ready - for this discussion.
This is a realistic, first-person story about a young girl who is navigating the impending death of her grandmother, puberty, and figuring out who she is.
This is a coming-of-age story. Although it will be pegged as a "book for girls," the story's themes of struggling to grow up, loss of beloved family members, and life changes have nothing to do with gender.

Buy for preteens who like character-driven stories and have family members who are ill.Tokyo : A three-year prison term over vote buying for former Japanese Justice Minister Katsuyuki Kawai was finalised after he withdrew his appeal.
Kawai, who held the ministerial post in former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s cabinet, is the first former Japanese cabinet member in more than 10 years to have a prison term finalised, reports Xinhua news agency.
He was charged with distributing about 28.7 million yen ($251,600) to 100 local assembly members and supporters to buy votes for his wife in the upper house election in Hiroshima prefecture two years ago.
His defense team filed an appeal after the Tokyo District Court sentenced the former minister to three years in prison this June.
However, his lawyer said Kawai withdrew the appeal on Thursday.
“The responsibility is solely on me, and I am ready to accept it all,” Kawai said in a statement released through his lawyer.
“I ask for leniency on the people who have accepted cash.”
As a result, his civil rights will be suspended, and he will not be allowed to run for election until five years after his service of the sentence.
Kawai pleaded not guilty in his first hearing in August last year, but he admitted most of the charges in March and requested a suspended sentence.
He gave up his lower house seat in April, saying he would bear the responsibility for causing public mistrust in politics.
His wife Anri Kawai was also sentenced over distributing money to local legislators in Hiroshima in January to 16 months in jail, suspended for five years.
The ruling was finalised in February.

We have moved from street hoardings to banners on websites, from celebrities in advertisements to influencers on social media, from ads on TV to ads on YouTube, and from advertorials to blogs.
We live in the digital age, where with every passing day we move closer to the digital world. And, for obvious reasons companies need to advertise their products and services where people will actually see it!
Hence, the era of digital marketing began.
A study conducted by Digital Marketing Institute in the UK, USA, and Ireland shows that a major chunk of the employees tested for the research couldn’t even qualify for an entry-level skill set in Digital Marketing.
In fact, only 8% of the subjects were able to attain enough marks to qualify for entry-level competency. That is roughly 73 people out of the 908 test subjects.
Starting to get worried?
Where does the problem lie?
The problem areas lie in the fact that the seasoned professional is starting to find it difficult to keep up with the trends and the new marketing professionals who are stepping into the industry are still learning from the age-old syllabus which mainly focuses on traditional marketing.
As a result, the employees are not trained for the various tools required for Digital Marketing, nor do they possess the skills for it.
Are employees the only problem?
Of course not!
With organizations jumping into the online business bandwagon due to various factors like cash crunch, global pandemic, planning for the future, etc.
Marketers are genuinely starting to get worried about how relevant they will remain.
Their own estimations show that businesses will be forced to become more digitally focused if they want to survive in the coming years.
And, in spite of that, there is still an alarmingly high level of unwillingness on the part of the employees to embrace the digital because they feel that their organizations do not require them to do so urgently.
They believe that their companies are unable to provide them with sufficient training support to help them develop the required skills.
Is there a Solution?

For example, you are running a sales promotion, what will your course of action be for promoting yourself? Will you write a Blog? Or will you create eye-catching images and put them on all social media platforms at your disposal?
The obvious choice is Social Media because the audience is much more active there. You can reach millions of people in one go with your campaign. And that is why the results you get will also be better and faster.

I don't know exactly when and how it happens but every time I call my horse it has very low health and stamina cores and it looks exhausted, like after a revive state. Same thing happens when I take it in and out of the stable and basically just every time it spawns in. All this happens with only one of my horses. I tried to buy a horse care package but it does nothing. The next time I call my horse or after I finish a mission, again it always is like I just revived my horse. Feeding my horse will bring it back up but then, the next time I call for it to spawn it will be like i just revived it (very low health/stamina cores). If anyone knows how to fix this bug, please share the information because I don't want to sell my golden Turkoman, it's a very expensive horse. *UPDATE* Ok guys so I found a solution about this bug and the reason it happens. The problem comes when you have 5 horses in your stable. After buying the fifth horse, one of your horses, or the one you just bought, migth get hit by the glitch-bug. Basically I don't know what triggers the glitch or what you have to do in order to enable it, but my friend, who owns 5 horses has not faced this problem, at least for now. Unfortunately in order to solve this you have to discard one of your horses (I know guys, it's hard, but you have to do it if you want your horse back). So this is the solution in order to fix this BUG. I've discarded one horse that I didn't want (the cheapest one)> made a different horse active > left the stable > returned to the stable and made the glitched horse active > left the stables and fed it. And that's it. Apparently there are reports that even when you do this and you have 4 horses, if you buy a fifth horse you will have the bug again. So I came to the coclusion that if you get hit by the BUG once, you will have this bug forever, or at least until R* does something about it. Again ... this is just a theory, I bought a fifth horse just to test this bug and i have no problems for now.

Numbers from an ICM poll for the BBC and an Ipsos poll for AOL/AP show that while more people are watching videos online than before, it isn’t detracting from regular viewing. In the US, only about 32% surveyed said they went to a computer to watch more video content than they did a year ago. Three-quarters of the British polled watched more video online than last year, though only 33% are heavy users, watching online and mobile once a week.
The promising numbers don’t betray the fact that online migration is only at the beginning stages. For the most part, both groups polled haven’t changed their ways. Regular habits have gone unchanged with the advent of other viewing options for 87% of Americans and 62% of British. TV types in the UK especially can let out a sigh of relief, since almost two-thirds of those polled said they’ve never watched content online or on their mobile and they don’t imagine they will this year.For example, questionnaires consist of a group of questions, which people respond to either aloud or put in writing. Quantitative and Qualitative Approaches. The assessment should reflect the content area in its entirety.
The scale is reliable because it consistently reports the same weight every day, but it is not valid because it adds 5lbs to your true weight. In the first one, you are hitting the target consistently, but you are missing the center of the target.
Think of the center of the target as the concept that you are trying to measure. Next criterion validity means the sum of the link relating to the test and outcomes of what the test alleges to measure.
After the study, they are asked how the pictures made them feel, and they respond that the pictures were very upsetting. Internal validity in social sciences thus answers the question whether the observed changes can be attributed to the intervention and no other possible causes Drost, In the same way, each method has to ensure validity with the purpose of gathering information researchers are truly seeking.
An example would be using a sample from a population. The experts can examine the items and decide what that specific item is intended to measure.
The second, shows hits that are randomly spread across the target. The more you are off for that person, the further you are from the center. What are some ways to improve validity. Match your assessment measure to your goals and objectives. Experiments, because they tend to be structured and controlled, are often high on internal validity.
The rows show whether you are using the same or different methods of measurement. The new measure could be correlated with a standardized measure of ability in this discipline, such as an ETS field test or the GRE subject test. Second, we can ask the student's classroom teacher to give us a rating of the student's ability based on their own classroom observation.
Moreover, these are reasons researchers study different types of validity and reliability. Moreover, the each of the instrumental tools previously discussed are important to securing the reliability of future research.
A questionnaire is a set of questions presented to respondents for answers Kothari, It refers to inferences about whether it is a reasonable to presume covariation given a particular alpha level and obtained variances Drost, Furthermore, imagine that we can measure each of these in two ways.
Finally, convergent and discriminate validity adds to construct validity by measuring the association of related i.
External validity - the results can be generalized beyond the immediate study. This measure is reliable, but no valid that is, it's consistent but wrong.
When we look at reliability and validity in this way, we see that, rather than being distinct, they actually form a continuum. Test Validity and Reliability Whenever a test or other measuring device is used as part of the data collection process, the validity and reliability of that we would not want to use a measuring device for research that was not truly measuring what we purport it to measure.
An obvious concern relates to the validity of the test against.. In this lesson, you'll look at how experiments can fail reliability and validity requirements to get an idea of the challenges behind conducting significant psychological research.
Reliability and Validity are important aspects of research in the human services field.
Without reliability and validity researchers results would be useless. This paper will define the types of reliability and validity and give examples of each. Inter-rater reliability is useful because human observers will not necessarily interpret answers the same way; raters may disagree as to how well certain responses or material demonstrate knowledge of the construct or skill being assessed.

Colour
The first thing to think about is the color, and while tradition dictates that we would usually buy blue for boys and pink for girls, feel free to break from this and go your own way!
Ultimately, you can choose any color for any gender, but if you do want to go down the traditional route, popular pink flowers include roses, tulips, carnations, lisianthus, and bouvardia, while common blues include freesia, delphinium, iris, hyacinth, and statice.
If you do want to break from tradition though, a popular choice is to go for a bright, multi-colored bouquet of tulips or roses, although the palette is entirely up to you.
Scent
The scent of flowers isn’t always that important, but it’s best to opt for something with a fairly soft and pleasant smell if they’re going to be around a newborn.
The likes of daffodils, iris, and sunflowers have softer scents, while things such as lilacs and lilies are a bit stronger, so probably not as appropriate.
Something else to bear in mind is whether anyone in the family might have any allergies to any flowers, or you could accidentally turn this beautiful moment into a disaster!
Click here for a bit more inspiration on some of the best flowers for babies.
The Message
It’s nice to include a message with your cards, but it can sometimes be hard to know exactly what to say!
Some florists will have pre-printed messages, but if you have to write your own and the words just aren’t coming, just keep it simple and encouraging!
To kill two birds with one stone, why not send your friends a Flowercard, a floral greeting card which you can personalize with your own message and delivered straight to the happy new parents.
Additional Gifts
New parents probably won’t be expecting much more than a bouquet of flowers, but if you do want to go the extra mile, there are a couple of things you could add to your flowers to make them a little more special.
For example, you could tie some balloons to the flowers, or buy the baby a small toy, or the parents some chocolates?
Check out this round-up from the Evening Standard of some of the current best newborn baby gifts.
Delivery
While most florists will allow you to have the flowers delivered straight to the recipients, if you do live close by, it’s great if you can make the effort to deliver them in person.
If you live far away or can’t make it in person, it’s always recommended that you have the flowers delivered the family home, rather than the hospital.
This way they won’t have to worry about transporting them home themselves and risk damaging them when they’ve got so much else to be worrying about!
Just make sure that the flowers are being delivered in a nice vase or container that the family will be happy with.September 14, 2021 -- Fellow radiology artificial intelligence (AI) software developers Aidoc and Subtle Medical are teaming up to provide AI-based image enhancement and triage on one platform.

Brian Armstrong, the CEO of a digital currency exchange Coinbase, in a series of tweets, expressed his opinion that Apple, by its actions in the App Store, slows down the development of cryptocurrencies, as well as global technological progress.
The biggest criticism comes from Apple's ban on earning money through the Coinbase app using cryptocurrency and accessing decentralized finance applications and websites.
By setting restrictions, Apple forces Coinbase users to take a long chain of actions (to use the app, then exit it and use the web, then return to the app), although this could have been avoided.
Apple Blocks Apps to Protect Itself from Competition, not to Support Users
Besides, he believes that imposing such restrictions appears to generate a conflict of interest. Mr. Armstrong believes that this is Apple's attempt to remove its products from the competition, and not the company's declared user protection.
Also, he claims that DeFi becomes a serious part of the financial system. Using them, people around the world can, for example, get a loan if they cannot go to a bank. Thus, Apple gets in the way of technological progress and better living conditions.
.” Brian Armstrong via Twitter
Apple Acting Like Microsoft 20 Years Ago
Moreover, he warns that Apple's actions are similar to those of its competitor, Microsoft, dated back about 20 years ago.
The company forced users to use their Internet Explorer browser, depriving them of alternatives. This ended in an antitrust proceeding.Make-up Removing Soft Flower Oil - La Canopée

The ferry suffered minor damage to its bow when it collided with Balmain Wharf on Wednesday morning, shortly after 11am.
A Harbour City Ferries spokesman said about 60 commuters were on board, travelling between Watson Bay and Pyrmont Bay, but nobody was injured.
The ferry – which will soon be renamed the May Gibbs, after the Snugglepot and Cuddlepie author – was taken to a shipyard for repairs.
The incident is currently under investigation and the crew is undergoing mandatory drug and alcohol testing, the spokesman said.
Transport Minister Andrew Constance named Ferry McFerryface in late 2017 in an ill-fated “captain’s call”.
He announced it would be renamed in January, on the same day he was accused of lying about public support for the joke title.
Ferry McFerryface was said to have won a Sydney poll to name the ferry, but freedom of information documents revealed reportedly signed off on the plan and later went ahead with naming the vessel Ferry McFerryface.
“It is not everyone’s cup of tea, but the people voted for it so we listened,” Mr Constance tweeted in November last year.
The documents revealed environmental campaigner Ian Kiernan, of Clean Up Australia, received the most votes in the poll that cost taxpayers $100,000.
Hours after the documents were released, Mr Constance announced the vessel would be renamed. He said it was branded Ferry McFerryface for the summer only.
“We always intended this vessel would be named for the kids,” Mr Constance said in a statement.
 Ferry McFerryface came from the first open call for public nominations where people could vote for any name without stringent criteria.
“In this round, Ferry McFerryface received 229 nominations and Ian Kiernan received 17,” Mr Constance said in January.
The second round of public voting included set criteria and did not include Ferry McFerryface as an option, he said.
The embattled transport minister has had a long start to the year, following repeated chaos on the Sydney Trains network. A dispute over the enterprise agreement with NSW and Sydney Trains is yet to be solved.

Bhikhu got up a bit late today. It had started drizzling early in the night and he had to make a dash into his house, gathering the untidy bedding with him. Jamana baa watched him scurry into the house “ Dikraa , dry your hair first; you may catch cold”
“No Maa it was just a drizzle” Bhikhu, never got upset his mother but he chose not to heed to his mother’s advice this time and tried to bury his head in the rolled out bed once again.
Jamana Baa, widowed recently, was a picture of quiet strength, her shaved head covered with the pallu of her red sari, her intense eyes hid her pain of losing her husband Morar too early in her life. Soon after she was married off to the handsome Morar, the label of ‘Aazad” stuck with her personality. Never to take any non-sense from anyone, not even Morar, She acquired a sort of notoriety in the quaint Kasba of Sarbhon. Why, she declined to be a simple, demure wife, at the beck and call of all elders.
She detested the call for ahinsa (nonviolent resistance) of the new breed of leader called Gandhi – “You are not going to get the freedom on a platter this way – you have to fight for your freedom” she would say.
She sang bhajans in her mellifluous voice in the early hours of the morning, grinding wheat grains.
Losing her first son at birth dealt a mortal blow. Then the second child, a girl, died of meningitis. She was distraught. Morar comforted her like a true loving husband. So the third one, Naaran, was precious. Elders advised Morar and Jamana to rename him Bhikhu, the one who was begged off from Gods, and leaning on close relatives, to buy clothes for him. A sort of fooling the Gods to say that he was not their son, “look we are not nurturing him. Please do not take him away because we are doomed to misfortune”
Jamna went about her morning chores with enthusiasm. After a quick bath, She folded her hands to the little temple of Thakorjee and then to the garlanded photo of Morar next to it.
“How are you Jamna? Count on me; I am at your service for anything you need” The aged widower Nathukaka was, as usual, was at the door. Jamna shot a nasty look at him, “nope“ and he turned away. “Shameless character “ Jamna mumbled.
Jamna got ready to face the day and face her own reflection in the palm sized mirror – it was same – the lovable symmetrical face sans the vermillion dot and the shaved head. The red pallu on the head gave the face a glow of a burning red brick. She hated the term ‘Ganga Swaroop’ (Pure like the eternally pure River the Ganga) ahead of her name. Was Ganga maiyaa a widow?
Bhikhu got up “Maa can I skip the school today?”
“No dikraa, you must not miss the school ever. You have to study well and become a big lawyer like your mama Dayaljee. Come on quick, have your bath, I will keep you hot rotla with baigan bhaatthaa on it – the way you like it”
Bhikhu knew. It was useless to disobey Maa. Her sense of discipline was unchallenged. Bhikhu got steeped into the same – He was a topper in the class.
Sport was something that he was not good at. Even here, Maa insisted that he went out to play the games that other boys played. Once Bhikhu injured his leg and his friends brought him home in a makeshift stretcher. Maa was calmness personified, nonchalantly applying the homemade paste of haldi (turmeric) and other ingredients, tied the wound up with a piece of clean cloth. “You will be all right tomorrow to go to school” She declared with a finality in her voice to the little Bhikhu wreathing in pain. ”Be strong, “ she added smiling at him.
But Bhikhu always fell short of her expectations. He was slightly built, easily getting cowed down to slightest pressure by his peers.
Was he still mourning the loss of his father? Maa would rather not give up. She was certain Bhikhu would be strong one day, just like her.

Thanksgiving is the best day of the year, and it is also when I tell you I love you, don't forget the person you want to thank.
The origin of Thanksgiving dates back to the beginning of American history. In 1620, the famous Mayflower arrived in America with 102 puritans who could not bear the persecution of religion in Britain. In the winter at the turn of 1620 and 1621, they encountered unimaginable difficulties, and many people starved to death due to food shortages. Fortunately, they got the help of the local Indians. At this time, the Indians sent the immigrants with the necessities of life, and especially, so they held a banquet and The Indians celebrated a good life together, and gradually this became a tradition until the United States made the fourth Thursday of November every year as Thanksgiving.
Thanksgiving is a holiday for people to send messages of love and warm wishes to their relatives, colleagues, superiors and subordinates, and very close people. On this day, they express their feelings by presenting Thanksgiving cards.
Although the Thanksgiving card may not be part of everyone’s tradition, there is no doubt that it can be one of the ways you can express gratitude to the important people around you. With its delivery, it can remind them and make them feel special to you on that day. Therefore, a simple Thanksgiving card message can express your love and gratitude for them. Although the greeting cards purchased in the store can convey gratitude, they always lack some warmth. At this time, you might as well try to make a handmade Thanksgiving card for the person you want to thank so that she can truly feel your love and gratitude for her.

Japanese organized expert Marie Kondo can be described as a typical representative of life-changing "organization and storage". In the editor's opinion, proper storage and organization in daily life are not only to make the room look tidy but to maintain convenient access after storage and organization are the most important.
Label organization is a bit like a library index. With it, no matter how many things you have in your home, you can quickly and easily find the items you want the first time without wasting a little time. At the same time, it also makes the originally disorderly storage clear and unambiguous. The labeling management way is the most common classification method in the organization so that the originally messy items can be sorted to keep an orderly home.
What efficient way should be used to achieve effective home organization? Let us take a look at how the following portable label printer can realize the labeling management of items in the three main areas at home.
1. Organize Kitchen Area

Kitchen spices jars are labeled after classification to facilitate better differentiation and identification. When cooking, you don't need to open each spice pot separately to judge, you can quickly identify and take it directly based on the label.
2. Organize the Refrigerator
Briefly introduce the three basic principles of refrigerator organization:
First of all, you need to prepare a storage box suitable for food storage. Of course, the style of the box can be free, but for the sake of a clean appearance, the style of the storage box can be kept as uniform as possible. Secondly, the next step is to use a portable label printer to mark these storage boxes, which can be classified and labeled according to the type of food or the length of the shelf life. This way of storage is carried out, and there is no need to look at each one. Use storage bags to find the food you need, and you don’t have to worry about eating expired food by mistake and harm your body. While maintaining your health, it also makes the internal space of the refrigerator more tidy and orderly.
3. Organize the Room Clothing
The sorting of clothes requires more thoughtful "labeling". You can divide the general area according to your needs first, use the storage box to organize the clothes of each season, and group the bottoming clothes in the daily suitcase by category. , Whether it is from the perspective of storage or daily wear, it is particularly time-saving and labor-saving. Then, use the label printer to label the storage box with specific clothing labels. If it is an opaque storage box, it is recommended to label it after classification and mark the storage box to make it easy to find. If there are more transparent storage boxes, and the storage at the bottom of the cabinet is not convenient to take, you can put the same type of items together according to the area as much as possible by attaching eye-catching and uniform labels to increase the convenience of taking.
Use the great portable label printer with appropriate storage techniques to simplify the visual effects presented in each space in the family area, and make people feel real comfort, which is the essence of storage.]]>.

]]> are on our “to-be-read” list for this spring. My TBR list is always long, but I will try to pick out a good sampling of what I’m excited about.
- Inferno by Dan Brown – I’m sure everyone will be reading this, but I must admit to being a fan of Angels and Demons and The DaVinci Code, so I am sure this will be one that I burn through in a weekend.
- Requiem by Lauren Conrad – The last book in a trilogy that I’ve been reading, one of those that I started when the first book was released and now, after two years, I will finally get to read the end of the story! I hear mixed reviews, but I can’t NOT read it.
- Clockwork Princess by Cassandra Clare – Another last book in a trilogy. Another two years spent waiting for the end of the story… Finally! This is why I keep saying I’m not starting anymore trilogies until the last book is released!
- A Step of Faith by Richard Paul Evans – This is the fourth book in The Walk series, and while I did not love the third one, I need to follow through and finish the story. Seeing a pattern here? I’m not doing this to myself anymore!
- Deeply Odd by Dean Koontz – I adore Odd Thomas! This series is not one that I mind waiting for, each book has an actual non-cliffhanger ending even though you know the journey will continue. With the quirky characters, these are must-reads for me!
- With or Without You by Domenica Ruta – My next book from my Indiespensables subscription! It should be here in a couple of weeks and I can’t wait!
- Life After Life by Kate Atkinson – I have seen a lot of pre-release press on this book and I enjoyed Started Early, Took My Dog so am looking forward to just plain old fiction, not part of a series, something different to contemplate.
- Vampires in the Lemon Grove by Karen Russell – I hear such great things about this collection of short stories that I can’t ignore it any longer! I’m hoping that they will be good short reads for those instances where I don’t have the time to get absorbed in something longer.
- Ordinary Grace by William Kent Krueger – I have the ARC of this sitting on my shelf and I am looking forward to a chance to read it – small towns, suspense, coming of age, all story elements I tend to enjoy.
- The Wonderful World of Oz by Frank L. Baum – I recently treated myself to the new collector’s edition box set of all of the Oz books. Since these are on my series-to-read list I am going to start reading them aloud to the kids next week! It’s been too many years (we are not going to talk about how many!) since I’ve read the first book in the series, and I am looking forward to sharing it with the family.What is WVUteach?

Although the sculpture was specifically a teaser for the next generation CLS, elements such as the larger front grille and three-pointed star emblem are expected to be included on all future Mercedes models.
The proportions of the new car are expected to be similar to the current model's, although it will be considerably lighter through the use of more aluminium in its construction.
Key components such as the drivetrains, suspension and electrical systems are expected to be shared with the SLS supercar.

Former Mr. USA and 15-year vegan died in his Venice, CA home Thursday.
February 1, 2016
Jim Morris, former Mr. Universe and famed bodybuilder, died in his Venice, CA home Thursday at the age of 80. The 30-year vegetarian and 15-year vegan had a career that began in 1954 and saw him earn numerous titles, including several Hall of Fame entries, Mr. International, Mr. USA, and Mr. America—the latter of which he won by the widest margin in history. Morris made headlines in 2014 by posing nude for PETA to promote the longevity-imbuing aspects of vegan eating, showing off his sculpted septuagenarian physique at the age of 77. A documentary chronicling Morris’ incredible career entitled Jim Morris: Lifelong Fitness garnered numerous film festival selections and was featured by Forks Over Knives. “I am deeply saddened to share with you all the passing of Jim Morris,” director Ryan Vance wrote in a Facebook post on the film’s page. “He will be sorely missed. Jim greatly appreciated all of your kind words about him over the past few years through this page, videos, and his website. I will soon be posting more about what Jim meant to me, feel free to do the same if you wish.”

It’s entirely possible that Howie Day is an egotistical jerk (further reading: Day, Howie, history of arrests), but it’s hard to deny the role he’s played in putting power pop back on the musical culture map. A frequent presence on the early 2000s indie rock scene, Day has recorded and released three full-length studio albums and nearly a dozen EPs. And let’s not forget the plethora of singles meant to supply a nation of car radio karaoke-singers with a continuous fount of material. What’s more, his work has been known to pop up on TV juggernauts like "Scrubs" and "Grey’s Anatomy," which makes for an undeniably ubiquitous quality to Day’s sound and style. We’re relieved he seems to have put the Bieberian antics on the back-burner for the time being and shifted focus to where it belongs: on the music. Day has been singing a different tune, and we’re more than happy to hum along.Results of the CreativeCH workshop at the INVTUR 2012 Conference (Aveiro, Portugal) on the 17th of May 2012. The workshop focused on the combination of heritage content, creative approaches and novel technologies to enable engaging and memorable cultural experiences.
Workshop highlights
Experience economy: The “experience economy” was understood to offer an inspiring and useful concept for local/regional development building on available specific assets. But such assets often need to be revitalised, adjusted to new consumer trends, and presented in new ways. Some examples related to the cultural domain included turning historic buildings into office spaces for creative companies, communicating the unique cultural heritage and regional identity to tourists, and organising festivals that mobilize and bring together regional cultural and creative actors.
The experience economy is not only about creative cultural products and services: While the focus of CreativeCH is cultural heritage the importance of other themes and assets should be noted. For example this includes high-value regional food, i.e. producing and marketing organic food from regional agricultural varieties (in the sense of “biological heritage”) and other natural and ecologically sound products (e.g. textiles, furniture, etc.). Such themes and assets can be subsumed under the specific cultural identity of a region.
There is no “one size fits all” experience economy approach: The discussion made clear that there is no “one size fits all” approach. Each region must identify its specific assets and strengths and develop a programme that allows making the most from them. Experience economy programmes can mobilize the community, strengthen local/regional businesses, and retain or bring back people. However, establishing centres of cultural and creative industries in former “industrial age” or rural areas will require sustained, long-term investment.
Tourists are seeking memorable experiences: The “experience economy” concept is particularly relevant for the tourism sector. People take more but shorter breaks while looking for special, memorable experiences rather than the typical “tourist package”. Yet, encountering in novel ways cultural history and heritage is but one option among others which, for example, include the performing arts (e.g. concerts) as well as sports events.
Important role of mobile applications also for promoting cultural heritage sites: A strong supporting trend is the rapidly increasing use of smartphones and downloads of mobile “apps” that are available for various purposes. Tourism was seen as one of the lead markets for such apps as tourists increasingly turn to up-to-data digital information on interesting places, events, shopping, transport and other information. An important role of mobile technologies for promoting cultural heritage sites through allowing tourists to interact with historical images, 3D models and site descriptions was emphasised by all presenters and confirmed in the discussion.
Novel digital applications may also contribute to heritage preservation: Augmented reality and other applications that demonstrate the change of urban and other sites can contribute to the preservation of cultural heritage by showing the loss in built and other historic environment.
Cooperation of heritage experts, creative designers and technical developers: A major challenge in the creative cooperation on novel cultural ICT applications was seen in bridging the “two worlds” of on the one hand heritage experts working in museums and archives and, on the other hand, creative designers and technical developers. The heritage experts want to ensure the authenticity of the historical material while the creative team members are eager to explore novel design and technical capacities.
The cultural heritage is in the content not in the technology used for communication: Creating new user experiences requires the right combination of creativity, content and technology to allow for new user experiences. While technical applications provide new channels and ways of communicating cultural heritage the core role of the cultural content and knowledge must be emphasised. The cultural heritage is in the content not in the technology used to mediate it. Therefore it is very important to avail of experts who are skilled in the selection, preparation, adaption and mediation of the content.
IPR/copyrights and licensing: IPR/copyrights and licensing of cultural heritage content was seen as a particularly critical issue. The managers of the presented projects and other workshop participants noted that it is often difficult receiving from heritage institutions licenses to use historic material. Sometimes the copyrights are not cleared or the institutions are concerned about making available digital images, fearing that they may be captured and used in inappropriate ways.

The workers behind Frosted Flakes, Froot Loops and Raisin Bran are striking for a better deal — for themselves and for their future co-workers.
At Kellogg cereal plants in Michigan, Tennessee, Pennsylvania and Nebraska, 1,400 workers have been on strike since Oct. 5. Among their complaints: Kellogg's proposal of a two-tier system under which workers can eventually earn the same wages as legacy workers but will never have the same health care or retirement benefits. They say Kellogg can afford good wages and benefits for everyone, given the profits it has raked in throughout the pandemic. Kellogg counters that its workers enjoy industry-leading pay and benefits and that the proposed contract maintains that.
At John Deere, which already has a two-tier retirement system in place, union workers resoundingly rejected a contract that would have further eroded retirement benefits for anyone hired after Nov. 1. More than 10,000 John Deere workers are on strike across the Midwest, demanding a better deal for all workers.
On the West Coast, nurses and other health care workers at Kaiser Permanente are also decrying a proposed two-tier system under which new hires would be paid wages significantly under current levels. They too are pointing to their employer's profits during the pandemic to argue that this is no time to shortchange workers.
Two-tier wage systems are not new. They proliferated in the 1980s and made a comeback in the Great Recession when unemployment was high. In tough times, companies say moving new hires to a lower pay scale and scaling back benefits is critical to staying afloat.
But at a time when companies are profitable and workers are in high demand, two-tier systems are a much harder sell. Workers simply see them as a union-busting tactic that will hurt not just future employees but their own livelihoods as well.
Detroit automakers used a two-tier system to gain back competitiveness
When a two-tier wage and benefit structure was adopted by Ford, General Motors and Chrysler in 2007, it was hailed by auto executives as "revolutionary" and "a major step forward."
Union workers, represented by United Auto Workers, voted to approve the change, which did not impact their wages or generous benefit packages but dramatically slashed those for new hires.
At the time, it was seen as a necessity.
"The survival of the industry was at stake," says Kristin Dziczek, senior vice president of research at the Center for Automotive Research.
But with the two-tier system came morale issues and other problems. Both the car companies and the unions said it created an unhealthy environment of two classes of workers doing the same job. Newer workers had no path to the top wages paid to veteran employees. They felt ripped off.
In 2015, Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne called it unsustainable. "We need to design a career path for people who come into this business that tells them that if they work hard they can get there," he said.
Eventually, two-tier wages were negotiated out of the contracts for production-floor workers.
Health care workers say under a two-tier system, patient care could suffer
In response to Kaiser's proposed two-tier system and other changes to wages and benefits, the unions representing more than 20,000 Kaiser employees in Southern California and Oregon are threatening to strike, though no date has yet been set.
Under Kaiser's proposal, people hired after Jan. 1, 2023, would make 26% less than current levels. The company said the change will help it "address future costs" while still ensuring that new employees are paid above-market wages on average.
But workers remain unconvinced.
"Especially after the last 18 months, it leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth," says Alaa Abou-Arab, an occupational therapist with Kaiser in Los Angeles, who works in the intensive care unit helping COVID-19 patients regain the ability to do basic tasks such as going to the bathroom.
He doesn't want to think about what it would feel like to work alongside someone making less money despite having the same job, the same amount of training and probably the same amount of student loans, he says.
Abou-Arab is afraid that lower wages will make it harder for Kaiser to hire and retain good workers and that patient care could suffer. Most Kaiser employees are also Kaiser patients, he says.
"My son was born at Kaiser Permanente. My wife delivered there. So we're all in the same boat. There's no in-between," he says.
Clarification: An earlier version of this story said that under Kellogg's proposed two-tier system, new and recent hires would earn lower wages. Under the proposal, those workers can eventually earn the same wages as veteran legacy workers but won't receive the same health care and retirement benefits.Kapha Oil is a blend of 28 carefully chosen Ayurvedic herbs that helps to ease the symptoms of Kapha imbalance such as water retention, loss

Asian Wedding Traditions Need to Be Crafted to Accommodate All of the Wedding Needs
The traditions and methods that Cookware weddings have got is something which can truly be a vision to see. It is a fact of life that every region and tradition have a unique set of customs and persuits in regards to all their weddings. If you wish to take part within an Asian wedding, then there are some things you need to know help to make it work for your wedding. A sensible way to begin is by knowing a little bit more regarding the actual customs and traditions that happen to be involved. You will not just have a distinctive wedding however you will also add a little bit of traditions to your marriage as well.
One of the things that you must do is definitely find out what many of the Asian marriage ceremony traditions entail. For instance, inside the Far East, the marriage would start out with the groom’s parents appealing the bride’s family to their home. They will present them with a bridal bouquet of flowers. From there, the bride’s spouse and children would give these people the wedding band that they would probably use very own wedding day. The family of the groom could support the ceremony of blessing the bride as well as the bridegroom. Also this is the time where the parents of both bride and the groom could throw egypt flowers into this inflatable water, which symbolizes fertility.
In Japan, the marriage is much diverse from what you would look at in other parts of Asia. In contrast to most Asian countries where the wedding ceremonies start with a great exchange of wedding wedding rings, the Japanese marriage ceremony starts much earlier each day. The bride and groom would go for the place where they would spend the previous night the wedding. Now is important as it provides them a chance to get ready. They will also do a couple of rehearsals too so that they can be ready for the big day.
In Singapore, there are zero special Oriental wedding customs in the sense that there is not a specific coming back the wedding ceremony to start and end. However , there are many customs that you have to follow. For example , the star of the event is supposed to wear a long gown that has a veil attached to it. The groom’s attire is normally simple.
It is advisable to make sure that you are choosing a location for your Asian wedding it really is a good spot for both the star of the event and the groom. There are two options below: one is a church marriage ceremony and the other is having wedding and reception reception for a inn. Both have their very own personal advantages and disadvantages, although. The cathedral wedding provides a more personal touch as you can sit down using your minister and promote your thoughts on marriage. A hotel reception allows you to simply come up for the entrance and greet your guests, after that you can go on with wedding event plans.
Other Cookware wedding customs contain giving items to the woman and groom as being a sign of appreciation. Since you can’t simply exchange gifts during the ceremony, you could provide them with something as easy as a card. This shows that you care about these people enough to consider all their happiness. Oriental wedding customs need to be looked at closely to follow all of them the same as you get married.How do you determine the convergence or divergence of #Sigma ((-1)^(n)n)/(n^2+1)# from #[1,oo)#?
2 Answers
As:

the series is convergent.
Explanation:
An alternative series:
converges if the succession
So we make the test:
As the denominator is always positive we can focus on the numerator:
which is always true, for
The we check that:
So both conditions are satisified and the series is convergent.
Another way that showing
#d/dx(x/(x^2+1))=((d/dxx)(x^2+1)-x(d/dx(x^2+1)))/(x^2+1)^2#
#color(white)(d/dx(x/(x^2+1)))=(1(x^2+1)-x(2x))/(x^2+1)^2#
#color(white)(d/dx(x/(x^2+1)))=(1-x^2)/(x^2+1)^2#
Examining the sign of the derivative, we see that the denominator is always positive. Thus the sign of the derivative as a whole is dependent on the sign of the numerator. When
A negative derivative shows a decreasing function. Thus,
Using this in conjunction with the fact that
#lim_(nrarroo)a_n=lim_(nrarroo)n/(n^2+1)=lim_(nrarroo)(1/n)/(1+1/n^2)=0/(1+0)=0#,
we can claim that

The outer movements -- the first one feather-light and the finale --ing -- were exciting, and the middle movements pointed up detail with clarity and affection. Only a very occasional blandness when the music was slow suggested the work of a young -- Harrigan is only in her middle 30s -- conductor.
Prutsman's playing in K. 450 suggested a Mozartean of real depth.
His playing was full of imaginative touches and had a flexibility that never sacrificed rhythmic strength. There was real joy and sparkle in a high-spirited finale that never sacrificed the music's momentum.
But it was Prutsman's treatment of the andante that was especially impressive. His tempos were somewhat faster than those which one customarily hears, but that made sense because they made the music breathe naturally, suggesting the concerto's incipient romanticism without a hint of the Dresden china figurine to which this piece can easily be reduced.
The concert began with Robert Macht's "Kreasi Baru," a 15-minute work in which the composer, who spent a year in Indonesia, uses 10 percussionists to open and close the work, functioning as a gamelan ensemble.
Macht, who teaches percussion at the Peabody Conservatory and who performed in his own piece, made some prefatory remarks about "Kreasi Baru" uniting "the First and Third worlds" and "the sacred and profane," and creating "a global village" by exhibiting "unity in diversity."
Such exaggerated claims can make even a liberal journalist sigh for red meat, patriarchy and a redolent Havana. But the piece proved harmless enough, suggesting nothing so much as second-rate Steve Reich or "New Age" elevator music in its repetitive rhythms and simple, predictable harmonies.Home Interior Design Styles: What is Minimalist Design?
A focus on clean lines and embracing negative space
By RaShea Drake
August 21, 2019
*We interviewed interior designers and other home professionals to create a series about interior styles and designs. When you’ve finished with minimalist, you may be interested in modern or contemporary.
A Brief History
Minimalist interior design is based on the minimalist art movement, focusing on creating harmony through symmetry and open spaces. Starting in the late 1950s, it gained popularity throughout the 1960s. It would be easy to fill our homes with more possessions given the cheap cost of goods. However, there is a growing trend to throw out the fluff and keep only what is necessary and what’s useful. A return to simplicity with a minimalist home.
The Definition of Minimalist Interior Styles
Think of a minimalist home as your private art gallery. Large open areas swathed in neutral hues with a few furnishings placed thoughtfully throughout. Each piece has its designated area to be admired, but the look isn’t cluttered. Each furnishing has room to breathe. Through thoughtful consideration of color, space, and light, minimalist living achieves a soothing atmosphere. The goal is for pieces to be functional but also complementary.
We made a graphic of the characteristics of minimalist interiors below. Feel free to save it to your Pinterest board or your device so you can easily refer back to it later.
Design:
"Minimalist interiors provide a great balance between aesthetic appeal, concealed storage, enhanced functionality and a subtle, yet peaceful, color palette that really allows the architectural elements of the space speak for themselves." – Wendy Gonzalez, Owner, Modern Ornament
“White is the color most often found in homes decorated in minimalistic style due to how it lends itself to the feel of open space. It forms the basis for the walls, floors, and furniture within the home. Colors that also work well are neutrals, light greys, and pastels. When adding a brighter color, stay with the addition of one color as an accent.” – Marty Basher, Home Design/Improvement Expert, Modular Closets
- A good rule of thumb is to keep the color scheme to three shades for a cohesive look with no distractions.
- Main colors are typically whites, neutrals, grays, or blacks.
- Accent colors are usually warmer or cooler complements of the main color.
- Wood can also count as one of your accent colors. The grain instantly adds a natural sophistication to the area, particularly if you can use the same wood in a couple of different elements.
Décor:
“Focus on three things: functional, geometric, and sparse. Minimalism is all about functional design so less is more for the minimalist.” – Mike Falahee, Owner and CEO, Marygrove Awning Co.
- Ornamentation should be kept to a minimum. A few select pieces will have a greater impact than extra pieces would.
- Fixtures and décor should fall within the same color palette as the rest of the room.
- Furnishings, storage, and textiles should all be constructed from high quality materials to ensure.
Are Minimalism, Modern, and Contemporary the Same?
While minimalism, modern, and contemporary share some characteristics between them, each is a definitive style. Contemporary blends multiple designs together, including some elements of modern and minimalist as well as traditional. However, it’s mainly defined by what’s in style at any given time. Contemporary has more flexibility in materials, palette, and décor than modern or minimalism.
Modern shares the same principle of form over function, but minimalism takes this principle further than modern does. Modern embraces more materials and even a bit more color than minimalism does. The intents between the two designs are also different. Modern’s goal is to create clean, pleasing lines and textures. Minimalism’s goal is to instill a feeling of relaxation. Minimalism does this by focusing more on plays between light and shadow, variances in texture, and a harmonized color palette.

Conclusion
By taking away visual distractions and focusing on simplicity in color and décor, minimalist interior styles promote an atmosphere of relaxation and tranquility.

Users will be required to verify accounts.
Streaming giant Netflix announced this week its intent to test a method to crack down on “password-sharing,” the practice where users from different households share access to the same Netflix account to avoid paying for additional memberships.
The company will be rolling out a test feature to a limited number of users in which they will be prompted to confirm that they are the owner of the account they are using. Users would have to respond to a text or email message to confirm their identities.
“This test is designed to help ensure that people using Netflix accounts are authorized to do so,” the company told media this week.
Netflix usage skyrocketed over the past year as hundreds of millions of people across the world were ordered to stay home in the hopes of curbing the spread of COVIDThe Main Cause of Periodontal Disease
Bacteria cause periodontal disease. Plaque is a sticky substance, full of bacteria, that forms on teeth. When plaque hardens over time, it is called calculus. Plaque and calculus provide irregular surfaces that allow these bacteria to attach easily. It is important to get Periodontal treatment if this occurs.
Periodontal disease (also referred to as periodontitis or gum disease) occurs when bacteria gets into the gumline, slowly destroying it and ultimately leading to tooth loss if left untreated. There are often warnings of periodontal disease, including reddening of the gums or bleeding from the gums when brushing your teeth. More serious symptoms include tender or swollen gums, spaces or pus between teeth and the gum line, and receding gums that make your teeth look longer.
Scaling and Root Planing
Scaling and root planing is the most common and conservative form of treatment for periodontal disease before it becomes severe. This technique allows dental professionals to clean between teeth and gums, all the way down to the roots.
Scaling and root planing remove. This is especially effective with gingivitis. With more advanced gum disease, scaling and root planing may be the first step before surgery.
The Procedure

When I first spotted this on Twitter my reaction was, “finally.”

At first glance, this seems like an odd move. Why would Google, a company that specializes in selling digital ads, include a default feature that blocks ads?
It turns out, not all ads will be blocked – just ones that provide a poor user experience. Which brings the question, what makes a bad ad? According to Google, .”
Simply explained, it appears that some ads will make it through while some won’t. Although Google did say that if a site has one bad ad, there’s a chance ads across the entire site will be blocked. This is good news, because it means sites will have to closely stick to Google’s ad standards or risk having their revenue cut.
So why would Google even get into the ad blocking business in the first place? According to a report in the Wall Street Journal, it has a lot to do with the rise in third party ad blockers. This way, Google has more control over ad blocking. The belief in the company seems to be that if “bad ads” are filtered out, perhaps users will be okay with seeing good ads (and be less likely to block them). This is good news for people who make money blogging, as ads are the lifeblood of many small sites.
The feature hasn’t been officially announced, but that should be coming soon.

. At our end we have several cost elements. A lot of effort has gone in developing the concept.
Then there are several heads under which we need to spend on a regular basis. There is infrastructure, establishment and systems; consultation with experts, cost of further explorations and research in different areas, cost of communication and travel, testing and validating products, designing and validating activities, games and projects, account management and promotion.
The pricing of a customized programme like MaxPot will always remain a tricky issue. On the one hand we are not providing a standardized service or a bundle of standardized services, on the other, the objectives and purpose of MaxPot Fellows are all different.
The fairest of all the methods would be to bill on individual basis. But here parents seem to have a problem.
They would like a clear idea of their commitment in advance. Though a situation where we could have developed some standardized rates for the various services would have given parents a clear idea of their commitment, it would have substantially raised the overall cost.
For standardization in the face of a high level of uncertainty can be done by raising the price sufficiently to cover the various options or contingencies.
Keeping the above in mind we have come to the following pricing and related policies:. Standardize as and when possible. Thus, the General Assessment and Customized Plan Development are two activities that have been standardized.
Parents of MaxPot Fellows must approve of the expenses involved before they are incurred. Thus they should always have a full say and control in the matter.
We keep our costs low by adopting appropriate organizational form and by working smart without sacrificing on the quality of services and support to members.
So please do not expect a swank office or a five star facility! Something that serves the purpose and is functional should be preferred.
Satisfaction or money back guarantee. If the parents of a MaxPot Fellow are not satisfied with the service, they can ask for a full refund within fifteen days.
It will help to improve the service if they told us the reason for their dissatisfaction. This is a one-time fee. As MaxPot is a customized programme, further charges vary with the type of services offered, mode of delivery, and other factors.

der sehr gute GedankeAccording to a San Francisco Chronicle article by Chase DiFeliciantonio published Thursday, Uber Technologies Inc. and the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) have reached an agreement regarding the company’s handling of rider sexual assault and harassment incident data. The CPUC initiated administrative proceedings against Uber after the company released a report disclosing statistical incident data, but refused to provide the commission with more information.
In the 2019 report, Uber allegedly revealed that it received nearly 6,000 reports of sexual assault and sexual harassment during 2017 and 2018. Of the 2.2 billion rides tallied for those years, 464 resulted in rape, the article said.
When a CPUC administrative law judge ordered the ride-hailing giant to give over more information concerning incident location and victim and witness contact information, Uber declined. In filings, the company reportedly contended that victims did not consent to such information sharing, and handing the information over “risked retraumatizing them along with having a chilling effect on future reports,” the article said. In turn, the CPUC levied a $59 million fine against Uber in a December 2020 decision, which the company appealed.
This week’s settlement, though not yet formally approved, requires Uber to pay a fraction of the original fine, just $150,000, DiFeliciantonio wrote. In addition, Uber will pay $5 million to the California Victim Compensation Fund and $4 million to redress physical and sexual violence in the passenger carrier industry, according to the proposed agreement. Uber must also give the CPUC data relating to past incidents, though information identifying victims will be withheld.If a family holiday is on the cards, then this lovely chalet in the Rhone Alpes with 6 bedrooms will give you space as well as comfort.

Min Aung Hlaing, the grouping’s chair Brunei said Saturday.
The 10-member bloc has been under intense international pressure to do more to force member state Myanmar to halt the violence that has left more than 1,100 civilians dead and to free scores of political figures, including ousted civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
ASEAN foreign ministers held an emergency meeting late Friday after Myanmar refused to cooperate with the bloc’s crisis envoy, Brunei Second Foreign Minister Erywan Yusof. He was appointed in August to mediate in the crisis but abruptly canceled a trip to Myanmar Erywan could not meet with people facing legal proceedings such as Suu Kyi and deposed President Win Myint or with entities that have been declared illegal, Brunei said in a statement.
Suu Kyi and other top civilian leaders were detained in the army takeover. She faces various charges that her supporters and independent analysts say are designed.
“This was a difficult but necessary decision to uphold ASEAN’s credibility given the unsatisfactory and highly limited progress” to resolve the crisis, Singapore’s foreign ministry said in a statement.

The latest round of Israeli slaughter in Gaza, along with its coverage in western mainstream media, has highlighted a glaring chasm between the facts of daily Palestinian life and the fictions Israel and its allies have fed the world.
To repeat that western media outlets are biased against Palestinians has become a truism. They have knowingly twisted truth into fiction not just by calling a colonial conquest a “conflict” or property theft “evictions”; they also get the plot wrong. There was a land without a people, the story goes, and a people without a land. These media outlets are invested in their own ignorance, having sold this fiction for decades.
This time around, though, the soup is so salty that even the cook had to admit it. Headlines citing “the misery of life under occupation” would never previously have been dreamt of in the New York Times, and yet it landed on the front page last week. Suddenly, the US newspaper of record was printing pictures of Palestinian children killed by Israeli forces on its front page.
Voices of defiance against Israeli war crimes have become common in Europe and the US, in a way we could not have imagined even a decade ago. Regular NYT columnists – not just those “guest columnists” who pop in during moments of crisis to give the newspaper an air of impartiality – are now writing on the shaking of the previously unshakable friendship between the empire and its favourite ally.
There are more balanced venues, to be sure. But importantly, media such as the BBC and the New York Times are no longer in charge of the story. They no longer establish the discourse; they deviate from it. They are invested in sustaining the course of the settler-colony. We read them not to find out what happened, but to see how they are spinning it.
David and Goliath
Indeed, there is the bloody reality that Palestinians have lived since their homeland was overrun by European Zionists, and then there is the fiction proffered by European and US media. These two diametrically opposed poles are falsely called two “narratives”; if we believe one side over another, we are just buying into a “narrative”.
In reality, Israel is a garrison state – a massive military machine, from top to bottom. Palestinians are killed, occupied and their land is robbed. Palestinians do not have an army, a navy, an air force; they are the David to the Israeli Goliath. Media such as the BBC and the New York Times side with Goliath, calling him David, and they blame David, calling him Goliath. Or, even worse, they blame both David and Goliath and call that “balance”.
In his landmark essay “Politics and the English Language” (1946), George Orwell wrote scathingly of the “ugly and inaccurate” prose that cliched and ideologically infested politics perpetrates on the English language. He famously denounced the “lifeless, imitative style” of such writings, pointing to “the political dialects to be found in pamphlets, leading articles, manifestos, white papers and the speeches of under-secretaries”.
More emphatically, he observed: “In our time, political speech and writing are largely the defence of the indefensible. Things like the continuance of British rule in India, the Russian purges and deportations, the dropping of the atom bombs on Japan….”
This was in 1946, but Orwell might as well have been writing of the BBC and the New York Times today, when it comes to their coverage of Israel-Palestine. Several years later, in his iconic novel 1984, Orwell elevated that critique into the nightmare of “Newspeak”. We now live that nightmare.
Antisemitism warnings
People who care about the fate of the Palestinians might now be very excited about the fact that the New York Times is starting to pay closer attention to the misery of those in Gaza. Along with detailed articles on the terrors the Israeli state has visited upon Palestinians, the newspaper has given ample space to Palestinian writers to share their thoughts and experiences.
Yet, at the same time, decent people such as US Senator Bernie Sanders have also come out to warn that too much criticism of Israel could translate into antisemitism, so people should “tone down” their “rhetoric”.
We should all be afraid of antisemitism, but the enduring sickness of antisemitism has nothing to do with Palestinians and their cause. Entrenched antisemitism in the US and Europe has been deliberately conflated with the Palestinian national liberation movement in order to silence those who dare to speak of the terror Israel systematically visits upon Palestinians. While this might silence the liberal opposition, it will not silence Palestinians or sidetrack them from their just cause.
Palestinians have long been fighting their own fights, writing their own stories, singing their own songs, and living their own struggles. Whether most Americans or Europeans will finally see the light and come to join them on the day of their impending victory remains to be seen.

In my June 19, 2015 edition of First Draught, I stated that Radlers were “slowly gaining popularity in Canada.” Well, it’s at the point now where I’m dubbing 2017 “The Year of the Radler”. Radlers are becoming such a hot commodity that Liquor Marts and beer vendors are having a hard time keeping them in stock. As far as I can count so far, Labatt has three radlers available in Manitoba right now, including Bud Light Radler, with possibly more to come through their Mill Street, Stanley Park or Goose Island operations.
Radlers have been available in Manitoba for as long as I can remember but I recall bypassing them completely because they were simply 50% beer/50% grapefruit juice, and I’m not someone who generally cares about grapefruit juice. Radlers will always be the beer of choice for cyclists, but it’s also the beer of choice for those who want something refreshing, light yet fruity at same time.
This week I’ve chosen three Non-Labatt Canadian craft brewed Radlers that are worth cycling to. (Please drink responsibly)
Pump House Crafty Radler - I’ve been a fan of Moncton's Pump House since back in the day when the pub-based predecessor of Farmery Brewery (Luxalune Gastropub) used to have an interesting selection of craft beers that were only available at their pub and nowhere else in Manitoba, their Blueberry Ale was always a hit in the summer time, while their Scotch Ale was a hit in the winter. Pump House recently brought out a new Radler called Crafty Radler. Crafty Radler is brewed with lager and a mixture of grapefruit and tangerine juices. Crafty Radler pours a cloudy straw beer with a hint of pulp-like sediment throughout the beer. The aroma starts out being reminiscent of 7-UP with a bit of lime and lemon then the notes of grapefruit and tangerine pop up quickly after. The taste starts off with a heavy dose of grapefruit mixed with lime and lemon but the tangerine really helps deal with the tartness of the sour fruits by adding a hint of orangey sweetness, though I wish there was a bit tangerine in there. Incredibly tasty and likely the strongest Radler of the night as it tops out at 4.7% ABV. Available at Liquor Marts in Brandon. Brandon, Minnedosa and virden for $3.49 per 473mL can. 4.5/5 Pints
Waterloo Grapefruit Radler - In my 2015 column, I reviewed Waterloo’s Lemonade Radler as I love lemonade and I wanted to see what the fuss about Radlers was at the time. In my opinion, Waterloo Brewing makes the top selling (non Labatt/Molson/Stiegl) radler in Canada, I see more people buying this beer than Bud Light Radler, but Bud Light just released their Radler days ago so things will change. Waterloo’s Grapefruit Radler pours pale, watery lemon yellow with a bit of sediment. There’s a great deal of carbonation taking place making it a bit fizzy like a soda. The aroma is full of grapefruit as it is tart yet sweet, a good deal of pepper and a hint of lemon. The taste starts out fairly sweet then the tartness of the grapefruit hits. The weird tartness of grapefruits is the main reason why I never liked grapefruits. There’s a hint of peppery spice in there as well but it’s mostly muted compared to the aroma. It’s fairly easy to drink and definitely the most tarty of what I’ve had so far, but I’m not done yet! If you’re a grapefruit fan, this Radler is obviously meant for you! Compared to some grapefruit coolers on the market, this one has a natural taste to it instead of a weird syrupy and sugary taste to it. 3.1% ABV. Available at Liquor Marts in Brandon, Dauphin, Swan River and Virden for $3.25 per 473mL can. It may also be available at the Keystone Motor Inn Beer Vendor. 4/5 Pints
Central City Red Racer Radler - Most of you who are familiar with the name “Red Racer” will immediately think of their popular India Pale Ale in the green cans. The Red Racer line from Surrey BC’s Central City Brewing is actually a wide selection of products from pilsners to pumpkin ales and.. yes, a Radler. Red Racer Radler just popped back at the MLCC two weeks back after an eight month hiatus. The Radler pours a thick and cloudy orange beer but doesn’t have any sort of sediment like the two previous beers. The aroma has notes of grapefruit, lime, lemon, a hint of pepper, and a light grassiness from the hops. The taste starts off with a bit of a Five Alive flavour to it as I’m getting lime and grapefruit popping up at the same time. It’s fairly tart and even has a light taste of crackers to it, which I haven’t seen in any other of the beers. This one is probably the smoothest of the bunch but after drinking three Radlers by myself, I wish I was sharing this with someone or if my portions were only in 4-8oz sampler sizes instead - that’s just too much grapefruit juice for one person! The grapefruit is complimented by lime in this one but it still has the tartiness and peppery bite that I experienced in the rest of the Radlers. 3.5% ABV. You can find this at Liquor Marts in Brandon and Dauphin for $2.73 per 473mL can. 4/5 Pints
Lastly, two new beer releases: With today being Cinco de Mayo, Vankleek Hill, Ontario’s Beau’s All Natural Brewing has launched their Buenos Dias Gruit Ale. If you were at the Brandon Beer Festival last month you got to try it before the rest of the province! Buenos Dias is available at Liquor Marts in Brandon and Dauphin for $5.30 per 600mL bottle.Yardmaster Garden Sheds are Manufactured from Quality Galvanized Steel, Hot Dipped Giving it 7 Layers of Protection inside and out, Assembled with Rust Free Screws its Fire Retardant Virtually Maintenance Free, Weather Resistance offering outstanding protection for your stored items with Zero Hassle & With Its Taupe finish & Anthracite trim it offers a tasteful and compact storage Solution.

Outlander has transformed former model Caitriona Balfe and actor Sam Heughan into global superstars. The pair have been praised for their joint performances as star-crossed lovers Jamie and Claire Fraser. However, many fans of the Starz series are curious about Balfe’s life away from the show and particularly her nationality.
What is Outlander star Caitriona Balfe’s nationality?
Balfe is best known for her portrayal of English woman Claire, who speaks with a stiff-upper lip.
Throughout the show, her cut-glass inflections stand out against the softer Scottish accents used by the other characters.
Despite her flawless accent, the actress is Irish and hails from the capital Dublin.
The star is adept at changing her accent to match her role.
However, Balfe did use her natural Irish accent in the Hollywood movie Money Monster in which she portrayed Diane Lester, an executive of a financial company.
She can speak Gaelic, telling The Social CTV in 2017: “I used to be fluent but now it’s very bad.”
Balfe grew up in outside Tydavnet in County Monaghan and always wanted to become an actress.
However, she fell into modelling and went on to walk runways across the world as well as serving as a Victoria’s Secret Angel for a time.
Speaking to the Irish Times in 2019, Balfe reflected on her childhood, explaining why she gravitated towards acting.
She said: .”
She added: “Let’s say being the daughter of a garda in 1980s borderland counties was not the easiest thing.”
Balfe’s role in Outlander has led to further acting opportunities including the aforementioned Money Monster, The Price of Desire and the Oscar-nominated movie Ford v Ferrari.
She even had time during off-season from Outlander to lend her voice to the Netflix series The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance.
During her career, she’s received a slew of award nominations including several Irish Film & Television Awards nods with the star winning one in 2018 for Outlander.
The star was promoted to a producer on Outlander last year, along with colleague Heughan, with the pair contributing significantly to some of most challenging episodes in season five.
Balfe and Heughan will be producers as well as joint leads on Outlander going forward, giving them the opportunity for more creative input into the series.
Along with her Outlander commitments, Balfe also has two Irish-focused projects in the works.
Despite moving away from Ireland, she remains spiritually close to her homeland.
Reflecting on her Irish projects, she said: “There’s some need for a reconnection or a going back.

The main aim of this paper is to employ the total variation (TV) inpainting model to superresolution imaging problems. We focus on the problem of reconstructing a high-resolution image from several decimated, blurred and noisy low-resolution versions of the high-resolution image. We propose a general framework for multiple shifted and multiple blurred low-resolution image frames which subsumes several well-known superresolution models. Moreover, our framework allows an arbitrary pattern of missing pixels and in particular missing frames. The proposed model combines the TV inpainting model with the framework to formulate the superresolution image reconstruction problem as an optimization problem. A distinct feature of our model is that in regions without missing pixels, the reconstruction process is regularized by TV minimization whereas in regions with missing pixels or missing frames, they are reconstructed automatically by means of TV inpainting. A fast algorithm based on fixed-point iterations and preconditioning techniques is investigated to solve the associated Euler-Lagrange equations. Experimental results are given to show that the proposed TV superresolution imaging model is effective and the proposed algorithm is efficient. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Even though the current has the usual exponential relationship to the terminal voltage, the slope at 200 mA (100 mA each, assuming they share & share alike) remains low enough that I (think I) can get away with just dialing in a voltage and leaving it at that; changes due to small temperature variations won’t cause meaningful differences in the current.
That’s easier than building an adjustable current regulator, anyway.
The heap disgorged two cheap DC-to-DC boost converters from halfway around the planet, with about the right specs:
- 10 to 32 V DC in
- 12 to 35 V out
- 10 A
- 150 W
They couldn’t produce their rated output, but a pair of LEDs shouldn’t pose much of a challenge.
So I wired one up to the bench supply, set it for 12 V, turned it on, and wham it maxed out the supply at 3 A with no load on the converter’s output.
Huh.
Adding a suitable load resistor brought the input current down, but the voltage adjustment trimpot didn’t have much effect and the bench supply would still wham hit 3 A with no provocation, so the load resistor didn’t actually make any difference. Eventually, I figured out that simply pressing my finger on the trimpot caused the output to vary wildly.
Given that fairly broad hint, this became obvious:
Evidently, I had used the other converter for the previous tests. Huh.
With that trimpot pin soldered in place, the converter worked fine. Eyeballometrically speaking, the LEDs seem bright enough at 100 mA total (50 mA each) for my purposes, which happens at 18-ish V. Dissipating only 2 W won’t require nearly as much heatsink as they’re presently mounted on, although I should wait for warmer weather before concluding that they’re doing OK while crammed inside the end cap.
Before declaring victory, I took a closer look at the board and found this mmm oversight:
Notice the big pad under the 78L09 regulator, with six thermal vias to an expansive copper pour on the other side of the board, completely covered with red solder mask.
Removing the regulator show the regulator’s footprint didn’t include the tab:
Maybe they decided, after a careful analysis, that the regulator couldn’t possibly dissipate enough power to warrant the additional solder required for the entire thermal pad. Heck, pocket a fraction of a yuan on ten million boards and you’re livin’ large.
Scraping the mask off, fluxing everything in sight, and soldering the regulator down probably won’t make any difference:
Yes, The Bigger The Blob, The Better The Job strikes again. It does make me feel better and that’s all that counts.
6 thoughts on “DC-DC Boost Converter: Another QC FAIL”
Many ebay parts come from sources with which I’m extremely familiar — what markings, if any, are on that SOIC8 on the bottom, beside the 78L09?
(I’m making the possibly bad assumption that the chip on the bottom is the boost controller, and the TO220’s are the switches.)
In order to protect their IP (or cover their tracks), they sanded that chip clean…
The TO220s are IRF2807 and MBR2060CT: one FET, one dual rectifier. They have high production values and might actually be from IR and ON, respectively, but good laser work is cheap and readily available these days.
The serpentine PCB-trace inductor / resistor on the IRF2807 source lead might be diagnostic: either they have really good designers or it’s straight from the recommended layout.
It seems to me that many of those layouts are done by people who don’t really know what they are doing. A.k.a. cargo cult engineering. They look at the board and it is all the same to them.
If it weren’t for the PCB layouts in the data sheets and app notes, nothing would work…

Scientists may need to think twice when using artificial intelligence to help in the search for extraterrestrial life, a new study suggests.
A Spanish team used an artificial intelligence system that interpreted the shape of a triangle outside a square from a NASA image of a crater on the dwarf planet Ceres.
The researchers then gathered 163 volunteers without astronomy training to describe what they saw in the image of the crater.
While AI detected a square and a triangle, most humans only interpreted a square.
But once the triangle was pointed to humans, the number of people who said they could see it increased from 7% to 56%.
This suggests that the influence of AI could be strong in the human brain when interpreting extraterrestrial features on other planets, even when it is questionable that they exist.
Scroll down to watch the video
Triangle or square, or both? Image of the Vinalia Faculae de Ceres region obtained by NASA’s Dawn spacecraft on July 6, 2018 at an altitude of approximately 36 miles
“Both people and artificial intelligence detected a square structure in the images, but AI also identified a triangle,” said Gabriel G De la Torre, author of the study at the University of Cádiz, Spain.
“Despite being fashionable and having a multitude of applications, artificial intelligence could confuse us and tell us that it has detected impossible or false things.”
This compromises the usefulness of AI in the search for extraterrestrial technology firms, discernible evidence of advanced technology by alien civilizations, said De la Torre.
“We must be careful with its implementation and use in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.”
De la Torre and his team of neuropsychologists observed one of the bright spots on the surface of Ceres, called Vinalia Faculae.
The image of the bright spot, found in a crater called Occator, was obtained by NASA’s Dawn spacecraft in 2018 at an altitude of approximately 36 miles.
Although the largest object in the main asteroid belt, Ceres is a dwarf planet, 587 miles in diameter, between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.
Another perspective of the Vinalia Faculae region (rotated 180º from the previous one), taken by the Dawn probe. The geometries that humans detected most frequently are indicated (bottom right)
The dwarf planet became famous in 2015 when bright spots were observed in Occator.
The mystery of the light source was solved when a NASA probe came close enough to discover that they originated from volcanic ice and salt emissions.
De la Torre said that what AI detected in Vinalia Faculae, both a triangle outside the square structure, is probably just a whim of light and shadow.
The AI vision system had previously been trained with thousands of images of squares and triangles.
However, De la Torre admitted that AI could identify or interpret extraterrestrial characteristics that go beyond human consciousness, “opening the doors to new realities for which we are not prepared.”
The experiment was an opportunity to explore how the search for technological signatures or spatial oddities could be influenced by our cognitive abilities and our awareness.
“ We were not alone in this, some people seemed to discern a square form in Vinalia Faculae, so we saw it as an opportunity to confront human intelligence with artificial intelligence in a cognitive task of visual perception, not just a routine task, but a challenging one with implications in the search for extraterrestrial life, which is no longer based solely on radio waves, “said De la Torre.
The results of the study have been published in Astronautics Act.
“Today, we live amid an increase in the use of artificial intelligence in many scientific and technological applications, including the search for extraterrestrial intelligence,” says the research paper.
“However, human perception and decision-making remain the last part of the chain in any data analysis or interpretation of results or results.”
What is the dwarf planet and why is NASA studying it?
Ceres is 590 miles (950 km) wide and was discovered in 1801.
It is the dwarf planet closest to the sun and is in the asteroid belt, which makes it the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system.
While it is the smallest of the known dwarf planets, it is the largest object in the asteroid belt.
It is less than three times from the Earth of the Sun, close enough to feel the heat of the star, allowing the ice to melt and reform.
NASA’s Dawn spacecraft headed to Ceres after leaving the asteroid Vesta in 2012.
There is a great interest in the mission because Ceres is seen as an early solar system registry.
.The Ultimate Guide to Disability Insurance for Physicians
I am beyond excited for you to jump into this wonderful guest blog post from Larry Keller, where he shares his ultimate guide to disability insurance for physicians. And we are fortunate to have yet another rockstar contribute a guest blog post for our second-ever guest blog post.
I don’t have any fun stories on how I met Larry; heck, truthfully, we have never met in person yet. I just kept reading his stuff on the White Coat Investor and saying to myself, "this guy knows his stuff!" Fast forward a few years, I cold emailed Larry with a tough question. And in true Larry fashion, he gave me a thorough answer in a few minutes. For any of you that have worked with Larry in the past, it was one of those “does this guy ever sleep?” moments.
Over the past few years, we shifted away from selling insurance products and more toward true fee-only advice, Larry (and Adam!) has been one of our main and most trusted resources to help with tough questions and to make sure our clients are properly covered for all their risk management needs.
Without further ado, let me introduce you to one of the best (if not, THE BEST) physician disability experts in the country, my friend, Larry Keller.
As a physician, you are in a unique position. You have spent a lot of time preparing to earn income and, as a result, you have less time to accumulate wealth. While a lot of websites I frequent tend to focus on budgeting, paying down student loans, maximizing your retirement plan contributions and creating an asset protection plan, they seldom mention protecting your most valuable asset: your ability to earn an income.
Disability insurance is something that anyone who is working and has not yet achieved financial independence needs. You might love what you do, but you are working because you need to generate an income. You need to protect that income, and the only effective way to do that is to purchase disability insurance.
Employer-Provided/Sponsored Group Long-Term Disability Insurance
If you work for a large practice, multi-specialty clinic or hospital the odds are very good that you are provided with or offered some type of Long-Term Disability (LTD) insurance coverage. While I would not recommend it serve as the foundation of your disability income protection due to the generally less favorable contractual provisions associated with it, there may be some significant benefits to it – especially when supplemented with an individual disability insurance policy.
Employer-provided or sponsored group LTD plans will cover a percentage of your income up to a maximum monthly benefit or “cap.” For example, a typical LTD plan might provide coverage of 60% salary to a maximum of $10,000 or $15,000 per month. However, the percentage of income being replaced can vary along with the maximum monthly benefit under the plan. Therefore, it is important to understand the coverage provided to you by your employer, if any, when purchasing or increasing your individual disability insurance coverage.
Many physicians mistakenly believe that their group LTD plan will support their lifestyles in the event of a disability. Unfortunately, this may not be the case for several reasons:
- Group LTD plans may not include certain components of your earned income (such as overtime pay, shift pay, bonuses and/or productivity or “incentive” pay) when calculating the monthly benefits payable.
- Long-Term Disability policies have a “cap” or maximum monthly benefit associated with them. For example, if a physician earns $300,000 annually and is insured under a group LTD plan that covers 60% income to a maximum of $10,000 month, they would be insured for the maximum benefit of $10,000 month. However, this policy would only insure them as if they were only earning $200,000 (60% of $200,000 provides for $120,000 annually or $10,000 month, the plan’s maximum monthly benefit). In this example, the physician is earning $100,000 in excess of what the group policy covers, leaving a significant amount of income uninsured!
Individual disability insurance policies will take all components of income into consideration when determining the amount of coverage available and, therefore, a larger amount of your income can potentially be replaced.
Most physicians may also not be cognizant of the fact that if their employer is paying the premium for their group LTD plan and not adding it back to their taxable income, any benefits received from the group LTD plan would be taxable, further reducing the amount of their income actually being replaced.
The monthly benefit from an individual disability insurance policy is typically received on an income tax-free basis when paid with personal post-tax dollars. policies do not take these benefits into consideration.
Disability Insurance Limits
Insurance companies don’t want you to earn a higher income when you are disabled compared to when you were working. For this reason, most insurance companies will limit the amount of disability insurance available.
Ideally, you would like to have 60-80% of your earned income replaced in the event of your disability. However, when you have group insurance in place, this will limit the amount of individual coverage available – even if you are willing to pay for a larger amount of coverage.
For this reason, when you are shopping for an individual disability insurance policy, it is best to provide your insurance agent or financial advisor with a copy or summary of your employer-provided LTD insurance plan, if any, for review along with your annual income, a description of your job duties, and if you have any health issues and/or are taking any prescription medication(s). Then he or she can present you with illustrations of coverage from several insurance companies and help you compare the pros and cons of each in terms of cost vs. benefits.
Residents, Fellows and “New In Practice” Physicians
Residents, Fellows, and “New In Practice” Physicians can purchase coverage without regard to their actual earned incomes or employer-provided/sponsored group Long-Term Disability policies. These amounts can range from $5,000-$7,500 per month.
The Cost of Disability Insurance
Premium rates are based on several factors including your age, gender, state of residence, monthly benefit, and optional riders selected. The younger you are when the purchase is made, the lower the cost of the insurance. Therefore, you should purchase a policy as early in your career as possible to lock in lower premium rates.
It is not unreasonable to think that most physicians would rather be on the beach than in clinic or the operating room. As a result, claims experience has been less favorable in certain states such as California and Florida. Therefore, policies are typically more expensive with less liberal contract provisions.
Unisex Rates
Due to a higher morbidity rate, premium rates for females are substantially higher compared to their male counterparts. This is due to pregnancy and complications of pregnancy, a higher rate of claims resulting from mental/nervous and/or substance abuse disorders, and a higher rate of autoimmune disorders.. Principal is the most recent example, as they stopped offering unisex rates to Attending Physicians as of January 1, 2021.
Even if unisex rates are unavailable, in most cases, Residents/Fellows should be able to obtain a 10-20% discount or more off of their policies. Additionally, Attending Physicians may qualify for association discounts of 10-15% off their policies. Every physician will qualify for a discount with at least of one the carriers.
What to Look for in an Individual Disability Insurance Policy, it is not worth the risk in most cases..
Definition of Total Disability
Look for a policy that contains a true “Own-Occupation” definition of total disability. The term “Own-Occupation” and the definition of total disability associated with it mean different things to different people, all depending upon who you ask. If nothing else, most physicians.
In fact, in their most recent offering, Berkshire adds a qualifier or a threshold that can be met in order to receive full disability insurance benefits and reads as follows:
."
OR
"If Your Occupation is limited to a Medical Doctor or Doctor of Osteopathy and more than 50% of Income is earned from Hands-On Patient Care, We will consider You to be Totally Disabled even if You are Gainfully Employed in Your practice or another occupation so long as, solely due to Injury or Sickness, You are not able to provide Hands-on Patient Care."
This language changes the focus from solely your duties to your source of earnings and provides more ways to qualify for total disability benefits.
If you have a mixed practice or your income comes from several sources, this can be an advantage as it stipulates).
Several years ago, one well-known carrier introduced a “Medical Occupation” Definition (MOD) of Total Disability..
As of this writing, there are only six companies who offer this definition of Total Disability to physicians, including Berkshire Life (a Guardian Company), Standard Insurance Company, Principal, Ameritas, MassMutual, and Ohio National. However, the availability of this definition may also vary based upon the state of residence and/or medical specialty.
Residual Disability Rider
While “Own-Occupation” is the most liberal definition of disability, it is not the end all. What happens if your disability is not total? What if you can still work in your occupation, but must work fewer hours — you can do some but not all of your job duties or you have physically recovered but not financially?
This rider protects your income by providing benefits proportionate to your loss of income in the event you are not totally disabled. To qualify for residual disability benefits, you generally must experience an income loss of 15-20% or more compared to your pre-disability earnings. Additionally, if your loss of earnings were greater than 75-80 percent, then 100 percent of your monthly disability benefit would be paid.
A Recovery Benefit is typically built into the Residual/Partial Disability Rider and.
Finally, it is imperative that you do not purchase a policy that requires that you be totally disabled first in order to collect benefits under the residual disability rider. While this is not the case with individual policies, this is very common in group policies offered by professional associations.
Cost Of Living Adjustment (COLA) Rider
A COLA rider is designed to help your benefits keep pace with inflation after your disability has lasted for 12 months. This adjustment can be a fixed percentage or tied to the Consumer Price Index. Ideally, you want a COLA that is adjusted annually on a compound interest basis with no “cap” on the monthly benefit.
Although expensive, this rider can be vital to maintaining your standard of living during an extended disability. However, if cutting the cost of coverage is an issue, this might be the first optional rider to consider excluding from your policy or using the additional premium associated with this rider to purchase a larger monthly benefit, if you are not already contemplating the purchase of the maximum monthly benefit for which you qualify.
Future Increase Option Rider (FIO) / Benefit Increase Rider (BIR), Benefit Purchase Rider (BPR), Benefit Update (BU) Rider
These riders provide you with the ability to increase your disability coverage, without providing evidence of good health, as your income rises. This guarantees that any medical conditions that develop after your original policy’s purchase would be fully covered and not subject to new medical underwriting.
The Future Increase Option or Future Insurability Option (FIO) Riders are “traditional” increase options, and you pay a premium to have them included in your policy. They typically allow you to purchase 2-3x your policy’s initial monthly benefit and the maximum monthly benefit that can be reached is a combination of the base policy plus the FIO Rider.
The FIO Rider option is available annually and can also be used “off anniversary” if certain conditions are met. There is nothing administrative that needs to be done, and you can decide if you want to increase your coverage and to what extent based upon your individual needs, goals, and budget. When the FIO Rider is exercised, the overall cost of your coverage increases but the cost of the FIO Rider itself is decreased proportionally.
In some cases, a new policy is issued when the FIO Rider is exercised. As such, the contractual provisions may differ from the original policy. In other cases, the insurance company amends the original policy and provides the insured with updated policy schedule pages reflecting the increased monthly benefit and premium.
The Benefit Increase Rider (BIR), Benefit Purchase Rider (BPR), and Benefit Update (BU) Rider are no-cost riders and may be included in your policy if certain criteria are met. Unlike the FIO Riders, there is no pre-determined maximum and you can purchase up to the maximum that the insurance company makes available based upon your income and other disability insurance enforce (either individual, group or association coverage) at the time of the exercise. Additionally, if the insurance company’s limits increase, you can potentially take advantage of them.
Since this is a no-cost option, the insurance companies stipulate that you must "check-in" with them every three years and complete an application to increase your coverage. If you do not qualify for additional coverage after the application is reviewed, you do not need to do anything else, and your increase option will be preserved for future use. However, if you do qualify for additional coverage, you must purchase at least 50% of the offered amount or the rider will be removed from your policy permanently. The same is true if you do not apply every three years.
Like the FIO Rider, some companies issue new policies while others amend the base policy to reflect the new monthly benefit and premium rates.
Catastrophic Disability Benefit (CAT) Rider
If you become catastrophically disabled under the terms of the policy and lose the ability to perform two or more Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) without assistance, or become cognitively impaired, or become presumptively disabled, you would receive a monthly benefit in addition to the base monthly benefit purchased.
The theory is that you use your disability insurance benefits to cover your expenses and the benefits received under the CAT Rider to hire someone to help care for you at home or pay for medical expenses not covered under your health insurance.
Are Two Policies Better Than One?
Typically, any one insurance company will issue individual disability insurance policies with a maximum monthly benefit of . This affords).
All Agents are Not Created Equal
There is no shortage of insurance agents and/or financial advisors that work with or want to work with physicians. Unlike medicine, which has a standardized path that physicians must take to gain the education, training, and experience requirements necessary to obtain board certification, the insurance and financial services industry does not.
Since the insurance industry is heavily regulated, you will not be paying anything more by purchasing your policy from an “experienced” insurance agent than you would be by purchasing your policy from a newly licensed or “inexperienced” insurance agent or broker.

Written by Larry Keller; guest post for WealthKeel LLCInfographics became the new standard of digital marketing. Is there any way that creative infographic ideas will happily delight prospects? I will share seven creative uses for those visual marketing tools in this post.
How To Use LMS Marketing Infographics In Your Strategy
Do you use LMS infographics for marketing in your strategy? Well, that’s right you should. Infographics are used by countless companies to promote new products and raise brand awareness. If they are lucky, the infographic becomes viral and, thanks to the strategically placed logo and embedded links, they meet a whole new audience. However, several companies lack the opportunities offered by golden LMS marketing. You will take the advertising campaign to the next level with a creative spark and clear-cut goals. Here are 7 creative ways to support the LMS using infographics.
How Can A Marketing Infographic Help Showcase Testimonials
Instead of merely adding blurb text testimonials to your landing page, using infographics to express customer satisfaction. The infographic on the LMS marketing that features 5 to 6 glowing reviews that highlight various benefits or features. The first testimonial, for example, includes a picture of the author or their company logo (with permission, of course) as well as a short or two-paragraph summarizing their experience. Prospects are more likely to sign up if they know that your product is being tried and tested, especially when there are different industries or use cases in the infographic.
Highlight Your Unique Selling Points With LMS Infographics
Most LMS firms use bullet lists or segmented site pages to express their specific selling points. In an infographic, however, you can shine the spotlight on your USPs to add visual appeal. It also sums up nicely why prospects should invest in the competition in your product. For example, the white labelling and configuration feature that allows users to customize the app to suit their needs, or the advanced reporting and analytics featuring out-of-the-box options and personalized metrics. To help prospects visualize the USPs in a real-world context, provide images or screenshots. For instance, the intuitive dashboard design that reduces the learning curve and improves functionality.
Company Bio To Build Brand Awareness
Bring prospects into your company and its key message. You can also offer them your company’s brief history, and highlight your team. This not only creates knowledge about the brand but also develops a partnership with future LMS customers. They can be assured that you aren’t just trying to sell them a product and instead, you are trying to earn their trust and foster a successful business relationship. For example, include a blurb about your beginnings and why you specialize in LMSs for compliance or external partner training. The next segment might feature a brief bio about your founder or CEO, followed by a product spotlight that hits two or three top sellers, as well as the top companies on your customer list.
Key Use Cases And Uses Of LMS Infographics For Marketing
People are more likely to purchase your LMS product until they fully understand its implementations in the real world. In other words, the advantages it can offer, and to whom it is intended. Use your LMS marketing infographic to show your system’s top use scenarios and the advantages it provides. You can also show the “top 5 challenges” your LMS can help overcome organizations to highlight the point. Back it up with statistics to make it still more plausible. “The LMS, for example, helped 75%of users increase resource allocation and cut training costs.” Include a contact email and company website so prospects can know more about what your LMS will bring to their organization — even if the LMS marketing infographic doesn’t mention their particular use case.
Impressive User Satisfaction LMS Stats Work Well As Marketing Infographics
Another perfect way to show off the stats is to pick 5 to 7 figures that match in with your points of sale or benefits. For example, note that 85% of users using the LMS for online customer service training have increased last quarter levels of customer satisfaction by at least 25%. Prospects appreciate concrete numbers indicating success for the company. During free trials, you can obtain statistics via customer surveys or questionnaires, as well as LMS metric data, or conduct focus groups to get more detailed feedback. Not only does this yield statistical data that you can use for your LMS marketing infographics, but it also helps you to continuously improve your product.
Read Benefits Of Gamification LMS For Your Online Training
Outline Pricing Packages
Instead of simply putting a price table in your LMS landing page or website, use an LMS marketing infographic to highlight your popular price packages. For instance, all the advantages that your “simple” program has to offer and for whom it is best suited, such as small to medium-sized companies with less than 50 employees. This is also an opportunity to invite them to sign up for a free trial or demo of LMS. Just include a connection to the landing/sign up page of your LMS and a call-to-action at the bottom. A side-by-side comparison of upgrade perks is another essential element to include in your pricing plan infographic. For example, the features included in your more advanced tariff plans versus your basic package.
Snapshot Product Tour
Take the prospects of a virtual tour of your LMS product and its many features that stand out. This LMS marketing infographic features screenshots to take potential customers behind the scenes from your platform. The first segment, for example, introduces them to the sign-up screen and explains the advanced security measures including password protection, encryption, and remote backups. Encourage them to sign up for the grand tour (the demo) or arrange a meeting with an experienced sales representative who will be able to answer their questions.
Marketing infographics from LMS provide buyers with all the information they need to make a well-educated purchase decision. At the very least they get to know the brand and its history so they can build confidence. If you’re chasing the marketing clock, use infographic templates or build your own models that you can use every now and then. This will also help you reduce the cost of development and extend your promotional budget.

and yet it makes me think of that other saying, that a gilded cage — is still a cage.
I like the turn in the second part.
i had “gilded cage” in my mind but I couldn’t remember why. now i see it must’ve been because i’ve heard of that saying before but forgot about it. 😉 i’m glad you liked it though!
whoa, I love how this poem made a complete 180… I always hate to see birds in cages… must feel so trapped

Lately there has been news surrounding the personal health of Geary and what that means for his role as the iconic Luke Spencer on ABC’s General Hospital.
As General Hospital Blog has previously reported, Tony Geary underwent two back surgeries during his time off from General Hospital. Due to a long recovery time, and more extensive operation that initially expected, the last report noted that Luke/Fluke would be away from the canvas for the remainder of the Summer.
Fans are still wondering when we will all find out who Fluke really is, and with Geary being away from work, it has been confirmed that Tony Geary will not be reprising his role as Luke Spencer and/or Fluke until this coming October.
As far as any further news related to the return of Tony Geary to General Hospital and his characters Luke and Fluke back to Port Charles, nothing has been confirmed that would lead us to believe that Geary won’t be returning despite recent rumors. We will do our best to keep you informed on this news as we all hope and pray that Geary makes a speedy recovery and will be lighting up our screen very soon.

The gastrointestinal tract presents a formidable barrier for pathogens to initiate infection. Despite this barrier, enteroviruses, including coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), successfully penetrate the intestine to initiate infection and spread systemically prior to shedding in stool. However, the effect of the gastrointestinal barrier on CVB3 population dynamics is relatively unexplored, and the selective pressures acting on CVB3 in the intestine are not well characterized. To examine viral population dynamics in orally infected mice, we produced over 100 CVB3 clones harboring nine unique nucleotide “barcodes.” Using this collection of barcoded viruses, we found diverse viral populations throughout each mouse within the first day postinfection, but by 48 h the viral populations were dominated by fewer than three barcoded viruses in intestinal and extraintestinal tissues. Using light-sensitive viruses to track replication status, we found that diverse viruses had replicated prior to loss of diversity. Sequencing whole viral genomes from samples later in infection did not reveal detectable viral adaptations. Surprisingly, orally inoculated CVB3 was detectable in pancreas and liver as soon as 20 min postinoc-ulation, indicating rapid systemic dissemination. These results suggest rapid dissemination of diverse viral populations, followed by a major restriction in population diversity and monopolization in all examined tissues. These results underscore a complex dynamic between dissemination and clearance for an enteric virus. IMPORTANCE Enteric viruses initiate infection in the gastrointestinal tract but can disseminate to systemic sites. However, the dynamics of viral dissemination are unclear. In this study, we created a library of 135 barcoded coxsackieviruses to examine viral population diversity across time and space following oral inoculation of mice. Overall, we found that the broad population of viruses disseminates early, followed by monopolization of mouse tissues with three or fewer pool members at later time points. Interestingly, we detected virus in systemic tissues such as pancreas and liver just 20 min after oral inoculation. These results suggest rapid dissemination of diverse viral populations, followed by a major restriction in population diversity and monopolization in all examined tissues.

HAYWARD, Calif — Robots that can cook - from flipping burgers to baking bread - are in growing demand as virus-wary kitchens try to put some distance between workers and customers.
Starting this fall, the White Castle burger chain will test a robot arm that can cook french fries and other foods. The robot, dubbed Flippy, is made by Pasadena, California-based Miso Robotics.
White Castle and Miso have been discussing a partnership for about a year. Those talks accelerated when COVID-19 struck, said White Castle Vice President Jamie Richardson.
Richardson said the robot can free up employees for other tasks like disinfecting tables or handling the rising number of delivery orders. A touch-free environment that minimizes contact is also increasingly important to customers, he said.
“The world’s just reshaped in terms of thoughts around food safety,” Richardson said.
Flippy currently costs $30,000, with a $1,500 monthly service fee. By the middle of next year, Miso hopes to offer the robot for free but charge a higher monthly fee.
Robot food service was a trend even before the coronavirus pandemic, as hospitals, campus cafeterias and others tried to meet demand for fresh, customized options 24 hours a day while keeping labor costs in check. Robot chefs appeared at places like Creator, a burger restaurant in San Francisco, and Dal.komm Coffee outlets in South Korea.
Now, some say, robots may shift from being a novelty to a necessity. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control says the risk of getting COVID-19 from handling or consuming food outside the home is low. Still, there have been numerous outbreaks among restaurant employees and patrons.
“I expect in the next two years you will see pretty significant robotic adoption in the food space because of COVID,” said Vipin Jain, the co-founder and CEO of Blendid, a Silicon Valley startup.
Blendid sells a robot kiosk that makes a variety of fresh smoothies. Customers can order from a smartphone app and tweak the recipe if they want more kale or less ginger, for example. Once or twice a day, a Blendid employee refills the ingredients.
Only a handful are now operating around San Francisco, but since the pandemic began, Blendid has started contract discussions with hospitals, corporations, shopping malls and groceries.
“What used to be forward-thinking - last year, pre-COVID - has become current thinking,” Jain said.
As salad bars shut down, Hayward, California-based Chowbotics started getting more inquiries about Sally, a robot about the size of a refrigerator that makes a variety of salads and bowls. Sally lets customers choose from 22 prepared ingredients stored inside the machine. It can make around 65 bowls a day before kitchen workers need to refill the ingredients.
Prior to this year, Chowbotics had sold around 125 of its $35,000 robots, primarily to hospitals and colleges. But since the coronavirus hit, sales have jumped more than 60%, CEO Rick Wilmer said, with growing interest from grocery stores, senior living communities and even the.
Robot cooks haven’t always been successful. Spyce, a Boston restaurant with a robot-run kitchen, closed in November to retool its menu. Zume, a Silicon Valley startup that made pizzas with robots, shut down its pizza business in January. It’s now making face masks and biodegradable takeout containers..”
Pirates, Microsoft wants you to come clean. While we wait for the “one-click upgrade” that”s coming soon, here”s how to do it now.
Microsoft loves Windows 10, users upgrading from Windows 8.1 love Windows 10, and even some pirates love the new operating system. Now, Microsoft wants to make it easier for pirates—”non-genuine users” in diplomatic Microsoft-speak—to get a legitimate Windows 10 license after upgrading from Windows 7 or 8.1.
Đang xem: Can i upgrade to windows 10 from windows 7 if my os was a pirated one?
Soon Microsoft will introduce “a one-click opportunity to get Genuine via the Windows Store or by entering an activation code purchased elsewhere,” according to a blog post. The new program will be U.S.-only at launch.
Once Microsoft’s one-click experience is active we’ll update this article with instructions on how to use it. For now, here’s how genuine pirates can currently end their “non-genuine” Windows status by upgrading to Windows 10 and purchasing a license.
This tutorial assumes you’ve used a cracking tool and have a seemingly legitimate Windows product key.
Upgrading
What most non-genuine Windows users do is just upgrade to Windows 10 the usual way, using the update tool provided by Microsoft. You can find out more information about how to do this in our previous article covering Windows 10 upgrades.
There are a few key things to remember at this point. First, you want to make sure that you are upgrading to a version of Windows 10 that corresponds with your older Windows build. If you’re on Windows 7 Home Premium or plain old Windows 8.1, for example, you want to upgrade to Windows 10 Home. If you have a Pro version, you must upgrade to Windows 10 Pro.
Just press Skip when asked for a product key.
Once you get to the screen asking for a product key during the upgrade, just press Skip. You’ll activate later.

If you are asked for a product key a second time after installation, press Do this later.
Post-upgrade
During the summer, some users on Reddit reported that after upgrading a cracked version of Windows 7 or 8.1 they ended up with a genuine activation of Windows 10. Don’t count on that happening for you, and if it does, the activation may be corrected a few days later.
Regardless, now is the time to get your legitimate Windows 10 license. Click the Start button and select Settings to open the Settings app. Then navigate to Update & Security > Activation.
Click Go to Store to get your license.
On this screen it should notify you that your version of Windows 10 needs to be activated. Click the Go to Store button.
Now you’ll be taken to the Windows Store app, where you can buy a proper Windows license.

The blissful bear strolled in casually, politely holding the door open before putting his paws on the refrigerator. He even used his nose twice to disinfect.
The woman held together for the first few seconds of the clip to shoo the bear outside. “Oh. My. Quality. He knows how to open – HEY STOP, ”she called.
Shortly afterwards, her “brave face” facade fell into sheer horror when she burst into screams of panic.
The viral clip has since received a staggering 5.8 million views in less than 24 hours. Of course, thousands of TikTok users hysterically flocked to the clip.
Noticing the tag on the bear’s right ear, one user joked, “The ear tag tells me he’s either a refugee or a repeat offender.”
“That strange moment when a bear behaves politely and the human screams like an animal”, one joked and another added: “This is how you treat your customers ???”

Even the official 7-Eleven TikTok account wanted to join, “he wants a blue rasBEARy Slurpee,” they said.
While another user joked, “The bear literally came in politely, held the door open and disinfected. What more do you want?”
Judging from an earlier video posted by creator Fanu (@ fmunna83pk) in May, the brown bear is a regular. The bear was taped walking to the store’s trash can to sniff around before strolling back into the wild.
You can hear the woman say “he’s not scared at all”, to which a user quoted sarcastically and replied: “Well, he’s a bear”.
He even took a double look at the filming person and began to saunter towards them. “It’s like he just remembered he was a bear and turned around,” joked another user.We are back with more of the best of Washington DC weddings!

Aparently there was no attempt to track the guns once they were purchased so the cows were out of the barn and the Justice Departments allowed this. Your article indicated some purchasers were just kids so it seems even the justice department should have been able to catch them and make an example out of them. Instead the Justice department wants to use this an an excuse to limit the 2nd ammendment to all honest citizens.

Article content
There are no two ways about it. The leaves are turning, the days are getting shorter and there is that crisp feeling in the air. Fall is here and with that comes my favourite time of year for cooking. While I absolutely enjoy all of the fresh summer vegetables there is just something I have come to enjoy about the ingredients of the fall season that I really take pleasure in. The opportunity to cook with humble root vegetables and gourds gets me excited at all of the opportunities. Maybe it’s because they pair so nicely with game meats and braised items, another reason I love fall cooking.

Perhaps the greatest irony with my fondness for the fall vegetables is that as a child I wouldn’t touch them with a 10. I can’t even really tell you why I wasn’t fond of them? I was just one of those kids. The smells of rutabaga cooking was enough to make me gag. The way beets made everything they touched a bloody red mess turned me off. Squash looked like pumpkin, which was meant for carving into Jack-o’-lanterns, and it certainly wasn’t fit for human consumption.

Who’s hungry?Yesterday, the prince of Jeopardy!, trivia champion Ken Jennings, returned to the show for another guest hosting stint. Monday, November 8, also happened to mark the one year anniversary of the death of the late Alex Trebek, but Jennings was kept in the dark on this airing detail until after filming the episode.
“Apparently, everyone was aware that we were going to air [my first episode] on the anniversary and nobody told me,” Jennings tells USA Today. “They didn’t want to put that in my head. So, I was not told until after that it was the Nov. 8 show.”
This ultimately means that yesterday’s episode did not make note of the day, with no speeches made in Trebek’s memory. However, Jennings says he had a little memento with him on stage in honor of Trebek.
“I did wear Alex’s cuff links that week, that his wife, Jean, had been kind enough to leave for me,” Jennings says. “So I do have a little kind of souvenir.”
The top Jeopardy! earner returned to the set back in September, telling USA Today he “felt rusty; I hope I don’t look rusty, but honestly it was just such a delight to be back on that stage.”
Jennings, along with 15 other celebrities of all sorts, took their shot at hosting Jeopardy! over the last year, and the 47-year-old attests the job is not as easy as Trebek made it look.
“But it’s a very tricky job. The mechanics of hosting Jeopardy! are daunting. There’s a lot going on at once, and Alex made it all look so easy. But I can tell you firsthand, it’s not easy,” Jennings says.

The lawmakers also intend to revise the tax rate percentage suggesting that investors who generate profits of more than $42,000 should pay 20%, while the initial legislation taxes gains above $2,900.
Not Ready for It
According to the current propositions, South Korea will start taxing profits from trading with cryptocurrencies on January 1st, 2022. Hong Nam-ki – Finance Minister of the country – even called the move “inevitable.”
However, South Korea’s People Power Party has its objections. The Korea Herald reported that lawmakers from the party plan to propose a bill via which they could postpone the taxation rules until January 1st, 2023. Rep. Cho Myoung-hee – a Member of the opposition – explained:
“It is not right to impose taxes first at a time when the legal definition of virtual currency is ambiguous. The intention is to ease the tax base to the level of financial investment income tax so that virtual currency investors do not suffer disadvantages.”
The politicians would also seek a change in the taxation rate. While the financial regulators would slam every South Korean who generates more than $2,900 with 20%, the People Power Party intends to raise that limit to people with profits of between $42,000 and $251,000. Those with gains above $251,000 would have to pay 25%.
Once again, though, the Finance Minister – Hong Nam-ki – was not open to the idea:
“It is difficult to delay taxation on virtual assets in terms of policy reliability and legal stability.”
The Democratic Party Also Wants a Delay
It is worth noting that the ruling Democratic Party of South Korea also tried to postpone the upcoming taxation rules. As CryptoPotato reported, lawmakers recently passed a bill that could have even entirely suspended the legislation. Back then, Noh Woong-rae – Member of the Democratic Party – opined that the East Asian nation does not have a well-designed plan to implement the taxing procedure:
“In a situation where the relevant taxation infrastructure is not sufficiently prepared, the deferral of taxation on virtual assets is no longer an option but an inevitable situation.”
Woong-rae added that the Ministry of Finance’s policy of enforcing taxation over digital asset endeavors wouldn’t work as planned. He explained that it is difficult to secure the proper taxing of overseas operations with cryptocurrencies or peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions.I imagine life fashion changes can make the world of difference.

It is also known as the Pontian lyra, Pontic fiddle or kemençe (kemenche). It is without doubt the musical instrument that defines Pontic culture, and has a very distinct melody unlike any other instrument.
The Pontic lyra comprises a narrow box shaped body which includes a neck and a pegbox, and a soundboard which covers the body. The body is either made by hollowing out a single piece of wood, or by gluing pieces together. The best lyra are said to be made of extremely dense wood such as plum, mulberry and walnut. Cedar is sometimes used. The soundboard is made of pine or spruce.
The sides of the body are generally 2-3mm in thickness, as is the soundboard. The pegs are made of hardwood (usually the same wood as the body) and are inserted from the front. The chords are made of wire although sheep's gut was used historically. When using wire chords, two Violin A (La) chords are used, whilst the high pitched chord is a guitar 13 or 14 (Si) chord. Various other combinations of chords can also be used.
Traditionally, the bow (doksar) was made from an olive branch however nowadays it's made from any light piece of wood. Hair from a male horse's tail was used historically however bows with synthetic hair are more commonly used nowadays. While playing, the tension of the bow hair is controlled by the second and third finger while it is held palm upwards.
Common tuning for the Pontic lyra is GDA and AEB, AAD and EAD and many others. The instrument is tuned in fourths. It can be played while standing up or sitting down and is held vertically. When seated, the bottom of the lyra is rested between the thighs of the player. The chords are touched with the flesh of the fingers, not the nails. There is no vibrato. A particular characteristic of the Pontic lyra is its polyphony in which drone effects and parallel fourths dominate. Wrist movement is also used especially in faster paced tunes.
History
The origin of the Pontic lyra is very difficult to define due to a lack of recorded historical references. The word kemenche is believed to be derived from the Persian words keman (bow) and che (little). The kamancheh or kamāncha is a Persian bowed string instrument related to the bowed rebab (the historical ancestor of the kamancheh), and also to the bowed Byzantine lira which is an ancestor of the European violin family. The answer could very well be that the Pontic lyra is related to both the kamancheh and the Byzantine lyra. Other variations of the kemenche also exist, such as the Kemona and the Kemane.
Earliest known depiction of a type of lyra in a Byzantine ivory casket (900 - 1100 AD). (Museo Nazionale, Florence)
Geographically the Pontic lyra was played only in the areas which once bordered the Byzantine Empire of Trebizond (from Samsun to just east of Trabzon, and also inland). Today, in this region situated in north-eastern Turkey, the kemenche is still made by local luthiers and played extensively and is referred to as Karadeniz kemençesi. The Karadeniz kemençesi is a slightly lighter instrument due to its lower depth. It also has fewer sound holes and therefore sounds slightly different. The instrument is generally not played in other parts of Turkey. The Rum (Orthodox Greeks) who lived in this region for nearly 3000 years, and who were expelled in 1923 as part of the exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey, sometimes simply call the instrument a ‘lyra'.
Eminent British musicologist Laurence Picken (1909-2007) wrote: "We shall never know what an illiterate fiddler of the early Middle Ages played on his lira; but the polyphonic fiddling of those who live on the Black Sea coast, in the belt of hazel-nut cultivation between Giresun and Hopa, may without exaggeration be described as quasi-mediaeval."

Me too. My wife has about had it. During the COVID lockdown, and work-from home, I have become too much to handle and I’m faced with a potential divorce. I’ve decided to cut alcohol completely out of my life and revisit my current medications (Adderall and Intuniv) and consider going back to Wellbutrin. I feel as though stimulant medication makes it worse. Not having a place to work combined with two daughters (each with ADHD) both in virtual learning equates to non-stop interruptions. I am so ashamed at myself and will be desperately seeking a new therapist ASAP. I feel for you all experiencing this during these challenging times. It is a nightmare and is tearing my family apart.Play the Best Online Casino Games with Unibet
Unibet Bonus Ireland
Ireland and gambling are synonymous. This is because the art of gambling has been part of the Irish culture for many years. In the present day, gaming is one of the most popular pastimes in the country. In fact, it is hard-pressed to find an Irish citizen who is green about the aspects of betting, such as odds, markets, and payouts, etc. And in a country where betting has taken root, bookmakers would be losing big not to do business there. That is why it is not surprising to note that Ireland is home to dozens of betting sites, including Unibet. Since stepping on Irish soil, the brand has gone on to establish a dominant presence in the country, taking bets on various different sports genres, such as football, horse racing, rugby, tennis, esports, and many more. But what really makes Unibet one of the favourites for Irish gamers? While there are many answers to this question, the bonus offers, is one of them, and it is the focus of this writing.
The Irish players on Unibet must be aware of the terms and conditions associated with the site’s welcome bonus. Understanding these is essential as it helps players to know how the bonus works, even before they can make a deposit and place their first bet. And they are not unique to the Irish; they cut across all the countries where Unibet operates. To redeem the Unibet welcome package, Irish gamers, like any other nationals, will need to be eligible bettors on the site. That would mean being at least 18 years of age; this is the legal gambling age in Ireland, and of course, the majority of the countries around the world.
After claiming the bonus, it will not last forever. Unibet requires its new Irish members to use the bonus within a certain number of days. If those days elapse, the bonus will automatically expire. What this means is that the players need to meet the wagering requirements within the set bonus period. Additionally, the first bet placed by new players should meet the requirements of the bonus. For instance, there is a minimum stake. Players must also deposit using a valid banking method to claim the bonus.
How to Claim Unibet Welcome Bonus
There is a super simple registration procedure to follow for Irish players who wish to take advantage of Unibet welcome bonus. The players can use literally any device to sign up, whether it is a mobile gadget or desktop. It all depends on what is convenient to them (the majority of Irish gamers prefer the mobile phone option though). Once a player visits the Unibet’s Irish site, they can follow the subsequent procedure to complete the sign-up process.
- Locate and tap or click ‘Register.’ The sign-up page, which requires the player to provide their personal details, will appear.
- The player will need to provide their date of birth, full name, and email address. Although optional, they may also want to provide their gender.
- Create their unique login details, including a username and password. The password has to be strong enough as not to be easily guessed by anyone.
- Choose a banking method and use it to load their Unibet account with money.
- Place the first bet. The player will be able to claim their freebies once the bet is placed.
Other Bonuses for Unibet Players in Ireland
With the welcome bonus being exclusive to new members to the platform, one would be asking, “what does Unibet have for existing Irish players?” Well, there are additional promotions beyond the welcome package. And for a bookmaker such as Unibet, it is essential to have a sound reward system in place to ensure those members who log in and play again and again are encouraged to keep on coming back. Most online betting sites thrive on repeat business, and that is why Unibet cannot afford to ignore its existing players. For instance, there is what is known as a multi-boost bonus, where players are awarded a bonus on multiple bets. This bonus is subject to terms and conditions, just like any other bonus type on the site. The bonus is given out on specific sports.
A cash refund in the event of a penalty is yet another extra designed to benefit the Irish gamers betting on football. In this promotion, players receive a refund if they lose a bet on a match where a penalty was awarded. The losing bet should be within a specific stake range, and the bonus is awarded at the end of the game. The offer applies to a wide range of betting markets, including Scorecast, Half-time/Full-time, Correct Score, and First/Last Goalscorer, among other markets.
Wrapping It Up
Unibet is a gaming platform with a good reputation in Ireland. While it is the biggest brand in the country, the site offers some fantastic bonuses to its players in the country. There is a welcome bonus for new players, as well as additional promotions for existing players. Looking at the bonus terms and conditions, one would not be wrong to imagine that Unibet Ireland is lenient to its members. Unlike bookmakers who impose very harsh bonus terms and conditions, Unibet has gone out of its way to ensure that players here find it easy to claim and make use of their bonuses. What is more, is that all the terms and conditions are clearly spelt out on the Unibet website, and there is nothing hidden at all. This transparency, combined with the mouthwatering bonuses, generous odds, and a wide range of betting markets, makes Unibet a darling of literally every Irish gamer.The article concerns:

This system has been practised for many centuries in ceylon island nation. Sri Lanka developed its own Ayurvedic system based on a series of prescriptions handed down from generation to generation over a period of 3,000 years.

The ancient kings, who were also prominent physicians, sustained its survival and longevity. King Buddhadasa (398 AD), the most influential of these physicians, wrote the Sarartha Sangrahaya, a comprehensive manuscript which Sri Lankan physicians still use today for reference. Some are believe the age of "Hela wedakama" comes from the great King Ravana,
as most of the real traditional medicine practitioners still worship the King Ravana inorder to obtain the permission prior to start treatments for the patients or prior to start making medicines according to the ancient traditions.
Ancient inscriptions on rock surfaces reveal that organized medical services have existed within the country for centuries. In fact, Sri Lanka claims to be the first country in the world to have established dedicated hospitals with the capability of performing surgeries even for the animals.. However, most of the traditional values of Sri Lanka had been died with the invasions of Dutch, Portuguese and English Nations.

The healing power of traditional medicine can be explored at several levels. At a profound level is the recognition that human beings need tranquility and balance to stay well. Nature provides us with all that we require to heal ourselves and traditional medicine shows us the way we can connect with the natural elements and heal ourselves.
According to the ancient wisdom, human beings and the universe are made up of five elements (or Pancha Maha Bhuta) which are Akasha (air/ether),Vayo (air),Thejo (fire), Apo (water) and Pruthuvi (earth). These common factors create harmony between living beings and the universe. Tridosha defines the three fundamental energies or principles which govern the function of our bodies on the physical and emotional level. There are three doshas - Vata, Pitta, Kapha, keep the balance in our bodies.These three doshas are made up of above mentioned five elements: Vata comprises air and space, Pitta comprises fire and water, and Kapha comprises water and earth.

Author:
EbookApplied Sport Business Analytics With HKPropel Access provides a practical explanation of the use of data analytic metrics in sport, exploring selected techniques and tools as well as addressing fundamental applications of analytics within modern sports organizations. Current and aspiring sport managers will develop their understanding of how analytics can be used strategically to make data-informed decisions by selecting and translating data into evidence and meaningful metrics.
The text begins with an introduction to the world of analytics, exploring the social, economic, and business foundations that form the history of data analytics. Different strategies used to make data-driven decisions are discussed to demonstrate the importance of analytics in a modern sport context. The text explains terms and methods that are typical in sport analytics, bridging the gap between sport managers and sport analysts to help them understand the perceptions and needs of one another.
The text’s focus on quantitative statistical analysis—with its exploration of modeling, predictive analytics, and forecasting—helps students learn how to analyze data and make use of it. Students will then learn to turn data into visual representations such as cluster diagrams to reveal clear results. With practical exercises that utilize five included datasets and are heavily support by related video tutorials delivered through HKPropel, even those without programming experience will learn how to program and transform complex statistical data into easy-to-understand visuals.
Case studies exploring real-world scenarios—including player position analysis in women's professional basketball, esport player popularity and market analysis, and prospective player evaluation for the NFL draft—examine managerial implications to help develop understanding of what questions to ask, how to interpret data, and how to use data to make informed decisions. Finally, an in-depth look at how cutting-edge analytics mechanisms were used to analyze over one million tweets associated with the NBA over an entire season will illustrate how to successfully work with large amounts of data to achieve results.
Concepts throughout the book are made easy to understand through exercises, datasets, and video lectures on key topics, all accessible through HKPropel. These tools combine to provide valuable experience and practical understanding. Interview With a Professional sidebars offer additional real-world glimpses into the use of analytics by practitioners in sport business.
Applied Sport Business Analytics will provide a broader and deeper knowledge of the use of sport analytics for aspiring sport managers, data analysts, and practitioners alike. It will prepare them to translate metrics in a useful way that allows them to make data-informed and data-driven decisions to achieve desired outcomes in their organization.

O Lord, I know that every hardship along the way is for me

DESCRIPTION
The knight is an icon of heroism. This painting illustrates some of the the qualities a medieval knight would have embraced, through pilgrimage and his devotion to God.
The questing knight – I chose a lone knight to represent a knight’s personal commitment to an ideal and his cause. This knight is a Templar, Knights Templar were a militant-monastic order who swore an oath of poverty and chastity and held in great esteem through much of the medieval period.
Red cross on the knight’s cloak – This is the symbol of the Knights Templar, it was also the symbol of St George the saintly knight who famously slew the dragon and symbolises courage and faith in the face of adversity.
The weary horse – The horse mirrors the knights exhausted condition, but endures the hardship and his burden as he continues resolutely onwards.
Empty desert – The vast expanse of the empty desert symbolises the daunting challenge ahead of the knight. The desert can be viewed in three parts: The first third contains the knight in the temporal world on the outset of his journey. The central section is empty and a desolate void, a place of transition where the knight’s faith and resolve will be tested. The final stage holds the symbols of his objective and the desert is slightly darker here as he has yet to see his future destination clearly and has not yet found his way.
Mountains – The sharp craggy mountain range reinforces the hardships the knight will endure on his quest.
The Christion fish symbol – The fish symbol is etched into the left-hand rocks representing the knight’s Christian devotion to God that as initiated his quest.
The Jerusalem Cross – The Jerusalem is etched into the rocks of the right-hand side signifying the knight’s destination.
The Lizard – This represents the knight’s religious zeal. Pope Gregory I noted that the lizards basked in the sun, commenting “the soul that humbly seeks enlightenment”.
Birds in the distant horizon – These birds are an ambiguous reference to the outcome of the quest. The could symbolise soaring life and a successful outcome or they could be carrion birds that represent failure.
The wooden Frame – The frame is a part of the design and is constructed of heavy rough sawn wood timbers crossing at the corners as a reference to Christ’s cross.Still looking for something to do this Valentine’s Day in Barrie? Well, you could win tickets to:

Kakamega and Bungoma counties have the highest number of beneficiaries of student loans, according to a Higher Education Loans Board (Helb) report for this year.
The report, which says the government is spending Sh14.4 billion to fund 354,069 students in public universities, shows counties in North Eastern and Coast got the least number of beneficiaries.
Read
HELB Chief Executive Officer Charles Ringera said the fund has been working with counties to develop revolving funds to support students from their regions.
“We have been giving them analyses of courses being studied by these students,” he said, adding that this enables county governments to use the data for the planning purposes.
Machakos, Trans Nzoia, Nyamira, Busia, Nandi and Muranga counties have about 9,000 beneficiaries.
Garissa has 71 helb beneficiaries, Mandera 72 helb beneficiaries, Tana River 272 helb beneficiaries while Isiolo closes the bottom five with 268 students who benefited from Helb loans.
Lamu County has 284 helb beneficiaries, Marsabit 523 helb beneficiaries, Samburu 863 helb beneficiaries, closing the category of counties with less than 1,000 beneficiaries.
HELB sponsors students in public and private universities following a directive by President Uhuru Kenyatta. MPs recently called for a reversal of the policy due to the financial strain facing public universities, which has forced them to restructure key operations.addhāna
same meaning as addhan but as simplex only used with reference to time (i.e. a long time, cp. Vv-a.117 addhānaṃ = ciraṃ).

Continuing what I anticipate to be an extended look at a variety of the different roster spot and playing time competitions brewing for this spring, I thought we would look at one of the more curious contests that's shaping up down in South Florida. The Marlins walked out a big procession of mediocrity at the position last season, primarily giving the spot to Jorge Cantu, Wes Helms and Chad Tracy with a sprinkling of Quad-A talent, and the team seems like they're content to do the same in 2011.
Depending on who you ask, Florida currently has either top prospect Matt Dominguez or longtime utility infielder Helms penciled into the position, and either way they're not exactly asking for a particularly strong performance. Helms is 34, and while he's solid defensively, he's batted .244/.303/.356 over the past four seasons, which isn't remotely tolerable for a corner infielder. Dominguez brings a plus glove to the table, but it's generally considered to be easily his best attribute by the scouting community, and it's hard to see the 21-year-old hitting much in the majors coming off a .252/.333/.411 season in Double-A.
If one of those guys is getting everyday playing time in the majors next season, that can't be seen as anything but a negative for Florida. Helms is hardly more than a mediocre bench guy with some ability to hit lefties at this point, considering that he hasn't been a useful hitter in four years despite getting 230+ PA in each season. Dominguez would provide solid defensive value, but the bat would be an issue, and given his youth and lack of performance in Double-A last season, he really should be in the minors improving his skills and continuing his development. Pushing him into an everyday role at 21 with 169 games of mediocre Double-A performance under his belt simply isn't the way to maximize his potential..
After batting .272/.429/.450 in 479 PA with the Cardinals' Triple-A affiliate in 2009, he followed that up by hitting .285/.410/.436 in 577 PA with the Diamondbacks' Triple-A club. Over those two seasons combined, he walked 197 times while striking out only 185 times, and he even flashed some pop with a .163 isolated power. Even if he's not much more than adequate defensively at third, and he's never been a particularly good defender, it's not hard to see the possibilities with Gotay given the numbers he's put up.
I think the pretty obvious solution here would be to try out some sort of platoon with Helms and Gotay at third base, giving Dominguez the chance to return to the minors to refine his approach and improve his batting skills so he can be a legitimate, high-quality option for the club at third base long-term. Helms can still hit lefties a little bit and Gotay's a switch-hitter with a solid track record against RHP, so it's not hard to see the two providing solid performance overall at the position. At the very least, it should be a solid improvement upon playing Dominguez everyday or batting Helms against right-handers consistently.Abstract
OBJECTIVE: Women with prior ectopic pregnancy (EP) have an increased failure rate when treated with singledose methotrexate (MTX) for subsequent EP. We sought to determine whether previous EP remained a risk factor for failure when using the two-dose MTX protocol. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of women managed with twodose MTX. Risk factors for MTX failure were evaluated in univariable analysis and multivariable regression modeling. RESULTS: A total of 234 women with EP between 1999 and 2009 were studied. Of those, 37 (15.8%) had a prior EP. In univariable analysis, prior EP was associated with a greater than twofold increased risk of MTX failure (RR 2.67, 95% CI 1.20–3.77). Higher hCG levels and ultrasound visualization of EP also increased the risk of MTX failure. In multivariable analysis hCG level remained associated with MTX failure, while prior EP did not (adjusted RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.33–2.82). CONCLUSION: Prior EP is not independently associated with MTX failure in women receiving two-dose MTX therapy after controlling for known risk factors.

Their objectives remain the same – finding their children and demanding that Mexican authorities do more in guaranteeing the safety and protection of the estimated 323,000 Central American migrants that cross into Mexico each year.
Named in honor of “Doña Emeteria Martínez”, one of the founding mothers who passed away this year after reuniting in 2010 (after 20 years) with her missing daughter, the caravan is being accompanied and organized by various migrant rights organizations such as Movimiento Migrante Mesoamerican (MMM), human rights activists, and religious organizations.
Much of this year’s route focuses on the “Pacific route”: passing Guadalajara, Jalisco; part of the Gulf route, passing Tabasco and Veracruz; and crossing the central and southern states such as Chiapas and Oaxaca. Organizers are targeting foco rojo (flashpoint) zones where migrants riding the beast (freight train) are often kidnapped, murdered and extorted by organized crime or even corrupt migration and law enforcement officials.
Anita Celaya, a mother from El Salvador whose son disappeared 11 years ago crossing Mexico for the US, expressed in an event organized by the online magazine, Desinformémonos on December 9th, “It is incredibly difficult knowing everyday that your son is missing, but what is worse is when you come here to Mexico and see the conditions and the horrible things that migrants go through and endure.” She went on to say that “there is a fusion between the criminal gangs and the migration authorities…we don’t need to talk more about organized crime, but rather authorized crime.”
Along the route there are at least five re-encounters anticipated between the searching mothers and their missing children, along with cultural events, visits to migrant shelters, meetings with grassroots organizations in solidarity, and a potential meeting with Mexican lawmakers.
In a change from previous years, this year’s caravan was not granted full security or a police escort by Mexican authorities, rather partial security in some areas. However, the organizers and participants decided to carry on, understanding the risks.
“We have three main objectives: to find the missing, make visible the depth of the problem, and to denounce officials who have done little to protect migrants,” said Marta Sanchez, executive coordinator of the migrant rights group, Movimiento Migrante Mesoamericano, the main group organizing the caravan.
According to various independent accounts, more than 70,000 migrants have disappeared in Mexico since the beginning of the previous administration. Unfortunately, no official government account actually exists. All the existing official databases do not have the specific purpose of searching and documenting the disappeared. This is one of the reasons why the families of the disappeared and solidarity activists declare that the authorities have no will or intent in protecting migrants.
Sanchez also went on to say how authorities in the Central American countries, where a vast majority of the migrants are from, are also doing very little to protect the safety of their own citizens as they migrate northward. “There is no indignation on their part, their responses to the problem are far too minimal to its scale and depth,” she said.
Although the depth of the violence and scale of the forced disappearances is wide, Sanchez says the work and experiences of these caravans have produced substantial and concrete results. “When we started nine years ago we were alone,” she said. “Now more than a hundred organizations and countless individuals are helping us.”
The caravans have also produced concrete results regarding one of the primary goals: finding missing loved ones. “Over those past nine years we have found and reunited more than 200 people. We suspect that number to be higher since people often are able to get in contact with each other after seeing the media attention around our efforts, so we don’t have documentation,” added Sanchez.
Although members of the caravan have achieved receiving special humanitarian visas to search for their loved ones, there has been little gain in their objective to shift Mexico’s migration policy, which was presumably reformed specifically to help migrants two years ago.
In 2011 an immigration reform bill was passed, scrapping an outdated policy that made migration a crime in Mexico. The bill also reclassified the visa system, adding a new “visitor” status that former president Felipe Calderon (2006-2012) declared was a new addition for people such as migrants to have a legal stay in the country as they transited to the United States. However, when the president signed and enacted the bill, certain requirements were included to the “visitor” status that are nearly unobtainable to most migrants.
According to article 129 of the Migration Act, the applicant (of the visitors visa) must have sufficient funds to cover the amount of the costs of accommodation and meals during their stay in the national territory or have an invitation from an organization or a public institution or private establishment in national territory to engage in any activity in the country.
This requirement essentially makes it impossible for the majority of Central American migrants to obtain a visa and legally stay in Mexico, forcing them to continue to take clandestine, unsafe, and illegal means to travel through the country’s territory.
What the mothers on the caravan and migrant rights organizations are demanding is the addition of a “transitory” visa status to Mexico’s migration policy that would grant migrants with the intent to migrate to the United States, the possibility to travel through the country legally. However, recognized human and immigrant rights defender Bishop Raul Vera has expressed that the “migration law is controlled and won’t touch such a proposition, it is a joke where we haven’t seen any results.”
Finally, these mothers and their supporters are also trying to put a human face on this massive issue and to de-stigmatize the public perception of migrants.
“We want people to see that migrants are not criminals or narco-traffickers, but rather, sons and daughters with families that are desperately searching for them,” said Sanchez. “This has been one of the indirect achievements of these caravans.”Ground-water levels and potentiometric surfaces, Naval Air Warfare Center, West Trenton, New Jersey, 2000

Our practice focuses on helping people create health as opposed to just “fixing” disease. What does that mean? A health-centered dental practice helps identify the causes of disease to prevent them. We help you develop a plan to keep your teeth for a lifetime, based on your current condition and your ability and willingness to take care of your teeth properly. A disease-centered practice simply fixes your tooth or dental problem when “something happens”. This leads to more dentistry, more costs and less peace of mind that you are healthy.
However, even as a health-centered dental practice, we cannot give you dental health. Optimum dental health is what you create for yourself with great home care with brushing a flossing; a balanced healthy diet without too much sugar; and partnering with a dentist who will give you regular feedback on your home care and any changes in your dental health. The Dental Fitness Program, where we measure dental plaque and bleeding gums at every visit using a computer, is our way to give you regular feedback on how you are doing to keep yourself healthy. In addition, optimum dental repair is a choice you make to allow us to provide you the longest lasting, lowest risk dental treatment that you can maintain and afford.
So what does this have to do with retirement? If you made it into retirement with good dental health, it is because of what you have been doing up to that point – keep doing the same things to maintain good dental health. Yes, if you need some older dentistry updated and want to take advantage of dental insurance, the time prior to retirement may be a good time to do this. But coming in less frequently after retirement because of losing dental insurance presents some real risks.
Some people who see us less frequently in retirement have what would have been small problems develop into big problems, which becomes more costly to repair than it would have to just maintain the same preventive care schedule they had prior to retirement.
You worked hard your whole life and deserve retirement. If part of the joy of retirement involves eating what you want; having a confident smile; and keeping the good dental health you have had, then keep doing the same things for good dental health you did before retirement – good brushing/flossing; having quality dentistry when needed; and keep regular visit so we can watch out for you.You have no items in your cart

On the morning of 22nd September 1964, Robert Jacobs prepared to oversee a test launch of an Atlas missile. It was perfect conditions for viewing any aerial object in the sky. While it was still dark on the ground, objects at a certain altitude in the sky above would catch the rising sun’s light and glow magnificently against the still dark background. And what’s more, this is the case for objects hundreds of miles away.
These conditions were very much present on this morning. And further still, only if viewed from one spot – Big Sur, to the “north and west of Vandenberg”. The brief that Jacobs and his team were working too was to get “side-on” shots of the missile launch and more specifically its climb and “stages of flight”. Specifically, Jacobs would state that their mission statement, in part, was to:
… (provide information) on the minute events following propellant depletion – at a distance of from 300 to 800 nautical miles!
In fact, so serious was the desire to capture such fine and detailed imagery that the Boston University telescope was literally hauled onto a truck and transplanted to a very specific spot at Big Sur.
Incidentally, we should note that Jacobs was unsure of the exact date, but subsequent research suggests the 22nd September is accurate. Whatever the date, the events that would follow were very real. And what’s more, according to Jacobs, would “inspire an official government cover-up and provoke an investigation and search for the filmed record”. A search which continues still.
Missile And Anti-Missile Technology Against The Back Drop Of The Cold War!
The small team gathered at a safe distance, ready to watch the events they were about to record on the monitors. The launches themselves were part of the Nike-Zeus project, which looked to develop “anti-missile” technology – at least officially. Against the ever-present threat of the Cold War, such experiments and projects would face very little questioning.
The team could hear the mechanical-like countdown for the launch of the Atlas missile. Then: Ignition…..lift off…..
And with that, a blast of flames and smoke burst out from under the missile before it began its steady ascent. All eyes, including that of the Bost University telescope camera, focused on the commotion. And what’s more, as was perfectly obvious to Jacobs and the team, as the missile traveled in excess of 100 nautical miles, the conditions and the focus of the shot could “not have been more clean”.
In fact, it was perfectly obvious that they had achieved their objective to the letter. As they shook hands, offering and accepting congratulations from each other, the 35mm film continued to film. Jacobs would take this film with him in the two metal “cans” to the processing laboratory back at the base. He would process the film immediately so it would be ready for his superiors to view the following day.
However, before he could bask in the sense of achievement that was quietly building inside of him, he would receive a phone call at his desk.
The Movie Projector And The Men In Plain Grey Suits
On the other end of the line was Major Mansmann. He would order Jacobs to the headquarters building where his office was immediately. Upon arriving there, Jacobs noticed two strange men waiting with Mansmann. He also noticed a movie projector, very purposely set up for this meeting in the middle of the room.
Each of the men donned “plain, gray suits” and although they said little, their presence was almost palpable. Within seconds of the office door closing, the lights dimmed, and the projector was clicked into action.
Artist’s impression of the Atlas rocket launch
On the wall from the light of the projector, the footage they filmed from Big Sur played. Despite the bizarre nature of the events unfolding, Jacobs remembers feeling a further sense of achievement at how clear the footage was. He continued to watch the footage. When it neared the end, however, Mansmann would tell him to “watch carefully now”.
He did and immediately saw what the men were drawing his attention to. He would state:!
Then, an already bizarre incident took an even more bizarre twist. At approximately the “four compass points of its orbit” this strange object emitted “four distinct flashes” towards the missile. In fact, the flashes, Jacobs would argue, must have had sufficient power and intensity as the flashes were clearly visible, almost like a “strike” which caused a “halo” to briefly form.
A “Classic Flying Saucer” That “Shot Down” An American (Dummy) Warhead!
Furthermore, as the object “departed the frame” back in the direction it entered it, Jacobs could see it was “a classic flying saucer” with a clear dome in the middle of the top part, from which the beams of light had emerged.
However, the missile itself, or more specifically, the warhead, “tumbled out of suborbit” falling to the ground. He immediately understood the gravity of the situation. As he would later state:
…This…unidentified flying…’thing’ had apparently ‘shot down’ an American dummy atomic warhead!
Jacobs would later attest his belief that the technology on display was obviously highly advanced. However, in the room, the lights would suddenly come on and Mansmann would enquire whether he or any of his team were “fooling around up there at Big Sur”. When he responded that this certainly wasn’t the case, Mansmann would ask, “Then what the Hell was that?”
It was then that Jacobs, perhaps without thinking, replied as a matter of fact:
It looks to me like we got a UFO!
The silence that would follow his statement was almost deafening in itself. Both of the mystery men continued to stare at Jacobs without saying a word. He noticed Mansmann looking at the men also. Then he turned his attention back to Jacobs, stating:
Let’s just say it never happened. You are to say nothing of this footage to anyone! As far as you and I are concerned, this never took place!
Jacobs flipped his attention back to the two men for a moment, perhaps hoping against hope that the whole situation was some kind of bizarre joke. Their rigid, serious manner told him it wasn’t.
The “Most Fantastic Event Of My Life” That “Did Not Take Place!”
Jacobs wasn’t sure how long he sat there staring into space. It could have been a few minutes. It was most likely only a few seconds as he relayed everything that had happened over the last 24 hours to this very surreal moment now. He couldn’t escape the feeling that what was “the most fantastic event” of his life was something he was being asked to not only keep secret but to deny altogether. NOTE: The above image is CGI.

"It brought back a lot of stuff, and when I saw the camera film of my mother and father, it was very scary. My heart just dropped to my stomach," Jordan Turpin, 21, told "Good Morning America" on Monday.
"But I'm just glad that it's out there," she added, so "people know that they have a voice and they can speak up if something's not right."
The Diane Sawyer special event, "Escape From A House Of Horror," is now streaming on Hulu.
WATCH: GMA Interview with the Turpin sisters
The eldest Turpin sibling, 33-year-old Jennifer Turpin, said "there's always a way out, and I hope people get that from our story. There's always hope, even if it feels like there's none."
Nearly four years ago, Jordan Turpin escaped her parents' Perris, California, home, where she and her 12 siblings were subjected to brutal violence and deprived of food, sleep, hygiene, education, and health care.
Early one morning in January 2018, the then-17-year-old broke free with a deactivated cellphone to call 911.
"My whole body was shaking. I couldn't really dial 911, because --" Jordan told Sawyer, through tears. "I think it was us coming so close to death so many times. If something happened to me, at least I died trying."

Her parents, David and Louise Turpin, are now serving 25 years to life in state prison after pleading guilty to 14 felony charges, including torture and false imprisonment.
Jennifer Turpin, who helped her sister prepare for the escape, said she was "so proud" of Jordan while watching the Sawyer interview, and able to hear Jordan's harrowing 911 call and see her conversation with the responding officers via body camera.
"I think that's why I cried the hardest," she said. "I couldn't have been more proud."
Jordan Turpin said the support they've received from the public "means so much to me."
"My whole life I thought that I didn't matter and I wasn't loved," she said. "I've always had my siblings and only my siblings. So when I see other people care about me, I don't even know what to think. It's hard for me to process."

After their arrest and conviction, the Turpin children were left to pick up the pieces and grapple with starting new lives after spending years locked away from society.
While public donations poured in to help support the kids, some say they've been left in the lurch by California's social services system.
"There are resources for them that they can't access. They're living in squalor," Mike Hestrin, the Riverside County district attorney, told ABC News, referring to some of the adult children. "They're living in crime-ridden neighborhoods. There's money for their education -- they can't access it. They have been victimized again by the system."

Despite the ongoing struggles to get on their feet and forge paths forward, Jennifer and Jordan Turpin said they are determined to make themselves the heroes of their stories, and not the victims.
Jennifer Turpin is working at a local restaurant and is writing Christian pop music she hopes to share with the world. She also dreams of being a published author.
"I have my own place, I recently got a car," she said. "I have an adorable kitty cat and bunny. I love my job, even when it gets hard."
Jordan Turpin received her high school diploma in one year and is now taking college classes. She said she hopes to become a motivational speaker.
"My whole life has been so hard for me to understand why, you know, why everything has happened," Jordan Turpin said. "If I can use what I went through to make a difference in the world, then I think that can heal me."

Marital life between another man and a Far east girl is definitely not as unusual as it accustomed to be. It is also considered to be more widespread than relationships among local Chinese. Nevertheless , it is still regarded as being very rare instead of something common. The internet has made it easy for the western men to find Chinese girls who wish to get married to foreign guys.
Many years ago, it was actually very difficult with respect to the Oriental ladies to find their own husbands, because what are chinese women like; how to meet chinese women; what chinese women want men originated from all over the world and finding a man outside of Cina was extremely difficult. Today, when using the internet and all the modern ways of communication, the finding a Chinese wife with respect to marriage is simpler and more rapidly. Today, you will discover online websites where western guys can content their background and photographs. There are also many websites that allow the Chinese birdes-to-be to upload pictures of themselves, so that the foreign guys can see them.
Many of these websites likewise have a chat room, which allows the westerners to directly contact the Chinese women, individuals ladies who are willing to get married to foreign men. This makes it easier intended for the foreign men, because they just do not have to go through the traditional customs like asking the Oriental girls i believe, or perhaps through the wedding party bureau. Through the Chinese online dating services, the foreign guys can make fresh friends and establish a friendly relationship with the Chinese women of all ages. When this marriage happens, the groom could offer his girl a nice dowry, which might boost up the monetary status for the family.Turbo yellow.

Most of us disliked that class quite a bit growing up, and none of us came away from it with positive feelings about sports or exercise in general.
There were many different reasons for those reactions, but the biggest ones had to do with our complete disinterest in sports and lack of athletic prowess in general.
This is a real shame. Physical Education teachers have a golden opportunity to show students how to stay fit regardless of how coordinated or athletic they might be. I empathize with how difficult it must be to get kids interested in gym class if they show up already expecting to hate it, but I’d also argue that there are a lot of changes that could be made to the way P.E. classes are run that will make them far more appealing to kids who aren’t athletic and who don’t think of exercise as a fun activity.
Today I’ll be sharing those recommendations. If there are any gym teachers reading this blog, I’d be quite interested in hearing your response to this post. These are the six things that I wish my gym teachers had done differently when I was in their classes.
Explained Why It’s Important to Exercise
My English teachers regularly explained why it was important to know how to write a grammatical sentence or be familiar with certain authors. They used examples like writing a formal letter or understanding certain literary references that the vast majority of adults know.
My math teachers told us how equations helped you save money or solve problems as an adult. They used examples like figuring out how much a sale item will cost after the 30% discount or calculating how many gallons of paint to buy when you repaint your living room.
None of my gym teachers ever made the connection between what they taught in class and what we’d need to know in order to function well as adults. We played endless rounds of basketball, football, volleyball, and other sports without hearing a single word about how exercise strengthens your heart, builds your muscles, burns calories, or reduces your risks of many different diseases.
It was like being given an equation that didn’t make sense and then never being told what the real answer should have been.
Because I said so isn’t a persuasive or helpful response in these scenarios. Kids, and especially teenagers, are smart enough to be told why they’re being expected to do something. It might be a while before they come to fully appreciate these lessons, but I think that explaining the reasons for gym class would go a long way to encouraging reluctant students to change their habits.
Taught Us the Proper Form
I wasn’t the most coordinated kid in the world, so I’m definitely not going to lay all of the blame on the injuries I regularly received in gym class on the teachers.
There were multiple times when I sprained fingers or got bruised up in gym class.
Yes, some of them were true accidents that could have happened to any child.
With that being said, I do think I would have been injured much less often if we’d all been taught the proper posture for the sports we were playing and if someone had corrected my posture if it still wasn’t right.
This never happened once in all of my years of attending public school. As an adult, I sympathize with my teachers for being responsible for the physical education of so many kids. I don’t think we should expect perfection from teachers in this area, but I do think they should have the support and resources to prevent as many injuries as possible.
Eliminated Dodgeball and Picking Teams
Dodgeball is the only sport I can think of where the purpose of it is to throw balls at people and purposefully hit them. I don’t know about you, but I remember feeling pain when those dodgeballs smacked me. This was not a pleasant experience in any way.
It’s one thing if a small group of friends decide to play this game at recess, but school isn’t an appropriate place to make kids to throw objects at each other.
If it happened in any other context, the kid who threw the object would be sent to the principal’s office and possibly even suspended or expelled for assault.
Picking teams is unnecessary, ripe for bullying behaviours, and a waste of time. It would be so much faster to divide the students by preassigning groups or having them count off (e.g. 1 through 4) so they could quickly be divided into four equal sections.
Spent 1/3 of the School Year on Non-Competitive Sports
Yes, I know that many schools have limited budgets for their physical education departments and therefore can only offer certain types of workouts to their students.
The schools I attended didn’t have anything fancy like swimming pools or tennis courts. We had gyms that always smell faintly of perspiration, plenty of old sports equipment, and far more wrestling mats than we knew what to do with.
With that being said, there are plenty of inexpensive and even free types of exercise out there that don’t require any competition at all.
For example, there would be little to no equipment needed at all for a P.E. teacher to teach martial arts or several different units on various types of dancing. The music for the dance classes could be piped in over the loudspeakers or played on an old boombox. Many types of martial arts don’t require any equipment at all.
Spent 1/3 of the School Year on Individual Sports
One of the reasons why I hated gym class so much growing up is that 95% of the units we did were team sports.
Basketball, volleyball, baseball, football, and hockey might be good workouts, but they didn’t appeal to me in the least. The more I played them, the less open I became to exercising at all.
While I do think it was a good idea to expose kids to team sports, I’d also argue that it’s just as important to show students the many ways they can work out that have nothing at all to do with competition or teams.
There are so many other ways to strengthen your heart and body that could easily be taught to students depending on their ages and what types of equipment are already available at the school: yoga, weightlifting, jogging, bodyweight exercises, and gymnastics to name a few.
The final third of the year could be dedicated to various team sports. Some kids honestly do enjoy those forms of exercise, so I’d be fine with keeping them as a small part of the curriculum.
Occasionally Given the Students a Say
This is by far the biggest change I’d recommend making to the way physical education classes are currently run.
My high school Spanish class was allowed to vote on which pre-approved Disney movie we wanted to watch after we’d studied that language for a while and were reading to start practicing our listening skills in real time.
One of my elementary school teachers regularly let us vote on which pre-approved book to read as a class next. This would be a little trickier to do in high school since certain authors are often required to be taught, but I could see a secondary English teacher narrowing down the choices to two or three Shakespeare plays and then seeing which one their class was most interested in studying over the next month.
Being able to have a say in those classes made me much more interested in reading those books and watching those movies.
There’s no reason why gym teachers can’t offer their students the same choice. Why not let them decide whether they’ll spend the next few weeks playing basketball or learning how to square dance? They’ll be exercising either way, and the fact that the teacher listened to them will mean a lot.
What were your experiences with gym class growing up? What could your P.E. teacher have done differently to get you more involved in that class?President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday extended his deadly drug war until the last day of his term in 2022, but conceded the police force acting as his frontline troops was “corrupt to the core”.
Thousands of people have died in the crackdown that began when Duterte took office in the middle of last year, with rights groups warning police are carrying out extrajudicial killings not just to fight crime but to aid their own corrupt activities.
Duterte won the presidential elections largely on a law-and-order platform headlined by a vow to eliminate the illegal drug trade in three to six months.
Once in office Duterte extended the timeframe until March of this year, but on Monday he said there would be no end while he was in power.
“I will extend it to the last day of my term,” Duterte told reporters.
“March no longer applies.”
In the Philippines, presidents are allowed to serve only a single term of six years.
Duterte has been unrepentant in the face of fierce criticism of the drug war from various Western governments, UN agencies and rights groups, saying he must take extreme measures to stop the Philippines from becoming a narco state.
However a series of scandals involving the police using the drug war as a cover for extortion, including the abduction and murder of a South Korean businessmen, have fuelled fears that rogue cops are on the rampage.
Police chiefs had repeatedly insisted in recent weeks that those crimes were isolated cases, and that they did not signal a larger problem.
However Duterte said on Monday he believed almost 40 percent of all police officers around the country were involved in graft.
“You policemen are the most corrupt. You are corrupt to the core. It’s in your system,” Duterte told reporters as he railed against the officers who allegedly masterminded the murder of the South Korean businessman.
He said he wanted to “cleanse” the police force by doing a review of all the police officers that had previously been involved in extortion.
However Duterte had previously insisted on many occasions he would not allow any police officer to go to jail for killing people in the name of his drug war.
He also said last year he would be “happy to slaughter” three million drug addicts as part of his crime war.
Police have reported killing more than 2,500 people they have accused of being drug suspects, while nearly 4,000 others have died in unexplained circumstances in the crackdown, according to official figures. (Agence France Presse)Go sports!

I always liked to spend my spring break “resetting” myself for the second half of the semester. Because of COVID-19, so many schools are canceling spring breaks all together. My university took this route and man am I struggling. Schools assumed that we didn’t need the week off because we clearly wouldn’t be traveling, but did they think about our mental health?
Personally, I’ve been feeling so overwhelmed and restless without time off. Maybe it’s the extra boatload of assignments we’re being given due to being online, or maybe it’s the constant work going into self-teaching every chapter for every class. Who knows? One thing’s for sure- this is exhausting.
I thought to myself, “how can I get the benefits of spring break without having a spring break?” And here’s what I came up with.
1. Have an off-the-grid day
This one is hard for me, I’ll be honest. With everything I do being internet-oriented, it’s hard to convince myself to take a day off. But my eyes need it and so does my mind. Take a day without phones, computers, or televisions. Maybe read a book or color a picture. Just give yourself a break from all that blue light!
2. Freshen up your wardrobe
One of my favorite parts of seasons coming and going is changing up my closet. I used to love fall the most, but I think spring is really getting to me. I love this weather! Give yourself a little shopping spree (thrifting is my favorite) to spice things up and give yourself something new to be excited about.
3. Grind it out quickly
If your instructors upload your classwork ahead of time, try to get it all done early so you can spend a few days toward the end of the week to yourself. I typically try to get all of my super important or time consuming assignments done early so I have less worries before the weekend. Sometimes this doesn’t come easily, so be sure to plan ahead!
4. Open the windows
I know this sounds silly, but I’ve realized that I find the most joy when I can get a fresh breeze. Since we’re in that weird transitioning season, some days are more appropriate than others for Mother Nature to make her way into your home. I love to open the windows and give myself a little dance break filled with my favorite songs before cracking open the books. It wakes me up and gives me the energy I need to have a successful day.
5. Go on a study date picnic
Just like in number 4, fresh air is key. If you’re stuck doing school work, call a classmate/friend and go on a socially distanced study date at a local park. Pack a light lunch or a snack and get some notes in. You can also get some really cute picnic pictures while you’re at it!

This is the Code of Chivalry as observed in House Hammered Raven.
Honor: Honor First.
You won’t really find it in a dictionary anymore. Its gets discussed by college sophomores reading THE ILIAD for the first time, then it gets dropped as being an impossible philosophical construct. “Is it honorable to steal bread to feed a starving child?” There are a hundred catchy, pretty phrases and no explanation.
Honor is the idea that some ideas and values are so important that we would choose extinction rather than betray those values. Perhaps the value itself is unimportant and what is vital is that we hold it passionately. For one man, honor might demand that he steal before he lets an innocent suffer. For another, honor might demand that he let innocents die before he steals.
Rather than simply bearing witness, Honor is that impulse that demands we act when we see what is Right. And Honor is the impulse to stand silent as a witness when that is what Right requires.
Prowess: Train constantly. Your strength and your prowess are all that stands between the Right and the Adversary.
Without the virtue of prowess, all other virtues are irrelevant. If a man is unable to strike down an enemy, then it is not mercy that stays his hand but simple weakness. Prowess is the virtue that provides a knight with the means to change the world to suit his own desires.
Without prowess, a man’s desires are meaningless as he cannot act on those desires. Your desire to feed the poor, clothe the naked, establish schools and courts will count for nothing if it is not matched by an ability to stay the hand of those who intend to remove those things.
Honesty: Always speak the truth.
I’ve been told this tenet can be a cruel one that defies mercy. I see that point, but I disagree. There are often truths that are unpleasant to speak, but when you hold your silence, it is not for the sake of the other but for your own comfort. There are truths that cause suffering. And when you speak that truth, you must be prepared to stand and share that suffering.
To lie doesn’t avoid an unpleasant truth, it merely delays its uncovering. Perhaps, when it is uncovered, the hearer will be in company less comforting than your own.
Courage:.
Mercy: Protect the weak. Defend the innocent.
Just as we prevent the suffering of others through our pursuit of the right, we seek to inflict no more suffering on the wrong-doer than necessary. This is one reason why prowess is the foundation of chivalry and why chivalry can only be pursued by warriors.
Mercy takes many forms, but it is never the simple over looking of errors and mis-deeds. We confront and defeat the weakness and ignorance of men, but we do not always need to defeat the man himself.
Humility: Praise the worthy deeds of others as you seek to emulate their virtues, but do not boast of your own.
If you are spending your time in the proper company, there will always be others to speak of more highly than yourself, and there will always be others speaking highly of you as they learn the code through watching your actions.
When we boast during sumbel, remember that those supporting you will be affected by your aspirations. Always push the limits of what you can do, but remember that if you push too hard and fail, your burdens fall to another.
Generosity: Gluttony and greed are marks of cowardice.
By taking up arms.
Justice: Seek justice for others without thought of your own gain.
What is good and right is always under assault by weak and ignorant men. Through our words and deeds, we seek to temper the harm done by those who act against the Right. We seek to set two examples. Of course we hope through our actions to inspire others to seek the Right, but we must also conduct ourselves in such a fashion that such men know that acting against the Right in our presence will be met with credible opposition.
If there are those who imagine that they can act in defiance of what is Good and Right in your presence, then you should reflect on how you have failed. Do they not respect your prowess? Or do they question the sincerity of your commitment?
But justice is a terrifying thing when we truly examine our own lives so we must temper that pursuit of justice with mercy.
Honor: Honor first.

The most important part is changing the name so in the public mind we can begin the two as the same, which they are.
The changes are expected to be a step towards formally merging NI with income tax, in an effort to make the taxation system simpler.

The interaction and contact between different generations has become an important topic in maintaining modern family relationships. As a matter of fact, aside from blood relationships, maintaining intergenerational relationships also requires emotional support, personal trait influence, bilateral interaction and mutual trust.knowledge)
In order to evoke the Taiwanese people’s emphasis on intergenerational interaction and to care about their grandparents, the Ministry of Education has promoted Grandparents’ Day since 2010 to advocate the passing down of family culture and heritage, as well as to highlight the importance of grandparents and intergenerational interactions, so as to break the stereotypical impression of the grandparents as the “Caretaker of Children” in modern society. Moreover, the objective is to reinforce family relationships. Through courses and events, the three primary objectives such as Promoting Grandparents’ Day, Stimulating Intergenerational Communication, Interaction and Intergenerational Learning will be achieved, so as to provide a substantial approach for intergenerational interaction, in turn enhancing the ability for good intergenerational interaction and create happiness and wonderful time between the generations. By organizing the Grandparents’ Day series events, the goal is to create good intergenerational interaction atmosphere, enhance the exchange of affection and promote a more intimate intergenerational relationship, thereby creating a happy, successful and harmonious family life.Are you looking for services relating to the repair and maintenance of industrial roller shutter doors Glasgow?

This paper will present a project that proposes to compare digital literatures in a range of languages and cultures, including Western and non-Western traditions, in order to examine to what extent and how linguistic and cultural specificities continue to exist in the digital space, what boundaries may distinguish digital literatures from one another, and how these literatures interact with one another.
Scholarship on electronic literature has so far largely focused on how works use technology and are determined by it, with little attention to the role of their linguistic and cultural background. Yet a number of archives and collections show the growing proportions of works especially in Spanish, Polish, French, and German, and the works of migrating authors also often visibly carry the traces of their first language and culture. Moreover, a number of accounts have been published in recent years on the electronic literature of specific geographical, cultural, or linguistic spaces, such as Francophone electronic literature, digital literature in Latin-America, Arabic electronic literature, Polish, German, etc. While these always point out the importance of technology and international influences, they also testify to the fact that there remain clear differences in historical developments and emphases. The series of panels on linguistic and cultural specificities in the present conference also highlights the fascinating range of factors that can be considered and their relevance to e-lit scholarship.
A funding application is currently in preparation for a project including a series of conferences and publications that will allow us to develop a methodology for comparing and contrasting digital literatures considered in their plurality. By presenting the theoretical foundations and objectives of the project, the paper is also meant as a call for expressions of interest to participate in the project.These 31 dividends are more than just safe.

The she-wolf ran through the woods, her amber eyes locked on the vulnerable prey. How stupid it is for you to be out this hour of night she thought. The animal stirred, likely sensing her presence. It craned its neck back, observing the dark surroundings. Unbothered, it returned to grazing. She moved carefully, making sure not to step on any stray branches or twigs. In a sudden, violent motion, she leaped through the air, landing only inches from her next meal. Before the animal had time to react, she snatched it by the neck, refusing to let go. Ah, the sweet taste of blood she thought. As she continued feasting on the dead carcass, a howl in the distance caught her attention. When she finished, she licked her lips, now wet with warm blood. Making sure no one was watching, she howled in return, the sound echoing through the trees. It came from deep in her throat, a sound she had perfected over the years. A full, yellow moon hung in the night sky. This common sight provided Lena some measure of comfort. Yes, Lena, that was her name. From the howl of her friend, she could tell something was wrong. By now, she had already begun her trek towards the cave, making sure to keep heightened senses. One thing she had learned since birth was to always be alert and ready to fight. This mindset had saved her on multiple occasions.
Lena made her way up the winding mountainside, beginning to worry if something was seriously wrong. Throughout the trip to the cave, she would hear sporadic cries. They were faint but still existed. As she approached the shady cave, this sound amplified, causing her to wince in pain. With her back hunched, she crept in, taking in the fresh smell of blood, much like earlier. An exasperated bark escaped her father’s mouth and all she could see was his mangled body. Scarlet red blood soaked into the dry dirt. She fell to the ground, overcome with shock. Frantically, she yelled out, hoping someone, anyone would come to help. For a brief second, she looked back towards the cave’s entrance, not expecting to be met with such a horrifying sight. Her father’s friend, Ramos, closed in menacingly. His coarse fur and jagged teeth made him the epitome of ugliness. Outside, Lena could hear a clap of thunder and heavy drops of rain began leaking through a hole in the cave’s roof. She didn’t even need to wonder who had killed her father. She knew it was Ramos: that sneaky, jealous bastard. Her father, the Alpha, had been savagely murdered and she refused to stand down. Puffing out her chest and digging her paws into the ground, she readied herself to fight, just like her parents had taught her years ago. With a swift motion, she lunged forward, pinning the large wolf down. His bright red eyes made her shudder. Caught off guard, Ramos was able to flip her over, clasping her throat in his rough paw. Gasping for air, Lena summoned all the strength she was capable of and broke free of his restraint.
As she exited the cave into the crisp night air, she could see a throng of wolves gathered by a large boulder. Each one stared at her intensely, a few letting out howls that served to warn others of the impending showdown. Turning back to the cave, she saw Ramos slowly coming into the light, a terrifying grin plastered across his face. Lena’s mother, Sabella, nudged her as if saying: please don’t fight, you could get killed! Disregarding her mother’s pleas, Lena began to circle Ramos, trying her best to intimidate him. This did little though because he just stared at her with an amused look on his face. Without any warning, Ramos rammed his bulky body into Lena, slamming her onto the muddy ground. For a few seconds, she drifted in and out of consciousness, only hearing the faint cries of the wolves around her. Without hesitation, her body picked itself back up, now more determined than ever. Just as Ramos was about to walk away victorious, she ran towards him full-speed, slashing her sharp claws into his face. He stumbled back, surprised by the she-wolf’s strength. Behind Lena, her mother and about 5 other wolves assembled in a triangular formation.
In the corner of Lena’s eye, she could see a steep drop off, an abyss of nothingness. This is where he belongs she thought. Ramos made multiple attempts to regain his strength but failed. The group of wolves huddled around him, ferociously clawing and biting at him. When he became just a hunk of meat, Lena grabbed him by the neck and dragged him towards the edge of the cliff. She nearly slipped but regained her balance. Jagged rocks and sharp thorns were ready to greet Ramos on his way down. After she shoved his body with great force, it finally gave way, falling into the pitch black. The moon lingered in the sky, still in its full glory.
The customary tradition after a chief died was to honor them. Lena’s father was pulled out of the cave and placed near a small flower bush. The wolves, even some tiny pups, gathered around to mourn the death of their beloved leader. They all howled once more, and Lena closed her eyes, imagining what it would have been like to say goodbye to her dear father before he died. Then she had a thought: her father would be proud of her for defending the pack. She adored her father and she had avenged him.

Roughly 49 of those are asking to renew or increase funds provided by taxpayers through property taxes for district operations, according to the Minnesota School Boards Association. The remaining 41 are capital requests to pay for infrastructure, technology or other investments.
In Ramsey, Washington and Dakota counties, there are six districts with a total of 10 tax requests on the ballot, according to the Association of Metropolitan School Districts.
Four of those levies are for money to pay for classroom technology, software, personnel and training. The other six are for district operations either in the form of levy renewals, replacements or new increases.
School advocates say these requests are relatively typical for an off-year election when not much is on the ballot besides some local races. However, the last 20 months have been anything but typical for public schools because of the coronavirus pandemic.
This is the third academic year in a row that’s been overshadowed by the coronavirus. COVID-19 has disrupted school and the way students learn more than any other event in modern history.
A COVID EFFECT?
Communities are divided over mask mandates, vaccines and other coronavirus mitigation measures. School board meetings in many districts have become contentious and more than 70 board members have resigned so far this year.
Scott Croonquist, executive director of the Association of Metropolitan School Districts, says some school leaders are worried controversy over pandemic restrictions could turn voters against routine funding requests. Before COVID-19, districts across Minnesota had strong support from voters for tax levies.
“That’s always a concern in our referendum elections,” Croonquist said, noting that districts are cautious to gauge the political mood before asking for money. “This year, maybe a little more so.”
Public opinion is increasingly important to understand, Croonquist and Kirk Schneidawind, of the Minnesota School Boards Association, say because local levies have become part of the bedrock of public education funding in Minnesota.
COSTS OF TECHNOLOGY
It’s long been the case for day-to-day operations as well as building maintenance and construction. Now, it’s a key way classroom technology is funded.
Roughly a quarter of capital requests statewide are for technology — something that was essential to navigating school closures during the pandemic. Yet there’s no long-term dedicated source of state funding for classroom tech.
RELATED: Here’s who’s running for mayor, city council and school board in east metro.
“If you don’t have a technology levy, you have to fund it out of the general fund,” Croonquist noted.
WHAT ABOUT ALL THAT FEDERAL AID?
District leaders also have to respond to questions about funding requests after Minnesota got more than $1.3 billion in federal aid to help schools recover from the pandemic.
Education advocates note the federal aid, in many cases, came with restrictions on how it could be spent. Much of it was focused on covering short-term costs associated with the pandemic, such as protective equipment, cleaning, air purifying and other responses.
“The federal money,” Schneidawind says, “was a temporary stop gap. A short-term fix in a pandemic crisis.”
The tax requests before voters next week have been put together to help districts establish more long-term security, advocates say. But it won’t be clear until the votes are tallied if residents see it that way.
“The mood? I wish it were better. But we are always optimistic,” Schneidawind said. “I think districts do a good job making the case.”
WHAT THEY WANT
Here’s a closer look at the districts with levies in Ramsey, Washington and Dakota counties:I thought I would share an article I wrote in Low Country Weekly Magazine. It is about fear, exercise and movement.
“A client recently told me that one of her friends is thinking of joining local a training facility, but the friend is afraid that she won’t be able to keep up. She worries that her body is too out of shape to get started. She has had a myriad of health concerns and is only in her 30s, but her fear of an exercise program is greater than her health fears at this point. Her fear of exercise is not uncommon, but it is an attitude that I would like to address.
The body is designed to move. In fact… it is designed to move a lot.
When immobile, the body malfunctions mentally, physically, emotionally and spiritually.
When the body is devoid of movement, signs and symptoms pop up – like disease, aches and pains, poor health, muscle atrophy, irritability, frustration, guilt, shame, back pain and even cancer.
Having taken thousands of people through training programs, I see people change their belief systems about their body’s ability all the time. I find that initially many people think their body is weak and fragile, and this can cause fear. This fear is destructive to growth and health.
A common barrier preventing people from engaging in physical activity or exercise and training is the fear of injury.
I think it is also important to acknowledge that people experiencing depression move less. Typically, the less you move, the worse you will feel; and the worse you feel, the more fearful you become. Low feelings permeate every aspect of our lives – from personal relationships to relationships with food.
When people are depressed, the biochemical reaction taking place can result in a total shutdown of body, mind and spirit. A way to combat this decline is by connecting your body to your brain through movement to activate the necessary neurotransmitters or “feel good” chemicals. Just movement will elevate the mood. Because of extensive research on this subject, exercise is the major weapon in the psychiatric arsenal, and it has been proven more powerful than any pill.
Individuals struggling with obesity or being overweight also move less. Research has found that at least 1 in 5 deaths are associated with obesity, and being overweight increases the risk of disease in general. The combination of being overweight and moving less is deadly.
This is the reason people find their body weak and fragile – because it becomes weak and fragile through less activity over time, and their confidence and self esteem declines.
The lack of movement can snowball into severe health issues, which can be compounded with a diet void of essential nutrients.
Movement through exercise is key to normalizing body weight, mental and emotional function, and by default, encourages more conscious eating habits.
Have you heard, “Sitting is the new smoking?” When you spend the majority of the day sitting, there is a lack of blood flow, nutrients, and energy within the body.
As a back pain relief specialist, I often see people associate a specific movement or moment in time with back pain. The truth is, if you have back pain it is rarely the result of one acute incident, but rather that of chronic incorrect movement patterns, inflammation, or general lack of movement for years, creating weakness in the muscles that support the body as a whole; and many times the culmination of that weakness ends up affecting the area with the most stress, the lower back. The key is to move more and to keep all the muscles strong, stable, mobile, warm and filled with new blood, oxygen and nutrients. Just doing that will prevent 90% of all aches, pains, and ills.
We know injuries are going to occur; it is pretty much a guarantee – part of life. For example, almost everyone at one point in time will experience back pain. We need to accept that fact and not let it deter us from engaging in life.
Just in the last couple of months we’ve had clients that injured themselves doing the most mundane things: laundry, moving in their sleep, pulling luggage, and making their bed. So it happens.
But… limiting your movement is the most dangerous thing you can do.
The key is, do not let fear freeze you into a state of inactivity. Minimize risk by ensuring your movements are safe and stable, and in a non-threatening environment. If you are just beginning an exercise program, be sure to progress gradually. The likelihood of injury increases when jumping too fast, too soon into an exercise regimen when you’re not prepared, or when you lack the knowledge to execute movements properly. Even though injuries can occur from time to time, the effects of not exercising are more harmful and devastating to your body. Move more and you will feel better, get stronger, be happier and more confident.”

Until next time, happy rendering!I’ve almost been with BizKidz for 6 months now, and how time has flown! During that time, I’ve hopped on a call at least once a week, sometimes twice, to help Cheryl out with business mentoring, which has lead to a few things being picked up along the way!
Through BizKidz, I’ve watched and supported loads of kids through the process of starting a business. I’ve seen them dream big, and reach and achieve their goals, time and time again. It is a hugely uplifting project to be a part of, and I can truly see that these kids are going to be hugely successful thanks to their entrepreneurial skills, and their initiative to nurture them from a young age. Kids as young as 7 are making similar sales to my own business, and that is incredible!
When I started with Cheryl I had a business that was essentially dead in the water. It was a business I started over lockdown and ended up falling out of routine with when it came to posting regularly and updating. I had a few Etsy listings, which had mostly run out, and that was pretty much it.
Watching the kids on our courses gather the courage to launch their own businesses and be successful absolutely inspired me to get my business going again. I followed the process a couple of times over, and I now have a fully operational website, complete with shop and subscription box! I’ve even gained the confidence to register with a wholesaler and branch out from handmade items to a much easier means of procurement.
I’ve also spent this six month period honing my writing skills, by writing this blog and almost all our social media posts. That’s about 25 blogs, and well over 250 social posts! I’ve also built and improved on multiple websites for Cheryl, complete with landing pages and more! This has built my confidence up, and I’m now happy to say that I’ve just launched my services as a freelance writer and VA!
So, truly, who knows what the future holds for me! I hope that it holds lots of writing jobs and sales, and a good connection to Cheryl for the future, and I wish her all the best for future projects and with BizKidz!
And to those who have consistently read our blog while I’ve been writing them, thank you very much!

It was the 1980s and new things were happening on campus. It was the decade when John Lennon was shot, the Berlin Wall came down and the war on drugs began.
In the Nov. 14, 1980 edition of The Eagle, an article titled “More Trophies Added” talked about the College of Eastern Utah speech squad bringing home loads of trophies. The squad was under legendary coach Neil Warren and known to be one of CEU’s most successful organizations. The squad traveled to Arizona for a forensics tournament and brought home five trophies and three other awards. It was the first tournament of the year and they performed well. They also placed fourth overall for team standings and Neil Peacock and Carr Harvey placed second overall.
Peacock was a returning letterman and was one of the top speakers at the meet. He placed second in extemporaneous speaking and won the second place trophy in impromptu speaking and third in persuasive speaking. Six members of the squad traveled to Pasadena, Calif., on the weekend of Nov. 7-9 for a competition; they brought home four trophies and nine other awards. That year, Peacock defended his first place by standing by a win over a Cerritos College veteran. He won three ballots in the final round and did an amazing job in the individual events, where he won a second place trophy in impromptu speaking.
In an article, “P.E. complex may be in the distant future,” talks about CEU’s physical education being moved up the State Building priority list to the ranking of 20 out of 33 state construction projects. Dean Walton, CEU’s administrative vice president said the total, including the physical education facility comes to $65.5 million. The college passed building projects at Weber State College and Utah State University on the State Building Board’s list.
CEU wanted to use bonds to pay for the new building. The last time the state approved a bond was in the early ‘70s for CEU’s Career Center. The cost of the new facility was $7.4 million and included an addition to the heating plant, the acquisition of the LDS Institute adjacent to the campus and Phase I of a physical education facility, which included a gymnasium, apparatus rooms, lockers, handball courts and offices.
An article called “New coach to use pressure defense,” talks about how 11 athletes were trying out for a starting position on the men’s and women’s basketball teams. Tryouts began Nov. 3, 1980. Athletes started the week with conditioning, where they ran one mile each day. They also run full and half court sprints and do weight training. CEUs new women’s basketball coach Kathy Miller hopes to have the team chosen by the end of the next week. The opening game was played at Western Wyoming College Dec. 8, 1980. Coach Miller said her team will use the fast break and pressure defense for the lack of height on the team.
Miller was a Weber State physical education graduate and named to the Region 7 Association for Intercollegiate Women’s Athletics (AIWA) all-conference basketball team in four years of competition. She was a first-round draft choice for the Milwaukee Does because of her abilities with basketball. She decided to coach instead of playing professional sports.
Veteran men’s coach Curt Jenson said that the Eagles are expected to be strong in the guard and forward positions. He said he is looking for more consistency in his two centers, Terry Bailey from Indianapolis, Ind. and Carlson Boudreaux from Sandy, Utah. Five lettermen returned to the men’s basketball team; they are Dale Ohlson, Paul Gasque, Kelly Newbold, Geno Lucero and the only returning starter forward, David Johnson. The first game of the season was Nov. 20, 1980 against Western Wyoming.Go to previous versions of this Article

He also said football prepared him to endure the rigors of becoming an astronaut.
"I think the football training in the NFL, that teamwork, that dedication, that discipline, you know, the hard practices, coming back from those hard practices and continuing to play is something that helped model the astronaut training program because it was long days, many years," Melvin said.
Now he's trying to inspire younger generations to also "chase space."
"My mission is to take the experiences that I had in space, seeing this incredible planet, going around every 90 minutes, seeing the sun rise and the sun set every 45, and bring that down to the classroom so the kids can say, 'Wow, I can do that. And that guy looks kind of like me. Maybe I can be an astronaut,'" Melvin said.

Dr. Gary Agena.
“I am very pleased to be able to bring this state-of-the-art technology to the community.” states Dr. Agena. “This technology enables the surgeon to operate through a small incision in the patient’s navel. In a matter of weeks, the dime-sized scar is virtually invisible, which gives our patients one of the most cosmetically appealing surgical results possible.” Prior to advances in laparoscopic and robotic surgery, women requiring hysterectomy could sometimes take weeks to recover, and they often had significant scarring on their abdomens. This single incision procedure can also be used for gall bladder removal.
The da Vinci® Surgical System uses breakthrough technology to offer a minimally invasive alternative for many complex surgical procedures. With single-site instrumentation, procedures are passed through just one port inserted through the patient's navel. This allows all the instruments for surgery, including a three-dimensional camera and two surgical instruments, to pass through a single, tiny incision. The more slender instruments, along with the precisely translated movements of the surgeon through robotic technology, enhance the surgeon's dexterity and make the surgery even less invasive for the patient. In addition to smaller incisions, the da Vinci® robot also provides benefits to the patient such as less pain, fewer side effects, a reduced risk of infection, a shorter hospital stay and a quicker return to normal activities.
“Dr. Agena is one of a very small group of surgeons in the region who have pioneered this type of advanced surgery,” states Bret Kolman, Lakeview Regional Chief Executive Officer. “The implementation of the da Vinci® system allows us to offer our patients a wide variety of minimally invasive surgeries with improved patient outcomes.”One of the most critical yet often undervalued sales functions is sales performance analysis. By continually monitoring your sales performance in terms of what you are achieving vs what you are intended to realize, you will be able to gain a holistic view of your current situation.
For the novices, sales performance analysis is a method of knowing where your business currently stands compared to where it wants to be in the future. The process utilizes several industry standards, performance, and other elements for comparison. When done right, it should show the gaps between the current state of your business and how it should be performing, as well as the possible root causes for the gap in between.
Simply put that it addresses the questions “Where are we?” and “Where do we need to be?”. These questions have to be answered as an organization grows. But why? As sales operations mature, the tendency to lose footing from its initial goals objectives is extremely high.
When the gap that exists in business goals, people’s performance, and organizational capability are bridged, a business can enjoy a plethora of advantages. Although gaps in these areas can be differently prioritized with different approaches, conducting an analysis of them bears the following significance:
- Gain Comprehensive Overview of Business Goals
- Better Decision Making
- Increase Stakeholder Satisfaction
- Boost Employee Motivation
- Improve Customer Relations
One of the best merits that this tool can provide is the enhanced employee productivity. By analyzing the performance of your sales team on key metrics such as the number of calls made, a number of client meetings scheduled, and a number of proposals sent, you can make the necessary adjustments on sales tactics they use, which can ultimately help them achieve the desired performance expected from them.
For instance, you might find that your sales representatives may no longer focus their time on building relationships with existing customers and peers, but rather on winning new leads. By performing sales performance analysis, you will be able to identify why your sales representatives have lost their focus, and finally implement a new strategy which will help them get back on track to success.
Furthermore, a successful sales performance analysis should be able to enable you to further solidify your engagement with your stakeholders. When the stakeholders – employees, suppliers, customers, media partners, investors – know that your business is heading in the right direction sales-wise, they are more likely to put their trust and confidence in your brand in the long haul.
If you do not measure your sales performance yet, then you are missing the opportunity to identify where your strengths lie within your product, and which sales activities require more support, and which ones provide the greatest potential for future profitable growth.
To learn the more on how to perform sales performance analysis, as well as the benefits it can provide to your business, check out below infographic provided by KONA a training and consulting provider based on Australia.

One of the ways people look to save money is by looking at their monthly outgoings. Often the first stop is by looking to cut down television subscriptions and unnecessary payments. Lots of people have gym accounts that they never use for example.
Another step people take is to look at making sure that they have the best deals on their utilities, such as energy bills, telephone bills and broadband bills. Money can often be saved by subscribing to several different services from the same provider, such as by combining TV and phone services.
Credit cards are often next on the list. Changing your credit card provider is a great way of securing cheap or interest free credit for a period on your outstanding balance. Saving money by transferring your balance to a new credit card company is a fantastic way to save money, but as with all things good, there is a caveat.
Lots of people are very disciplined; once the balance is transferred to the new company they cut up and dispose of their old card and close the account. Some however feel compelled to hold on to their old card “just in case” and this is their downfall.
Some of the people that keep their card in case of emergencies are perfectly capable of putting it away and forgetting about it. For a lot of people though, the temptation is too much to bear. An empty credit card is to some like having money burning a hole in your pocket.
Intentions may be good, but it is common for the thin end of the wedge to start at something like getting petrol for the car towards the end of the month before your payday. Then it could be to cover a bill to avoid late payment charges, or paying for a new tyre on the car etc.
Eventually for many the wedge gradually gets thicker, and before you know it you have double the credit card debt! I have met several people who have done the same, I know I was guilty of it and now I am having to repay 2 cards, so the initial saving of a balance transfer has actually cost me more money in the long run. Therefore, it is important to cut up that old credit card! Especially if you do not have an iron willpower.There the reason online dating stinks for men is not any facebook or twitter drawing,

Price: $1.99
Version: 1.00 cease to be amazed by the sheer volume of puzzle apps in the App Store. Our craving for brain teasers, word games, and match sets must be insatiable. With so many apps, there's also a lot of repetition; so when a truly novel puzzle app comes our way, it's worth taking notice of. Trainyard, from independent developer Matt Rix, is such an app.
The basic concept of Trainyard is simple: route color coded trains from departure point to the correct destination by laying out track. Sometimes, every train must arrive at the same destination; other times, you will need to manage crossing paths and switch tracks to get each train where it needs to be. As things get more complicated, you will even have to combine trains or arrange for them to change color in order to complete the level.
It's a clever concept, simple to grasp but with a lot of variety. Trainyard is a little slow to ramp up, but once you get into it there's a lot of fun to be had. Emphasis on the slow ramp up; it’s some forty-odd levels before the tutorials end and you hit the really challenging stuff. But once the game hits its stride, it's a whole lot of fun trying to figure out how to route each train. I never found the puzzles too daunting or tedious; like any good casual puzzle app, it was enough to get me thinking, but not enough to wrack my brains.
Traianyard is, perhaps fittingly, the kind of game you'll want to pull out on the train (or waiting room, or standing in line for the next iPhone).
The game's design is positively Spartan: black backgrounds, white line graphics with color only where it needs to be, and sound effects that barely register. These elements of the game don't exactly wow, but neither do they get in the way. It's the game play that carries this title along, and in that job it’s hindered only by its finer touch controls—the game isn’t quite as responsive as it could be, especially if you’ve got bigger fingers like mine. You might find track-laying to be somewhat finicky.
Still, you'll want to play, at least until you finish the offered puzzles. The designer has tried to build in replayability by means of a website where you can share your solutions with others and compete for the "best" solution. Since solved is solved in Trainyard, and there's no incentive for refining your solutions (say, bonus points for using less track or getting the trains there faster), I don't know how popular this particular feature will be.
All in all, Trainyard is an impressive first offering from its designer, with a neat new spin on the puzzle app. Puzzle fans should definitely check it out.- Not important at all

Sure, he’s a little kid — scouting reports and Pop Warner rules put Abney at less than 12 years old and no more than 120 pounds.
But still.
Yesterday afternoon, Abney scored all his team’s points and dominated on both sides of the ball like a latter-day Sammy Baugh in the Marshall Heights Bison’s 23-0 rout over the New Haven (Conn.) Steelers in the semifinals of the Pee Wee division of the Pop Warner Super Bowl tournament in Lake Buena Vista, Fla.
Abney had touchdown runs of 30, 70 and five yards, , and added a sack of the New Haven quarterback.
The win puts Marshall Heights, a team sponsored by the D.C. Department of Parks and Recreation, into Saturday’s title game.
Marshall Heights now takes on the East Bay Wildcats (CA) in the Super Bowl finals.
The other D.C.-proper qualifier in the Pop Warner tourney looks like it’s also rolling to a title.
Also yesterday, the Beacon House Falcons earned their way to the finals of the Jr. Pee Wee (11-and-under, 105 lbs. or less) with a 12-8 triumph over the Tustin (Calif.) Black Cobras. Beacon House, another DPR team, will meet the Sweetwater Ravens for the national championship.
The Pop Warner championships are broadcast by ESPN.
Marshall Heights and Beacon House teams have both won national championships in recent years, as have other kiddie squads based within the city.
The other area representative in the Pop Warner extravaganza, the White Oak Warriors from Silver Spring, crushed the Brookline-JP Patriots 31-0 in the semis of the Jr. Midget (13-and-under, 135 lbs. or less). White Oak goes against a Virginia Beach team in the title game.
But, back to Marshall Heights and Beacon House. The continued success of D.C.-proper youth football programs under the DPR-umbrella means we have to keep asking the questions: Why is D.C. high school football so lousy lately?
Also, should DPR take administration of D.C. public school football?
And, finally, does Vincent Abney have an agent?The Coffee Academics

After two weeks of tense negotiations at COP26 in Scotland, the world has a new international climate change agreement: the Glasgow Climate Pact.
The new document does not replace the landmark Paris Agreement, but rather bolsters it with increased clarity on key issues. One of the major stakes going into this year’s COP was a matter of degrees. The world is teetering on the edge of keeping alive the possibility of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Surpassing that threshold would be a death sentence for small island states and other vulnerable countries, and it all comes down to just how drastically nations are willing to cut their emissions. The pact gives added weight to the 1.5 degrees goal, and demands that countries do more to achieve it.
It also calls on rich countries to increase their financial support to help poorer nations adapt to rising seas and extreme weather, another priority for the meeting. And for the first time ever at a COP, the final text references “coal” and “fossil fuels” — the leading causes of climate change that were formerly taboo on the international stage.

From the present relationship styles in Asia, one that fascinates me personally the absolute most is internet dating. Using this comparatively more recent opportunity available these days, the Indian culture which has been notably restrained and abashed, even yet in larger urban centers, has fully embraced the dating tradition.
Whilst in the past, there clearly was a tremendously restricted test size to select from – buddies, peers, household connections – now the choices are practically limitless.
I was worried that when it comes to the dating scene in India, I might be out of touch – having lived in the US for the past few years when I was working on Letters to My Ex. Nonetheless, once I called my buddies who inhabit some other part of India, from big urban centers like Delhi and Mumbai, to smaller people like Indore and Ranchi, we realised that dating in Asia is obviously extremelyвЂ¦ Americanised. We, as a nation, will always be affected by western tradition, nonetheless it appears as if now, more than ever before, young Indians are following complicated dating styles predominant in the western.
ThereвЂ™s a chapter in Letters to My Ex focused entirely on experiences the protagonist, Nidhi, has on Tinder. She joined up with the dating website after a break-up, half-eager to go on, half-curious to discover just exactly what it’s all about, and this opens an innovative new globe to her instantly. This woman is subjected to most of these choices she hadnвЂ™t imagined before. Appearing out of a lengthy, severe relationship, Nidhi ended up being somebody who hadnвЂ™t even considered exactly just exactly what it might feel just like become with some body elseвЂ¦ after which there was clearly a entire realm of leads at her disposal.
Letters to My Ex by Nikita Singh; Harper Collins Asia
This type of opportunity modifications things. In a secretive society like ours, where dating is not anything people do openly so we love to conceal our feelings and do not speak about them, online dating sites arrived such as a portal to a different globe. oasis active Some sort of which had constantly existed all around us, nevertheless now thereвЂ™s a available home, in the shape of dating apps, available to you aren’t a smartphone. Which, in contemporary Asia, is pretty everyone that is much.
With internet dating, additionally come all sorts of complicated rules that everyone else is supposed to understand. It is like a language that everybody else talks but no body shows – you merely need to catch in as you are going. You have actually gotta discover the lingo to try out the overall game.
The essential typical one is probably “ghosting”. This is how you reveal desire for somebody, perhaps head out together with them a times that are few text one another on a regular basis, after whichвЂ¦ nothing. You then become a ghost, by entirely vanishing on it. They never hear away from you once again – no communication, no description, simply silence. While shocking to some, ghosting is in fact extremely typical, and contains turned out to be also appropriate at the beginning of phases of dating. The I-donвЂ™t-owe-them-anything mentality has bought out. Since bad as it really is while dating, individuals also ghost someone theyвЂ™re in relationships with. I’m sure, brutal.
Then thereвЂ™s “stashing”, that has be much more common aided by the increase of online dating sites. ItвЂ™s whenever youвЂ™re earnestly tangled up in your partnerвЂ™s social life, have met all of the significant individuals within their life, you have now been held a key, saved someplace. And since you met online, thereвЂ™s probably no connections that are common start out with. Hate to be the only one to split it for your requirements, but thereвЂ™s bound become secrets behind this stashing tooвЂ¦
ThereвЂ™s also “submarining”, in which you reveal fascination with some body, date them and things get fine before you disappear, cutting down all contact. Nonetheless,”, in the other hand, is merely vile. ItвЂ™s where people date you, but in the time that is same keep flirting along with other people, in order to have their choices available in the event they have dumped. So fundamentally, these people were never ever inside it. The fact with padding is it shows the mindset of the individual. This is the way they think, this is the way much they appreciate individuals and connections that are emotional ItвЂ™s all a game title for them.
Into the country that is tech-savvy you’dnвЂ™t expect “catfishing” to nevertheless prevail, but it does. Catfishing is when somebody produces an identity that is fake themselves to secure better dates. ItвЂ™s an exaggerated, psycho-level type of lying.
Though it appears comparatively innocent, “love-bombing” could be the worst of all of the. Love-bombing occurs when somebody showers you with love and attention within the start, which overtakes all of your life. The romance of it all hides the truth – there is a constant surely got to understand one another, learn if youвЂ™re compatible or perhaps not, before dropping.
TheyвЂ™re not brand new although these trends have new names. During the core from it, theyвЂ™ve constantly existed, ingrained when you look at the culture. TheyвЂ™ve simply been repurposed to suit the internet dating scene. Under this rebranding, lie the principles that are same folks have been doing terrible what to one another forever.
But does which means that weвЂ™re going to cease? That folks are going to get fed up with all of this and opt to be quit? Unlikely.
While you can find horror tales of heartaches everywhere, for almost any nine nightmares, thereвЂ™s one fantasy. One effective love story that trumps all unsuccessful people. And for some people, those chances seem reasonable. The majority of us arenвЂ™t shopping for the fantasy anyhow – weвЂ™re simply sampling because of these choices obtainable in abundance. And weвЂ™re perhaps perhaps not going to end any time soon.Reuters on Tuesday reported that three Indian scientists of an advisory group on Covid-19 vaccination did not back the Union Government’s decision last month to double the interval between two doses of the Covishield shot.
Last month, the health ministry increased the gap between two doses of the vaccine from the recommended interval of six to eight weeks to 12-16 weeks.
The Centre had said then that the decision was recommended by the country’s Covid Working Group and was backed by the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation.
But according to the report, three NTAGI scientists out of 14 “core members”, said the body did not have enough data to make such a recommendation.

As a manager, it’s your responsibility to get the most out of your team. You p...
"Sling allows businesses to schedule smarter instead of harder." - Bradley Knebel
Every manager is looking for ways to be more productive. Whether you manage your team face-to-face every day or from home, productivity is the key to your success. But how exactly can you go about maximizing your daily productivity? The experts at Sling give you 12 tips on how to be productive at work and home.
Along the way, we’ll talk about such issues as prioritizing tasks, getting plenty of sleep, using the 80/20 rule, avoiding distractions, and more. We’ll also show you why eating healthy food and drinking water throughout the day can keep you productive longer.
Incorporate all of the tips we’re going to discuss into both your home and work life, and encourage your team members to do the same.
For busy managers, there are very few things that can improve productivity like using the right tools. The Sling app, for example, makes it easy to:
These powerful features are available everywhere you work—on the web, on iOS, and on Android—so you and your team are always in sync. There’s no better way to improve your productivity at work or at home than with the power and flexibility of Sling.
Your mind and body are at their best first thing in the morning. Take advantage of this fact, and tackle your most challenging tasks at the beginning of your day. Save less-intensive work, like responding to email and attending meetings, for after you’ve completed the difficult jobs.
Resist the urge to get up and go straight to work. Instead, carve out some time in the morning for yourself.
Eat a healthy breakfast, exercise, read the news, mediate—whatever charges your batteries. You may have to get up a bit earlier than usual, but the rewards of improved productivity are well worth the effort.
It may seem counterintuitive to spend less time on a job, but taking breaks throughout the day actually improves productivity and focus. Start by taking a 10-15 minute break every two hours. Go for a walk, eat a healthy snack, or meditate outdoors. If you don’t see a rise in productivity, try taking a 5-10 minute break every hour instead.
Is the task you’re doing right now moving you closer to your short-term goals and benchmarks? If not, put it off until later. By focusing first on the things that matter the most, you can achieve more in a shorter amount of time.
Contrary to popular belief, multitasking is the death of productivity. Even trying to do two tasks at the same time can drastically reduce your effectiveness and efficiency.
Instead, dedicate all your energy and attention to one job. Get it done well, and then move on to the next task on your list.
Don’t leave your work week up to chance. Take 30 minutes Sunday night and plan your activities for the coming five days. But don’t worry; there’s no need to plan every minor detail. Simply fill in the major tasks.
For example, assign team tasks Monday morning, schedule employees for the next two months Monday afternoon, work on payroll Tuesday morning, etc. That way, you’ll be mentally prepared for the week ahead.
You produce 80 percent of your positive results with only 20 percent of your activities. That means that a large portion of what you do every day doesn’t get you closer to your goals.
By examining how you work, you can eliminate the activities that have very little effect on your productivity. You can then replace those unproductive tasks with work that will produce better results.
To help you stay productive, set time blocks on your smartphone or tablet when you focus on just one activity. For example, set a countdown clock for 50 minutes. Hit start, and dedicate those 50 minutes to whatever is most pressing.
When the alarm sounds, take a break and recharge your batteries. After the break, come back and do it again.
Interruptions and distractions are like multitasking: they’re the death of productivity. When you’re focused on a challenging job, turn off your phone(s), close your email app, let people know you’re unavailable for the next hour or two, and then shut your door (if you have one).
Taking these small steps will minimize interruptions and distractions so you concentrate on being as productive as possible.
Most adults need six to eight hours of sleep each night in order to be productive the next day. So turn off the TV, silence all your electronic devices, and get to bed at a decent hour so that you can come to work ready to focus and maximize your productivity.
You may feel like you’re firing on all cylinders, but your body is slowly losing fuel. That can have a dramatic effect on your focus, your thinking, and your productivity.
To combat this slow drain of energy, munch on healthy snacks between meals and try to drink at least four cups of water during an eight-hour workday.
Always look for ways to improve your productivity. Don’t get complacent and rely on what you did before. Keep tweaking your productivity practices to maximize your success.
If some these tips are new to you, don’t try to incorporate them all right away. Instead, pick one or two that resonate with you, and work on them until they become habit. When you’ve mastered the those, pick one or two more and focus on them for a few weeks.
If you find that a specific tip doesn’t work for you, scrap it and try something else. Remember, this is about improving your productivity, not checking off every item on the list. Find what works best for you and forget the rest.
With these 12 tips and a little practice, you can improve your productivity and become a master of your workday.

JAIPUR: A BJP legislator triggered a row in Rajasthan on Wednesday by calling some protesters taking part in the farmers’ agitation ”terrorists”, with the party’s state unit justifying her comments.
In a video clip on social media, Dausa MP Jaskaur Meena is heard purportedly referring to the new agri-marketing laws and the protest over them by farmers camping at Delhi’s border.
“Terrorists are sitting there and the terrorists have AK-47s with them. They have pitched the Khalistan flag,” she is heard saying.
The MP was unavailable on phone for comment.
Meena’s statement drew criticism from the ruling Congress in the state, which said people in Rajasthan are “ashamed” that they voted for her.
State Congress president Govind Singh Dotasra said the BJP’s vision was limited to getting into power, alleging that its veterans did not even want to liberate India from the British.
“The BJP has always been an anti-farmer party,” he claimed.
In an apparent reference to strikes against Pakistan after terror attacks in India, he said, “In the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP leaders won due to the valour of the army.”
“Now, people of Rajasthan are feeling ashamed that they voted for a leader with such a narrow mindset,” he added, apparently referring to Meena’s victory.
But state BJP spokesperson Ramlal Sharma justified her comment.
“MP Meena’s feelings were not wrong. She wanted to say that the kind of flags and slogans being raised at the farmers’ protest is wrong. Some people have entered the protest in the name of farmers,” he claimed.
He said the Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre is concerned about the welfare of farmers and is holding talks with them to resolve the issue.
Farmers from Punjab and Haryana have been camping at Delhi’s border for weeks seeking the repeal of the central laws enacted last September.
Farmer unions claim that the laws weaken the minimum support price (MSP) system.
But the government says they provide more options for farmers to sell their crops.It will come as no surprise to residents that High Wycombe has become one of the happiest places to live in the South East.
With its position in the Chiltern Hills, beautiful Georgian architecture and excellent schools, it’s no wonder the town is a cheery bunch.
High Wycombe also boasts a wide range of great leisure spots including The Eden Centre and The Wycombe Swan.
As well as being a stone’s throw away from the picturesque West Wycombe Park.
Rightmove’s annual Happy at Home Index placed High Wycombe as the fourth happiest place in the South East behind Tonbridge, Guildford and Winchester.
The survey asks residents how they feel about where they live based on ten happiness factors.
These include feeling a sense of community spirit, the sports activities, friendliness of people and nature.
This year the survey also found that lockdown has meant over a third of people now like their local area more than before.
While access to nature and green spaces, which we have on our doorstep in High Wycombe, is more important for home movers now when choosing where to live.”13 Sep Al-Bahlul, Conspiracy and the Subject Matter Jurisdiction of Military Commissions
I will delay any detailed response to Kevin’s typically insightful posts about the CMCR’s recent decision, particularly its conclusion of a “substantial showing” that conspiracy to violate the laws of war is “an offense against the law of armed conflict.” For now, I will note that I have some similar concerns to those Kevin expressed (e.g. on the relationship or relevance of joint criminal enterprise and criminal participation liability to conspiracy liability).
In fact, I am highly suspect of any claim that customary or conventional laws of war (not including the Rome Statute) affirmatively sanction the punishment of inchoate violations such as conspiracy, attempt or solicitation. Prior to the Rome Statute, relevant treaty law addressed only completed violations. For example, the 1949 Geneva Conventions (GCs) and their protocols require states to impose a penal sanction only for completed grave breaches. The Nuremberg IMT and ad hoc tribunals offer no real support for inchoate liability. Interestingly, though, the Rome Statute includes both attempt and solicitation liability/responsibility, in Article 25 (b) & (f), respectively. It also includes liability for those who “in any other way contribute to the commission or attempted commission” of a war crime. Article 25(d) (emphasis mine).
For these reasons, there appears to be an open question regarding whether international law permits the use of the other domestic modes of inchoate criminal liability to punish non-nationals for extraterritorial violations of the law of war. Exploring this rather complex issue requires retracing the origins of law of war violations and their punishment.
States have punished law of war violations by adversaries and their sympathizers since long before there were international laws affirmatively requiring or authorizing it. The law of war prior to the 1949 GCs was understood to permit punishment of captured members of enemy forces as well as certain hostile civilians for violations, and indirectly required punishment – through the threat of reprisals and the command responsibility doctrine – of violations by members of friendly forces.
The 1949 GCs for the first time required states to impose a penal sanction for grave breaches (regardless of the nationality of the victim or offender), but all such punishment remained a sovereign act of the individual states party — a domestic crime with an international origin. Additionally, this new requirement to punish certain offenses did not immediately change the view that all violations of the law of war permitted punishment. This is why the 1956 U.S. Army Field Manual on the topic defined a “war crime” as “the technical expression for a violation of the law of war by any person or persons, military or civilian.” It continued, “[e]very violation of the law of war is a war crime.” Although the law being violated was international in origin, the sanction was necessarily domestic in character. This is consistent with Blackstone’s commentary on the topic, and also with the way that other violations of the law of nations by individuals, such as piracy, were traditionally punished.
Contemporary notions of “international criminal law” create the perception that customary or conventional international law must expressly or affirmatively provide for a criminal sanction for a given law of war violation. This is required, we are told, by the legality principle: nullem crimen sine lege, which is similar to our constitutional prohibition on ex post facto laws.
But is affirmative definition or identification of conduct as a crime in customary or conventional law truly necessary? If so, how could the customary law of international war crimes evolve or expand? All contrary state practice would necessarily be invalid under the legality principle (unless, perhaps, only nationals or territorial violations are prosecuted). Or is it the case that these traditional understandings provide adequate notice that states may punish all law of war violations? If the traditional understanding is that the law of war permitted such punishment, one could argue, the world is on notice and (an admittedly loose understanding of) the legality principle potentially satisfied. This would potentially leave us with two types of “war crimes” – those that are solely domestic crimes implementing lesser aspects of the laws of war and subject to standard constraints on prescriptive criminal jurisdiction (territoriality, passive nationality, etc.), and those deemed so serious that international law both requires punishment and permits the exercise of universal jurisdiction.
Both before and after the 1949 GCs, the subject matter jurisdiction of U.S. military commissions traditionally extended to all law of war violations against U.S. forces. As Kevin noted, though, it went beyond international law of war violations during the U.S. Civil War, including a conspiracy offense (and what seems to me at least one other inchoate violation) not clearly within that law. Colonel Winthrop’s commentary analyzed this vibrant domestic common law of war. He noted developments in both the substantive and procedural components of this common law in the decision-making of military commissions.
But the Civil War was an internal armed conflict. Thus, all such developments were, at best, domestic common law only. They were one state’s practice rather than customary international law. Such domestic common law doctrines and developments are fairly within the subject matter jurisdiction of military commissions from the perspective of U.S. law. However, their application to extraterritorial violations by non-nationals would implicate the legality principle and the constitutional prohibition of ex post facto laws, but only if not consistent with relevant international law.
For me, then, the key question is whether the application of this admittedly domestic criminal responsibility doctrine is consistent with international law. Does the earlier cited language of the Rome Statute reflect either customary international law or an applicable general principle of law? Does one “contribute to the attempted commission of . . . a crime by a group of persons acting with a common purpose . . . with the aim of furthering the criminal activity or criminal purpose of the group” by entering into a criminal conspiracy so long as the group ultimately makes a substantial (rather than merely any overt) step toward completing the offense? It at least seems plausible. I am, of course, very interested in what Kevin thinks about all of this (though I suspect that I know the answer).
Sorry, the comment form is closed at this time.Product Details

There are still 19 grammar faculties in London (eight for ladies, eight for boys, and only 3 mixed). I believe there are plans to repeat and lengthen the mission sooner or later, leading up to a more spectacular temporary set up in 2012. I certainly hope so, and i trust the palace will probably be allowed balloons next time. There have to be an awesome view from up top, wanting down at an oval of flattened earth now surrounded by blue portakabins surrounded by security fencing surrounded a few newly-buried concrete tubes surrounded by a pair of rivers. But what are the big unanswered questions? At the identical time, it’s a good suggestion to treat the accompanying signs of such pain.

It may appear like an unusual football kickabout area as we speak, however in 1851 this grassy expanse near the Prince’s Gate was the unique site of the legendary Crystal Palace.

I have all the time been very aware of my weight loss program, and I am someone who plans meals for the week on the weekend itself.

Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), in Edo State, Chief Dan Orbih, has mocked the state chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), as a party that cannot manage 24 House of Assembly members.
Orbih who said this last weekend while addressing journalists at the state secretariat of the party, said the APC that cannot manage its 24 state lawmakers has no business managing the state.
“It is clear that Edo people can now see for themselves that a party that cannot manage 24 people in the state House of Assembly has no business in managing Edo State.
“It is time for Edo people to embrace the PDP so that we can give the people of the state the government they deserved.
“We are hearing that a list of commissioners has been submitted to the House that is made up of nine or 10 members and where majority of the members are yet to take their seats in the House.
”Let APC realize that Edo State is bigger than the membership that constitute the numbers of their political party,” Orbih said.
The Edo PDP chairman also warned the embattled Governor of the State, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, not to nurse ambition of getting preferential treatment for the party’s governorship ticket if he decamps to the party.
Chairman of the party, Chief Dan Orbih, have the indication weekend in Benin, on the heels of rumours making round that the Governir was in talk with the PDP leaders in the south-south and its national secretariat, with the aim of decamping to the opposition party.
He said: “Even if Obaseki is coming to PDP, with his failure and rejection by his people, he won’t have preferential treatment.”
“Over the past few years, we have shown a difference between the PDP and APC, and I believed that many members of the APC, at one time or the other, have seen the difference between us and their party and have since joined the PDP.
“There is no doubt that there are many others who out of self-conviction will join us in future. But to be specific, I want to tell you very cleary, whether he [Obaseki] is willing to join us or not, he is the one you should ask the question.
“I don’t want us to start jumping bridge when we have not reached the river.
“As at today, Governor Obaseki is a member of APC. Agreed, they have their internal quarrel, but he hasn’t informed Edo PDP that he has the intention of joining us.”

Teenagers sang on the corner for pleasure and to attract girls, influenced by the Ink Spots, Mills Bros, Delta Rhythm Boys, other 'race' stars; then they rehearsed on the corner, or in an alley or in a tenement hallway for the acoustics, hoping to get a chance to make a record. The typical group sang four-part ballad harmony, with a high tenor (often with a sweet falsetto), a mellower second tenor lead, a blending baritone and a bass. Deborah Chessler, a young white Baltimore woman who worked in a shoe store, wrote songs but couldn't get them sung the way she wanted them; then in September 1948 the Orioles, a black singing group, had a no. 1 hit in the Billboard black chart with her 'It's Too Soon To Know', which Greil Marcus describes in retrospect as the first rock'n'roll record. An uncountable number of doo-wop records were subsequently made; few of them made much money at the time, but they are collectors' items today. There were more 'bird' groups: the Crows, Penguins, Ravens, Wrens, Flamingos, Robins, Cardinals, Meadowlarks (satirist Stan Freberg wrote that 'Rankled record buyers complained that after a while these records molted'); others named after cars: the Cadillacs, Lincolns, Coupe De Villes, V-Eights; also the Chords and the Cleftones, the Valentines, Valentinos, Valtones, Velons, Velvets, Veneers, Versatiles, Vibraharps, Vibrations, Vocaleers and Vocaltones. Inevitably there was confusion over names: Velvetones in NYC and Chicago; Vibranairs in Baltimore and Vibranaires in Asbury Park.
Among the best-loved who never had a hit big enough to reach the charts were the Harptones: the Skylarks '52 became the Harps, then the Harptones '53, when they first recorded; Willie Winfield, lead tenor; Nicky Clark, second lead and first tenor; Bill Dempsey, second tenor; Bill Galloway, baritone; Bill Brown, bass; pianist Raoul J. Cita could double as tenor or baritone. The Clovers had huge R&B hits 1951-9, the Platters were the first to have a no. 1 pop hit '55. The popular groups of the late 1950s-60s came out of the tradition: the Drifters, Four Tops, Temptations and the rest; see also Hank Ballard, Harvey Fuqua, Clyde McPhatter, Frankie Lyman. Relic Records had more than 80 doo-wop compilations available on vinyl albums in 1987; Street Corner Memories '87 on Ace celebrated the Italian-Americans, with tracks by the Orients, Vito and the Salutations etc; Doo Wop Box '94 on Rhino and Doo Wop Box 2 '96 are four-CD compilations; there are single CDs on Rhino, Ace, Specialty and Collectables. They All Sang On The Corner '83 by Philip Groia traces personnel changes in NYC groups; other books celebrate Chicago (Robert Pruter), Los Angeles (Steve Propes and Galen Gart); White And Still All Right is by Edward R. Engle, Doo Wop: The Forgotten Third Of Rock And Roll by Gribin and Schiff.Working with Metadata
Metadata is information about a contentTypes of content include HTML, XML Smart Forms, forms, polls, surveys, DMS documents, Office documents, multimedia, blogs, Web calendars, discussion boards, assets, and content imported from SharePoint. item, such as its title and language. Ektron provides extensive and flexible support for metadata, which is used in both standard and innovative ways.
<title>identifies the content in the screen title, favorites list, and browser history. Creating and deploying a Title tag definition
Best Practices
- When anyone creates a new Metadata definition, it is assigned the next available ID number. The ID numbers determine the order in which metadata definitions are arranged on the Folder properties screen’s Metadata tab. By planning ahead, you can enter metadata definitions in logical groupings, which make it more intuitive for the person assigning the metadata to pick the correct ones.
- You can use metadata as a search criterion for your website content, but the metadata definition name cannot include a space. Eliminate spaces from metadata definition names.
You define metadata in the Workarea at Settings > Configuration > Metadata Definitions, but you assign metadata in the Content area.
Prerequisite
Only Administrator group members and those defined in the Manage Members for Role: Metadata-Admin screen can view, add, or edit metadata definitions. See also: Using the roles screens
Use the Add Metadata Definition screen to define metadata (such as keywords and title). You can define as many instances of metadata as you wish. If your site supports multiple languages, you create metadata definitions for each supported language.
IMPORTANT: After creating a definition, you assign it to folders, whose content uses it. See also: Assigning metadata to a folder
To add a metadata definition:
IMPORTANT: You can apply additional languages only when creating a metadata definition. You cannot apply them when editing.
The following definition was copied from.
The META element is an extensible container for use in identifying specialized document meta-information. Meta-information has 2 main functions:
The following definition was copied from.
The title should identify the contents of the document in a global context. A browser may display the title of a document in a history list or as a label for the window displaying the document.
content="document management web content management content management cms"
Searchable metadata allows content to be found by a search phrase that you add to the content’s metadata. The content is typically found by either a website search or a Workarea search.
For example, each DMSDocument Management System; Ektron's way of managing assets (Microsoft Office files and other types of files) document has a unique part number. To let site visitors and Ektron users locate the document by its part number, you need to:
NOTE: Regardless of whether this is checked, content to which this metadata value is applied can be found using the Workarea’s Search Content Folder screen > Advanced Search tab > metadata field.
Also, if you have set up an Ektron search (using the Solr or SharePoint provider), Publicly Viewable and Searchable metadata is searchable if you use property queries.
NOTE: Child folders inherit from their parent folders by default. So you only need to apply metadata to the top-level folder, not all folders beneath it. See also: Inheriting metadata by folder
Ektron.Cms.Search.SearchMetadataPropertyclass.
You can set up a Web page so that whenever a source content item appears, related information appears next to it by associating the following types of content with a content item.
For example, your website sells motorcycle helmets. On a page that shows a particular helmet, the left column lists a collection of motorcycle drivers who wear that helmet. Another example might show the profile of a user when a certain content item appears.
Related content lets you connect a content item with several types of related content (see list above), and is associated with a content item, not a Web form. For example, you can display a library image of the company logo on a page whenever content in a certain folder appears. For content in a different folder, a different logo could appear.
NOTE: This capability is similar to the MetadataList Server control except that MetadataList shows a link to every content item with a selected term in the keywords or title. Also, a MetadataList is associated with a Web form (.aspx page), not a content item.
To create and deploy a related content definition:
IMPORTANT: If you are using Collection Selector type, only users with permission to work with collections can select a collection. Also, if you are using Image, Hyperlink or File Selector type, only users with permission at least read-only Library permissions can select a library item. See also: Managing folder and content permissions.
If you create a metadata definition, assign it to a folder, then users apply metadata information to content, the information takes on the characteristics of the metadata definition. For example, if the metadata is title and its type is HTML tag, this is how it appears in the Web page’s source code.
<title>CMS Developer</title>
If you later change its type from HTML tag to Meta, the following occur:
<title>CMS Developer</title>.
<meta name="title" content="CMS developer">.
NOTE: For information about metadata, see The Meta Element.
When you change the style of searchable property type metadata, Ektron attempts to maintain data stored in content that uses the definition. For example, if data style was number but you change it to text, the number stored in that metadata definition is converted to text and maintained in the content that uses it.
However, sometimes Ektron cannot maintain the data when you change the style. For example, if you change a metadata definition style from number to date, Ektron cannot convert those styles, in which case any data stored in metadata definitions is lost. Data is maintained in the following conversion scenarios; data is lost for other conversions.
When you change metadata definition's style, the screen lets you use existing data (if possible) or the default value. Following these choices is a field that lets you define a default value. If you want to replace existing data, select Use default value and enter the new value in the Default field. If the data is convertible and you want to maintain existing data if possible, select Use existing data if possible, else default. Then, enter a default value.
After you create a metadata definition, assign it to folders whose content will use it. To do that, use the folder’s properties screen's Metadata tab > Assigned boxes to assign metadata definitions to a folder.
NOTE: Only metadata definitions created for the language in which you are viewing the folder are available. Use the language drop-down to choose a language.
You can require a metadata value to be inserted before content can be saved (see the Required checkboxes in the illustration above). If applied, the requirement is enforced when content is added or edited. Also, on the Edit Content screen's Metadata tab, a required metadata field has a red label and includes an asterisk (*).
NOTE: If a default value is supplied for a required metadata field, that value is used when the content is saved. The user is not prompted to enter a value.
Each folder can inherit metadata fields from its parent folder or have a unique set of them. The information includes metadata definitions that are assigned, and which are required. For example, you could assign the top folder (Content) all metadata definitions, while you assign the Contacts folder (directly below it) none.
On every folder property’s Metadata tab, use the Inherit Parent Configuration check box to determine if metadata definitions are inherited from the parent folder or unique. By default, Inherit Parent Configuration is checked, meaning that metadata definitions are inherited. If you uncheck Inherit Parent Configuration, you can change the settings as desired.
When a user creates or updates content, he can define its metadata within the assignments specified for its folder. Default metadata values are applied without user intervention.
Prerequisite
- Content status must be Published, Checked In, or Checked Out by you.
- A metadata definition has been created in the content's language Adding a metadata definition.
- That definition is assigned to the content's folder See also: Assigning metadata to a folder.
To enter or edit content’s metadata:
Use content tags to apply terms by which you want users to find content when the terms are not in the content. The search can use the tags to find content.
Default content tags appear on the Metadata tab of every content item. Check any tag that you want to apply to a content item. You can also create a new tag and apply it to a content item. You cannot reapply that tag to other content.
When you display metadata tags, the tags are listed alphabetically. However, when you add a new tag, it is listed at the top of the list until you display the list again.
You can assign an image to any content item’s metadata from a standard field that is available to every content item; it is not a definition in the Metadata fields. Use the Image field to identify an image that can be retrieved by Ektron Markup Language’s (EkMLEktron Markup Language)
[$Image] and
[$ImageThumbnail] variables.
For an example of using Image data, assume that your site promotes a soccer team. A list summary shows every player on the team. Next to each player’s name is an image.
Simple Dublin Core is a set of fifteen standard names for metadata fields designed to cover the most useful items of information on a document. From the Dublin Core site FAQ: “Dublin Core metadata provides card catalog-like definitions for defining the properties of objects for Web-based resource discovery systems.” For more information, refer to the Usage Guide: Using Dublin Core.
To generate Dublin Core metadata, set the
GenerateDublinCore property to True. This creates 7 of the fifteen Dublin Core metadata fields. These fields are automatically filled with the information from the equivalent Ektron property. The following list shows the 7 fields and their Ektron equivalent. For more information on the Metadata Server Control, see the Metadata server control.
To fully comply with the Simple Dublin Core metadata element set, the administrator must create the remaining 8 Dublin Core fields as standard Ektron Metadata definitions and apply them to all Ektron folders. Next, Ektron users complete the appropriate values for each content block.
IMPORTANT: When creating Dublin Core metadata fields in the Metadata section of the Workarea, you do not need to create the first 7 fields above. In addition, the names of the fields you create must match the names in the following list. For example, in the name field, enter “DC.subject”. DC identifies it as Dublin Core metadata.
These descriptions are from the Dublin Core Metadata Initiativesite.Impeached Trump rages, but knows he won’t be convicted
By failing to force key witnesses to testimony, the Democrats spiked their own guns. They were never going to have Trump removed from office, but they could have done him a lot more damage in the process
At 8.30 pm local time on Wednesday evening, after a six-hour debate of invective and spluttering fury, Donald Trump became the third US president to be impeached in 240 years.
In his parallel universe at a rally in Michigan, Trump boasted that “it doesn’t really feel like we’re being impeached”. That’s because he isn’t. The fix is in for Trump, and he knows it.

Bye and see you soon!
You'rs Familie Faltejsek.If you’ve already invested a substantial amount of money into your camper van, you might be reluctant to pay to sleep at paid campgrounds and RV parks. $30 here, $20 there. These costs add up quickly and before you know it, you’re spending a considerable sum every month just to sleep in your own vehicle. Why not just camp for free?
Seriously. After all, you already have your own room and bed. All you need is a secure place to park every evening.
In this post, we’re going to talk about several of the most popular ways to camp for free while traveling in your camper van or RV. This includes not only how to find the most picturesque, dispersed campsites all across the United States but also how to overnight at convenient spots while driving along the nation’s major highways. Wherever you are, this van life free camping guide will make sure you don’t pay a dime to sleep.
So if you’re ready, let’s get to it!
Camp For Free On BLM Lands
Nature lovers on a budget can rejoice! Camping on BLM (Bureau of Land Management) land is a fantastic way to get far out into the wilderness and camp for free.
Though paid & serviced campgrounds are available on BLM lands, these areas only make up a small percentage of the total land reserved under BLM. The rest of the area is designated for ‘dispersed camping’, which is camping on public land away from established recreation facilities.
Use the BLM online map to locate the closest BLM near you.
The downsides to dispersed camping on BLM land is that there are usually zero resources available to you. No toilets, showers, running water, or electricity is provided. But hey, it’s free. You get what you pay for. Just be sure to pack everything out when you leave your campsite.
Free Camping On National Forest Lands
Free camping opportunities also exist on National Forest lands. With over 150 National Forests in the United States, you can be sure at least one of these forests is located near you.
All National Forest lands are open to free dispersed camping, unless otherwise indicated. And since we started van life, we’ve almost never seen a sign explicitly prohibiting camping on these National Forest lands. So you can be sure that your spot is likely safe from those pesky forest rangers.
To find a National Forest near you, check out the locator feature on the US Forest Service website.
The downside of dispersed camping on National Forest land is that there are a number of rules you’ll need to follow to prevent damage to natural resources and wildlife. These include:
- Campfire restrictions with burn bans and permits
- Human waste disposal requirements
- Proper food storage procedures
- Following ‘Leave No Trace’ principles by packing all your things out when you leave.
For more information on dispersed camping regulations, check out the US Forest Service camping guide.
Overnight Parking At Walmart
Sleeping for free overnight at Walmart parking lots has been a staple among the van life & RV community for decades.
And it’s no wonder why that is. Walmart Supercenters are ubiquitous all across the country (and Canada!) and offer safe places to stay overnight with security personnel overseeing the parking lot. We’re not ashamed to admit that we’ve slept overnight at more than our fair share of Walmart parking lots across the country.
The downside of overnight parking at Walmart is that not all Walmarts are friendly to camper vans & RVs. If you happen to be at the ‘wrong’ Walmart, you may get a rude knock in the middle of the night and be asked to leave.
To ensure we’re staying at a Walmart that typically allows overnight RV parking, we use the iOverlander App and FreeCampSites.net and read the reviews from past campers.
Camp For Free At Truck Stops
When traveling along major transportation highways, you’ve probably gassed up at one of the many Flying J and Pilot service centers. These two brands, and a handful of others, used to only service the long haul trucking industry, but recently began prioritizing campers, RVs, and other private vehicles.
While certainly not the most beautiful free overnight parking solution, sleeping near the 24/7 convenience store won’t cost you a penny and guaranteed to be free from the dreaded ‘midnight knock’ from the police.
In addition, Flying J and Pilot service centers also offer a wealth of RV services like water dump stations and propane refills. Bonus: If you have a Good Sam account, then you’ll be able to get discounts off these services (as well as fuel discounts).
The downside to overnight camping at Flying J and Pilot service centers is the noise. If you haven’t had the pleasure of trying to sleep while gigantic diesel trucks drive by your camper, you’ll soon find out what we’re talking about.
To locate the nearest Flying J or Pilot location near us, we use the myRewards plus app.
Take Advantage Of Casinos
Many casinos offer free camping facilities to the van life and RV community. Although oftentimes the free ‘campsite’ is nothing more than a parking spot in the back of the Casino lot without even a bathroom nearby.
Of course, the hope is that you’ll wander into the casino and try your luck at the roulette table or slot machines. But if you practice good restraint, parking at casinos is a great way to camp for free in your vehicle.
Use the CasinoCamper website to find casinos that offer free overnight opportunities.
Sleep For Free At Highway Rest Areas
Another convenient free overnight solution is to park at rest stations, which are ubiquitous along major highways in the US.
Sleeping for free at these highway rest areas is possibly the most convenient method when long-hauling it across the country. That’s because you don’t have to drive very far off the highway to get to a rest area. In addition, there are always plenty of parking spaces, 24/7 bathroom facilities are available, and drinking water is usually nearby.
The downside of overnight parking at rest areas is that not every rest area allows parking overnight. And if it is allowed, most areas will restrict your parking to not more than 8 hours. However, our experience is that the ‘8-hour’ rule isn’t strictly enforced and can usually be stretched out to a 12 hour period.
Again, it’s best to consult review sites, like FreeCampSites.net to plan in advance which rest area you want to stay at.
Stealth Parking In Urban Areas
One of the most popular terms in the van life community is ‘stealth camping’, which involves discreetly camping for free in urban areas like residential neighborhoods, roadsides, and business parking lots.
To successfully stealth camp means evading the attention of the police, would-be thieves, and curious neighbors and usually involves sleeping in a vehicle that doesn’t overtly look like a camper. Hence the “stealth”.
A camper that looks like a basic white, standard commercial work van works best here.
But if we’re being honest, stealth camping is our least preferred method to camp for free. That’s because this overnight solution is the least safe from intruders and has the highest chance for you to get in trouble with the authorities. It’s also the most annoying to the local residents. Would you like it if your own neighborhood street became a popular urban camping location?
Not only is stealth camping our least preferred method, but we also almost never do it. There’s just too many better options that are safer and legally allowed (a nearby Walmart would be our pick).
To learn more about why we don’t recommend stealth camping, check out our post: Why Stealth Camping Is A Terrible Idea.
Best Tips for Finding Free Campsites
Finding free places to camp during van life is a bit of an art form. And it can take some time to learn how to search for a free site quickly and get it right the first time. That being said, here are some of our tips to finding free places to camp with your RV.
- Plan Ahead – Don’t get stuck trying to search for an overnight spot after dusk.
- Take Advantage Of Good Reception – If you have full cell reception now, use it. Don’t wait until later. You might end up in a reception dead zone.
- Utilize Different Resources – Whether you’re searching for BLM land, forest land, or just a truck stop, use the right tool (smartphone app) for the job.
- Don’t Get Discouraged – Just because you had a terrible experience at one free camp site, don’t get discouraged. Use it as a learning opportunity and keep searching for the next great place.
Final Thoughts: The Right Free Camping Spot Is A Magical Experience
Not every free camping spot is a fantastic place. Sometimes you just need a ‘good enough’ location to carry you over until the next morning.
But when you finally find that one picturesque spot out in nature that doesn’t cost you a dime, soak it in and enjoy the solitude. You’ve reached peak van life.
And as always, please help to keep these free campsites pristine and litter-free. Follow the ‘Leave No Trace’ principle and return your spot to the same condition as when you arrived.
Happy camping!

Yesterday my daughter decided to spend her Border’s gift card.
Yes, Borders–one of those mega-chains that can and do out-price and out-stock small independent businesses making it harder or even impossible for them to survive. I have to admit, Borders is one of my favorite places to shop. Just the smell of the place–the heady aroma of books mixed with the scent of good coffee from the cafe area–makes me happy. And the selection! Aisle upon aisle of every kind of book on every subject one could wish to explore.
It’s a book-lover’s paradise, and I love books. Not just reading them, but holding them, turning the pages, looking at them on my bookshelves and remembering all the quiet, comforting hours spent with my nose buried in them. Given enough resources, I’d fill my house with them, every room. As it is, my lovely husband built a whole wall of shelves for me in my tiny office. I’ve already resorted to shelving my books two rows deep and laying others flat when I couldn’t squeeze them in.
I can spend hours in a Borders bookstore, wandering from travel to romance to history to religion to nutrition. The workers keep an eye on me, suspecting foul play, but I just smile at them and continue browsing. It’s a rare day I leave without dropping fifty bucks.
But those days are over. This year, I’m shopping locally.
Once upon a time, I worked in a small, independent bookstore in Oxford, Maine. I know first-hand how the big book chains and Amazon.com cut into these little jewelboxes of literary treasure found in fewer and fewer of our small towns. The store in which I worked, Books ‘n Things, was owned and operated by Katie Whitehead. With a seven-month-old baby on my hip and trepidation in my heart, I went into the store and inquired about work. I was handed an application. Katie interviewed me a week or so later and offered me a few hours during the week plus Saturday mornings–a perfect schedule for a new, stay-at-home mom.
It was a dream job for someone who loves books. I had a discount. I had access to the newest fiction. Katie had a subscription to the New York Times Review of Books. The salary didn’t matter so much as the stimulation, the chance to get out of the house, the opportunity to use my baby-numbed brain a little.
Katie worked hard, she expected her employees to work hard, and I learned alot from her. I learned about Books In Print and publisher catalogs and how to “front” books on the shelf. As she insisted her employees count back change rather than depend on the calculator, even my math skills improved.
The best part, though, was the personal relationship with the customers. The regulars would come in week after week, and I got to know their preferences. We’d chat about our favorite authors or just about life in general. At Christmastime, people would come in to buy books for everyone in their family, and we’d wrap the selections in heavy, purple wrapping paper.
The store was small enough that I knew our inventory and could usually get a requested book into someone’s hand in less than a minute. If we didn’t carry the book, ordering was a simple process, and we would call the customer when their book arrived, most of the time within a week.
Katie advertised in the local paper every week, supporting the local economy. She donated books for school fundraisers, supporting local education. She gave many a teenager their first job. She hired teachers looking for part-time income to supplement their salaries.
Katie and her bookstore were an integral part of the Oxford Hills community, as independent bookstores are important to communities all across America. Dollars spent at a local business are much more likely to stay in the region. Studies have been done to show this. Read this study done in mid-coast Maine about the positive effects of local business on communities. Case Study.
Unfortunately, the survival of these small, literary havens is threatened every day by competition from the big-box and online book retailers like Walmart, Amazon, Borders, and Barnes and Noble. However, even the big chains admit that independents do a better job in some areas. Read this article about an independent bookstore in Illinois.
When a Walmart opens up shop down the road and offers steep discounts for the new release hardcover books, that cuts into one of the most profitable area of sales for independent sellers. You’ve probably seen the movie YOU’VE GOT MAIL, starring Meg Ryan as a children’s bookstore owner and Tom Hanks as a mega-book retailer whose newest store drives the little place out of business. That’s what happens to independents when Borders or Barnes and Noble rolls into town. Amazon.com offers the convenience of home shopping, and that, too, can eat into profits. It’s amazing to me that any of these independent bookstores have survived at all–but they have.
They have fought back with online shopping from their websites. They have fought back with a program called Booksense, which has now evolved into a program called IndieBound developed by the American Booksellers Association. One of the most exciting aspects of the program is the giftcard program which allows booksellers to accept each other’s giftcards. An IndieBound giftcard bought in Maine will be honored at a participating independent bookstore in Ohio.
Independents have also fought back by highlighting their uniqueness, their customer-service orientation, their ability to find new voices in literature that the big chains might miss. Because of these independents, smaller publishers and new authors get a chance to reach readers. Regional authors are often showcased at smaller stores. The booksellers at independents are often more knowledgeable than your average cashier at the big-box store.
We can help them survive by voting with our shopping dollars.
Katie sold her bookstore back around the year 2000, but Books n Things is still alive and well, now housed on Main Street in Norway. If you’re ever up that way, stop in and check out the selection. I’m sure the new owner will appreciate the interest and the business.
My town doesn’t have a bookstore. Neither does the town next door. Or the town next door to that. Even the city of Sanford lacks an independent bookstore. The town of Alfred has a nice antique bookstore, and Sanford does have a used bookstore run by a nonprofit organization, but for new books I’ve resorted to shopping at the Borders in South Portland and on Amazon. However, with the need for local-shopping pressing down on me, I’ve done a little research and discovered a locally-owned shop in Saco called Nonesuch Books. There is also a South Portland Nonesuch Books, so there really is no excuse anymore for shopping at Borders . . . or Amazon, as I can order the books online from Nonesuch or simply make a quick call to a helpful bookseller.
Which brings me back to yesterday. My daughter isn’t participating in my experiment, and she had this giftcard from a generous great-Aunt and Uncle. (Thanks Aunt Sandy and Uncle Niles!) I went into Borders with her, and that familiar smell of books and coffee hit my nostrils. I resolutely ignored the piles of discounted fiction calling to me and followed my daughter to the children’s section. Addiction takes many forms, and it just didn’t feel right to walk up to that checkout counter with no books in hand. They called to me as we wound our way from the back of the store where the smart spacial engineers stuck the children’s section knowing the parents would have to pass by tempting displays all the way to Harry Potter and back.
I’m happy to report that I resisted. Danielle spent the gift-card that was burning a hole in her pocketbook and happily read all the way home. Feeling slightly depressed, I promised myself a trip to Saco very soon, and dreamed of the day when some enterprising (and independently wealthy) soul opens a bookstore here in my hometown. In the meantime, I have library books and my bulging shelves to keep me satisfied.
For those of you who would like a little reading today, I’ve posted a short story on my Fiction Corner page. I can’t promise you it’s any good, but it is free!
I also miss the independent bookstore I used to work in. I miss knowing exactly where a book is on the shelf and the look on the customers fae when you find it for them. I miss our used-book section. A whole floor of books priced less than $4.00. We have a local bookstore but it is small and I don’t find the staff welcoming. There is a certain ambiance that a bookstore should have. We have decided at my book group that we have to hold the book in our hands; not browse a book cover on our computer screen. As you said Shelley, there is the library and yeah I got stacks of books too:)
I’m sorry to hear that the local store isn’t welcoming. Frankly, it’s surprising that in this economy they wouldn’t be working really hard to attract and retain customers. I agree about the ambiance. Books ‘n Things had this great, old, Victorian sofa where you could sit and look at books. There was also a children’s playroom area where the kids could hang out while Mom or Dad shopped. Katie sold Celtic and other world/folk music, so an album was always playing in the background. Maybe one of these days we’ll get to open a bookstore ourselves–we could have one branch in your town and one in mine. Now, where to get the money . . .?
I am amazed at your control of the “word” It’s a pleasure to read word like you type them.
I grew up in a family that had a great garden, and I, like you or your family, remember picking up vegetable,weeding, canning for winter,and all the good memories I have of those wonderful days of old.It seems we have gotten away from that life. Time to go back.Click or Press enter to Enter to Enable skip content option

The physical home of Philadelphia International Records may have fallen but as Shaun Ponsonby reveals their great legacy won’t be forgotten.
Philadelphia International Records Top 10
On October 15, the sign outside of the building at 309 S. Broad Street in Philadelphia was lowered, the building having been sold for development and now ready to be demolished. Perhaps that won’t mean much to you, but it really should. For this was the home of Philadelphia International Records, perhaps the greatest soul label of the 1970’s, picking up where Motown and Stax left off at the end of the 1960’s, and bringing a new, sophisticated soul sound into the homes of black America and the world.
And yet we didn’t see this news reported on many music sites. It just seemed to pass by. Why? If Motown’s Hitsville building in Detroit, or Stax’s Soulsville building in Memphis closed down, the sites would be lit up with the news. The Sound of Philadelphia building hosted The O’ Jays, Patti LaBelle, Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes, and when the Jackson 5 left Motown, where did Michael and his brothers end up? Philadelphia International, that’s where.
The label was formed in 1971 by Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff, two songwriters and producers who had previous success with the likes of Aretha Franklin, Dusty Springfield and Wilson Pickett.
They formed Philadelphia International as a rival to Berry Gordy and Motown. Just as Motown became one of the definitive soul sounds of the 1960’s, Philadelphia International did for the 1970’s, successfully eclipsing Motown in the process.
Furthermore, the Philadelphia Soul sound they pioneered later became the basis of Disco; the lush strings, the thumping bass, and hi-hat rhythms all becoming notable stylistic motifs in the late-70s movement.
Sadly, the building was a victim of arson in 2010, and it’s structure was never able to be revived.
We believe the Sound of Philadelphia building should be a cultural landmark, a tribute to the great music that came out of it. So, in tribute to this astonishing label, here are ten Philadelphia International records that no soul fan should be without.
PIR, we wish you love, peace and soul…
1. Love Train (The O’ Jays)
Kenneth Gamble himself cites 1972’s Love Train as the ultimate PIR song (we’re sure that has nothing whatsoever to do with the royalty cheques), so it’s only fair that we list it first. He believes that the song’s message was paramount to what PIR was about; bringing people of all types together through a sheer love of music.
2. Me and Mrs Jones (Billy Paul)
Culled from the 1972 album 360 Degrees of Billy Paul, this is one of the undisputed classic soul ballads, though it was mildly controversial at the time – the title should give away why (MRS Jones? If there’s a Mrs Jones, that means there’s a Mr Jones). Much of the song’s success is due to Paul’s silky vocals. The former jazz singer was already nearly 40 years old when he recorded the song, meaning he had more than enough life experience to bring the emotion needed to the forefront. For reference, Michael Buble recorded the song in 2007 and managed to make it one of the most soulless renditions of anything ever.
3. Wake Up Everybody (Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes)
The title track from the last Blue Notes album to feature Teddy Pendergrass on vocals, this one of the more overtly political songs released by the label. Lyrically, it’s a pretty simple affair. The title alone should clue you as to what the lyrics entail. But the slightly unconventional structure of the song is what truly makes it. Beginning as a subdued piano-led ballad, by the mid-point of the song it’s started to really jam, building to one of the greatest climax’s in soul. We maintain it is impossible not to feel Pendergrass’ ad libs.
4. Soul City Walk (Archie Bell & The Drells)
Archie Bell & The Drells signed to PIR in 1975, following Bell’s return from the Vietnam war. They immediately came out with this Philly classic. A favourite in early Disco clubs at the time, the brisk feel to the track struck a chord with club goers of the day. Of note, the smooth backing vocals of the Drells were effective enough to earn them the nickname “The Sweethearts of Stigma”.
5. Blues Away (The Jacksons)
This one is more of a curiosity than anything else. Amazingly, this is the first song ever written by Michael Jackson. The Jacksons had spent seven years at Motown under the name the Jackson 5. When they left the label wanting more creative control, they went straight to Gamble & Huff and slowly began writing their own material. It may not be one of the best PIR tracks, nor one of the best Jacksons tracks (if you want more successful PIR/Jacksons collaborations, then Show You The Way To Go or Enjoy Yourself may be the place to start), but it captures an interesting moment in musical history. A track that may be slightly unsure of itself, but shows a young man on the cusp of something special.
6. Ain’t No Stoppin’ Us Now (McFadden & Whitehead)
Gene McFadden and John Whitehead were originally songwriters and producers at the Sound of Philadelphia building, and were frustrated at Gamble & Huff for not allowing them to step into the spotlight. Funnily enough, that’s what they wrote this song about. Gamble has stated that he attempted to convince the duo to give the song to The O’ Jays. They refused and had a #1 hit on the R&B charts and a top 5 hit in the UK. The song was later adopted as an anthem for the black community in America.
7. Life On Mars (Dexter Wansel)
This is maybe the definitive PIR jazz-funk tune, owing much to the likes of Grover Washington Jr. This was only a minor hit, reaching #91 on the soul charts. Wansel began his time at PIR as a session player, and eventually became the company’s head of A&R. He hasn’t left behind the greatest of musical legacies, but tracks like this make us wish he had indulged a bit more. (N.B. This has nothing to do with David Bowie).
8. I Don’t Love You Anymore (Teddy Pendergrass)
Pendergrass’ first solo single after leaving Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes, I Don’t Love You Anymore launched him as one of R&B’s biggest stars for a number of years. The uptempo track has one of PIR’s catchiest choruses and a groove that makes it impossible to keep still.
9. Am I Black Enough For You? (Billy Paul)
After the humungous success of the aforementioned Me and Mrs Jones, Paul practically BEGGED PIR to not release this as his next single. But Gamble was so damn proud of the song, that his pleads fell on deaf ears. Ironically, the song ended up too black for mainstream audiences and killed Paul’s career. However, the song became a favourite amongst black audiences, with pioneering gangsta rapper Schoolly D naming his 1989 album after the song, and a 2009 biographical film that chronicles Paul’s life since Me and Mrs Jones used this song as it’s title.
10. TSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia) (MFSB featuring The Three Degrees)
For anyone who loved soul music in America, there was only one show that provided the very best of the music they loved on television; Soul Train. Anyone who is anyone in R&B played Soul Train. And every week, millions of loyal viewers heard PIR’s house band MFSB provide the theme tune, and this was it. When released as a single, Don Cornelius, the man behind Soul Train, refused to allow any references to the show on record. Hence, the record was renamed TSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia), thus providing a theme tune not only for Soul Train, but for PIR itself.

Agnieszka Radwanska will compete in the final of WTA Finals for the first time in her career after a stunning 6-7 6-3 7-5 victory over Garbine Muguruza in the semi-finals on Saturday evening.
Radwanska has made history in Singapore this week, becoming the first Pole to reach the Final at the WTA Finals and becoming the first player to finish the group stage with a 1-2 win/loss record to reach the final since Venus Williams did so in 2009. Earlier in the week, Radwanska became the 16th lady to reach 500 career victories on the WTA tour and she has now won over $20 million in prize money.
Radwanska looked down and out after slumping to 0-2 courtesy of losses to Maria Sharapova and Flavia Pennetta. It would have been very easy for Radwanska to concede defeat and give up on her Singapore campaign after 2 disappointing losses. However Radwanska rebounded with an impressive 7-6 6-1 victory over Simona Halep to advance into the semi-finals. Aga needed to win in 2 sets and was 2 points away from elimination at 1-5 in the 1st set tiebreak before winning 6 straight points.
Radwanska once again showed her fighting spirit on Saturday. The Pole was extremely emotional after her victory over Muguruza, admitting that she didn’t think it would be possible to come back after losing an extremely close first set.
It was a match full of momentum swings, after losing a tight opening set, Radwanska came out strong in the second set to open up a commanding lead before Muguruza came storming back. Radwanska managed to weather the storm and send the match to a decider. The deciding set followed a similar path, Radwanska opened up a nice lead but Muguruza would blast her way back into the match despite being clearly fatigued. Radwanska was ultimately the better player, bringing a stunning mix of deft touch and aggression to the court to record a famous victory.
Radwanska now has a chance to win the biggest tile of her career, it would be a truly amazing end to the season for Radwanska considering the bitter lows during the middle of the year. No matter what happens, this tournament and the Asian swing in general will give Radwanska a much needed confidence boost heading into season 2016.Project Description

Today’s Reflection
Story reminds us to which communities we belong. Family stories tell us that we are part of a community related by blood. In some respects knowing the stories is as much a part of belonging to a family as our biological inheritance. The stories that shape who we are and what we value also define the parameters of the communities to which we belong. . . . Because we know the stories of Jesus and his followers and indeed claim to be followers ourselves, those stories form the persons we are and the decisions we make even today.
—Michael E. Williams, “A Community of Stories,” The Wondrous Mystery: An Upper Room Advent Reader, compiled by Benjamin Howard (Upper Room Books, 2019)
Today’s Question
What stories have helped to form your identity? What stories form the identity of your community? Join the conversation.
Today’s Scripture
“Return home and tell the story of what God has done for you.”

His parents were refugees who had escaped from Hungary after the failed Communist Revolution following WWI. Meir was left in Uzhorod while they continued to the Soviet Union. He was later transferred to the Jewish orphanage in Debretzen Hungary, and adopted by the Weinberger family. Meir studied at the local Jewish high-school, then at 14, was sent to study at the Teachers Seminary in Budapest. After the German occupation of Hungary in 1944, he was sent to forced labor in Yugoslavia, and at year’s end, freed by the Partisans. When WWII was over, Meir returned to Budapest to finish his studies. He then accompanied a group of children to Germany as their teacher. In 1947 he left Germany and traveled to Paris, where he met Lehi members. He encountered through them, the Underground’s war policies against Britain, and joined them. Meir worked in Paris in various ways organizing a European branch for Lehi, until he decided to make aliya. With the first opportunity after the establishment of the State in 1948, he reached Israel and immediately joined the IDF. He was assigned to the ‘Carmeli’ Brigade and participated in the ‘Brosh Campaign’, at the Northern Front. After the first ceasefire, the brigade attempted to push back the Syrian forces from the bridgehead at ‘Mishmar- Hayarden’, which they had captured in a surprise move, on the eve of the ceasefire. Meir fell in this battle, on July 10,1948 and was laid to rest in the Military Cemetery at Rosh-Pina, not far from the resting place of Shlomo Ben-Yoseph, the first Jewish prisoner hung by the British regime. Meir had no surviving relatives.Jennifer Legra

We asked Martin Partington, author of Introduction to the English Legal System, for his top ten film recommendations for new law students and aspiring lawyers. Iconic cases, legendary lawyers, fact and fiction – which films would make it on to your list?
1. Twelve Angry Men (1957)
This US film is set in the jury room, where 12 jurors have to decide the outcome of a seemingly open and shut case. In the UK, no one knows precisely what goes on in the jury room. Direct participant research is prohibited by law. So dramas like this offer a version of what might happen. One question to ponder: how do you think the verdict might have differed if the jury had been told it could reach a majority verdict (possible in England and Wales) rather than a unanimous one?
2. The Paper Chase (1973)
Another US film features a first year law student’s experience of taking a class in contract under the supervision of the fearsome Professor Kingsfield. It shows how the much vaunted socratic method of legal education – where students are fiercely quizzed by their professors – works in practice. You may end up relieved that your course is demanding in different ways! The intellectual limitation of the film is the suggestion that all legal education is about textual analysis of cases and statutes. It takes no account of the social importance of law. For a different take on the law school experience, you could try Legally Blonde (2001).
3. In the Name of the Father (1993)
This is an Irish-British-American film based on the story of the Guildford Four, four people falsely convicted of the 1974 IRA‘s Guildford pub bombings, which killed four off-duty British soldiers and a civilian. The story is important as it formed part of the background to major changes in the criminal justice system of England and Wales, including the creation of the Criminal Cases Review Commission and the Crown Prosecution Service. Warning: its portrayal of the trial process is a travesty of reality – it should not be taken as any sort of representation of what happens in practice.
4. To Kill a Mockingbird (1962)
Based on Harper Lee’s classic novel, this tells the story of attorney Atticus Finch’s defence of a black man falsely accused of rape. The recent publication of Harper Lee’s follow up novel Go Set a Watchman brings a new dimension to the tale. How does the new book change your perception of Finch?
5. Erin Brockovich (2000)
A great ’cause lawyering’ film. A clerk in a small law office pursues an action against a huge corporation, suspected of widespread land pollution. It’s a pity no similar UK film was made about the Sunday Times classic investigation into the thalidomide drug.
6. Judgment at Nuremberg (1961)
Post World War 2 trial of 4 Nazi judges, accused of using their position to support German state goals of cleansing the country of Jews. Worth seeing both for its own sake, but also as the back drop for the more recent creation of International Criminal Tribunals charged with the hearing of cases against those accused of war crimes.
7. Reversal of Fortune (1990)
Based on a true story it centres on the appeal by Law Professor Alan Dershowitz in the case of Claus von Bulow, a wealthy Dane found guilty of the attempted murder of his wife. An interesting film: not least because it shows the engagement of legal academics in real litigation – something which does not often occur in the UK.
8. 10 Rillington Place (1971)
A film about the trial for murder of Timothy Evans: one of a number of high profile miscarriage of justice cases that ultimately led to the abolition of the death penalty in the UK in 1965. Worth watching as a reminder of why the death penalty needs to remain abolished.
9. A Separation (2011)
Iranian film focusing on an Iranian middle-class couple who separate, and the conflicts that arise when the husband hires a lower-class care giver for his elderly father, who suffers from Alzheimer’s disease. I’ve included it here because it features some proceedings before courts in Iran, although it is hard to know how accurate the representation of the working of the Iranian court system truly is.
10. 10th District Court (10e Chambre – Instants d’Audience) (2004)
Documentary on the work of a Paris Criminal Court. Worth viewing to compare how the French criminal justice system operates to the work of Magistrates’ Courts in England and Wales.

Interesting choice of films. One I think which should be included is Akira Kurosawa’s 1950 masterpiece Rashomon often considered one of the greatest films ever made? This black and white Japanese film starring Toshiro Mifune is probably one of the greatest films ever made about the philosophy of justice in a story told from 4 angles. Each character gives his or hers version of events of the death of the samurai illustrating the complexities of witness statements and the difficulties of ascertaining the truth of events. If law is about justice and getting to the truth this film is a masterclass as much as the good professor’s lectures in The Paper Chase.Get in Touch What's your name?* What's your email address?* What are you contacting us about?* I want to work with you!

Latin Name : Sideritis Raeseri have anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-spasmodic properties. They are rich in a number of natural antioxidants, including flavonoids, and almost all species also contained essential oils. Greek mountain tea is as potent as green tea (Camellia sinensis) at inducing cellular antioxidant defences and preventing oxidative stress. Although the mountain tea extract had a lower phenolic concentration and total antioxidant capacity than green tea in the study, their cellular antioxidant effects were similar due to comparable bioavailability.
- Lowers Blood Pressure : Siderits helps to lower blood pressure levels while helping blood vessels to relax. A study showed that a dose of Sideritis extract led to blood vessel dilation, which helped lower blood pressure levels and reduced stress on the heart muscle.
- Protects the Digestive System: It has been found that taking an oral dose of Greek mountain tea can lead to less inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract, likely due to the presence of phenols and antioxidants found naturally in the plant.

Methodology & Implementation
Tigoona is from the word ‘teen guna’ in Hindi, and the idea is essentially about driving 3
times business, 3 times safety, 3 times comfort, 3 times reach, and 3 times pride. We
believe that the ones who give should always get back ‘teen guna’.”
A classic example of human-centric design, the Tigoona could well redefine the way merchandise and materials are moved, distributed, and sold. What’s more, it comes in a flat pack, like simple bicycle parts, can be easily customized, and can be repaired anywhere in India.
It comes with a solar-powered light for business during the nighttime and can carry big loads (up to 100 kg ). It also enables easy waste management, offers protection against sun/rain, and is also very easy to use for women.
Envisioned as an enterprise to enable hawkers to get closer to their consumers and expand their business, the Tigoona is also a good step towards self-employment, while facilitating new standards in the unorganized trade.Beautiful certificate from the Beaunit Mills, Inc. issued no later than 1960.

Okra is a vegetable high in fiber which will improve your digestion, regulate bowel function and encourage the growth of friendly bacteria in the belly.
Apart from that, including okra in your diet provides flavor and substance that satiates the senses and the appetite, while maintaining a low-calorie level diet that improves weight, thus minimizing your food cravings.
In addition, it contains essential nutrients that boosts your body’s metabolism, strengthens your core muscles, stabilizes blood sugar levels and lower high cholesterol, reducing the risk of heart diseases.
Endeavor to cook your okra soup with little oil, then you’re good to go!
8. Potatoes
Whether white or sweet, potatoes are one of the most filling, nutrient-dense and low-calorie foods that makes a good addition to any weight loss diet.
Potatoes are high in fiber and all sorts of vitamins and are actually very good for you, especially if you’re trying to lose weight or belly fat – as long as they’re not fried or served the French fry way.
9. Pumpkins
Pumpkin is a very rich source of fiber and devoid of cholesterol, sodium and fats which can help curb your appetite, reduce your weight, improves vision, strengthens the bone, immunity and overall blood circulation.
10. Tomatoes
Tomatoes are low in calories and high in vital nutrients making them an ideal choice for any weight loss meal plan.
Tomatoes are important because not only do they make our food taste better, they’re full of antioxidants and they aid in weight loss by reducing inflammation and water retention in the body.
Also, they help in reversing leptin resistance (leptin is a hormone predominantly made by adipose cells and enterocytes in the small intestine that helps to regulate energy balance by inhibiting hunger, which in turn diminishes fat storage in adipocytes).
Tomato juice makes for an excellent belly fat burning juice too.
You can add other fruits or veggies and herbs to make it more palatable and filling.
Herbs/Spices For Weight Loss
Here are some essential herbs and some spices that not only add tastes and flavour to our foods but also have some weight loss benefits.
- Aloe Vera
- Cayenne Pepper
- Cinnamon
- Garlic
- Ginger
- Green Tea
- Turmeric
- Zobo Leaf
Asides from helping with weight loss, there are other numerous health benefits of some of these herbs and spices.
Cinnamon helps lower blood glucose levels by improving insulin sensitivity and slowing down the breakdown of carbohydrates. This means it can help manage type 2 diabetes mellitus conditions.
Turmeric, which contains curcumin, has powerful anti-inflammatory effects. This makes this herb useful in fighting oxidative stress or damage, which plays one of the key roles in ageing and disease development.
Capsaicin in cayenne pepper has anti-cancer effects and reduces appetite.
Ginger has anti-inflammatory properties and can help treat nausea and also helps with pain management.
Conclusion
Vegetables provide substantial amounts of fiber to our diet and offer many essential vitamins and minerals.
Herbs can help combat most of the serious health conditions people are battling, such as cancers, diabetes, obesity, heart diseases, high blood pressure etc.
When purchasing vegetables, herbs and spices for your consumption, it is often better to go for natural and fresh organics.
This ensures that you are feeding on healthy foods that are not irradiated or preserved with harmful chemicals.
So, make these listed weight loss vegetables, herbs and spices regular part of your diet to boost metabolism, cleanse your colon, prevent weight gain and belly fat.

If you think about all the good shots that you run across with a great sky but nothing to put in the foreground, it tends to beg the question do you take the shot or let it go by? Well this past weekend I was thinking about this and decided to take just some quick shots of the sky. It was beautiful so why not. As a Friday thought before going on shooting this weekend think about doing something that’s outside the standard rules of thirds and see what you come up with.

Musicians who want to create unique sounds and experiment endlessly will get nothing but joy from the Modal Electronics ARGON8. This wavetable synthesizer offers 8-part polyphony and contains a high-quality FATAR TP9 keyboard with 37 full-size, touch-sensitive keys with aftertouch. You get access to no fewer than 120 wave tables, divided into five sets over 24 benches, allowing you to opt for traditional virtual analogue sounds or modern EDM sounds. Many of the models are taken directly from the Modal Electronics 002, so you know you you're going to get excellent sound quality. Thanks to a subtly designed steel and aluminum housing, this compact synth will stylishly lift the look of your home studio.
The ARGON8: A musical trip
The addition of a 1.54 inch OLED display makes the Modal Electronics ARGON8 effortless to navigate. With 32 hi-res wave table oscillators (4 per voice) and eight types of modifiers, you get a huge range of possible sounds under your command. You can use the assignable joystick to add extra expression to your game and three envelope generators (AMP, MOD and FILTER) that you can use completely independently or simultaneously, will only push it further. With the three independent stereo effect engines you can also add intensely powerful effects such as delay, reverb, flanger, phaser and chorus.
Sequencer and arpeggiator
Other practical additions to the ARGON 8 are the built-in sequencer and arpeggiator. With the 512 step real time sequencer you can spit out impressive soundscapes in little time. The programmable 32 step arpeggiator can generate up to 2048 steps before a repeat occurs and with 300 factory presets, even less experienced synthesizer aficionados can get started immediately. 200 user slots are available to store your own creations and a nice bonus is that you can easily download new patches using the free MODALapp for Mac, PC, iOS and Android.

The Company leases corporate office space in Los Gatos, California.
In August 2020, the Company and its landlord amended the lease for
this office. This amendment extends the expiration date of the
operating at the time of the amendment. In January 2021 the
additional space became available for use, and the Company recorded
an additional ROU asset and corresponding liability of
approximately $144,000..

space in Tempe, Arizona. The new lease is classified as an
operating lease with an initial term of two years and an option to
extend for an additional three years through February 2026. The
lease also contains a performance standard for research
collaboration with Arizona State University. The agreement requires
a minimum value of collaborative research in each year of the

the research payments are included in the ROU and lease liability
at the commencement. In March 2021, the Company recorded an ROU and
associated lease liability of approximately $238,000. The
lease liability is based on the present value of the minimum lease
payments, discounted using the Company’s estimated incremental

We were organized as a Delaware limited liability company under the
name Nanovis LLC on November 26, 2001. On March 14, 2007, we
converted to a Delaware corporation under the name Mears
Technologies, Inc. On January 12, 2016, we changed our name to
Atomera Incorporated. could offer and sell, from time to time at our sole
discretion, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering
price of up to $25.0 million in an “at-the-market” or ATM offering,
to or through the agent. We announce the completion of this
offering on January 5, 2021 after 2,221,575 shares had been sold at
an average price per share of approximately $11.25, resulting in
approximately $24.2 million of net proceeds to us after deducting
commissions and other offering expenses.
Results of Operations
Revenues. To date, we have only generated limited
revenue from customer engagements through a JDA, integration
engineering services and integration license agreements. In the
future, we expect to collect increased fees from license
agreements, which in some cases may be part of a JDA, and royalties
from customer sales of products that incorporate our MST
technology. Our JDA includes the grant of an upfront, paid
manufacturing license allowing the customer to install the recipe
for our MST film into a tool in their fab and to fabricate
semiconductor wafers incorporating MST, as well as development
milestones that, if achieved, could result in additional revenue to
Atomera. However, the JDA does not confer commercial distribution
rights. Revenue from the grant of licenses to MST is recognized
either at a point in time or over time, depending on the nature of
the grant. We have determined that the limited manufacturing
license granted to our JDA customer when we delivered the MST
recipe was distinct from any obligations to provide other goods or
services and was a right to use our intellectual property and
therefore recognized revenue at the point in time when the recipe
was delivered. each of the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020
was $0. Revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 was
approximately $400,000 and $62,000, respectively.
Cost of Revenue. Cost of revenue consists of costs of
materials, as well as direct compensation and expenses incurred to
provide integration engineering services. Cost of revenue was $0
for each of the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. Cost of
revenue was approximately $0 and $13,000 for the six months ended
June 30, 2021 and 2020, June 30,

Research and development costs were approximately $2.1
million and for each of the three months ended June 30, 2021 and

lower headcount in the three months ended June 30, 2021.
Selling and marketing expenses for the six months ended June
30, 2021 and 2020 were approximately $403,000 and $440,000,
respectively, representing a decrease of approximately $37,000, or
8%. The decrease in costs is primarily related to lower headcount
and lower bonus accrual.
Interest income. Interest income for the three months
ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 was approximately $3,000 and $2,000,
respectively. Interest income for the six months ended June 30,

Earth: One Amazing Day, Official Trailer – BBC Earth Documentary
24 September 2017
Narrated by Robert Redford comes the long-awaited sequel – Earth: One Amazing Day, from BBC Earth Films, an astonishing journey revealing the awesome power of the natural world.
On 27 January 2018, I went to see the BBC wildlife film Earth: One Amazing Day.
The theme of this beautiful film is that Earth is a very special planet, being the only known planet in the universe, as far as is known, where there is life. Not just one species of life: millions of species of animals, plants, etc.
This life on earth became possible because Earth is neither so close to its star, the sun, that it is too hot for life, nor so far away from the sun that it is too cold for life.
Earth turns around its axis, making for relatively hot daytime and relatively cold nighttime. This change, day after day, helps biodiversity, as some wildlife prefers the day, and others prefer the night.
So, every day on Earth is an ‘Amazing Day’ as special wildlife things happen day after day.
The film begins with sunrise, and ends with nighttime. The rising sun causes a giant panda in China to wake up. Meanwhile, a serval, a mainly nocturnal cat, tries to catch a rodent just after dawn in Africa. The rodent sees the threat and escapes. The serval realizes that it is time to sleep.
There is much more fine footage in the film. On the Galapagos islands, newly hatched marine iguanas try, successfully or unsuccessfully, to escape from snakes. In Africa, a young zebra manages to cross a fast flowing river with crocodiles and hippos in it. Later, its mother saves the foal from a cheetah attack.
In the South American rainforest, a hummingbird has to compete for flowers’ nectar with bees, whose stings might kill it. However, interaction between the sun and the earth’s atmosphere causes rain clouds. When the rain starts, it hinders the bees much more than the hummingbird which can now feed peacefully.
AS the film progresses, it moves closer to sunset. Monkeys in China do dangerous rock climbing to be in caves before the night, dangerous for them, falls.
Though, according to the film, all days on earth are amazing, it says one day is extra special: the day when millions of mayflies hatch in the Tisza river in Hungary, to live for just one day as adults.
Finally, the film calls on humans to take good care of all the amazing wildlife on planet Earth.

But it’s not going to be easy because everyone now knows that this team can do something given an opportunity so every game so every game for us will be a cup final because we won the last trophy that was on display,” Nyirenda is quoted as saying by LimSportZone.
The Zambian coach knows it won’t be easy to win another domestic cup in succession, however he is confident his side can rewrite history.

3. becoming merely sensuous adequate . without heading overboard!
4. allowing the love of life tv show – without sense like a stand-up comic on a bad night!
5. focusing on how to READ him . which means you know if he’s getting ultimately more interested (or otherwise not)!
When you are speaking with a man.
There are times when you just need AN IDEAL TERMS TO STATE. TO SUCH A THING ACCORDING TO HIM FOR YOUR REQUIREMENTS?
You are sure that. something you can SAY quickly the top of your mind.
Something that’s just just the right response to whatever according to him to YOU.
Understanding How To FLIRT. gives you the clear answer!!
Knowing how to flirt with boys. really, that’s the start to getting alongside a man!
That means it is VERY important! Possibly it’s the most significant love life ability might actually ever wanted.
That is because when you know how to flirt, all the rest of it is a LOT easier.
If you are a real Flirt in your mind, you can have the relationship of your dreams – throughout your lifetime.
It is absolutely real. Whenever you really know how to “flirt with men,” you own within hands the key to his center.
In addition to key to the hearts of all the DIFFERENT guys who WISH they were in your business!
Indeed, you may find your self in enviable situation to be able to choose between a couple people.

(Sure, I’m sure – you don’t WANT boys to fight over your! Neither performed I, but listen to this:)
Two Boys Arguing. Over Me??
Have you known the consternation – nevertheless secret thrill – of getting two males arguing together because each man wished one other chap to vanish, so he might have you-all to themselves?
This really happened certainly to me. I have to say, it is very stunning emotional memories of living.
I happened to be internet dating two guys simultaneously – two entirely various but quite interesting people. One is an artist; one other is an author. Neither was actually greatest but both were really talented.
One day both came out at my weekend place of work – which been a public, outside set in brand new Orleans – in addition.
Both of them happened to be already unhappily familiar with one another’s existence.
I’d not ever been in times that way one before during my existence, but considering some breakups and makeups, i discovered myself with not simply one, but two men just who desired us to dispose of additional man in support of all of them.
(I happened to be attempting to make a determination between the two, therefore is getting complex.)
Both of these guys glared at every more.
Then they began gently but greatly arguing with one another in wide sunlight, just a couple foot away from in which I found myself operating.
You can cut the tension in the air with a blade.
They detested each other – because they each need a unique declare to my affections.
I never imagined in my wildest aspirations that two guys would disagree over me.
I may also independently criticize another woman so you escort Roseville can get herself in an insane circumstance like that people!
But i need to tell the truth – a part myself got profoundly flattered.
It actually was very a sense to witness this event happening and understand that I was the explanation for they. And I’m perhaps not a raving charm or a supermodel.
(I became putting on a nice backless sundress that time – that did not damage the dramatic second one little bit.)
Allow me to ensure you, you as well can feel a moment in time like this people, by absolute advantage to be a phenomenal, charming lady.
It does not matter one little how old or younger you’re, often.
Yes, it absolutely was a tremendously gluey and tense time – but it addittionally made me feel deeply recognized as a woman.
All women should undertaking an instant like this one or more times in her own life!The Outstanding Research Award was established to encourage research breakthroughs and the pursuit of academic excellence.
Dr. Po-Wen Chiu’s research has been focused on graphene (Gr) and 2D layered semiconductors, covering fundamental material growth, transport properties, and device applications. The most pressing challenge in the development of advanced electronics based on 2D layered semiconductors stems from the lack of site-selective synthesis of complementary n- and p-channels with low contact resistance. Dr. Chiu’s research has been dedicated to solving this problem. A series of studies related to the 2D-contact issue have been reported by his group. One of the most important figures of merit is an in-plane epitaxial route for the growth of interlaced 2D semiconductor monolayers using chemical vapor deposition with a gas-confined scheme, in which patterned Gr serves as a guiding template for site-selective growth of Gr-WS2-Gr and Gr-WSe2-Gr heterostructures. The Gr/2D semiconductor interface exhibits a transparent contact with a nearly ideal pinning factor for both the n-channel WS2 and the p-channel WSe2. The effective Fermi level depinning provides an ultralow contact resistance. Thus, integrated logic circuits made of 2D layered semiconductors have become possible. An inverter, a NAND gate, static random-access memory, and a five-stage ring oscillator were constructed using the complementary Gr-WS2-Gr-WSe2-Gr heterojunctions as a fundamental building block. These devices exhibited the prominent performance metrics of high operation frequency, low power consumption, large noise margins, and high operational stability.The genuine 082821005 Belling oven door hinge is a must-have replacement for your broken cooker's hinge.

George Vale is back in Bohol.
Vale was reassigned again for the second time in just over a month as he was recently designated to head the Provincial Intelligence Branch in Bohol (PIB).
He took over the helm of the PIB on Monday as a result of a reshuffling in the command staff of Senior Supt. Felipe Natividad, provincial director of the Bohol police.
In July, Vale was replaced by Supt. Nicomedes Olaivar as chief of the Tagbilaran City police.
Olaivar moved from the top post of the Provincial Public Safety Company-Special Weapons and Tactics unit while he was replaced by Supt. Patricio Degay.
Meanwhile, Supt. Jeffrey Caballes who headed the Provincial Intelligence and Detective Management Branch is now the deputy provincial director for operations in Bohol.
Other officers holding top provincial police posts were retained including Supt. Ricky Delilis and Supt. Lorenzo Batuan, who are still public information officer and operations officer for the Bohol police, respectively.
In the previous mass reassignment of Bohol police officials, Vale was stationed at the PRO-7 headquarters in Cebu City and a number of Bohol municipal police chiefs were also moved to other police stations in Bohol and across the region.
However, most of the municipal police chiefs were relieved of their posts for inadequate aggressiveness in campaigns against crimes and illegal drugs while Valeâ€™s term as city police chief expired. (Allen Doydora)Advocates are mounting a campaign to declare a crisis among Canadian youth as children’s hospitals report a staggering rise in demand for mental health services during the pandemic.
The #CodePink campaign — named after the medical code for a pediatric emergency — is urging federal and provincial authorities to address the struggles young Canadians face between school closures, restrictions on recreational activities and social isolation.
“We have reached a point where there’s no turning back and the implications that kids are experiencing will be felt now and for many years to come,” says Sara Austin, founder and CEO of Children First Canada, which is leading the campaign launched Wednesday.
“It really is incumbent on all of us as adults, and particularly our government leaders, to take the urgent action that’s required to help our children survive.”
Austin says children have “suffered silently” as the COVID-19 crisis has deprived them of opportunities for emotional, social and physical development. But the statistics speak volumes about the pandemic’s impacts on the next generation’s health and wellbeing, she says.
A survey of 14 children’s hospitals suggests that admissions following suicide attempts doubled on average between March 2020 and January 2021 compared to the same period the year before, according to a report by Children’s Healthcare Canada.
The association also finds that children’s hospitals saw a three-fold increase in admissions related to substance use, and admissions for complex eating disorders rose by 63 per cent.
“We’re talking about issues of life and death,” says Austin. “Our future is in jeopardy.”
Toronto’s Hospital for Sick Children is among the many children’s health organizations backing the #CodePink campaign’s calls for the safe and swift reopening of schools and recreational facilities and increased investment in youth mental health services.
SickKids president and CEO Dr. Ronald Cohn says the hospital’s in-patient mental health unit has been at roughly 130 per cent capacity for several months, and the emergency room has also seen an influx of patients seeking psychological care.
Cohn notes that hospitals tend to treat the most severe cases, so these numbers only offer a glimpse into the full scope of the youth mental health crisis.
“I don’t think there’s a single child that doesn’t in one way or another deal with the pressures of the pandemic,” says Cohn.
“As we get to the other end of this pandemic, I hope that we are not talking about a generation that is at risk…. It’s just going to require a special focus on really making children a priority.”
—Adina Bresge, The Canadian PressThe State of Ohio felt the need to have its own Patriot Act. Way ho way to go, Ohio.
As a result there’s a loyalty oath, of course. State employees have to certify that they’re not terrorists and that they don’t support terrorists. Sign here, please.
This is even more ridiculous than the Cold War loyalty oaths. Those at least had a tenuous connection to reality. There was a real war, and real Soviet spies operating in this country, and some of them were American citizens. The rest of it, well. Yeah.
The idea, though, that agents of terror are deliberately getting jobs with the State of Ohio in order to use their influence to cause terror to reign o’er the land, uh, no. If such people exist, lying on the loyalty oath isn’t going to be such a problem for them. Yeah, I’m leaving pipe bombs full of nails around in malls on weekends but due to this official form I’m now forced to admit it! GOT ME!
I took symbolic logic at UCLA from Donald Kalish. Kalish was a wonderful teacher and a very nice guy. He was also an old time radical (he hired Angela Davis) and had the genuine rebel spirit. One day he used loyalty oaths as a logic example:
“So, we have here the example of an oath which professors are asked to sign, certifying that they are not Communist agents. There are three groups here… [chalkety chalk] The secret Soviet Communist agents will of course sign the oath [chalk chalk], the collaborators and the weak will also sign the oath [chalk chalk!] but the idealists will neither sign the oath [chalk] nor speak to those who do! [furious chalking]
7 thoughts on “How can you run, when you know?”
California has the same thing, though not specific to terrorism. It dates back from the McCarthy era IIRC. So when I was hired as a TA at Berkeley I had to swear to uphold the Constitution of the State of California (and the US, but the California Constitution is notable in that I don’t know what it says).
I had to do that too, in order to change tapes on the mainframe computer at the ASUCLA Student Store for four two-hour shifts a week. No mention of Communists or Terrorisms though, just the State Constitution.
Hell in a hand basket right this way folks, keep the line moving, hell in a hand basket, come one, come all.
geez this makes me tilt toward terrorism now.
Me too.
I think I shall form a Terrorist Organization. We will, of course, renounce violence of any kind towards persons or property. However we will remain true to the ideals of Terrorism. We will Hate Their Freedom, Respect No Laws of War, Threaten the Infrastructure, Make the Innocent Suffer, and most importantly Pose a Threat until Utterly Destroyed.
We can have picnics and outings, meet for lunch at chain restaurants, run for school board, and most importantly have cards so we can be card-carrying.
Re: Me too.
Have you considered joining the Unitarian Jihad?
Now More Than Ever….
Once upon a time I was a typical average all american 9 year old male person who was picking up his first american passport for the first run overseas, and the fine man asked me if I had now, or at any time been a member of the communist party, the communist party international, the international workers of the world, ….
and he went on down through the list of players in that tone which all will recall from the Alice’s Restaurant Anti-Massacre Movement, with full orchestration, and I turned to my father, and asked him if he was aware of any of these and he told me to just say NO!
But what I find most unpleasing about this way to go Ohio is that it fails to address the on going Holy Crusade Against All Iranian Flying Saucers!!!! Since it does not ask if any of the persons so swearing have not now, or at any time, been an Iranian Flying Saucer….Tour operator:

This is another of the English Tudor era reality videos. These are the people who built the castle using tools and methods of the era, I linked to that video a week or so ago :
This is an excellent summary of how “science pursuing truth” has failed to produce much truth and has degenerated into a make work project for scientists, vs how research focused to solve problems has done, namely the great majority of the rest of scientific progress. Long, but very worth the read :
Kurdistan, whatever it means to Kurds, Iraqis, Syrians, Iranians and Turks, is another US and Israeli plan to balkanize the ME, of course. As the Iraqi Kurds have expelled other ethnic groups from what it considers its territory, none of them will be able to vote against Barzani’s plans :

George Webb and his crowd mind continue their investigation. The third in this list begins dealing with more fake employees throughout the Federal Government, beginning with the Congressional Administrative Office. Very impressive guy, George Webb Sweigart :
Jason Goodman and his crowd mind continue their investigations. This is the interview of Dr. Thomas Rudd. Watch the cops doing the interrogation of a young woman, innocent in fact. Very different than you see on TV cop shows, these guys is not trying to find the truth, he wants to close the case. So the coroner screwed up, the cops took the advantage of a small person, 8 – 10 hours of interrogation of a mildly retarded young woman, she resists until the very end. A long discussion of the corruption in the ‘justice’ system and law enforcement. Very bad :
No, electing crazies is he only possibility of getting anything changed. We are left with crazies as the only choice because only crazies run against incumbents who everyone knows are supported by the full power of the establishment. Provide some Constitutional Conservatives as primary candidates, I bet they would be elected also.
Hilarious “in the 90s the Republicans began losing control of their constituencies”. So did the Dems, in retrospect, the Status Quo had begun failing. 9-11 signaled the end of that era, was the ultimate failure of centralized power. We are now playing out the endgame of that failure, searching for the institutions and principles that can replace our failed USofA :
This claim that the US Constitution is the problem per se in our political system is too simple. It took 175 or so years to eliminate the gold standard, as an example. You could claim that the Constitution was too centralized, and that allowed the evolution that got us here, but everyone thought that the ability to withdraw from the Union was the ultimate defense. The Constitution didn’t fail so much as the propaganda triumphed and the institutions of government failed. It is very clear we need improved technology of limiting the power of government :
“Alexa, should I kill myself today?” is apparently a question someone expects people to be asking their chatbot.
Yes, a chatbot will have the spirtual depth, the soul, to help people make end-of-life decisions. How do they validate such a program? I can see measuring satisfaction of the users, the normal approach. You can predict that some people won’t be entirely satisfied with advice to go on living. But what about the people who took the chatbot’s guidance to terminate their lives? Might many of those people have changed to wanting to live, had they had the chance? What morons thought this was a topic for a chatbot? :
The power of propaganda in Mao’s China’s feminism :
This is the military’s ‘Skynet’ to link everything. I think it is most likely will be another overlay network using IPv4’s TCP as a transport layer. IPv4 has better security than IPv2 and TCP has become the universal transport for other protocols. That is probably not optimal, as many network ideas were not pursued after IP displaced other networks, and so addressing by lat/long and bidding for bandwidth allocation as the basis for routing, among many other ideas, have not been evaluated for effectiveness in modern communication links :
The SEC’s computer security team is minimally competent, but their insider trading code and analysis group made up for it, eventually :
Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks can be foiled, the end of an era in internet history :

This sounds so simple, yet so few of us attain true success. Whatever you perceive success to be.
Consistency is key. You need to do the same thing over and over and over again until you get very good at what you are doing. You need to become an expert in your field. The challenge is to get into the top 5% in your field, that is where the money is. This is easier than you think. The secret is to learn to do “a little a lot”. It only takes 30 minutes a day, every day, year after year, to get into the top 5%.
You need to be extremely Focused in what you want to achieve and establish exactly what you need to do to achieve it. The more Focused you are the greater the results.
Unfortunately most people underestimate the effort it takes to achieve true success. They give up long before the results arrive. Hence the saying “An overnight success normally takes about 15 to 20 Years.” You can visualise as much as you like but without Massive Action you will not achieve any worthwhile Goal.
The final ingredient is Time. Rome was not built in a day. It was built over many days, one brick at a time.
Success is only achieved if you have Grand Worthwhile Goals. Goals that will inspire not only you but also those around you. Goals that will make a difference.
Your WHY needs to be strong enough so that the HOW becomes easy.
Success is in your reach if you have the strength of character to always be on a Mission with Passion.Should You Be Reading 'Southern Cross'?

Instant help from our qualified supportWhen the Mountain View High School football team went 5-5 two seasons ago, it gave the impression one of the Valley’s dormant programs might be about to awaken.
Then came last season’s 3-7 record and 0-5 mark in the Mission Valley League, which was followed by the unrelated resignation of seven-year head coach James Wilson.
So as new head coach Victor Ambruso begins his journey, the program he inherits appears to be at a fork in the road. Another bad season and the progress made in 2010 looks like a false alarm. Any improvement and the belief that things might be changing for the better will start to creep back in.
“I think we have a good plan,” Ambruso said. “I feel that we have what it takes to be competitive. We’re not going to blow anybody out. But in my eyes, with how we’re doing things this year, we’re going to be competitive and we’re not going to be pushed around.”
In order to get things rolling, the Vikings need across-the-board improvements from last season when the offense averaged just 4.6 points per game in league play and the defense allowed more than 35.
Mountain View will stick with the Wing-T offense installed by Wilson prior to 2010’s surprise season. The Vikings actually impressed this summer at the SGV Shootout and reached the quarterfinals.
Quarterback Xavier Yanez looks like a capable playmaker who can make throws most previous Mountain View quarterbacks could not. That may or may not have meaning since the Vikings only completed 12 passes all of last season.
Last year’s starting quarterback Josh Martinez will shift to running back and also play linebacker. Jose Zamora, who ran for 933 yards last season, returns and should be the feature back.
“We’ll have some more tweaks to the offense than what we had last year,” Ambruso said. “We’re able to expand the playbook a little bit more. My guess is they probably no more than three or four times a game (last year), which is kind of shocking considering how much they were down.”
Ambruso also is hoping eliminating two-way duties for the key contributors on offense will mean a fresher team in the second half of games and help eliminate turnovers. Ambruso estimates the Vikings fumbled three or four times per game last season.
Compared to what it was last season, the Vikings defense should be markedly better if its performance in the shootout is any indicator.
Mountain View will have eight or nine starters on defense focused solely on playing defense with no roles on offense. The top returnee on defense is safety Chris Gonzalez, who should vie for all-league honors.
Linebacker Jonathan Correa has turned heads this summer and should be the rock in the middle of the defense. The defensive line is led by Yoary Martinez, who will anchor things up front.
In past seasons, fans may not have seen the best talent Mountain View had to offer because key players were ineligible due to grades. That won’t be the case this season, according to Ambruso.
“We have nearly 100 percent of the players eligible,” Ambruso said. “We’ve got to get every kid eligible. I don’t care if that keeps us here to 7, 8 or 9 o’clock tutoring, we’re going to make sure every kid who’s in this program is going to be held accountable and is going to be eligible.”
Back-to-back road games against Arroyo and El Monte highlight the schedule. The Vikings have a solid nonleague slate, but with doable games against Bassett, Pioneer and Lynwood they just might have a winning record heading into league.
Head coach: Victor Ambruso
Year at school: First
Record at school: 0-0
2011 record: 3-7
Quotable: “Looking at the past scores, we’ve been blown out a lot. This year, our main goal is we’re going to be in games. We’re going to be competitive and we’re going to go into that fourth quarter with a good shot of winning the football game. With the type of defense we’re running and the type of offense, it’s really going to give us that opportunity.”

The managing director of the tech giant’s local operation Tony King told the Senate Economics References Committee on Corporate Tax Avoidance that all of its corporate taxes were up to date.
“We are a compliant taxpayer everywhere that we operate in the world,” King said (via The Australian).
Apple was hit by a $128 million tax bill in the 2016 financial year, including a $58.4 million adjustment for previous years, with revenue of $7.5 billion.
King said that Apple Australia will “continue to engage only with the ATO as to our current and future taxes” and that the recently introduced multinational tax avoidance laws would not impact the company.
“The anti-avoidance legislation is designed to look at companies who have their books and records, unlike Apple, on an offshore basis.”
“Apple continues to have a straightforward business model here in Australia that has essentially remained unchanged for decades… We buy, distribute, and sell Apple’s products to resellers and customers — the revenue from which is all recorded locally in our accounts,” King said (via Business Insider and ZDNet).Questions you should definitely ask during an interview for a tech role
Must-ask: Questions to ask before accepting a new tech job
When you apply for a job there are a number of important things that aren’t mentioned by the recruiter, at all, during the process of discovery. These are never advertised on the description for the job role, but as an applicant you should ask them during your first round, when given a chance.
If you interview people, on the other hand, this list might prepare you ahead of time.
So let’s get listing!
List of questions to ask a hiring manager during Engineering hiring process
1) Delivery expectations for role
- Usually the job description mentions requirements and experience, but what is the actual expectation for the role during your first 30-60-90 days at the company doing that job? What about at the end of the first year?
2) Training
- If I am interested in certain aspects of the technology (or anything pertinent to my role's vertical), can I get trained in it? - How do other people at the company do the training work: i.e. self-learning or workshop based? - Any concrete examples of training that benefitted a member of the team at the company?
3) Community contributions/open source
- Does the company work to contribute to open-source through own projects or supporting others? - A good rule of thumb is taking 20% of the engineering team's time to dedicated to OSS projects, alternatively does the company donate money to OSS maintainers/projects? - Hackdays or hackathons can also lead to open-source contributions...
4) Intellectual property
- Execution is key to nailing any business, but I.P. is a hammer. Asking if the company is working on anything specifically that can be considered their intellectual property is a smart move, and no, you don't need the details. Most companies don't have a solid answer to this question but those which do are *obviously* better prepared. Having a good idea whether someone has some secret sauce recipe is ALWAYS a good sign.
5) Frequency of deployments (CI/CD)
- When a company has a solid strategy for deploying and continuosly improving their product using git or similar systems, that usually equals maturity and stability. This is because when you set up a working CI/CD pipeline you can rollback, at any time, the code and (data incongruencies apart) sleep tight at night. - Also ask about testing, what kind of testing happens during the cycle of deployment?
6) Code quality practices
- On the topic of testing, how does a certain company review the code within the team? Are there regular code reviews or pair-programming session where multiple members of a team work together
7) Roadmap quality and grooming
- This is a long one, so I am just going to sum it up in one sentence:
Who is involved in the grooming process of the roadmap in the company? Top points if the answer includes a mention that engineers can directly propose changes and influence the backlog.
8) Career ladders
- I find that most organized and well structured have a simple and understandable career ladder document. When there is a defined career ladder, with levels, and expectations for each level of seniority within the team, you know what's expected for you to progress within the company. - It is a great sign for a successful and stable career in a company, on the other hand not having one means you're probably going to have to spend energy and resources to figure it out with whoever you're reporting to
9) Compensation
- Understanding how compensation works is paramount, by this step you should have already asked about the compensation and how bonuses/equity work, but if you haven't this is an extremely important question to ask. Equity or profit shares increases engagement within the team as people are more involved when their economic ties to the company are defined
10) Work life balance
- If the company is remote-first, what are the hours where everyone agrees you shouldn't be working? Are you following a 9-5 approach or something different. Are you going to end up having meetings with the team in SF at 3am? How much ASYNCHRONICITY does the team account for?
Any more ideas?

I enjoy watching the gopher tortoises on Sanibel. When viewed from a distance, they move across the grass at a surprisingly swift pace. They stop to eat worms, beetles, weeds, berries, anything they encounter. They are not picky, content to destroy anything that they run into with great disdain. Gopher tortoises are omnivores. They move along boldly with self-assurance as kings of their domains, carefree and oblivious to other species or events taking place in their environment.
Once in a while, however, I encounter a gopher tortoise walking across the road. Its speed seems slow, and its step tentative. Perhaps it is out of its domain and feels vulnerable. A couple of times, I have gotten out of my car to pick up a tortoise crossing the road and move it to the side. As it is being approached, the tortoise will quickly draw in its head and feet, becoming a fully armored creature. The contrast between the bold confidence with which it crosses the grass, and its swift retreat into the confines of its hard, nearly impenetrable shell is striking. When unable to be the master of lawns, caterpillars, grubs, and snails, the gopher tortoise hides under its dome, isolated from aspects of the world that it views as threatening.
I am struck by the similarity between the gopher tortoise and Bishop Frank Dewane of the Diocese of Venice in Florida, which includes the island of Sanibel. Bishop Dewane gives the appearance of being a bold leader. He sends off missives to government officials advising them to be charitable and to act with justice. He has a section on his diocesan website showing him to be “out and about.” He thrives on supportive news stories and photo ops that he is able to generate. He is in charge: reading to children, presiding at graduation Masses, flashing a brief smile, meeting Pope Francis. On occasions, he sends off cards to people in the diocese expressing that he cares for them, hoping to win esteem and confidence. Experience indicates that in the same way the gopher tortoise sees nourishment when presiding over its domain, Bishop Dewane sees financial opportunities when presiding over the people of his diocese. Bishop Dewane, too, is an omnivore. He exploits the rich, the poor, priests, laity, anyone whom he encounters when parading across his domain whom he deems to be a target to be taken advantage of to provide him with money, power, or prestige. That deceptive smile hides a voracious appetite.
At times, also, Bishop Dewane finds himself in territory where he cannot preside, cannot manipulate an individual. As a gopher tortoise hides under his shell, Bishop Dewane hides under his skull cap and miter. Letters from the faithful that ask sincere questions about faith and justice are ignored as he adjusts his skull cap to provide coverage meant to convey authority. Questions about his leadership built on bullying, temper, and deceit simply evoke an adjustment of the pectoral cross, a reach for his crozier, and a careful placement of the miter on his head to ensure that its coverage will radiate height, strength, and impenetrability. One so adorned should indeed be exempt from dealing with mere laity. He is safe.
A gopher tortoise hides for preservation, it seems that Bishop Dewane hides as well. Although the tortoise is nobly trying to protect its life, Bishop Dewane is only interested in his image and prestige. Which one is doing a better job of following God’s plan?
1 thought on “In Praise of the Gopher Tortoise”
The Gopher Tortoise is about to find a sink hole in the green grass he moves along so
boldly. Bishop Dewane is also about to find a sink hole. The abuse he distributes and distruction he has inflicted along his path is about to colide with his cover up’s . No adornment will protect him. No one is safe from such a preditor and he is no longer safe. He will join the long list of Bishops that are about to meet justice. Looking closely the sight I see are colorful snakes falling into a huge sink hole.It is a chilly Monday morning after a great weekend and now you’re back at your desk picking up where you left off on Friday. Time to look for something new. You need a career not just a job. Something with meaning. For an employer that appreciates you and takes care of their employees.
OK, here we go. Post resume job board. Check. Network with colleagues. Check. Update LinkedIn. Check. Peruse some online job postings. Now what happens?
Some recruiter from a staffing agency recruiter calls you. Chances are they have a job they want to pitch you….but wait, Hold On! Who are they? Do they understand why you are looking or what you are looking for in a new job?
There are a lot of questions you should be asking before deciding to work with a staffing agency.
5 Things to Know When Working with an Agency Recruiter
How did the recruiter contact you? First impressions matter and you can tell a lot by the recruiter’s initial approach.
- Email or LinkedIn InMail: Was it well written? Did they use an email template or was the email personalized to you referencing where you work now or what you do? Are they just emailing you a job description or are they interested in talking to you so they can understand your situation? Be picky.
- Phone: How is their introduction? Do they take the time to talk about their company and their specialization? Do they ask good open-ended questions about what type of position you are seeking? Style is important and so are listening skills. For example, it is a waste of your time to have them pitch you a job that is contract if you only want permanent.
- Referral: Who referred them to you? If it is someone you respect that is a good sign. Hopefully the person that referred thought highly enough of this staffing agency to refer you.
What is their story? Does the agency specialize in certain disciplines? What are some of the differentiating factors?
- You should really ask as many qualifying questions as possible to determine your comfort level. There are no right answers here. I wouldn’t assume that just because a recruiter has been in the business for less than a year that they are any less capable then someone who has been doing it for 10 years. The Recruiters Lounge writes about the different types of recruiters: Are You An Old School Or New School Recruiter?
- Most importantly you should feel that the recruiter is providing you with some sort of value proposition as to why you should work with them versus any of the other hundreds of other staffing agencies out there.
What is their process prior to them submitting your resume to one of their clients? This is very important and will tell you a lot about them. Two key things to consider.
- First, you want their pre-screen process to be thorough as it is best to work with picky recruiters. Why? Selective recruiters tend to be able to weed out the inappropriate jobs for you and are more successful at getting you an interview for a position for which you are truly a match. For technical positions they should understand technology enough to know what you do and exactly what type of positions are most appropriate for your background.
- Second, if you send them your resume do they officially (written or verbally) ask for your consent to send your resume to a specific company for a specific position? If not it means they may be sending your resume to companies without your knowledge and submitting your resume to jobs to which you have already applied.
What you don’t hear or see up front my surprise you. How can you figure out the quality of their “back-end” services once you decide you want them to submit your resume to one of their clients? Here are some good questions to help vet this out:
- When should I expect to hear back from you regarding feedback from your client? If I do get an interview, what is their interview process like?
- Who is the Account Manager that works with the client? Do they work directly with the hiring manager, through Human Resources, or through a Vendor Management System (VMS)?
- How long have you worked with the client? How many candidates have you placed there?
- If you place me on a contract position do you offer benefits? 401K?
- Who will I deal with after I start working for one of your clients? How often will they touch base with me to make sure everything is going okay?
Style! Ultimately you simply must feel comfortable with the Recruiter and their approach. If you feel they are pushy and don’t listen to you, chances are they are not the right fit to help you find your next career.By Rebecca Martin.
Russia is arguably the home of ballet. Some of the world’s greatest stars, past and present have trained there and they are renowned for their gymnastic flexibility and dynamic technique. Russian ballet schools and companies are infamously difficult to get into and are incredibly demanding on the body and psyche. Add into that the volatile state of the arts and politics in Russia and you’ve got dancers who are willing to do anything to get to the top and stay there.
When news of an acid attack against The Bolshoi Ballet’s Artistic Director spread on January 17 this year, the dance world was stunned. Most shocking of all was that it wasn’t a random act of violence, but a calculated attack by a disgruntled theatre employee who was unhappy with the state of play at The Bolshoi Ballet.
Ballet has previously only ever dipped its toes into political matters, mainly when a dancer wished to defect from a country, as Li Cunxin famously did from China, but now the art form is knee deep in the political battles of a theatre in crisis.
Prior to the incident on January 17, The Bolshoi’s Artistic Director, Sergei Filin had been feeling under threat for some time, noting that his phones had been blocked, his car tyres slashed and his internet hacked, all of which he believed was a warning.
Bolshoi Ballet soloist Pavel Dmitrichenko is the alleged mastermind of the attack, although he has said that he didn’t order anyone to throw acid at Filin’s face. Dmitrichenko complained about Filin to an acquaintance, Yuri Zurutsky, who then offered to beat up Filin. Zurutsky was paid 50,000 rubles (about $1,600) by Dmitrichenko to inflict harm on Filin because he was unhappy about the way money was distributed within the ballet company. ,” Dmitrichenko said in court.1
It has been suggested that Dmitrichenko was upset over Filin’s refusal to cast his girlfriend in a lead role. However, Filin’s lawyer has said that the group of people involved in the attack is much larger than the two men charged by police. Accusations and theories abound, with The Bolshoi’s general director, Anatoly Iksanov, accusing principal dancer Nikolai Tsiskaridze of inspiring the attack. Filin’s appointment as Artistic Director has exposed the infighting at The Bolshoi Ballet, with many dancers resisting his attempts to bring more modern repertoire to the company. He held an enormous amount of power, deciding matters of scheduling, casting, promotion and salary.
In Russian theatres today, defection and international travel are no longer the sources of drama. Instead, money is the main intruder aside from politics and professional rivalry. A dancer’s meagre salary is only boosted by Filin’s selection to perform leading roles. In Russia, lawlessness and corruption is the norm and what happens in the theatre is a reflection of what happens in the streets.“I feel like I’m on the front line of a war,” Filin said.2
In addition to the acid attack against Filin, The Bolshoi’s reputation has further been harmed by the recent revelations of former company dancer Anastasia Volochkova who claimed that it was a “giant brothel” with dancers forced to sleep with oligarchs and other influential members of society.
In a further twist to the tale, hundreds of dancers have sent a signed letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin demanding an investigation into Dmitrichenko’s confession. Filin himself believes that Dmitrichenko was party to something much greater than what has so far been uncovered and that the true mastermind is yet to be caught. Clearly he is not alone in his assertions.
Where does all of this leave ballet in Russia? Does this spell the end of the Bolshoi?
Ballet in Russia is part of the cultural landscape and a benchmark for dancers around the world. But the Bolshoi as a whole is devoid of a cohesive corps de ballet and is populated by gymnastic lead dancers who lack any great artistry on stage. Many of the best dancers are leaving Russia to dance in the United States and Europe and the company’s stars such as Svetlana Zakharova have been poached from The Mariinsky Theatre. The current scandals within The Bolshoi may affect the way the rest of the world perceives the company. Yet while the acid attack was shocking and the allegations of forced sexual activities are appalling, these things are apparently the norm in Russia and the locals are accustomed to such events.
The Bolshoi has fallen a long way since its golden age in the 1960s but it continues to create some of the world’s best dancers, firstly through the ballet school and then the company. Despite this, The Bolshoi itself isn’t guaranteed to last the test of time. The infighting that not only lead to the acid attack but the ensuing conflict amongst dancers and administrative staff, in addition to the current lack of direction for the company, doesn’t suggest much hope remains for a once great company.
“There is no happiness in our past,” the Soviet Bolshoi Ballet star Vladimir Vasiliev once said. “And there will be none in our future.”3

Let’s imagine for a moment that you are a scientist running a grand experiment on leadership. Your laboratory is an organization with hundreds of leaders at varying levels, and with technology, you can watch and listen to them 24-hours a day over an extend period of time. Sort of like the TV show Big Brother, except corporate style (and minus all the drama-filled antics). Essentially you get to observe the species Homo Sapiens Laederes in their native environment.
Your quest is to learn the behaviors that make servant leaders stand out from the crowd. In a noisy world where a few celebrity leaders grab the headlines, and everyone tries to copy-cat their way to becoming an overnight leadership success, servant leadership has withstood the test of time as a tried and true approach to effectively leading people and organizations. You would observe at least five key ways servant leaders are different from their counterparts.
Servant leaders…
- Listen more than they talk—A servant leader is much more interested in hearing the viewpoints of others than having their voice be the loudest in the room. Make no mistake, servant leaders clearly articulate their point of view and cast a vision for the organization, but they do so after they’ve spent plenty of time hearing from others, incorporating their ideas, and enlisting others in their cause. As Larry Spears observed in the book Servant Leadership in Action, listening is one of ten key characteristics of a servant leader. Listening involves paying attention to what is said and not said, identifying the will of the group, listening to the leader’s own inner voice, and coalescing that input into a clear plan of action.
- Say we more than me—When servant leaders do talk, they focus the attention on their team by speaking in the collective we, rather than the personal me. Servant leaders know that leadership isn’t about them; it’s about others. Robert K. Greenleaf, the father of the modern servant leader movement, said the motive of a servant leader is to serve first, and out of that desire to serve rises a conscious decision to lead. Servant leaders are driven to improve the welfare, contribution, and autonomy of others, not to garner fame, attention, or status for themselves. Their focus is on we, not me.
- Flex their leadership style to meet the needs of their followers—Since servant leadership is about doing what’s best for others and helping them to realize their full potential, servant leaders adapt their leadership style to provide the right amount of direction and support their followers need. There is no one best leadership style. If someone is new to a task, the leader provides higher levels of direction to teach the how, what, where, when, and why. If the follower has a moderate level of competence but is unsure of himself, the servant leader uses a supportive style to build the follower’s confidence and help him problem solve. Servant leaders understand their followers have varying levels of competence and commitment on their tasks or goals so they adjust their leadership style to the situation.
- Look for opportunities to shine the light on others—As you observe leaders in this mythical experiment, you’d notice that servant leaders make an intentional effort to give people the chance to be in the spotlight and to praise them for their accomplishments. Servant leaders don’t care who gets the credit; they care about helping people and the organization succeed. Ken Blanchard likes to say that “people who feel good about themselves produce good results, and people who produce good results feel good about themselves.” It’s a virtuous process that servant leaders look to perpetuate.
- Treat failures as learning moments—Failure is inevitable; learning is optional (click to tweet). Servant leaders view failure as an invaluable teaching tool, and rather than punish or demean people for making a mistake, they turn it into a positive and make it a learning moment. This is possible because servant leaders have a high level of trust with their followers. When people are trusted, they aren’t afraid to take risks and try something new. They know that if they fail, their leader will partner with them to use the opportunity to grow, learn, and do better next time. My friend and fellow servant leader, Garry Ridge, CEO of WD-40, embodies this philosophy. He believes that creating a culture of learning has been one of the pillars of WD-40’s success, an organization with 93% employee engagement.
Although it would be cool to take part in this kind of mad scientist experiment, it really isn’t necessary. Research about the effectiveness of servant leadership is plentiful and the traits of a servant leader are common sense, albeit not common practice. If you look around and see people engaging in these five behaviors and others like them, chances are they’re servant leaders who are bringing out the best in their people and organizations.The blue steeple of Durnstein Abbey

Foot patrols are a basic COIN tactic, a specfically stated point of "guidance" (order?) in Gen. Petraeues August 1, 2010 Counterinsurgency Guidance, as noted here. As Petraeus wrote:
Walk. Stop by, don't drive by. Patrol on foot whenever possible and engage the population. Take off your sunglasses. Situational awareness can be gained only by interacting face to face, not separated by ballistic glass or Oakleys.
COIN doctrine assumes that putting US forces out on the road, like walking, not sitting, ducks, is a means to "earn their [Afghan] trust." And "earning their trust" is the linchpin of COIN, and, thus, the linchpin of all US war and nation-building policy in Afghanistan.
It is a cracked linchpin, and it cries out Congressional attention. It is incumbent upon our US Representatives and Senators to investigate whether this tactic of IED-foot patrols -- and other COIN tactics including restrictive ROEs, payola, and reverence for the Koran -- are working. Even more important, it is incumbent upon Congress to investigate whether this strategy of "earning their trust" is working. It is time to bring in the generals and the secretary of defense to ask them some real questions for a big, fat change.
Back to the USA Today story. Remember, we have learned to expect "IED incidents" to increase. Now, the general in charge of what is called the Joint IED Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) -- catchy acronym, that -- explains his mission:
Protecting troops from stepping on bombs has become the top priority, he said.
One quick way to protect them is to curtail if not cancel foot patrols while Congress investigates 1) their effectiveness as a tactic in the strategy of earning Afghan trust; 2) the strategy of earning Afghan trust; 3) what (the hell) "Afghan trust" actually means and 4) whether Uncle Sam should be spending $350 million every single day of the year to "earn" it.
But no.
The story continues:
Commanders favor foot patrols because of their effectiveness in building trust with locals while rooting out the Taliban.
Does the phrase "circular argument" come to mind? Certainly, the overriding issue -- the Western sickness of nation-building on the backs of the COIN-indoctrinated military-- is never confronted and we are left twirling around with palliatives: the "handheld mine detectors," "small drones," and "bomb-sniffing dogs" that are being "rushed to the front lines."
Dogs have become so vital to foot patrols that battalion commanders must sign off on operations that do not include them in their plans, he said. ...
Just wait until some village elder tells a US commander that, sorry, but dogs are "najis" (or regional equivalent) or "unclean" to Muslims: Bye-bye pooches.
The vast majority of IEDs in Afghanistan (84%) are powered by homemade explosives whose main ingredient is fertilizer, Barbero said. Virtually all of that comes from Pakistan, and it is "ubiquitous" in Afghanistan, he said.
The Pentagon, State Department and intelligence agencies have formed a task force to reduce the amounts entering Afghanistan, he said. The fertilizer ammonium nitrate already has been banned in Afghanistan.
Reducing the fertilizer supply is a worthwhile effort, said John Pike, director of Globalsecurity, a public policy organization focused on defense issues.
Because it takes a relatively small amount to make a bomb, the effort probably won't reduce the threat substantially, Pike said.
Good thing thing Uncle Sucker formed an Af-Pak-Pak-Af-Fertilizer-Reduction Joint Task Force (APPAFRJTF).
Instead, he said, establishing "persistent surveillance" of insurgents and areas where they might plant bombs shows the most promise....
Persistent surveillance of insurgents? How about establishing some oversight over our Pentagon?Can A Lawyer Assist Them With Employees Compensation Claims For A Work Injury?

Article Personal Injury Claim, Car Crash Injury ClaimI recently fell in love with the REISS Autumn/Winter 2014 collection. Have you seen it? I was introduced to it at the Content to Commerce Summit where they were one of the sponsors. The collection is gorgeous with simple lines, patterns and textures. I had been to their store in Soho and I wanted everything in my closet. I think I'm adding a few of these items to my Christmas list! Here are a few looks from the collection. Enjoy!“I was cleaning my field. At a depth of 70 centimeters, I found the first shell. I continued digging and I found more of them. I’ve collected them for my collection,” said Mehmed Delic from Delici in BiH, who found fossils of about 5 million years old shells.
I will not give these fossilized shells to anyone. I’ll keep them for future generations and pass the story about the existence of the Pannonian Sea from generation to generation,” said Mehmed.
Pannonian Sea “left” our region around 5 to 6 million years ago. However, it is possible even today to come across the evidence of this sea, and even on its remains. The latest evidence was discovered in BiH near Gracanica, near the road Gracanica – Orasje. In the village of Borik in the area of Soko, there are excavations that contain huge amounts of sediment, gravel and sand, for which experts state that they are remains of the Pannonian Sea. The greatest proof of the existence of the Pannonian Sea are fossils of shells and sea organisms.
In the village Delici, 6 kilometers away from Gracanica, almost every house has its own collection of fossilized shells.
Zeljko Zubanovic, priest in Klakar, near Slavonski Brod, is an excellent expert in of shells and he concluded that the fossils of shells and urchins are proof that the area in Slavonia, Posavina and northern Bosnia were covered by the Pannonian Sea.
In Delici, fossils of shells or stones with holes are found often. Almost every house has a collection of fossils. In the Pannonian Sea in the zone of strong waves lived bivalve mollusks with thick shell, and in the deep sea with thin shell.

How can the power needed to drive Indonesia’s transformation be ensured?Ruma Balasubramanian (Google Cloud)
Google Cloud has appointed Ruma Balasubramanian as managing director of Southeast Asia, replacing Tim Synan who has relocated to Italy with the technology giant.
Effective immediately, Singapore-based Balasubramanian is tasked with driving the vendor’s go-to-market strategy across customer and partner segments, in addition to delivering operational execution and building on growing enterprise momentum within the region.
Balasubramanian joins Google Cloud from Cisco, having spent more than eight years in a number of regional management roles, most recently as vice president and chief transformation officer across Asia Pacific and Japan. Prior to Cisco, Balasubramanian was vice president and general manager of then Hewlett Packard’s Enterprise Services division, following more than a decade at EDS Corporation.
Balasubramanian replaces Synan who has transitioned to another role as part of Google Cloud’s Global Strategic Initiatives team, based in Milan, Italy.
“Google Cloud Platform, Google Workspace, and industry-based artificial intelligence and machine learning solutions are critical enablers for economic recovery and growth in Southeast Asia,” Balasubramanian said. “As enterprises of all sizes look to digitise, modernise and innovate, I’m thrilled to embark on this journey with Google Cloud to accelerate cloud adoption for our customers.”
Balasubramanian's appointment comes amid strong momentum for Google Cloud in Southeast Asia, with the vendor counting Bank BRI, Gojek, NTUC Fairprice Co-Operative and REA Group as key customers, in addition to Reliance Health Services, Tiki Group, True Digital and Tokopedia among others.
The move also comes six months after Google Cloud officially launched a new region in Jakarta, in a landmark move designed to help businesses overcome traditional barriers to cloud adoption in Indonesia.
The newly unveiled GCP region - first communicated to the market in October 2018 - comes with the vendor’s standard set of services, including Compute Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine and Cloud SQL, alongside Cloud Storage, Cloud Spanner, Cloud Bigtable and BigQuery.
Representing the first GCP region in Indonesia - and ninth in Asia Pacific - the launch comes with three cloud zones from the start, enabling high availability workloads across the country. Collectively, Google Cloud now offers 24 regions and 73 zones across 17 countries worldwide.
“We’ve achieved many ‘firsts’ in Southeast Asia under Tim Synan’s leadership,” added Rick Harshman, managing director of Asia Pacific at Google Cloud. “Ruma joins us at an exciting time as our business continues to grow from strength to strength in one of the most dynamic regions for technology adoption. We look forward to Ruma building on this strong foundation.”Trek Powerfly FS 4

How do we reconcile God’s mercy with His punishment? In this episode, host Mohamad Zaoud explores this question with Sheikh Mohammad Elshinawy, author of the Yaqeen Institute paper “The Infinitely Merciful and the Question of Hellfire.”
if god knows that we're going to sin why does he still punish us if god is so merciful why is there a hell fire better still why is there an eternal hell fire
welcome to double take a podcast by yaqreen institute where we explore ideas and questions in islam that give us pause i'm muhammad zawad and today on the show we're exploring the concept or the reconciliation between allah's mercy and allah's punishment and with me is sheikh mohammed al-shinawi author of the paper the infinitely merciful and the question of hell-fire muhammad assalam alaikum foreign
thank you so much for joining us you you studied extensively english literature and you also studied uh at madina university the hadith and the sciences of hadith so you could have gone in a million different ways but you decided uh to focus at least with with regards to today's episode you you decided to focus on the question of hellfire what led you to focus on this topic when you could have gone in in multiple directions so bismillah will begin the name of allah praising glory be to him and may his finest peace and blessings be upon his messenger muhammad sallallahu and his family and his companions and all those who adhere to his guidance until the last day um a number of reasons it was requested of me but this was a near and dear topic to my heart because i've gotten this a lot that how can we reconcile the fact that god is the most merciful and the most great and then he would actually punish us or even care about whether or not we are upright or evil or any of that i remember one young man uh struggling with his faith he said to me in a coffee shop once that you actually want me to believe that the creator of the galaxies actually cares what tiny me is doing in a tiny corner of this tiny rock in the middle of the universe and that question of course it is a very arbitrary objection but it speaks a lot to a sentiment that we should validate which is the concept of hellfire does cause apprehension i mean no one wants to feel punishable and that is normal and maybe that sentiment is overly accentuated in our times because you know modern ethics and psychology they're obsessed with the elimination of guilt um and so i understand where the sentiment is coming from and a lot of people struggle with this but at the same time a lot of people struggle with the very opposite as well that they want to be sure that god is merciful and compassionate and does does actually care about us right i remember being in a university once and they asked me to speak on god's mercy and his infinite compassion and when i did so i received a email days later about a sister that was struggling with her faith and my wife and i we went to meet with her and i asked her you know what do you believe at the moment do you believe that there's a god to begin with he said i'm not sure and it kind of blew my mind how this should not have you know um triggered you to hear so much about god's mercy to the point that she walked out of the lecture actually and that's why she reached out to me that i wasn't able to finish the lecture but at the same time if god is imaginary if he's a fantasy if he's a social construct then why would you be so moved about the mention of his mercy and that's it like deep down inside we want to know that god is there for us uh on this distant planet us tiny creatures when we're subjected to distress when we're subjected to evil when we're you know subjected to uh wrongdoing but at the same time you want to say i think it's beneath god or i hope that it's beneath god he'll just overlook it when i'm the oppressor i'm the one doing the wrong doing and so to reconcile these concepts is very healthy and really an opportunity to show how only revelation can do it and so to capture how revelation captured the balance between allah azza's mercy and the possibility of punishment this paper was an opportunity for that no i'm i'm honestly very grateful that you've covered the topic and extensively as well because a question in my mind um like we're going to go through you know why it was created and you know the different uh aspects of of that but the one thing that i need to ask right off the bat is why allah even created hellfire like i know that you know when we pray five times a day we always talk about or always hear that allah is so merciful you know alhamdulillah we always hear the the concept of mercy and that's kind of you know the default uh understanding that we have of allah but at the same time we're taught about his punishment um and uh and not just that allah spends so much time in the quran describing that punishment you know in hellfire is not really kind of just mentioned and then mentioned in passing it's very descriptive it's very graphic you know there are moments in the quran where allah says they ask for water and they get oil instead or their skin is is replaced so they can so it can be burnt again like it's it's really graphic so my question to you right off the bat is why did allah create hellfire sure i mean some people may say this is graphic and it causes me anxiety to even hear about this this is also said and we want to question the notion is is all anxiety bad like this was partially intended of course this becoming the dominant uh you know hyper fixation of your understanding of god and becomes you know equivalent with god himself the punisher that's not even one of his names right that becomes the problem but there is a degree of anxiety there is a degree of you know apprehension uh insecurity that could bring out of you the best version of yourself and that is of the reasons why god created the hellfire and created it in such a way that he knows in his perfect wisdom will move us in that direction those of us that are willing to move those of us prosperous enough to accept embrace the invitations and guidance and move in that direction but you know there's something that needs to be said here which is this is too graphic this is too much that is your you know or logical assessment it is illogical actually to assume that we would have no limitations in understanding god because he is the most wise and which means we cannot possibly have you know the perfect uh wisdom the perfect understanding regarding god right we say in english i'm not sure if they say in australia you can't have your cake and eat it too do you guys say that yeah we say it you sure you guys say it it's all right sugar is not good for you anyway but but yeah so this saying means what like you you can't enjoy something and then you know uh you know keep it uh in front of you forever you you have to decide right so why the apprehension like why do i need why do i need that anxiety in my life so yeah anxious enough so a healthy dose and and i think we should talk about how to determine it's a healthy dose but what i meant with the uh the example of it being illogical or this point is that is god the most wise is god the most just or are we see god created us we have a sense for justice we know what moral principles are like you know compassion justice yes we know these things but moral judgments on the detailed level we only know what god revealed to us so you can't say i take my judgments determinations of right and wrong from god and then come back and want to say wait a minute but how did god judge in this way that there has to be a hell fire that is this much and so why is it it is extremely beneficial for there to be a hellfire uh and extremely uh equitable for there to be a hellfire beneficial because i mean look at the fruits the people that say this is too much well you know i am not the one and i'm not even going to quote a muslim that says muslims are the most religiously committed people in the world you know the the readers of this quran are islam their religion has such a command on them that people from other faiths notice it i remember john paul ii you know the previous pope you know he was once like lamenting to to christians or or catholics he said to them that whenever i see our magnificent cathedrals and the beautiful architecture and i think about how vacant they are all the time i wish you know people from our faith would take a lesson from the muslims who wherever they are they stop on a dime five times a day and they pray to their lord right and so the fruit is actually there and so someone who's offering a different framework uh needs to show us its fruits uh on the ground and so ultimately there has to be a hellfire and it has to we have to be told about it and told about it in the perfect way which is the way the quran said it and that doesn't mean that this hellfire will ever out do or win over on god's mercy no but at the same time god's mercy does not necessitate that there not be justice the same way we say in the paper that god's mercy is unlimited we say that he is also not limited by his mercy from exacting justice okay i i get it like that it's about deterrence you know you have a carrot and a stick and um you know in this life there are people who do absolutely awful things um whether they're bombing something or you know there's a serial rapist or a serial killer or there's major kind of atrocities that happen in this life and the concept of hellfire is there as a deterrent for justice i get that but allah being the most merciful um isn't there other ways for him to be just like does he have to burn us yeah so this is assuming that you know uh people are going to be burned the moment they commit a sin there are tons of stations for a person to be forgiven so when we say god's justice god's justice does justice and we even focus too much on that you're assuming that god will be just with you no god will always be at least just with you but you know great scholars like abner he speaks about 11 stations of forgiveness that god sets up before a person is sentenced to the hellfire you know he speaks about the fact that there are eight doors to paradise uh and only seven gates to the hellfire he speaks about how god many times sets up for you along your way uh you know mechanisms and opportunities not just to be deterred but even when you're not deterred to reform that are involuntary so it's not even like you're seeking god's forgiveness or you do a good deed that outweighs your bad deeds but you'll send you know a difficulty your way every prick of every thorn is yet another opportunity to you know put a dent in that pile of wrongdoing that could subject us to being burned at the very end of the road okay um thank you i mean you're helping me kind of come to terms with it and i i get it it's it's there for justice uh my question to you then and uh this for me is a really challenging one um because i get the question often uh it's the concept of the infinite hellfire or the eternal hellfire um which means basically if i'm on this earth for seven years and let's just say i was sinning for 70 years and doing the same sin over and over again for seven years why then am i in hell fire for eternity right so this is also another common concern that is brought up uh regarding punishment in the hellfire how do we say that god is just but at the same time there's an infinite punishment for a finite you know set of crimes which is a lifetime of crimes so let's build from the ground up number one no sin and no lifetime of sins will ever mean lifetime in the hellfire that's not islam not quran not true it is only shirk which is the mother of all sins shirk means to set up rivals to god and ultimately we would need another episode to speak about why [ __ ] why rejection of god uh setting up equals to god is the greatest sin what is so you know dastardly about you know uh the the rights of the creator being violated the creator at the end of the day in a word is worthier and greater than all of the creation combined so violating him a greater violation so that's number one we're only talking about associating partners setting up rivals contenders with god that's number one the only sin a lifetime of sins that don't include that we're not talking about them number two those who actually commit this mother of all sins this if they did not receive the message of islam then they are not guilty for the greatest crimes they get dismissed as well because they didn't get a fair chance at discovering god and submitting to him and aligning with the truth and then those who did commit it and received the message and you know lived their entire lives upon shirk but they repented from it then they also are not included in the category right and so we're talking about a very specific class of people these are the people who committed shirk and received the message of islam and continued to rebel against god after discovering his message and died upon that those people might and i use the word might deliberately enter the hell fire forever why do i say might because the scholars of islam all agree all of sunni scholars agree that you know the believer will enter paradise forever and the disbeliever who is guilty of his disbelief and dies upon that will not ever enter paradise but they disagree on whether he will be in the hell fire forever some of them this is reported about even some of the sahaba like abdullah
himself may allah be pleased with them all this is like an opinion most famously championed by ibm they believe that these people spend a very long time in the fire that very specific class of people but then they and the fire will cease to exist at some point they will vanish okay so people that cannot grasp this issue you know we tell them it is not like you're rejecting islam you're rejecting the mainstream understanding about this very specific point within islam but let me also defend the mainstream position because let's assume the mainstream position is right the mainstream position being that there is an eternal that yes that very specific class for that specific sin would spend eternity uh in the hell fire would that be unjust first of all god would never be unjust we've already covered that we cannot one-up god on his justice or his muslim but also can this be rationalized now yes the majority would argue that it can be rationalized how because you are not being punished for your lifetime of [ __ ] or you dying upon you are being punished based on god's knowledge that you would have continued doing this forever you see god did not need to give us this life of ours to judge us his foreknowledge is certainly sufficient and perfect he gave us this life so that we would recognize at the end of it that he has not been unjust with us but we are told in the quran that when these people are standing over the fire may allah protect us and you from ever drawing near to the fire when they're standing over it they will say yeah we wish we can go back meaning to this lifetime right and allah says if they were to go back they would still be disbelievers they'd go back to being disbelievers the fir like they were the first time like they did the first time around and so that is what they are being punished eternally for according to that interpretation so there's nothing unfair about it you did not stop being a rejecter of god forever on your own accord so you don't get credit for it you were interrupted from this by death it is similar to the prophet muhammad sallallahu alaihi you know when he said when two muslims come at each other and this is not self-defense right this is actively deliberately trying to kill each other fighting yeah without justification right not in the pursuit of justice one of them is not a police officer no two muslims come at each other with their swords he said the killer and the killed are both in the fire they said yeah rasulallah we get it why the killer would be in the fire but why would someone who's killed go to the fire he said because he was keen on killing his brother you see the fact that he lost the fight or was one step too slow is not something he gets credit for and therefore their punishment would be equal that is the idea of how an infinite uh punishment were that the case to still be fair if you only got a chance to act out a finite number of crimes or the mother of all crimes should we say so if i'm to summarize because there's a lot to take up sorry to take in no no i i i appreciate it you know and it's a very kind of intricate uh topic so you know hellfire was created for for justice and i think we acknowledge that um and the the concept of it being an eternal hellfire uh is debatable amongst the scholars there is a portion of scholars or some sahabi who say that there is no eternal hell fire it actually ceases to exist after a period of time but the majority of scholars say um that there is an eternal hell fire but there's only one group of people that fall into that category um but the you know the the bulk of people are going to paradise through hellfire if i understand correctly um uh you go as far as saying that hellfire plays a therapeutic role now i have never come across this concept before of hellfire being therapeutic it's probably the last thing that i think about when i think of kind of hell and and and the atrocities that happen in hell um what's this concept of a therapeutic hellfire yeah so we discussed some of this in the paper but it is beyond the scope of even that paper there is so much uh that can be said on the therapeutic uh offerings of the existence of the hellfire how what that serves so even in this world for example a person is is uh spiritually rehabilitated by the concept of the hellfire what does that mean the same way that you know prosperity and luxury and extravagance can delude a person into doubting things right like doubting the reality of this world the temporal nature of this world doubting god all that right the same way luxury can delude a person into doubting likewise fear can drive a person to faith because the possibility of it being true is gonna make me wanna confirm because the stakes are high that is our human nature god who created our psyche knows how we function and so that is part of uh the reason why there's a fire and the therapeutic function spiritually of that that's in this world and then also take an example from the next world like in the hereafter there are people that would enter the hellfire to be purified from their crimes and so remedying the souls that have you know corrupted themselves a person can say can god you know remedy them without punishing them yes but he deemed that part of the just requittal is that there may be an element of of pain involved there may be an element of sentencing it is actually the pain it is actually the temporary suffering that purifies them as dictated by his perfect justice subhana also therapeutic for uh those that deserve to uh be avenged you know i remember one writer who did not believe in a god she was stuck uh post-world war with a notion that she wrote about in her memoirs she said wait a minute hitler just died and that's it hitler just died and that's it you know likewise you know many people who uh you know saw the brunt of an oppressor they will never feel fully healed until they see justice with their own two eyes that's actually why in the quran allah speaks about his favor on the israelites and he says
and one of the things we did for you we blessed you with allowing you to see our drowning of the pharaoh while you were looking on from the from the shores right and so in the hell fire there will be people that will be healed by seeing those who massacre children killed their loved ones imprisoned their fathers theirs and their sons and so on and so forth they will be healed by this okay so it's therapeutic in two ways it's therapeutic in the sense that those who are on the receiving end of an injustice or an oppression knowing that the oppressor is being punished is therapeutic in itself um but also uh hellfire being therapeutic in the sense that it's a cleanse before we get into paradise and that's two ways in in the next world on top of the spiritual rehabilitation that happens in this world being driven to faith by fear okay okay so like clearly you know this is the first time i i learn about concepts like this and you talk in your paper about um the way allah's mercy is explained to us and the way allah's punishment is explained to us as we're growing up you know in our pedagogy how would you teach allah's mercy and allah's punishment punishment if i was sitting there after one of your lectures and i had all those doubts what would be your methodology what's the right way to kind of explain this whole concept to a younger me for example yeah this is really about changing a person's frame of reference you know to the credit of australians uh when i visited melbourne uh there was a lot of political turmoil uh muslim-related a lot of raids were happening first time in australian history and you know i was met at the conference by a muslim brother who did his phd his thesis on islamophobia right the manufacturing of fear right the fear-mongering that is very systematic words and about muslims for policies and to the end of it right so he apparently has to like sit on a lot of panels and a lot of news briefings and he's invited by a lot of news anchors and channels to speak about this whenever like a bad muslims in the news so he said to me something so profound backstage and i took it with me over the years he said to me you have no idea how hard it is to begin a conversation from a beheading right because you know some you know radicalizing that being the topic yeah okay yeah and so he beheaded someone or something right he says that you know that shocking image that visualization that's been of course disproportionately focused on in the news and so on and so forth he says when that's on everybody's mind it act it doesn't matter much that i'm the standing expert that knows all the statistics about how peaceful muslims are compared to other communities and groups and so on and none of this matters because the frame of reference the you know the premise from which the conversation launched was a beheading so it's just like it falls on deaf ears so that's what you want to do here as well people's frame of reference needs to change by the way we speak about this as well like it's not just you know the secular age and the anti-religious sentiments that you know skew people and create that imbalance of fear more than hope it's you know it's bad preaching also when me and you grew up and perhaps heard so much about allah as you know an imposer of injunctions haram hellfire we were taught to fear allah so much more than we were taught to love allah that's a big problem because how did allah introduce himself in the quran like you say you read all the time in fact right most merciful grantor of mercy yeah we read that and before we read maliki omadeen right the intimidating owner of the day of judgment verse because allah wants us to see him that way that he is the most merciful first and then owner of the day of judgment also and this is permeates the quranic narrative by the way you know allah says for example tell my servants that i am the most forgiving and i am the most merciful and my punishment he doesn't say i am i'm the most merciful i'm the most forgiving and my punishment is severe punishment that's as if to say this is who i am and if i happen to punish it's bad right it's a very different it's nuanced but it's a very different description every surah in the quran begins with allah's mercy it doesn't begin by any other attributes of god and so centering that is extremely important and that does require like you said some unlearning and some relearning and part of this is not just reading deeply the quran part of this also it requires us to focus on and realize the importance of self-awareness like am i imbalanced what needs more nourishment because you know they say that for your relationship with god to take flight the early muslims would say it is like you know the metaphor of a bird the head of the bird is the love of god because that's what your perspective comes from your head right and also your life because if you lose your head you lose your life so the head of the bird the most dominant quality we a believer should be having towards god is love and then the two weeks yeah you've got to learn how to love god yeah and then there are the wings the wings are fear and hope fear and hope you have to figure out am i too afraid am i not you know uh hopeful enough and then if i am hope too hopeful you know is there not enough fear so you gotta create that balance so that your flying is actually linear survival and then linear progression as you're talking about the concept of hellfire and and punishment and its therapeutic nature
i'm thinking honestly like of the verse uh may i follow allah become like allah what does he want with your punishment like why why would he even want to punish you that's not what he wants allah but growing up on the member you know in in islamic circles it's always the stick you know it's always kind of allah do this or you will get punished you know for example if we grew up in that environment and you know our fear of allah is is warranted because that's what we're hearing and that's our default position
how do we find that balance you know how do we grow up now and reteach ourselves that balance between allah's mercy and allah's you know justice and punishment
so some of our scholars they said that we should understand the quran to be a written universe and you know the counterpart the universe is like an observable quran meaning they go hand in hand uh towards understanding reality and faith so if we said the quran is very clear on allah wa ta'ala's mercy being dominant and infinite and unimaginable and his compassion of being greater for us uh than we ever realize and greater than you know our mother's mercy for us as the prophet sallallahu alaihi if that is the case we also are able to see that in the universe and that is why allah azza told us in the quran
go and look at the signs of the mercy of allah everywhere you know so with that lens you need to approach the world be mindful be looking for allah's mercy while certain from his book that it's there so that is a cognitive process that is part of spiritual growth spiritual training spiritual development to see with your insight uh you know what your eyes are detecting what you're detecting with your eyesight that's an important part of it and then also you need to self-evaluate that what should i be focusing on how do you know that you're not focused enough on the mercy of allah azzawajal well you quit doing good deeds you see because an extreme in hope is like an extreme in fear if you have too much hope you think everything's under control and i'm fine you're not driven right fueled to do good deeds because you feel like you don't need to and likewise too much fear you're gonna say i'm done i'm doomed there's no point and so i'm not gonna do and so you're i don't wanna say sweet spot but you gotta find where you are most productive where you are most accelerating on that straight path and so long as there are deeds to be done you want to figure out the balance that will drive you forward that'll carry you and then when the deeds are over you want to resign back to allah's mercy you know like when you couldn't do the deed and you failed that's not the end of the world that's why you know ibn's he said that of the signs that you're depending too much on your deeds is that you quit or you lose hope when you fail when you commit a bad deed it's like whoa why are you quitting it was never about your deeds to begin with like ultimately it's about allah's mercy and that's the way we want it right and likewise when your life is at its end uh you know the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said that we heard him say the prophet salallahu 3 days before he died let no one of you die except while assuming the very best of allah is this is your lord we are going to meet your maker who took care of you and you're going back to him now and since there's no more deeds to be done you're at the end of your life then you lean on your greatest deed which is hinging on his mercy so it is a process it is a lifelong process islam is not an event islam is a journey and so give yourself time don't to be too hard on yourself look and let the measuring stick the metric be actions for what is a healthy dose for me and then act accordingly because it really does vary and it does need to be customized you know and i won't take long saying this he speaks about the difference of opinions scholars had regarding your sins should i remember them should i forget them he said and the correct opinion is that these are all right for different contexts that if remembering my sin will help me from getting arrogant like what are you getting all conceited narrative about you've only been in the masjid for a year you've been clubbing for five years then remember your sin and if remembering your sin will uh you know slow you down and be a tool that shaitaan leverages on you that you think you're going to be a good person now you think you'll ever be able to turn a new leaf then forget your sin and you know steamroll ahead and so it is a lifelong journey allah's book allah's universe find the balance balance determined by you know your productivity and your actions and be self-aware understand yourself you are your own best doctor inshallah we're gonna we're gonna wrap up very shortly but i have one last question um we spent hamdulillah the last half an hour or so explaining the concept and honestly like i i'm content i i'm happy with the the answer but how would i explain this to a nine-year-old so if if that nine-year-old asks you
why does hell fire exist why does allah want to burn me or what's to that effect what's your answer to that nine year old kid in 30 seconds so i i would make sure that this child has the proper frame of reference for sure like if this is my child i know that this question will require a very simple answer because she sees allah as that but just in general a generic answer you know is that you know we know that allah is the most merciful subhanallah he is more merciful than all of our moms and all of our dads combined he's the one that made them merciful you know made their hugs so warm made their heart so selfless he did that he's the owner of all of that and so knowing this then you need to just rest assured that everyone is going to enter paradise except those who insist not to except those who refuse because i do believe even for a child the best answer is the answer of the prophet sallallahu alaihi
every single person in my ummah meaning those i was sent to will enter paradise except those who refuse they said who would refuse or messenger of god he said those who follow me enter paradise and those who uh you know renegade those who refuse those who rebel then they have refused paradise
and thank you so much for the paper and for your work on this concept of hellfire and allah's mercy
i look forward to the next few episodes regarding other topics inshallah with you Obama to punish him for issuing an executive order giving fewer than half of the nation’s undocumented workers a limited ability to remain in the United States.
Americans would prefer if Congress fixed this problem. But Congress hasn’t. In the year and a half since the Senate passed a bipartisan immigration reform bill, House leaders have refused to permit a vote on it. So now, President Obama, like all 10 presidents since 1956, Republican and Democrat, has issued an executive order on immigration. The order says America will treat 5 million striving unauthorized immigrants with respect.
Exactly one week before Thanksgiving, President Obama described his order to the American people. It broadens the “dreamer” program that provides temporary reprieves from deportation to unauthorized immigrants brought to the United States as children. It establishes temporary work authorization for undocumented immigrants who have lived in the United States for at least five years and are parents of American citizens or servicemen. It directs the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to focus on deporting criminals and suspected terrorists and orders Homeland Security to help secure the border.
It disqualifies new undocumented immigrants. Anyone who has entered the United States recently or who enters now without authorization is excluded. The order is limited as well. It lasts only as long as Obama is president. The next executive could continue it. Or kill it.
If such a program had been in place 14 years ago, actress Diane Guerrero, who plays Maritza Ramos on the show Orange is the New Black, would have been spared separation from her parents and brother. Guerrero described her family’s deportation in an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times earlier this month. She was just 14 when she arrived home from school to find lights on, dinner started but her family missing.
Born in the United States, Guerrero was a citizen. Her parents and brother were not. Neighbors broke the news to her, these new émigrés work to give their children a better life. Some young undocumented workers today labor to give their parents in Mexico remittances that enable them to survive after NAFTA destroyed their ability to eke out a living from subsistence farms. Americans respect those family values.
Unauthorized immigrants are lured into the United States by the promise of jobs, whether it’s making hotel beds, washing cars or picking produce. Employers want their labor. Farmers who rely on the backbreaking work of unauthorized immigrants found, co-chaired by former governors from both parties, said immigration reform would be a powerful instrument of economic revitalization: “The results make clear that reform.”
In addition, reform means immigrants no longer need fear deportation for reporting violations such as wage theft, perilous working conditions and workplace violence. This protects native-born workers because employers who become accustomed to impunity for illegal exploitation of immigrants quickly attempt to abuse all workers.
While unauthorized immigrants have long prayed for reform, 57 percent of native born Americans now believe those entreaties should be answered. The number is higher – 74 percent– if reform includes a path to citizenship, fines, back taxes and background checks.
But a president’s power is limited, and Obama stopped short extending citizenship. That’s.LATEST:

LACON, Ala. – A high-speed chase originating in Morgan County after an attempted stop for a traffic violation led authorities into Cullman County, where officers from the Cullman Police Department and Cullman County Sheriff’s Office joined in the pursuit Friday evening. Alabama State Troopers were also involved. The vehicle eventually stopped off Interstate 65 Exit 318 at Lacon, where two suspects were apprehended.
No officers were injured. The suspects sustained minor injuries but were treated at the scene.
According to Cullman Police Capt. Gene Bates, the suspects fled from Morgan County, down I-65 South. Once in Cullman County, they exited onto U.S. Highway 278 through Cullman, down West Main Avenue and into Good Hope, where they got back on I-65 North.
CPD Officer Rob Long deployed spike strips; however, the suspects avoided them and exited onto Exit 310 and went down Alabama Highway 157 to Hwy. 278, where they turned back and came through Cullman again, taking a left on U.S. Highway 31 to Cherokee Avenue and to Good Hope and back to I-65.
The spike system was deployed again by Long near Exit 308, and this time all four of the suspects’ tires were deflated. The vehicle continued north and lost its tires, running on rims.
Once at Exit 318, the suspects exited the interstate and wrecked as deputies with the Morgan County Sheriff’s Office were preparing to perform a pit maneuver to end the pursuit.
Bates said the driver had three felony warrants and the passenger had misdemeanor warrants.
As of press time, officers were recovering controlled substances that the suspects threw from the vehicle at various locations during the pursuit.Husband of children’s book author accused of torturing children says his wife beat him, locked him up for intervening

Why I Love This Recipe
I'm from Greek lineage so I'm pretty picky about my Spanikopita - this has taken me years to perfect.
Ingredients You'll Need
2 10-oz packages fresh spinach
1 T salt
1/2 lb feta
3 T grated parmesan
1 medium onion, chopped
1/4 cup chopped parsley
16 oz cottage cheese (sometimes I use ricotta)
several sprigs fresh dill, chopped
1/4 cup olive oil
3 eggs, beaten
1 lb filo dough
2 sticks butter
Directions
Wash spinach and drain. Cut spinach finely with kitchen scissors, place in bowl and sprinkle with salt. Rub salt into spinach and set aside for 15 minutes or longer. Rinse Feta cheese in cold water, drain well and crumble into a large bowl. Add parmesan cheese, onion, parsley, and dill. Then take handfuls of spinach, squeeze dry, and add to cheese mixture. pour olive oil over mixture and fold in eggs.
Unfold filo and cut so that you have sheets measuring approximately 8 x 13 inches (that's the pan size I use - it's my broiler pan). Cover sheets with a towel so they will not dry out. Brush each sheet as it is used with butter - I usually put eight down in the bottom of the pan brushed with butter. Then put the filling on top and then repeat with another eight sheets of filo brushed with butter. I use a razor blade to score the top layers in squares before I bake it - it makes it much easier to portion out when you are done. I lightly sprinkle some water before I bake on the top. Bake at 400 degrees for 20-30 minutes - basically until golden brown.

For the nature lover, few spots can match the size and beauty of Seoul Olympic Park (서울올림픽공원). Located in southeastern Seoul’s Jamsil-gu district, the park’s massive 1.4 million square meters set it apart from virtually any other green space in the city.
As one might expect from its name, the vast wooded Seoul Olympic Park includes extensive sporting facilities, including six stadiums.
Seoul Olympic Park’s massive size means there are multiple points of entry. However, the main north entry is where you’ll find the iconic Peace Gate. In fact, most Koreans can’t separate the gate from the 1988 Summer Olympic Games, when the park served as a focal point for guests.
Designed by Kim Chung-up, it’s an impressive 24 meters high, 62 meters long and 37 meters wide. On the wide promenade leading up to it, four rows of pillars are decorated with traditional Korean mask designs.
Behind the structure are flags of the 161 countries that participated in the 24th Olympiad. At its center is an eternal Olympic flame that flickers above the Seoul Peace Declaration.
In addition to a large pond that wraps its way around much of the park, I’d say that Seoul Olympic Park’s most conspicuous feature is the recreated earthen fortress that rings most of its interior.
Known as Mongchontoseong (몽촌토성), it’s the remains of an ancient wall constructed during the Baekje era to protect what was a capital city. Given that Baekje existed between the 1st century BCE and 8th century, the settlement marked the first time that the Seoul area was a Korean capital.
Today, the wall feels more like a precocious berm, with its grassy slopes covered in all manner of trees and bushes. Transformed into an extensive walking trail, it provides a great vantage point from which to view the park’s many interesting features.
Smaller in scale but no less conspicuous are the hundreds of pieces of art that decorate Seoul Olympic Park’s lawns. SOMA, an acronym for Seoul Olympic Museum of Art, was opened in 2004 to highlight the cultural achievements of the 1988 Games.
By using a huge swath of the park as its outdoor exhibition gallery, it’s said to be one of the world’s five largest sculpture parks. Today, the 219 installations by 155 artists from 66 countries create a fitting international celebration, much like when the Olympics came to South Korea. Also on site is the newly constructed Seoul Baekje Museum (서울백제박물관).
One thing that I’ve always appreciated, in my five years living here is that Seoulites really do love their parks. The city’s green spaces are well-utilized in a city that admittedly isn’t very green.
On a recent visit, looking around there were many singles on bicycles or skates and couples and families riding on bike carts. Under the shade of trees were groups playing badminton or enjoying a picnic.
Given the fact that admission to the park is free and access is available around the clock, there’s even more reason to visit Seoul Olympic Park this fall..A gay man from Dublin, Ireland, has opened up about a violent homophobic attack he experienced after arranging a meetup on Grindr.
Marc Power was talking to a man on the hookup app and arranged to meet him on Tuesday at a Dublin cinema, local media reported.
However, when he arrived at the location he encountered a group of teenage males wielding hammers.
“They tried to kill me with these weapons,” Power explained on Facebook.
“They were trying to hit me on the head with hammers.
“[The teenagers] didn’t manage but I’m in the emergency room in hospital with facial injuries.”
He said the violent teenage gang also “destroyed” his car.
“I’m OK but f**king angry. I need to find out why Grindr allows violent scum to open accounts.
“The police were helpful but hands tied as dumb teenage scum fear nothing.”
He said he was speaking out because he wants the youths responsible for the violent attack “rounded up” by police.
UK’s dramatic rise in anti-gay and anti-trans hate crimes
Responding to Power’s social media post, gay Irish councillor Chris Pender shared his own story of being attacked outside at night.
Pender claimed local police told him at the time if he didn’t want to be attacked for being gay, maybe he “shouldn’t flaunt it.”
“As a result of that attack, even though I walked away relatively unscathed… I changed everything about my behaviour for a long time,” he tweeted.
“I still have issues when it comes to being alone in the dark at any time.”
The Grindr crime comes after new figures show a dramatic rise in anti-gay and anti-trans hate crimes in the UK.
Transgender hate crime rose 37% in 2018-19 to 2,333. Homophobic hate crimes rose 25% to 14,491.
The UK Government’s Home Office attributed the increase to better recording by police. But LGBTIQ charity Stonewall warned the figures were likely “the tip of the iceberg”.
“While it is possible that the increase is due to higher confidence in reporting, these figures are still likely to only represent the tip of the iceberg when it comes to hate crimes against LGBT people,” Stonewall director Laura Russell said.
“The significant rise in hate crimes against trans people shows the consequences of a society where transphobia is everywhere.”

The Times report said, among other things, that Trump paid no federal income taxes in 11 of the 18 years examined; that his businesses’ large losses have helped him lower his tax bills; that he has taken questionable tax deductions for expenses; and that his businesses have received money from lobbyists and foreign officials.

Jeffrey Levine, a partner with the accounting firm Alkon & Levine in Newton, said “everyone expected there were government kickbacks; everyone expected his family was being compensated.”
In a series of tweets Monday morning, Trump suggested that his low tax bill — $750 in federal income tax the year he was elected, but zero for several years prior — was due to “depreciation and tax credits.”
John Geraci, an accountant at LGA in Woburn, said in an e-mail that “tax law in the US can be very favorable for real estate investors who own and manage rental properties.”
The Fake News Media, just like Election time 2016, is bringing up my Taxes & all sorts of other nonsense with illegally obtained information & only bad intent. I paid many millions of dollars in taxes but was entitled, like everyone else, to depreciation & tax credits.....— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 28, 2020
Several accountants and lawyers said the average person might be tempted to think Trump’s tax practices are consistent with those of other wealthy people, especially in real estate. But they said the findings raise questions.
“I think it is definitely true that people in the real estate field have the opportunity to build wealth while not paying taxes between interest and depreciation,” Levine said. “But to have years and years of losses and to purposely take aggressive positions, I think, is unusual.”
Levine said he was taken aback by the “enormity" of the revenues and losses in Trump’s various business ventures, which he compared to numbers one would see for multibillion-dollar companies. That’s in addition to the specific details about Trump’s deducted personal expenses, which he said were “blatant and should have been caught.”

The investigation also sparked a reaction from law students who are studying tax law.
Professor Meredith Conway of the Suffolk University School of Law spent an hour on Zoom Monday talking about the report on Trump’s taxes, after students logged into class and immediately had questions.
Conway said students were interested in understanding how Trump could write off $70,000 that was paid to a hair stylist during “The Apprentice” television show.
“If it is a stylist doing his hair before the show starts, it sounds legitimate," she said. "If it is just him getting his hair cut and deducting it, it doesn’t sound legitimate. But none of us know the circumstances.”
She said students were also curious about how Trump was able to compensate his children by paying them as consultants, and where his business losses came from. The Times found evidence that Ivanka Trump was paid $747,622 as a consultant and that Donald Trump’s “core businesses” were reporting more than $100 million in losses over a two-year period.
Without the tax documents in front of her, Conway emphasized that although some figures may sound suspicious, they are not inherently illegal.
“On a moral level, am I OK with all of these deductions? Absolutely not,” she said. “But the provisions are there . . . Trump supporters are going to say he is allowed to take advantage of tax laws."

She also spoke with her class about how Trump’s refusal to release his tax returns could hinge on the fact that he finds them to be embarrassing, rather than incriminating.
“It is a double-edged sword: He wants to minimize his taxes and take aggressive positions that look like he is running losses and allow him to pay less tax," she said. “That slams his ego because he wants to be portrayed as this really wealthy businessman."
Levine said that beyond Trump’s paying only $750 in taxes in 2016 and 2017, he sees a bigger issue in the fact that the president has several conflicts of interest.
The Times’s investigation revealed more details surrounding Trump’s refusal to divest himself of his business interests after being elected — his properties have attracted large sums of money from lobbyists and foreign officials. And since he has been in office, Trump has collected funds from deals in countries including the Philippines and Turkey.
“There is still money coming to him because of his business ventures that are enhanced by the fact that he is president . . . it is disgusting," Levine said. Trump "is ridden with conflict.”
Ray Madoff, a professor at Boston College Law School, said the “power of taxes in a democracy can’t be understated.”
“He saw how all of the games were played, but instead of closing loopholes, he chose to pass a bunch of rules to give himself greater opportunities to line his own pocket,” she said. “This is the greatest act of disloyalty to the American public.”

Getting inside the mind of a real-life murderer is a tough task for any actor, but over the years a number of high-profile stars have nevertheless signed up to tell their horrific stories.
Zac Efron is one of the latest actors to step into the shoes of Ted Bundy in Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile, with early reviews praising his performance as the prolific rapist and murderer.
But what is it like for the actors themselves to play serial killers? Here’s the stars’ stories.
Zac Efron as Ted Bundy
After initially saying he would struggle to play Ted Bundy, Efron later admitted playing the role was actually a ‘fun’ experiment. Bundy confessed to murdering more than 30 women before he was executed in 1989.
‘It simply tells a story and sort of how the world was able to be charmed over by this guy who was notoriously evil and the vexing position that so many people were put in, the world was put in,’ he told Entertainment Tonight. ‘It was fun to go and experiment in that realm of reality.’
In a more recent interview, the 31-year-old elaborated on how he got into character, saying he lost almost a stone after undergoing a dramatic physical transformation. For research, Efron studied footage of Bundy at his trial and spoke to people who knew him.
‘I feel a responsibility to make sure that this movie is not a celebration of Ted Bundy,’ the actor told Variety. ‘Or a glorification of him. But, definitely, a psychological study of who this person was. In that, there’s honesty.’
Dominic West as Fred West
Dominic West revealed he had suffered nightmares while playing notorious killer Fred West in ITV drama Appropriate Adult. Fred and wife Rosemary West tortured, raped and murdered 12 young women at their Gloucester ‘House of Horrors’ home between 1967 and 1987. The victims’ bodies were buried in the cellar or garden. West killed himself a year after he was charged with the 13 murders.
Speaking about the role, The Wire actor told The Telegraph:’I was having pretty horrible dreams during the shoot where I’m perched on a wall and Fred West is trying to grab me and pull me down.
“I only did it for three weeks and it was a pretty intense, very dark three weeks. It was grim.’
Charlize Theron as Aileen Wuornos
Charlize Theron won her first Oscar for her performance as famous female serial killer Aileen Wuornos in 2003 film Monster. Between 1989 and 1990, Wuornos shot seven men at point blank range in Florida. She claimed her victims had either raped or attempted to rape her. She was executed by lethal injection in October 2002 – just as Theron signed up for the role.
In preparation, the actress underwent an incredible transformation over five months. She put on a significant amount of weight and admitted she lived in ‘sweatpants for five months because they were the only things I could fit into’.
Speaking to About Film, the 43-year-old admitted playing the role was emotional.
‘When I was playing her, I always used to say to Patty [Jenkins], “God, if only she didn’t do this one thing. How would her life have turned out?” It’s a very emotional place to be. I read the story and immediately related and responded to that. That wasn’t tough for me. It wasn’t like I was reading this very distant thing that I couldn’t understand at all.
‘She was a normal human being that had gone through a lot of heartache. I related to that on a different level. I think you have to get to a place where the best you can do is understand – maybe – why, and then really drag yourself through it, because it’s tough to do those things. The last killing, it was impossible. It was one of the worst nights of my life.’
Jeremy Renner as Jeffrey Dahmer
Jeremy Renner played cannibalistic serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer in 2002 film Dahmer. Recluse Dahmer raped, murdered and dismembered 17 men and boys between 1978 and 1991. Two years after he was sentenced to life in prison he was beaten to death by a fellow inmate.
Renner later said the playing the killer was a curse. He told Parade, ‘After I did the film, playing a guy who was basically a monster, things started getting creepy. My cat was stolen.
‘Then some girl bit me in a bar because I wasn’t paying attention to her anymore and I had to go to the hospital.
‘It kept me single for a while, that’s for sure. Lot of people I wanted to date, but people I probably shouldn’t date.’
Kathy Bates as Madame Delphine LaLaurie
Kathy Bates returned to TV in 2014 for American History Story: Coven where she played Madame Delphine LaLaurie, a high society Creole socialite and sadistic serial killer who tortured and murdered her slaves.
Kathy admitted some of the scenes she shot were ‘horrific’, but said didn’t try to make ‘sense’ of the terrible things her character did.
‘The,’ she told Collider.
‘And then, I also talked to some detectives, from all over Europe, at a film festival that I got to go to in the spring. I said, “So, what is it? Why does somebody do these horrible things?” And they said, “Some people are just that way.”
‘At some point, I think she probably got off on the power. For our show, we’re doing crazy shit anyway, so you don’t have to make sense of it.’
Lily Collins as Ted Bundy’s girlfriend Liz Kendall
The British actress plays Ted Bundy’s girlfriend in Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile alongside Zac Efron. Unlike Efron, who described playing the infamous killer as a ‘fun experiment’, Collins had a very different experience.
‘I actually had an awful time in prep for it,’ she told Variety. ‘I woke up every single night at 3 or 4 a.m. for a month.
‘I was woken up with visions of destruction around rooms, logs, and broken Gunn set to direct Suicide Squad 2 following firing from Guardians Of The Galaxy

Summary
A luxury organic memory foam mattress that easily matches the sleep experience of premium store brands, for far less money.
Great Choice for: people who want a luxury organic foam mattress without the high price; and, couples who need different firmness levels in the same mattress.
Avoid if: you prefer a softer mattress.
Price: $849-$1,799
Loom and Leaf's luxury foam mattress offers the same quality as luxury brands iComfort and Tempur-Pedic®, but for a LOT lower price.
Loom and Leaf is a luxury memory foam mattress sold by a subsidiary of Saatva, one of the largest and best-rated direct-to-home mattress manufacturers in the US.
Price-wise, L&L is closer to other online mattress companies like Nest Bedding, Keetsa, Tuft and Needle and Leesa.
So how does it compare?
As you will see in this 10-minute review, Loom and Leaf performs at the same level as Tempur-Pedic.
Most notably, the Loom and Leaf mattress excels at temperature control; it is one of the coolest memory foam mattresses sold today, at any price.
Even better, the Loom and Leaf is a steal when compared to leading store-bought memory foam brands.
For a queen memory foam bed of this quality, you might pay $2,500 in a store – but a queen-size Loom and Leaf sells for just $1,599.
So let's take a 10-minute deep dive into the Loom & Leaf, to see what it has to offer – and whether it is worth your hard-earned money.

About Loom and Leaf
Loom and Leaf is owned by Saatva but operates as an independent company.
Both companies share Saatva's 14 factories and 44 fulfillment centers in the US, but the Loom and Leaf team is responsible for the entire customer-facing process, from inquiries to delivery and service after the sale.
Despite being relatively new in the factory-to-consumer mattress market, Loom and Leaf has experienced rapid growth as word about their product quality and excellent customer service has spread.
The company claims their customer service is much better than you will find with other direct-to-consumer mattress companies.
Social Impact
For Loom and Leaf, life is not just about making and selling mattresses; they also care about the environment and giving back to their community.
To this end, the company has made a commitment to use only environmentally sustainable materials in their mattresses.
For example, the Loom and Leaf mattress uses the following materials:
- plant-based foams
- 100% organic cotton cover
- for their flame retardant, the company avoided using harmful chemicals and instead opted for natural thistle, a natural material that is safe for your health and very effective.
Loom and Leaf is also committed to minimizing their carbon footprint as much as possible.
They are a member of the Sustainable Furnishings Council (SFC), something that no other online mattress company claims as far as I am aware.
Loom and Leaf's parent company, Saatva, has partnered with numerous charitable organizations to give away hundreds of mattresses to the less fortunate in our society.
Price
For a high-quality mattress that does not compromise on anything, the Loom and Leaf's price is hard to beat.
And all orders come with FREE White-Glove delivery and FREE old mattress take-away – a savings of $200 vs. most other mattress manufacturers, who charge extra.
Here is their full retail price list:
These prices are far lower than better-known memory foam mattresses, but Loom and Leaf performs equally well, if not better (certainly cooler).
Purchase Process
The only place you can order a Loom and Leaf is on their website.
The purchase process is simple and straightforward.
There are two comfort levels available for sale: the Loom and Leaf Relaxed Firm is for those who want a medium-firm feel, and the Loom and Leaf Firm for sleepers who prefer a much firmer surface.
As for sizes, the following are available:
Price varies based on the size of the mattress, ranging between $699 and $1,399.
This is about the same as a Nest Bedding mattress, but more expensive than a comparable Leesa mattress.
That said, the Loom and Leaf is a higher-quality mattress and offers a choice in comfort level, which Leesa does not.
Add a Frame
On their website, Loom and Leaf also sells foundations and frames that fit your mattress:
A simple frame costs $99, while the cost of a foundation ranges from $250 to $285.
The company does not collect sales tax for online orders.
Shipping
Once you complete your order, your mattress will be delivered within 7 to 15 days, anywhere within the contiguous United States.
Unlike other online foam mattress companies, Loom and Leaf does charge for shipping.
Shipping fees depend on your location, but they typically add about $99 to your price.
Delivery & Setup
In-home White Glove Delivery and setup is complimentary for Loom and Leaf customers. Most other foam mattress companies expect you to do everything yourself.
To ensure your delivery goes well, you will receive a call one day before the delivery date. You will be asked to set aside a 4-hour window for delivery.
If the driver is late, you will be notified and you can reschedule delivery at no cost to you, or you can cancel the order with a full refund, including the cost of delivery.
If you are not home when the driver gets there, then you can reschedule delivery for an extra fee, or cancel the order for a full refund minus the delivery fee.
After your mattress is set up, Loom and Leaf will also haul away your old mattress and old foundation – for FREE. Almost no one else hauls away for free, any more.
Smell/Off-Gassing
Most direct-to-home foam mattresses are shipped compressed, which makes shipping easier and cheaper. This means that when the mattress arrives in your home, it has to go through a period of expansion that often involves off-gassing of chemical vapors.
But if you are expecting a “new foam smell” with a Loom and Leaf, you will be pleasantly disappointed.
Loom and Leaf ships their mattresses stable and uncompressed, so when you receive your mattress there is zero off-gassing.
Styling
The first thing that strikes you when you see the Loom and Leaf mattress out of the box is: this thing is a luxury product.
This is a mattress that looks, feels and is luxurious.
Everything about the looks, from the cover to the stitching, smacks of a fine attention to detail.
The top quilted organic cotton cover has a beautiful texture. Along the edge of the mattress is a fine gold trim that adds to the luxe look.
The stitching looks straight and tight and adds to the premium feel.
On the sides, you will also find handles that make moving the mattress much easier.
Cooling Technology
The most notable technology used in the Loom and Leaf mattress is the medical-grade gel layer embedded in the memory foam along the spinal zone.
This cooling gel is the same used in hospitals and burn units. Its purpose is to keep the mattress cool when you are asleep.
This gel is a big reason why Loom and Leaf is the market leader when it comes to temperature control, out-performing the much more expensive Tempur-Pedic.
Mattress Construction
The Loom and Leaf mattress is comprised of four layers of foam, each designed for a specific use and benefit.
While the foam layers are not certified organic, they are all plant-based and CertiPUR-US certified.
In addition, there are no harmful volatile organic compounds (VOCs) given off by the mattress.
1. 100% Organic Cotton Cover
On top of the foam layers is a beautiful 100% organic cotton cover. The cover incorporates a 5/8 inch layer of soft foam which makes the mattress super-comfortable, giving it a nice plush feel. It also contains natural thistle flame retardant instead of chemical retardants.
The high quality cotton feels soft and is breathable, which helps to keep you cool.
The organic cotton and stitching used in the cover is of high quality, with beautiful contours and patterns stitched into the fabric.
Like its competitors, Loom and Leaf does not offer custom cover designs.
2. Conforming Gel Foam
The very top layer of the mattress is a layer of conforming gel foam, which is made by combining a 4 lb memory foam with medical-grade cooling gel and phase change material.
In addition, the top layer uses a gel-only laminated panel that contributes to the outstanding cooling effect that Loom and Leaf is known for.
3. Memory Foam
The second layer consists of 2.5 inches of 5 lb bio-based memory foam. The purpose of this layer is to provide body support and contouring.
4. Transition Foam
A 2″ thick transition pad allows the top comfort layers and the much firmer base to work together to provide the best support and body contouring.
5. Foundation Foam
The final layer is a 6 inch support base. It is made of a high-density foundation foam meant to provide adequate support to the whole mattress.
Sleeping Experience
The Loom and Leaf mattress sleeping experience varies slightly, depending on which level of firmness you opt for.
The Loom and Leaf Relaxed Firm is the most popular option. This is my favorite.
The Relaxed Firm perfectly balances being comfortable with the right level of firmness that most sleepers prefer.
Most customers and reviewers give it a firmness level of 5 or 6 out of 10, and I agree. This make it a notch softer than the Leesa (6 or 7) and about the same as a Nest Alexander Medium.
The Loom and Leaf Firm is only a tad firmer (7 or 8) than the Relaxed Firm, but it is still very comfortable.
Sinkage
A mattress’ sinkage is an essential part of the sleeping experience.
If a mattress – even one meant to be soft – sinks too much, it compromises support and causes uneven weight distribution. You can end up waking to various aches caused by a lack of even body support.
The Loom and Leaf mattress performs impressively when it comes to sinkage.
When lying flat on the mattress, the maximum sinkage I saw was 1-1.5 inches. This is just enough for the mattress to contour and mold around your body, but not so much that it inhibits your body's motion.
Motion Transfer
How well does the Loom and Leaf absorb motion, preventing it from spreading and disturbing a sleeping partner?
As I observed during my trial, there is essentially no motion transfer. This makes the Loom and Leaf mattress ideal for sleeping with a partner.
If you or your partner tend to move around a lot during sleep, the Loom and Leaf is a good choice.
Hot/Cold Issues
When it comes to temperature control, the Loom and Leaf mattress is one of the best sold online today.
I found during my trial that the mattress remained pleasantly cool at all times, with no uneven pockets of warmth or cold occurring.
Thanks to the medical grade gel layer discussed above, body temperature remains constant. The phase change material, breathable foam and the organic cotton top also play a role in Leaf and Loom’s success at staying cool.
120 Night Trial
With Loom and Leaf, you are allowed to test the mattress in your home for 120 days, risk free. This is 20 nights longer than most of L&L's competitors offer and is plenty enough time to give you an idea of whether this is the mattress for you.
If you find that the mattress does not suit your needs, you can call Loom and Leaf to pick up the mattress for a full refund – no penalty or pickup fees involved.
There are essentially no risks involved here.
Returned mattresses are never restocked, since the seal has been broken and the mattress has been used. Loom and Leaf donates all usable returned mattresses to charities.
Warranty
Loom and Leaf offers an exceptionally long 15-year warranty on their mattresses. This is considerably more than the standard 10 years. It speaks to the faith Loom and Leaf have in the quality and life of their mattresses.
This pro-rated warranty covers structural and workmanship defects and the value declines over time.
- If a defect occurs within two years, the mattress will be replaced free of charge.
- If it occurs within 3-5 years, you pay 25 percent of the original price to replace it
- If the return occurs during years 6-10, you pay half the original price
- During years 11-15, the mattress will be replaced for 75% of its original price.
Abuse, poor placement of the mattress, burns or soiling of the mattress voids the warranty.

Conclusion
If you were on the fence regarding which luxury memory foam mattress to buy, I hope this review helps to clear things up.
By purchasing a Loom and Leaf mattress, you'll save up to $2,000 compared to similar Tempur-Pedic mattresses. You get the same quality, the same great features and even a few new features (like cooling gel) that you will not find elsewhere.
In addition to saving all that money, the Loom and Leaf mattress looks fantastic, sleeps great and has no new mattress smell.
I love Loom and Leaf's white glove delivery and setup, too.
That said, the Loom and Leaf is for people who like their mattress at least somewhat firm.
If you need a softer luxury mattress that has more sinkage and/or hugs your body, then this is not the right mattress for you. At this level of quality, a softer alternative is the Alexander Signature Select mattress (Soft or Medium Firm comfort level).
If you need to customize your sleeping experience further, then take a look at Helix. They sell a truly unique product that can be tailored to your body type, weight and sleeping style. The Helix is not as luxurious as the Loom and Leaf mattress, but if you're really particular about a custom fit, they're worth looking into.
Finally, if you care a lot about organic materials in your foam mattress, then check out Keetsa, instead.
Where To Buy
The best place to buy a Loom And Leaf mattress is on their main website. You'll be assured of getting the best / latest price as well as their full warranty.

I have the “relaxed firm” L&L queen and my wife is complaining that it’s too soft. Is the “firm” much harder?
Loom & Leaf “Firm” isn’t rock hard. It’s like mattresses that claim to be medium-firm. Maybe a little bit firmer.
Trish, I own the L&L Relaxed Firm. Right “out the box”, the mattress felt GREAT! However over the last 2 weeks, the foams have softened up which I understand happens. The problem is it has become a bit soft for my comfort. If I exchange for a Firm, am I safe to expect that the foams in the Firm too will soften a bit over couple weeks, basically making it feel perfect?
Justin,
Yes, the foam will loosen up a bit after you sleep on it a while – like most memory foams do.

If the judge decides that your landlord owes you money for the deposit, they have 30 days to pay.
If the landlord does not pay within 30 days, you can ask the court for help. The court can “garnish” (take money from) their wages or bank accounts, or put a lien on property they own.
Our small claims Roadmap has more details on small claims court and how to collect a judgment.
If you have a hearing with the Burlington Housing Board of Review, you will get a written decision within 30 days. Both you and the landlord have the right to appeal the decision to Superior Court.

Due to the success of the regatta and the positive feedback from sailors and spectators alike, The UK Hobie Class Association have committed to host the event again next year at Poole Yacht Club with sponsorship already secured from Wildwind holidays and The Hobie Centre.
The regatta attracted a mix of ages of crew and boats, with some of the older crew and boats scoring some of the top places in races throughout the regatta. Proving that a well maintained and well sailed Hobie 16 of any age can perform in this International one design class.
On the first day of racing the boats launched to a mirror smooth harbour, the scheduled time of 12.00 was put back 30 minutes whilst the sailors waited for the wind to kick in. The wind arrived and then slowly built to a steady South Westerly of about 16 knots over the course of the afternoon. Andrew Boyd and Kim Troll dominated the regatta right from day one securing 1st position in all 3 races on the first day. Lloyd Crisp and Claire Marion held 2nd place after the 1st Day racing followed by Mark Farrow a seasoned Hobie 16 racer who was racing for the first time with his 14 year old son Johnny.
The first day ended with a fantastic party with live band sponsored by Wildwind holidays. The party was well attended not only by competitors but also by Wildwind staff and clients, the Hobie Centre Team and members of Poole Yacht Club.
The following morning the sailors appreciated the 11 am post party start time and got on the water to a good breeze of 18-20 knots with some strong gusts coming off the land that were to catch out a few of the sailors on their approach to the windward mark off the Arne peninsular. During the 4 races there were a few capsizes with crews rushing to right their boats in an attempt to maintain their position. Andrew Boyd and Kim Troll continued to dominate the second day securing 2 more 1st places in the first 2 races and a 4th (their discard) and then a 2nd. Mark and Johnny Farrow ended the 4 races in second place and local Poole sailor Jacobo Miquel with his crew Thomas Clayton crept up into 3rd place.
For all the results and photos as well as the date for next year’s event see the event website.
The Hobie sailors are now turning their attention to forthcoming European Championships in La Rochelle, France from the 17th to the 27th of July.
The Hobie Worlds takes place in Fort Lauderdale, USA from the 1st-16th November, 2019home remedies for crusty feet

Cryptera is further strengthening its Leadership team and progressing its technology offerings with the appointment of Mogens Saigal as new Chief Technology Officer (CTO).
Mogens is joining Cryptera from Universal Robots, part of Teradyne Inc. At UR Mogens held the position as Vice President and represented the R&D activity in the UR Senior Leadership Team. Prior to his career at UR Mogens held the position as Cryptera R&D director for 4 years.
As Cryptera CTO, Mogens Saigal will identify and implement opportunities for innovation to support the company’s ongoing growth plans. He has extensive experience scaling technology platforms and leading transformation.
Brian Schleisner, CEO at Cryptera, commented: “I am glad to welcome Mogens Saigal to Cryptera as our new CTO. Mogens is a senior profile and he has a proven track record. I’m confident Mogens will bring a new perspective to Cryptera to support our growth strategy. He has a strong passion for SW and technology and he will bring strong competences to our R&D team.”

I’m looking forward to working with colleagues and customers to discuss the challenges and opportunities that technology and security solutions can bring.”The under the Articles, and the Constitution cured that defect.” A committee took up the Articles on July 30th and 31st and then August 1st of 1776. During the first couple days, the delegates debated how to calculate each state’s monetary contribution to the “common treasury” and the “manner of voting in Congress.” And it was there that controversy occurred; controversy that would continue to the time when the Constitution was drafted and adopted and even to nearly 250 years later.
Article XI of the draft Articles of Confederation stated: .”
Samuel Chase argued that quotas were best and that those quotas should be tethered to the number of “white inhabitants” as that number would be more readily ascertainable than what others had been suggesting: making the quota tied to the value of property in every state. Chase, however, .” Based on that, Chase posited, “negroes in fact should not be considered as members of the state more than cattle & that they have no more interest in it.”
John Adams arose. Taking a more principled stand, he said that people should be the measure and that “it was of no consequence by what name you called your people, whether by that of freemen or of slaves.” Proof of this was the fact that “500 freemen produce no more profits, no greater surplus for the paiment of taxes than 500 slaves.” To this Benjamin Harrison objected and offered a compromise: “two slaves should be counted as one freeman” for the “slaves did not do so much work as freemen,” and “this was proved by the price of labor.” Hiring a laborer in the South was typically 8 to 12 pounds, and in the North it was generally 24 pounds. James Wilson noted the practical effect of all this. The “Southern colonies would have all the benefit of slaves, whilst the Northern ones would bear the burden” as the Southern states would enjoy more profits due to the slaves. To Wilson, the men gathered had a “duty to lay every discouragement on the importation of slaves; but this amendment would give the jus trium liberorum (Latin for “the right to three children”) to him who would import slaves.” That “right to three children” harked back to Ancient Rome when the Emperor Augustus favored the upper class by rewarding them with rights for having more children (such as men being excused from compulsory service and women being free to end the guardianship that a male relative held), which naturally led to widespread fraud and loopholes.
Dr. John Witherspoon had had enough. He continued to trust that the “value of lands & houses was the best estimate of the wealth of a nation, and that it was practicable to obtain such a valuation.” To attempt to measure how slaves should be counted based on what food they ate that could have gone to the freedmen was foolish, and the reality was that in “the Southern colonies slaves pervade the whole colony; but they do not pervade the whole continent.”We haven’t posted an evening photo in a while, so if you’re at happy hour (still), or resting on the couch at home, here’s an interesting and sad photo for you to get lost in.

We’re four weeks into the fantasy season — essentially a month into the NHL schedule — and, for many leagues, it’s becoming clearer which teams are contenders and which are pretenders. The balance of power is starting to take shape.
As a result, the trade winds are really picking up. Fantasy GMs are ready and willing to wheel and deal. There has been next to no movement in real life as NHL GMs are still finding it difficult to bolster their rosters through acquisitions, but in the fantasy world, it seems nobody is standing pat anymore.
That’s good news for the Mailbag, with trade-related questions pouring in almost on the daily — both asking for advice and requesting feedback after the fact. Many of them are coming from the usual suspects — Mike Hall and Luc Grenier — two guys that appear to trust (or at least appreciate) my fantasy insight despite not knowing me in real life. I’m in a keeper league with Luc, so there is some familiarity there, but Mike is a total stranger. I enjoy helping them with their teams or at least providing them with my two cents — some of it confidential and some of it fair game for the Mailbag.
Mike had a heck of a week, pulling off two trades that really blew me away and should prove beneficial for his team going forward. Mike landed Oliver Ekman-Larsson straight up for Patric Hornqvist, then packaged Marian Hossa and Alex Goligoski for Ryan Johansen and Jared Spurgeon. To me, he got the best player in both deals with Ekman-Larsson and Johansen. Well played, Mike.
Luc also wound up making a 2-for-2 trade with a win-now focus, acquiring Justin Williams and Dan Boyle for Trevor Daley and Steve Downie. This is a dynasty league, so getting older isn’t necessarily a good thing, but in this case, Luc is taking aim at prize money for this season and the addition of Williams will help his chances. It’s a pretty fair deal, in my opinion, from an overall value perspective.
If the first four weeks are any indication, you’ll be seeing more questions from both Mike and Luc as the season progresses. The more, the merrier for me. If you’ve got questions, I’ll do my best to answer them. You can leave a comment below or fire me an email at larry.fisher31@gmail.com. I’m also active on Twitter and Facebook if you prefer to track me down there.
THW reader Kris Noble asked: Just wondering what your thoughts would be on a trade of Taylor Hall and Erik Karlsson for P.K. Subban and Steven Stamkos?
Erik Karlsson is a gamebreaker, not only for the Ottawa Senators but for fantasy teams too — especially in leagues with separate scoring categories for defencemen. In those leagues, he might be the most valuable player. This trade is sure to trigger mixed opinions, but I’d stick with Karlsson and Taylor Hall if I were Kris.
ANSWER: Now that would be a blockbuster! A fair one, in my opinion. Karlsson is off to a bit of a slow start by his standards — still without a goal this season — but he should catch up to Subban and become slightly more valuable than him as the season progresses. Karlsson has led the league in defence scoring in each of the last three full seasons — by six, 13 and 25 points, respectively. That gap is gradually closing, but Karlsson is currently tied for second among defence scoring leaders with 11 points, just one point behind the Montreal pairing of Andrei Markov and Subban, the latter of whom led the league during the lockout-shortened 2012-13 season with 38 points in 42 games. Switching to the proposed forward swap, I would give Stamkos the edge on Hall, but that gap isn’t as wide for me as it might be for others. I feel many would consider the defencemen a near wash and consider Stamkos a far superior asset to Hall. Therefore, I think the majority would make that deal if you were the team receiving Subban and Stamkos. Personally, I’d be reluctant to part with Karlsson and Hall, but I might be biased there, having owned both of them on my keeper team for the past five-plus seasons. The value is fair, or as close to fair as it gets with a trade of this magnitude. So you can essentially go with your personal preference on the players involved, whether you prefer Hall-Karlsson or Subban-Stamkos. For me, it’s Hall-Karlsson, but I’m probably in the minority there. Go with your gut or follow your heart, and you should be fine either way.
Kris also asked: Would you trade Sean Monahan straight up for John Klingberg?
John Klingberg was tied with Erik Karlsson for second in scoring amongst defencemen prior to his Dallas Stars facing the Toronto Maple Leafs on Monday night. Klingberg’s stock is on the rise and you should definitely do everything in your power to acquire him. For Kris, that means giving up Monahan. I’d even throw in a draft pick to sweeten the pot if need be.
ANSWER: It would depend on the make-up of my roster and my league’s scoring system, but I’d be leaning towards yes. If there are separate categories for defence goals or points, then I would absolutely do the deal for Klingberg. He’s a fantasy stud, manning the point on Dallas’s top power-play unit with Jamie Benn, Tyler Seguin, Jason Spezza and Patrick Sharp. With a supporting cast like that, Klingberg has managed to avoid the sophomore slump and should continue to be a big contributor. He was tied with Karlsson for second among defence scoring leaders with 11 points, including two goals, as of Monday morning. Monahan is a very consistent player in his own right, seemingly a lock for 30 goals and 60 points year in and year out for the Flames. So you know what you’re getting — or what you’ve got — with him. If it’s a points-only league, rotisserie style without separating positions, then their value is much closer and Monahan might be worth keeping. Forwards still tend to outscore defencemen — Monahan had 31 goals and 62 points to Klingberg’s 11 goals and 40 points last season. Granted, Monahan was a sophomore and Klingberg a rookie. Monahan put up 22 goals and 34 points as a rookie in 75 games, and Klingberg was limited to 65 games last season. Klingberg is actually on pace for 60-plus points as a sophomore this season. The deciding factor here may come down to your roster strengths and needs. If you are loaded up front but weaker on the back end, then moving Monahan for Klingberg makes perfect sense. It’s a no-brainer in that case. On the flip side, if you already have Karlsson and a few other big-name blue-liners but Monahan is among your best forwards, then perhaps you should hang onto him and pass on a deal like this. Too much of a good thing can be a bad thing, especially if you’re forced to bench one of your top defencemen on the busy nights to make room for Klingberg. All things equal, I’d want Klingberg on my fantasy team over Monahan. Why? From my experience, elite defencemen are harder to acquire than forwards — in fantasy and, not coincidentally, in real life too. Reason being, there are fewer elite defencemen to go around, so if you have a chance to land one, I’d say go for it.
My Fantasy World
Keeper 1
Linus Ullmark, you are my hero. The Buffalo Sabres rookie goaltender rallied my team to victory on the weekend, turning a 7-2-1 deficit into a 5-3-2 triumph over our defending regular-season champion. That result was thanks in large part to stealing both goalie categories on the strength of Ullmark’s wins over the Flyers and Islanders, and aided by Sergei Bobrovsky sieving out for my opponent on Saturday. Ullmark allowed only two goals — one in each game — and posted save percentages of .964 and .967. Not bad for a kid I claimed off waivers on Thursday, assuming he might get his second career start on Friday after a mediocre 4-3 loss to the Devils in his NHL debut back on Oct. 24.
I second that fist-pump, this guy just stole me both goalie categories in my #FantasyHockey keeper league! #NHL
— Larry Fisher (@LarryFisher_KDC) November 2, 2015
With Robin Lehner nowhere near returning — still expected to miss another month or more — and with Chad Johnson a below-average backup, the ball is suddenly in Ullmark’s hands and he’s running with it so far. Unfortunately for me, the Sabres only have two games this week, at home to Tampa Bay on Thursday and Vancouver on Saturday. I’m assuming Ullmark will get to start against the Lightning, but that’ll be his biggest challenge to date, especially considering the Islanders were without John Tavares on Sunday.
I’ll need a big effort out of Ullmark because he’s my go-to goalie this week with Carey Price joining Jacob Markstrom on my Injured Reserve. My only other active netminder is Curtis McElhinney, the seldom-used backup for Columbus who actually replaced Bobrovsky and stopped all 16 shots he faced against Winnipeg. Was that enough to earn McElhinney the start tonight in San Jose? Here’s hoping because I need a minimum of two starts as per league rules.
Either way, it would take a miracle to even split the goaltending categories this week against an opponent running Frederik Andersen, Semyon Varlamov and Joni Ortio. Then again, he’s shocking only got three wins from that trio in 21 combined games. Andersen won on Sunday and I’m fully expecting them to break out against my team this week.
This is another big matchup — he’s tied for third in our standings, with 50 points through four head-to-head weeks of 10 scoring categories, while I’m sitting fifth, with 47 points. Wish me luck, because I’m going to need it — especially without Price, who had been my key to success prior to getting lit up and hurt in the process last week.
My handful of Oilers have been great — with the exception of pointless Anton Lander — but Sidney Crosby continues to disappoint. He’s been limited to only one goal and five points on the season and has been held off the scoresheet in nine of 11 games to date. I really need him to pick up the pace this week with the Penguins on a Western Canadian road trip, facing off against the Canucks, Oilers and Flames. Light them all up for all I care. Here’s hoping for a high-scoring barnburner in Edmonton, with Taylor Hall, Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, Nail Yakupov, Benoit Pouliot and even Lander finding the scoresheet on Friday night.
I’m also hopeful that my other waiver claim from last week — Detroit forward Tomas Jurco — can get it going offensively, or at least find a way to stay in the lineup. He’s been a healthy scratch more often than not this season and was consequently dropped earlier in the week by the team that drafted him in our league. Jurco’s got mad skills (as you can see below) and I’m still feeling good about adding him for Philadelphia defenceman Brandon Manning.
In other news, our first seller has emerged, but he’s been getting great value in exchange for his top talents. He’s in last place in our 20-team league — six points back of 19th and 39 points behind the standings leader — so his focus has understandably shifted to future seasons. He’s been our most active GM, with seven total trades, including five from a seller’s approach. Here’s his body of work so far:
INCOMING = Cam Ward and Karri Ramo
OUTGOING = Craig Anderson and James Reimer
INCOMING = Henrik Lundqvist and Nicolas Roy (Carolina fourth-rounder in 2015)

OUTGOING = Rick Nash and Mikko Koivu
INCOMING = Valeri Nichushkin, Calle Jarnkrok, Travis Sanheim (Philadelphia first-rounder in 2014) and Malcolm Subban (Boston first-rounder in 2012, goalie)
OUTGOING = Phil Kessel
INCOMING = David Jones, Colin White (Ottawa first-rounder in 2015) and Zane McIntyre (another Boston goalie prospect)
OUTGOING = Patric Hornqvist
INCOMING = Jake Virtanen
OUTGOING = Zdeno Chara, Beau Bennett and Nicolas Roy (Carolina fourth-rounder in 2015)
ANALYSIS: He gave up a lot — shipping out the likes of Kane, Nash, Kessel, Hornqvist, Koivu and Chara — but he got impressive returns for the most part. The future is bright for this team, building around Jack Eichel as its franchise player. The supporting cast now includes Barkov, Schwartz, Nichushkin, Virtanen, Malcolm Subban, Sanheim, White and a couple picks, among others. This team will be fun to watch next season, and the rebuild may not be complete yet with the potential to still move Lundqvist as his last remaining big fish unless somebody bites on a guy like Alex Semin.
Parity still prevalent
The rest of the league remains competitive, by far the most parity we’ve ever seen in this our sixth season. The teams from fifth to 17th in the standings are all separated by one point, with the exception of two points between 13th and 14th. Still, there are only 14 points — or seven category wins — between fifth and 17th, which is incredible after four weeks. There are 24 points between first and 17th, so even that spread isn’t insurmountable. It’s still wide open and a big win or a big loss really impacts your place in the standings.
Here are a couple more trades that went down in this league over the last week:
INCOMING = Steven Stamkos, Al Montoya, Zack Phillips and Petri Kontiola
OUTGOING = Ryan Getzlaf, Jeremy Bracco, 2016 second-round pick and 2016 third-round pick
ANALYSIS: This was a cool blockbuster too, with Stamkos the best player in the deal — especially since we switched to shots on goal as a category (replacing plus-minus) for this season — but that return is full of quality. Getzlaf is going to be productive once he gets back, which could be this week, while Bracco is looking really good since arriving in the OHL. That GM, who is currently in 17th place and could become a seller, is a big Leafs fan and adds Bracco to a long list of Toronto prospects on his roster, including Mitch Marner, Connor Brown, Nikita Soshnikov, Frederik Gauthier and Zach Hyman, plus active players Jake Gardiner, Leo Komarov, Peter Holland and James Reimer. For those keeping count, that’s 10 Leafs and the potential for a couple more with those picks. The other GM has Roberto Luongo, so it also made sense to get Montoya for the Florida tandem in goal. Phillips and Kontiola, who busted in Toronto last season before returning to the KHL, will be lucky to ever play another NHL game, but they could serve as throw-in assets for future deals.
INCOMING = Nick Leddy
OUTGOING = David Perron, Artturi Lehkonen and Mattias Backman
ANALYSIS: Defencemen are difficult to acquire in this league, so that’s the price you have to pay. That was actually our standings leader who parted with Leddy, a bit surprising, but he does have Brent Burns, T.J. Brodie, Dion Phaneuf and Anton Stralman as his top-four, so he was dealing from a position of strength. Chances are, he plans to flip those prospects for an upgrade somewhere else.
Keeper 2
I managed to squeak out a victory here too, but it wasn’t nearly as fulfilling. After two strong weeks statistically to start the season, my team has been struggling as of late. Fortunately, this slump has come in an easier stretch of my schedule against the two bottom feeders from my seven-team division in this 28-team league.
Granted, last week was a “battle” of teams with identical 1-2 records, my roster was quite a bit stronger on paper with that opponent still in a rebuilding stage. His trio of Bruins forwards — Matt Beleskey, Jimmy Hayes and Brett Connolly — kept it close by combining for 51.2 fantasy points, but I managed to prevail 124.2-114.2 to get back to .500 on the season. Now, I’m getting to play a winless (0-4) opponent, albeit one that is underachieving in my opinion, with a dangerous up-and-coming roster.
Nobody on my roster cracked 20 points last week — my top point-producers was Cody Franson, at 19.4 — and I posted the eighth-worst total. Ironically, I was ranked as the eighth-worst team in our pre-season power rankings, but I’m still planning to exceed those insulting expectations.
That said, I’m not a buyer at this point in the season and rejected a couple of trade offers as a result. I turned down Nick Holden and Mattias Janmark for Gustav Forsling, and also passed on Lee Stempniak for a 2016 third-round pick. I’m still trying to figure out what I’ve got with this team, and I don’t want to mortgage the future for marginal upgrades — especially if I really am the eighth-worst team. So I’m staying the course for the time being, hoping for a better effort from my boys this week — I believe they are capable of 150-plus points week in and week out, so hopefully they start proving me right sooner than later.
As per usual, I’ll leave you with a few trades from this league over the past week:
INCOMING = James van Riemsdyk
OUTGOING = Matt Duchene
INCOMING = Luke Schenn
OUTGOING = Ben Lovejoy
INCOMING = Brandon Davidson
OUTGOING = 2016 third-round pick

Currently, all the gold produced by mining companies in the country are refined outside, therefore, the government gains nothing from gold refined abroad.
In that vein, the government entered into a public-private partnership with an Indian company, Rosy Royal Limited, to refine gold in Ghana.
The agreement states that the Government of Ghana will receive a 20% equity share in the gold refined by the Indian Company locally, while the Indian investor, which built the refinery gets 80%.
Wisdom Gomashie, a personal assistant to Deputy Minister of Lands and Natural Resources in charge of Mines, George Mireku Duker, told the Ghana News Agency in an interview on Wednesday.
He said, “It is the cost of refining gold locally which we will gain 20% free equity share but the gold belonged to the mining companies.
“In fact, we do not gain anything when the gold is refined outside and so as part of efforts to providing refinery solution, the government of Ghana entered into an agreement with the Indian Investor to build a refinery here. It also formed part of government’s policy to at least refine 30% of all gold produced in Ghana,” he added.
Gomashie stated that the Indian Investor invested an estimated amount of US$25 million in constructing the gold refinery, which is located at the Diamond House on the premises of the Precious Minerals Marketing Company in Accra.
He explained that the Indian Investor would also pay corporate taxes to the government and employ Ghanaians and later the percentage of equity share between the parties would be 50%-50% after the Investor has operated the refinery for some time.
The government through the Precious Minerals Marketing Company entered a joint partnership with Rosy Royal Limited, an Indian company, to establish a gold refinery that has vested state equity.
The refinery will be known as the Royal Gold Ghana Limited, which can refine 400 kilogrammes of gold daily.

Table of Contents Long play Selling out Once the relic of a bygone era, vinyl
U.S. revenues from physical records hit $620 million in 2020 and are on track to exceed that by 94% this year with $467 million in sales in the first half of 2021, according to data from the Recording Industry Association of America.
Although paid streaming subscriptions still generate the industry’s biggest revenues with $7 billion in 2020 and another $4.6 billion so far this year, vinyl has rebounded to comprise 6.4% of all music sales in the United States. That is vinyl’s highest percentage since 1990 and a tremendous leap from the format’s lowest point of less than 0.01% between 2004 and 2006.
Despite those recent gains and rosy outlook, though, vinyl’s present is more troubled. Just before the pandemic began in February 2020, a fire destroyed the Banning-based manufacturing plant Apollo Masters Corp., at the time one of only two businesses responsible for the world’s lacquer production, providing 70% to 85% of the world’s master recording plates used to press records for consumers.
Currently, only Japan-based MDC Master Lacquer remains as the industry’s lacquer producer, but a group of more than 50 companies in the vinyl supply chain came together in March 2020 to form the Vinyl Record Manufacturers Association of North America in an effort to meet demand. Unfortunately, the pandemic has interrupted progress on opening new facilities.
While the current output of all known pressing plants in the world is between 160 million and 170 million raw vinyl discs per year, a well-placed insider in the music industry said current demand is roughly double that number. And supply chain issues during the pandemic have further exacerbated delays over the last 18 months while freight and material costs have driven up prices on the finished product.
A new record that consumers might have bought for $20, just a few dollars more than the price of a compact disc 15 years ago, now goes for $30 to $40. Capitalizing on that trend are mass-market retailers like Barnes & Noble Booksellers Inc., Urban Outfitters Inc. and Target Corp., which have added the product to their shelves in recent years. But having more points of sale for vinyl now than there were pre-1980 when it was the dominant format has not offset these price increases.

Cobraside President Randy Boyd said his warehouse tries to keep a consistent stock of approximately 100,000 records and ships in and out almost 6,000 of them per month to independent retailers across the country.
“We try to carry everything that a well-stocked store would want to have,” Boyd said.
Boyd, a 45-year veteran of the music industry, moved to Los Angeles with his family in 1999 to work at Global Fulfillment, an internet startup that built backend software for online shopping portals for Tower Records, Blockbuster, EMI Music and other companies. When the company blew through its funding after just two years, he was left with a master list of 6,000 record stores and data of the on-hand inventory of suppliers around the globe. Boyd, who has previously operated music distributors, saw an opportunity with the vinyl market, which at the time was “hanging on by the skin of its teeth.”
“From 2001 until 2005 or ’06, we cold-called off this list of 6,000 stores and said, ‘We’re a vinyl distributor in L.A. County,’” he said, “5,950 stores said, ‘You must be crazy. Don’t ever phone us back.’ And then around 2006, the vinyl resurgence started to pick up.”
As the biggest — and only — vinyl distributor on the West Coast, Cobraside has an active client base of 300-400 stores. It’s one of six companies across the United States known as “one stops” that supply records to retailers from a worldwide slate of manufacturers without requiring them to maintain contracts with individual labels.
Boyd said those supply chain issues on the manufacturing side have affected the quantities of some records he’s able to get, but they have also guaranteed that the company’s annual $3 million to $4 million in sales are “very sure and stable.”
“It’s really frustrating to order 80 of something and be told (by the pressing plant) that your allocation is five when you’re the only one-stop on the West Coast,” he said.

While Smith operates one of the smaller music stores in Los Angeles, his biggest competition — in sales and square footage — is Amoeba Music Inc., which reopened in a new location April 1 after the lease on its previous Hollywood home was set to expire. Co-owner Jim Henderson said he moves approximately 50,000 records in and out of his doors monthly, 52% of which are used. The store’s volume allows it to deal directly with labels instead of going through distributors like Cobraside, but Henderson said his store is experiencing many of the same shipping delays and ordering backlogs.
“Things selling out and not being able to get something back for five, six weeks — that’s just been a recurring reality of pandemic retail for us, and it’s hard to message that out to your customers,” Henderson said.
As prices go up and delays push supplies of new pressings further back, the consensus is that the vinyl segment of the music industry will continue to be volatile, at least until the supply chain irons itself out. But demand does not appear to be waning.
“My fear is, on the one hand, this price inflation and the distractions of people possibly going back to their pre-pandemic life might detract from vinyl sales,” Boyd said. “On the other hand, there’s this huge unfilled, pent-up demand for records.”
Smith said his optimism for the future of Paradise City, and the industry as a whole, wavers, but he’s still glad he opened the store in the first place.
“Part of me thinks it’s a bubble and that at some point, it’s going to die again,” he said. “But I’m kind of glad I’m in it while I’m in it.”

Dorian's impact: Maritimers complain about cellphone service failure
Published Tuesday, September 10, 2019 7:44AM ADT Last Updated Wednesday, September 11, 2019 7:37AM ADT
HALIFAX -- Federal Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale says he's heard from residents in the Maritimes livid about losing cellphone service after post-tropical storm Dorian swept through the region, causing widespread power outages and property damage.
Speaking Tuesday from a slightly damaged government wharf in Herring Cove, N.S., Goodale pledged financial support through disaster assistance programs, but he also made a point of urging fed-up cellphone users to take action, saying he's heard about their frustration "loud and clear."
"For those who have been affected by what they consider to be faulty or deficient telephone services, they ... should make their concerns known to the ... regulatory authority," Goodale said, referring to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission.
"They need to know if customers believe the response to the emergency was not at the level they have a right to expect .... Make sure you make that concern known to the CRTC."
Goodale said cellphones have become essential tools for Canadians. "It's not just a frill that's nice to have," he said, adding that infrastructure across the country must be built to withstand the intense weather and "abnormal circumstances" caused by climate change.
Many Nova Scotia residents have come forward to complain about spotty cell service in the aftermath of the storm, with some saying they were left with no way to call for help or seek critical information.
Various wireless providers have confirmed they dispatched crews to repair damaged cell towers, but company officials have also reminded users that most cellphone towers have limited backup electricity, leaving them vulnerable to failure during extended power outages.
Telus issued a statement that it has been working around the clock with its infrastructure partner to restore service to its customers and won't charge people for some fees due to the storm.
"We apologize for the inconvenience and thank our customers for their patience and understanding," Steve Beisswanger, a Telus spokesman, said in an email.
"To support our customers during this challenging time we are proactively waiving all domestic voice, text and data overage fees incurred between Saturday, Sept. 7 and Saturday, Sept. 14, 2019, for customers in affected areas."
Dorian pulled down power lines across the region. In Nova Scotia, outages were reported from one end of the province to the other, leaving more than 400,000 Nova Scotia Power customers -- 80 per cent of the homes and businesses in the province -- in the dark at the height of the storm.
If nothing else, the wave of complaints confirms how reliant people have become on their smartphones and fibre optic telecommunications gear that can also fail when the lights go out and backup batteries die.
"In 2019, internet and cellphone services are an essential service," provincial NDP business critic Claudia Chender said in a statement.
"People should be able to expect that in the event of outages, the companies that provide these services will deliver detailed and timely reports on what the impacts are and what restoration work is underway."
Chender said the province's Liberal government should require telecom companies to advise when service will be restored, the same way electric utilities are required to do.
Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made a brief stop at the military's Willow Park Armoury in Halifax, where he met with Goodale, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan, military officials and Halifax Mayor Mike Savage.
There was no official photo-op for the prime minister, who is expected to announce the official start of the federal election campaign on Wednesday. Trudeau steered clear of politics Tuesday, remarking in a brief statement that his government has been monitoring the storm's impact.
"I know crews have been working around the clock to restore power throughout Nova Scotia, and there's a lot more work to do, and the federal government is here to support in any way we can," he told reporters assembled outside the armoury.
Goodale, Sajjan and federal Rural Economic Development Minister Bernadette Jordan later headed to Herring Cove, a tiny coastal community south of Halifax close to where Dorian made landfall on Saturday night.
As the storm approached the coastline, it lashed the area with driving rain and gusts reaching almost 150 kilometres per hour -- approaching the power of a Category 2 hurricane.
There were no reports of injuries, but roofs were torn off and trees were snapped like twigs, pulling down power lines across a wide swath of the Maritimes.
At one point, more than 500,000 electricity consumers in the region were without power, including 75 per cent in Prince Edward Island and 20 per cent in New Brunswick.
As Day 3 of the recovery effort drew to a close, about 16,000 customers were waiting for reconnection in P.E.I., and about 1,000 in New Brunswick. However, more than 88,000 Nova Scotia Power customers were still without electricity Tuesday evening, and the company said it would be Thursday before everyone was reconnected.
The company said the repair teams face a big challenge.
"I think it's fair (to say) that all Nova Scotians have not seen a weather event like this for quite some time," he said.
"The physical infrastructure damage from one end of the province to the other is unprecedented. Everyone is working to best ability to restore that power as quickly as possible, to restore telecommunications as quickly possible."
Nova Scotia Power CEO Karen Hutt said she hoped the number of customers still without power would be cut in half by Wednesday.
A Canadian Forces spokesman said troops have accomplished tasks in the greater Halifax area and will now extend their mission.
Capt. Guillaume Lafrance, chief of staff, Joint Task Force Atlantic, said the 380 assigned troops will be joined by 70 reservists from Nova Scotia, bringing the total number of troops to 450. "Our next objective is .... to help out the entirety of the province," he said.
Light armoured vehicles were spotted patrolling the streets as soldiers with chainsaws were ready to clear the streets of fallen trees. However, they were prevented from removing some trees because limbs were still tangled in power lines, which meant an electrician was needed to get the job done.
Sajjan said the soldiers aren't trained to repair downed power lines, which means their safety would be put at risk without the help of a trained professional.
In Halifax, experts were brought in to see how a crane that toppled at the height of the storm could be taken down safely.
Many schools across Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island were closed Monday and Tuesday, and emergency officials have been urging people to stay home for their own safety and to give cleanup crews the room they need to work. Public schools in Nova Scotia were to reopen Wednesday.

March 1, 2017: Indian carpet brand Obeetee, who recently collaborated with Indian designer Tarun Tahiliani to create one-of-a-kind collection of carpets, has now introduced the collection at ABC Carpet & Home in New York.
Commingling the traditional and contemporary, Mr Tahiliani’s carpets follow three inspirations.
The Antique Frames Collection portrays history and the romance of royals using delicate Mughal designs. The repeated patterns of floral motifs, Persian scripts and tiny prancing birds and bees against a backdrop of royal blues, rich burgundy and dusky green with hints of gold highlights create this exquisite collection that aims to give a home a rich sample of India’s glorious arts memoir.
The Chikankari Collection exemplifies that time honored art of chikan embroidery from Lucknow, where fine thread work is used to create delicate florals and motifs on fine muslin fabrics.
For the carpets, Mr Tahiliani has deconstructed the motifs and set them against contemporary geometric lines and distressed, layered borders, combining age with modern India.
Using layering and texturing created the Abstract Arts Collection, which translated the carpets into intricate and sophisticated expressions of vivid colours, styles and strokes. Devoid of defined motifs, these carpets encourage free-flowing patterns that are pleasing to the eye.

The term "elevator speech" has been around a long time. It refers to perfecting the right few sentences to describe something to someone in a short time, like an elevator ride. It has been used to describe new jobs, products, services, movie script ideas, and a number of other things.
In safety, it can be used to define safety, describe a strategy for safety or share any number of ideas.
However, a powerful use for an elevator speech is to succinctly describe how safety supports the organization's mission. Many consider safety as a competing priority to the main mission of producing products or services. The goal should not be either productivity or safety, but rather safe production.

Parker Ford's second-period goal proved to be game-winner as No. 11 Providence bested the Catamounts 2-0 on Saturday night at Gutterson Fieldhouse to complete a Hockey East weekend sweep.
Providence rallied for a 4-3 triumph in Friday's contest.
Friday's game:Catamounts cough up three-goal lead in loss to No. 11 Providence
"I felt that there were a lot of scoring chances, which is really the mark of a team's offensive output," said second-year coach Todd Woodcroft. "I liked the way that we broke the puck out and the way we played with speed."
Ford struck with 6:10 left in the second period on a top shelf shot from the right face-off area that slipped past Catamounts' Gabe Carriere. Friars forward Cody Monds kept the puck alive before Ford buried his sixth goal of the season.
The Friars added an insurance goal, the lone tally via power play, with 3:10 left in third period. Directly after Friars' faceoff win, sophomore Brett Berard collected the open puck and skated in front of Carriere (23 saves) before firing a pass to Patrick Moynihan for the one-timer.
Moynihan's goal was his third of the two-game set against the Catamounts (1-8-1). Providence improves to 10-5.
"I don't think Gabe can be faulted for either those goals," Woodcroft said. "He is just coming into his own and showed that tonight, I think that he's going to be a big piece moving forward."
The Catamounts had early scoring opportunities, including on two power plays, before the Friars tallied in the second period. In what was a competitive game, the Cats tied in shots and led in faceoff wins after two periods, but were unable to capitalize on four man-advantage opportunities.
"As long as we're getting looks on the power plays and scoring chances in the power plays than I think we are doing something right," Woodcroft said. "The best power plays are the ones that put fear in the other team and nobody is afraid of our power play right now."
Less than 3 minutes in on Saturday, junior Andrew Lucas fired an early look that would have been a sure goal less but Providence goaltender Jaxson Stauber (22 saves) made the stop.
Woodcroft noted that the Catamounts are generating chances when they have the man advantage, but without any "natural finishers" on the team they will have to continue working on finding the openings on net.
Lucas, Carter Long and William Lemay led the way for the Cats with three shots on net each.
The Cats will travel to Yale to face the winless Ivy League foe on Wednesday at 7 p.m.

The estimated public health expenditures on rabies disease diagnostics, prevention, and control in the US is $245 to $510 million annually.). However, the total expenditures on rabies accounting for associated healthcare costs, animal control measures, and time lost from work is much greater.
About 55,000 Americans get PEP each year. When rabies becomes common in wildlife in a region, the number of PEP treatments in that area increases. Although the cost varies (typically from about $1,200 to $6,500), a course of rabies immune globulin and four doses of vaccine given over a two-week period averages about $3,800, not including costs for hospital treatment or wound care. The cost per human life saved from rabies ranges from approximately $10,000 to $100 million, depending on the nature of the exposure and the probability of rabies in a regionDear Ann,
Coasting on the success of the two projects I’ve knit so far from Field Guide No. 6 (i.e., the Shakerag Top and Albers Shawl), I’m going back in. I’ve cast on for the wee Cockleshell Cardigan.
The Cockleshell Cardigan, as you know since you’ve knit it, starts at the right cuff. The cuff has a little knit-purl triangle design. This is a fun way to edge a sleeve. It’s simple, yet effective.
Unfortunately, it wasn’t quite simple enough for me the first time around.
I cast on for the 6-12 month size, followed the instructions to the letter as I always do (cue the foreshadowing music), and got this:
WHOMP WHOMP.
The ribbing at the cuff is supposed to flow, uninterrupted, into the knit-purl pyramid thingie.
The ribbing and the pyramid are not supposed to be separate events.
Since you had knit the 6-12 month size, and you had not had this problem, I suspected Operator Error.
But I put this wonky little cuff aside for a full holiday weekend, because I was sick of its nonsense. (My nonsense.)
Yesterday, I cast on again. Whee! Perfect the first time!
My mistake, as it turns out: the 1 x 1 ribbing at the cuff, which starts right after the cast-on, starts on the WRONG SIDE. Meaning, not the right side.
My clue, apart from the clear instruction “Row 1 (WS),” was that the 1 x 1 ribbing started with a purl 1. Which only really makes sense if it’s the wrong side. I can see that now.
Everything went swell after I made that mental adjustment.
Before and after turning on brain.
I’m in excellent company making this little error. Vicki Mothes (Knitorious, one of the OG knitbloggers and a knitter who is not to be trifled with) has knit wee matching Cockleshells for her wee pair of granddaughters. On the first one, she knit the right sleeve with the separate ribbing feature, but found that when she cast on for the other sleeve, it was hard to replicate the mistake I mean feature.
(Vicki also modified the closure from crocheted ties to a single button with crocheted loop buttonhole.)
Time to recite one of our sturdiest Mason-Dixon Knitting Rules:
Read the pattern.
Read the pattern.
Read the pattern.
(If this is the worst knitting mistake you ever make, you’re doing just great.)
Love,
Kay
P.S. Read the pattern.

Shamima Begum's jihadi husband has refused to condemn ISIS beheadings or the use of sex slaves and said he still hopes to see a caliphate established.
Speaking in an interview from Kurdish-run al-Roj prison in northern Syria, Yago Riedijk, 29, described the couple's 'beautiful' former life under the extremist group.
He said ISIS-claimed attacks on the West were not 'Islamicly responsible' because they involved killing innocent people which is 'prohibited in Islam' but refused to condemn the group's violence against Yazidis, who were sold as sex slaves, and other Muslims.
Riedijk also stayed silent on ISIS beheadings, saying only 'I can't really comment' when pushed to condemn the extremist group's brutal punishments.
The 29-year-old later said he did not believe ISIS was finished and said he still hoped to see a caliphate which adheres to 'Islamic traditions' established.
He smiled as he spoke about married life with Begum in the caliphate and described 'beautiful memories' of baking cakes as a family.
The Dutch extremist married Begum days after she arrived in Syria from East London, aged 15, in 2015 and the couple had three children together, all of whom have died.
Begum is being held in Kurdish-run refugee camp al-Roj in northern Syrian amid an ongoing battle to return to the UK after she was stripped of her citizenship in February 2019.
Riedijk is being held in al-Roj detention centre. He was convicted in a Netherlands court in 2018 for joining the extremist group and will face a six-year jail term if he ever tries to return to Europe.
Riedijk married Shamima Begum (pictured with her son Jerah in 2019), days after she arrived in Syria from East London, aged 15, in 2015 and the couple had three children together, all of whom have died
Begum (pictured) is being held in Kurdish-run refugee camp al-Hol in northern Syrian amid an ongoing battle to return to the UK after she was stripped of her citizenship in February 2019
Speaking to Alan Duncan, a former Scots soldier who is making a documentary on ISIS, Riedijk said he did not agree with ISIS-claimed terror attacks on Germany, France and the UK because they involved killing 'innocent people'.
'Personally, I don't agree with these attacks for a couple of reasons. The prohibition of killing innocent people in Islam, women and children.
'I see these attacks as not being Islamicly responsible [sic],' he said.
However, questioned about attacks on other Muslims and Yazidis - who were sold to ISIS fighters as sex slaves - Riedijk shook his head and said 'no comment'.
More than 2,800 Yazidi women and children are still missing and are thought to be being held by ISIS.
Riedijk also revealed he discussed marriage directly with Begum when she arrived in Syria in 2015 and agreed on conditions before they tied the knot.
'It was not really anything big. Small things like going out shopping - stuff like this. She asked for some freedoms which I agreed to give her. Going shopping, seeing friends. Basic stuff,' he said.
He said Begum asked for a dowry of an English translation of the Quran, which he agreed to.
He smiled on camera as he recalled the family baking cakes to make money while Begum was pregnant with their second son Jalah.
'There were some nice days with my wife and kids at home. Some beautiful memories,' he said.
Riedijk has said he wants to reunite with Begum and 'start a family again'. Last year he urged Begum to 'do whatever you can to build a future for us' as she fought against the Home Office decision to strip her of her British citizenship.

Riedijk (pictured in the Netherlands in 2011) also revealed he discussed marriage directly with Begum when she arrived in Syria in 2015 and agreed on conditions before they tied the knotRiedijk said he found it hard to take that Begum had two miscarriages, before giving birth to their three children. Talking about the first miscarriage, he said: 'It was difficult to take. I'm a family man, I love family, I love children.'
He added Begum got pregnant immediate after the first miscarriage but lost the baby for the second time.
The 29-year-old added that while living in the caliphate he contacted his family back home more often than Begum spoke to hers, but declined to elaborate.
Riedijk also refused to comment much on how Begum viewed ISIS's beheadings and punishments. But he described seeing corpses left on the street as an example as 'not a pleasant picture', but refused to condemn the act as wrong.
'I can't really comment', he said. He went on to describe death as part of daily life, blaming coalition bombing for the killing of innocent Muslims.
Asked if ISIS was finished, Riedijk said 'no', later adding when questioned that he would like to see a caliphate which adheres to 'Islamic traditions' established.
Begum was one of three schoolgirls from Bethnal Green Academy who went to join ISIS, shortly after Sharmeena Begum, who is no relation, travelled to Syria in December 2014.
Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase, then 16 and 15 respectively, joined Begum on a flight from London to Istanbul before making their way to Syria.
Shamima Begum (centre) was one of three schoolgirls (pictured) from Bethnal Green Academy who went to join ISIS in 2015
Begum and two girls flew to Istanbul from Gatwick then helped by ISIS traffickers through Turkey to Syria
Aged 19 and heavily pregnant, Begum resurfaced at a Syrian refugee camp in early 2019 and said she wanted to return to Britain.
In an extraordinary interview she admitted she did not regret going to join ISIS, saying the experience had made her 'stronger and tougher'.
She acknowledged she knew the group was carrying out beheadings and executions before she left, adding that she was 'OK with it at first'.
'I had my kids, I did have a good time there. It's just that then things got harder and I couldn't take it any more and I had to leave,' she said.
She also revealed she had left Raqqa in January 2017 with her husband, but her children, a one-year-old girl and a three-month-old boy, had both since died.
The baby boy she was carrying later died in a camp in northern Syria, with reports suggesting he had suffered from breathing difficulties.
In September, a dolled-up Begum appeared on Good Morning Britain and begged the UK public for forgiveness and to be allowed to return
Begum is being held at the al-Roj refugee camp in northern Syria, where she is faced with 'dire conditions', according to her legal teamBegum's case became a major political controversy in Britain, resulting in then-home secretary Sajid Javid revoking her British citizenship on national security grounds in February 2019.
She challenged the government's decision, and in 2020, the Court of Appeal ruled that 'the only way in which she can have a fair and effective appeal is to be permitted to come into the United Kingdom to pursue her appeal'.
The supreme court later overturned the ruling and said Begum could not return to the UK to contest the case.
In September, a dolled-up Begum appeared on Good Morning Britain and begged the UK public for forgiveness and to be allowed to return.

Researchers worldwide are working to develop new technologies for producing clean energy. A team of researchers led by Sven Kerzenmacher at the University of Freiburg's Department of Microsystems Engineering (IMTEK) is interested in combining wastewater and bacteria, an approach that is both unusual and promising.
Even though current low oil prices do not appear to signal that fossil reserves such as oil and coal are finite, there is no doubt that they are. And as the global population – and hence energy needs – continues to grow, new technologies that generate CO2 neutral, clean energy are required. Neither solar and wind energies nor energy crops alone are able to solve the global energy problem. Algae and bacteria are regarded as promising new resources for energy production.
The team led by Sven Kerzenmacher from the University of Freiburg's Department of Microsystems Engineering (IMTEK) uses a particular resource for producing energy that has not previously been considered: wastewater. “In theory, we only have to put two electrodes into the wastewater at a sewage plant and it's not long before a biofilm forms on the electrodes with which electric current can be generated,” says Kerzenmacher.
Microbial fuel cells generate electricity in the same way as conventional fuel cells by converting chemical energy into electrical energy. Bacteria use the organic constituents that float in wastewater as food. The oxidation of food molecules, which happens in all living organisms, is associated with the transfer of electrons. The researchers from Freiburg have found a way to tap into this electron flow and generate electricity. “The bacteria act as catalysts. But they are considerably cheaper than the platinum used in normal fuel cells,” says Kerzenmacher.
However, only a handful of bacteria are suitable for generating electric current. “They must be able to transfer their electrons directly to an electrode,” says Kerzenmacher. An example of such an electrode is an anode made from porous stainless steel or graphite. Only exoelectrogenic bacteria have this capacity. The researchers from Freiburg work with Geobacter sulfurreducens, a bacterium present in soil and therefore also in wastewater. These bacteria are able to oxidise organic compounds by transferring electrons to electrodes. They have special proteins that transport the electrons produced by organic matter oxidation across the cell membrane to the outside where they are transferred to a fuel cell anode as the sole electron acceptor. Usable electric current is generated when these electrodes flow from the anode to the cathode through a wire.
However, there are even more effective ways of generating power: Joana Danzer, a scientist in Kerzenmacher’s team, works with so-called filtration-active microbial fuel cells that, in addition to producing electric current, also clean the wastewater. “This tubular fuel cell has a membrane anode that serves as both filter and electrode,” says Joana Danzer who developed this fuel cell variant as part of her doctoral thesis at the IMTEK Laboratory for MEMS Applications (see figure). In October 2014, she won the Baden-Württemberg Ministry of the Environment's f-cell award.
Joana Danzer has used synthetic wastewater to develop the fuel cell, but will now test it with real wastewater. She will also have to find alternative anode materials for the two fuel cells as porous stainless steel would be far too expensive for commercial use. In the long term, the researchers also plan to test the miniature cells on the large scale as the industrial application of the technology requires square metres rather than square centimetres. “We do not yet know what kind of problems will arise when we scale up,” says Kerzenmacher.
The researchers will also have to increase current density. “We are currently able to produce around one to two watts per square metre, but the system only pays off from 5 to 10 watts or more,” says Danzer. The researchers’ goal is, however, not to supply entire cities with electricity. “We would have achieved a lot if we manage to produce fuel cells that can cover the power requirements of sewage plants,” concludes Danzer.
Sewage plants are real energy guzzlers. Wastewater aeration is particularly expensive but necessary as the microorganisms used to clean wastewater need oxygen. According to the Federal Environment Agency, sewage plants consume on average 20 percent of the overall energy used by German towns and cities, making them the largest municipal energy consumers. Annual energy consumption in wastewater plants in Germany amounts to around 4,400 gigawatt hours, which corresponds to the energy needs of 900,000 four-person households. Huge savings would be made if some of this energy could be directly produced in the sewage plant.
The researchers from Freiburg want to focus initially on industrial wastewater from breweries or food producers. “The wastewater of such organisations is usually more heavily polluted than municipal wastewater. Cleaning or disposal costs are relatively high. I think that these kinds of organisations would be interested in our technology,” says Kerzenmacher.
In addition to energy-neutral wastewater treatment, the microbial fuel cell can also be used for other applications. One variant can be used to produce hydrogen, and another could be used to indirectly produce biopolymers by feeding bioplastics-producing bacteria with fuel cell electrons instead of sugar as is the case at the moment.Throughout the project, we’ll post questions and comments that have been submitted on comment cards collected at community meetings, sent via email or submitted via the website.

Recode Knoxville
I do have concerns as to the RN4 coding will play into the H-1 overlay process......not sure what the multi-family /townhouse would look like in relation to our H-1 overlay or is that something that would not pertain to an H-1 Overlay area ??

Rezoning
I don't understand the reasoning in rezoning the entire 4th and Gill neighborhood from R-2 to R-4. I can understand the logic of multifamily zoning along corridors to act as a transition into established neighborhoods, as I see being done on Magnolia on the new map, but not the rezoning of an entire neighborhood. I also don't see that type of rezoning in surrounding historic neighborhoods, so why 4th and Gill? We worked long and hard many years ago to become R-1A, or R-2 as it is called in the Recode. This would be a huge step backwards, in many eyes. Please reconsider this decision.:

4th & Gill Zoning
I strongly oppose recoding the 4th & Gill neighborhood to allow for the conversion of homes into multi-family units and townhouses. I am concerned that this will negatively affect the historical integrity of our neighborhood.

Recode: 4th & Gill
I strongly object to the rezoning of the Fourth and Gill neighborhood from "Single Family/Duplex" to "Multiple Family/Townhouse". Many individuals and families have been working/investing for decades to build the fabric of this neighborhood into a strong, tightly knit community. I, for one (and I know many agree with me), would like to keep it that way. From a pragmatic standpoint, we don't have the parking to support this new zoning anyway. Thank you for your consideration.

As a 4th and Gill resident, I prefer the original zoning plan for Single Family/Duplex (as we are now) and do not support allowing Multi-family and Townhouses.

SAGINAW – As Draymond Green’s corner 3-pointer swished through the basket Thursday night during Game 6 of the NBA Finals, nearly 20,000 Golden State Warriors fans rose to their feet in celebration.
And inside a Hooters in Saginaw, at least one Warriors fan did likewise.
“Saginawwwww!” Jeremiah McLaurin hollered, more than 2,000 miles away from the game action in Green’s hometown.
It’s been more than a decade since Green led Saginaw High School to back-to-back basketball state championships. But here, in this chain restaurant in a rust-belt town, the locals still root for the one they call “Day Day,” hoping he can bring their city one more ring.
McLaurin, a former MSU defensive back and Saginaw High School star, was decked out with a Golden State hoodie and fitted cap.
Even the fans of the underdog Raptors in this series had at least one Warrior on their side. They were all rooting for the trash-talking, technical-foul-drawing, rebound-gobbling big man who has been the glue and grit holding together a supremely talented NBA dynasty – and the thorn in so many opponents' sides.
Green’s success is their success. His struggles are their struggles.
Some cheer for him because they know him personally. Some cheer for him because they know his experiences in this city shaped him into the player he is today.
Throughout Thursday's game, with greasy chicken and light beer providing the lubrication for conversation, McLaurin and his buddies talked ball. They talked about the hometown kid. And they talked about life in an area that’s considered one of America’s 10 most dangerous cities, according to the National Council for Home Safety and Security.
When General Motors downsized and manufacturing jobs declined, a city that had an estimated population of nearly 100,000 in 1960 saw its population cut in half as of a 2018 census projection. Among the people who remained, 33.6 percent live in poverty.
“We’ve got a survival mentality,” said Dave Sontoya, a bald-headed Saginaw man with a toothpick dangling out of his goateed face and dozens of tattoos up and down both arms. “No jobs. High crime rate. Everything is negative, man.”
During this night, with basketball as the backdrop, one thing became clear. There are problems in this city, at least in certain parts of the city. But there’s also this unique sense of pride.
“People may not even like being here,” Sontoya added. “But as soon as you’re out of town, you tell them you’re from Saginaw.”
It's an odd dynamic that's sometimes difficult to understand. But once you do, you can begin to understand what makes Draymond Green who he is.
'This is where it all started'
McLaurin feels the tug of the city that raised him and the connection to one of its favorite sons more than most.
After helping to lead Saginaw to the 1999 state championship in football, McLaurin enrolled at MSU. In those days, the ballplayers from Flint and the ballplayers from Saginaw had their separate cliques in East Lansing.
The players from Flint called themselves the Flintstones. So the Saginaw players had to come up with something for themselves.
Jason Richardson went to Color Splash tattoo parlor near MSU's campus and got inked with a “SAG” tattooed on one forearm and “NASTY” on the other. When McLaurin saw it, he went with former Spartans star Charles Rogers two weeks later and they both got the same “SAGNASTY” tattoo. McLaurin’s cousin and future NFL linebacker, LaMarr Woodley, eventually got one too.
In this way, as the ink of the tattoo seeped into their veins. Saginaw is quite literally in their blood stream.
McLaurin is something of a Saginaw sports encyclopedia. And on Thursday, he was a generous and willing tour guide.
The first stop was the legendary Citivan Recreation Center, an old brick building swimming in a sea of overgrown grass. It's probably been months since the lawn has been cut. The widows are boarded up. The glass on the front doors has been smashed out and replaced with a chain and a lock.
Yet, this place holds a special place in the hearts of those from Saginaw. It served as an incubator for basketball dreams in their most infant stages.
“This is where it all started,” McLaurin said, staring at the building with a certain nostalgic feeling.
Green lived right around the block.
Back before asbestos was discovered here and the doors were chained shut, kids used to walk to the rec center for free sandwiches and juice cups. They played games to eight and nine instead of 11 so that more kids could get on the court.
Former NFL safety Stu Schweigert, Rogers, Woodley, Richardson and so many others used to call “The 'Tan” home. Forged in this furnace, the players became a unique breed, Green included.
“You see him talking trash right now,” McLaurin said. “He learned that in this building. That mouth you see on Draymond, all those techs he gets, he learned that playing in the Civitan Recreation Center.”
Peak inside the recreation center and, off in the distance, there's a plaque with the rec center rules, which may be ironic in some ways for a player known for walking on the edge – and sometimes stepping right over – those rules.
The tour continued to Saginaw High School. It's not hard to find Green's face here. Just outside the gym, there are two massive team photos from the 2006-07 and 2007-08 state championship teams.
But what stands out more than the photos are the sayings. They're everywhere here. Virtually every wall is covered. Motivational quotes. Famous quotes. Inspirational quotes.
Perhaps the most significant one is the one that hangs over the entryway from retired four-star general Colin Powell: "If you are going to achieve excellence in big things, you develop the habit in little matters. Excellence is not an exception, it is a prevailing attitude."
Kids see that quote every day here. Whether it was conscious or not, Green found a way to absorb it.
'You've got to work for it.'
Back in the bar later than evening, the conversation frequently drifts from the basketball game to Saginaw greats. For a city with a dwindling population, Saginaw has produced a surprising number of professional athletes.
Maybe that’s not a coincidence.
In every city, ballplayers seem to take on the mentality of the neighborhoods where they’re raised. Saginaw is no different.
"You really got to work for it," Gary LaBelle, another Saginaw lifer said. "You’ve got to want it. You come from nothing."
For every player who made it, there are five stories of players who squandered opportunities or fell back into the pitfalls that everyone thought they had sidestepped.
Saginaw native Robert Castillo said every year there’s some high school athlete the community believes is going to make it big. Like really big.
“And then they never do,” Castilllo said. “Honestly, the best example is Chuck.”
That’s what the people who know him here in Saginaw call Charles Rogers, the former first-round draft pick who flamed out of the NFL when a promising career became derailed by drugs and bad decisions.
“He should have never went to Michigan State,” Castillo said. “He should have never gone to the Lions. He was too close to home. That’s what killed Charles Rogers.”
That’s partially why Green is respected so much around these parts. He wasn't necessarily the sure-fire prospect. He was the chubby kid with potential who found a way to reach it – and then maybe even exceed it.
He made it out. And continues to make a name for himself.
“Look at what team he got drafted by,” McLaurin said. “If Charles would have went out to Oakland, it could have been different.”
The missed chances and shattered dreams were a sobering thought. As the evening continued, the light beer ran dry. So too did the Warriors' playoff run as the Raptors held on for a 114-10 title-clinching win.
Sure enough, the hometown kid, Green, found himself right in the middle of the drama, as Golden State made one last surge. With just under two minutes left, Green hoisted a 3-pointer that swished through the net, cutting the Raptors lead to 108-105.
“Let’s go Sawginawwwwwww!” McLaurin stood up and screamed, again.
Moments later, with less than 15 seconds left and Toronto clinging to a two-point lead, Green trapped Toronto’s Danny Green just over half court. The Raptors tossed the ball out of bounds, giving the Warriors one last chance.
“He was taught that here,” McLaurin stood up and screamed.
The Warriors inbounded the ball. They found Stephen Curry. His last-chance 3-pointer clanked. Green dove on the floor and called the timeout with 0.9 seconds left – a timeout the Warriors didn’t have.
Game over.
“He pulled a Chris Webber,” LaBelle shouted, referencing one of the most infamous moments in college basketball history, when the Michigan basketball star called for a timeout near the end of the 1993 NCAA championship game.
The truth is this was no Chris Webber moment. The Warriors were already beyond life support before the timeout and the technical.
But this is Saginaw. This is a place where trash talking is a way of life. And even one of the city’s favorite sons isn’t immune to a little chatter.Brompton Chain Tensioner Assembly Kit

The latest castoff expresses his frustration about how he was portrayed on TV
Over a period of three days, multiple cameras film between 300-500 hours of footage. Then, a team of editors boil all that footage down to one 44-minute episode.
Dan Foley, the latest contestant voted off the island, says he watched the first two episodes and realized that he was going to get a villain’s edit. But even he seems surprised at how negatively he was portrayed – and how vitriolic the viewer response has been.
So what did we miss? Foley, a 47-year-old postal worker from Maine, was happy to tell us.
Okay, there are going to be some tough questions today, but let’s start with an easy one: what could you have done differently to keep from going home?
You know, it’s easy to be an armchair quarterback. If I had only known that Carolyn had the immunity idol, I would have voted out Sierra.
You used your extra vote during the tribal council. Do you think that made you a target?
I said it before: superfans can’t do basic math. It made no sense for me to play that vote when there was an odd number of people left. I wanted to play it when there was an even number. And what you didn’t see was that Sierra came to me and said that Will was ready to get rid of me. And then during Tribal Council, Will said, “If Dan has the advantage, he should use it.” It was the right time to play it.
Fair enough. So what was your reaction when you were voted out? Were you angry at Carolyn?
Look, anyone who walks out of the game with a smile on their face didn’t play the game. I left that game with a fever of expletives. They didn’t show it, but I was swearing and spitting and seething after my torch was snuffed. I was absolutely furious, calling Mike every name in the book. But I don’t wish anyone ill will.
Okay, I need to call you out on your statement that flippers never win.
They don’t.
They do.
No they don’t. Tony Vlachos was a backstabber, not a flipper.
Okay, but Vecepia Towery won season 4 and she flipped twice. She flipped to vote out Boston Rob at Final 10. Then, at Final 9, she flipped back and took out the Rotu alliance.
But did she win?
Yes. She won the million. She beat Neleh Dennis.
Huh. Okay.
And Sandra Diaz Twine flipped multiple times to win.
Well, Sandra is a different case altogether. But Cochran flipped, and did that work for him?
No. No one says that all flippers don’t win. But flippers can and do win. Also, there was Danni Boatwright in Guatemala…
(Laughs) Yes, she played a good game. But I still believe that flippers don’t win. I really do.
Okay, let’s move on to the ugliness of the season. Your character was very difficult to root for.
I talked to Jeff Probst the other day and I ripped him a new one. I said, “You did me wrong. You did me dirty. You screwed me on my edit. You made me look like a piece of s—.” And Jeff said, “How do you figure?” And I said, “You cherry-picked things to show, sometimes out of context.”
Get a Tour of Jeff Probst’s ‘Spectacular’ Pad
I don’t know you. I only know the edited version of you. Are you saying that it was incorrect?When I am pushed, I push back. And I was pushed a lot. They didn’t show that. Lindsey, Sierra … they said things to me and pushed back. Look, I was always the fat guy. I learned how to stand up for myself. But you didn’t see what other people were saying or doing.
You took a lot of heat for your comments to Shirin.
Look, there’s not a single person on this season who didn’t say derogatory things about Shirin. Even Mike called her a man-hater. I made an unfortunate comment about slapping her. I had no idea about her past. None. Zero. I would never have made that comment. I apologize for saying it.
But at the same time, my comment was not meant literally. I meant it figuratively. How many times do you hear people say, “I could kill him.” Are they really plotting to kill someone? Of course not.
So where do things stand with Shirin now?
The truth of the matter is that we don’t get along. I don’t wish her ill or badly, and I hope nothing but the best for her. I hope that if she wants to go back on Survivor again, she gets that shot. There are things in her past that continue to haunt her to this day, and I hope that she gets the help that she clearly needs.
You were a big Survivor fan. Now that your reputation has taken a hit, are you still a fan of the show?
My reputation has not been harmed. The people who know me know that my edit was not who I really am. I don’t have a problem telling the truth. There are people who love me, and people who hate me. There is no real middle ground. the people who hate me can’t handle the truth.
But do you still love the show, or has your view been tainted?
How can you not have a tainted vision when you pull back the curtain and see that Oz is pulling on the levers? I’m a little disappointed, but I still love the show. Would I play it again? (Long Pause) Yeah. In a second.Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council

Hitting up those summer sales? Well, If you’re thinking of making a shopping list before hitting up the mall, I have something you need to add.
If there is one thing every Fashionista is looking for this summer, it is a good pair of ripped jeans. Even if your mom says they are impractical, these are the on-trend item to have. The wear-and-tear look has been dormant for a while, but it’s a throwback classic that has recently seen a huge revival. Some of the hottest looks this summer feature this grunge piece, and the perfect pair is not hard to find—all of the best stores are selling them, and some are available at super-affordable prices.
The Fashionista pictured in this article sported a washed-out pair of jeans featuring a ripped hole in the knee. The lighter wash gave her look a summery vibe, even on the especially cloudy day. She paire her jeans with light neutrals, which worked effortlessly with the jeans. For accessories, her fringe purse added to the hip, edgy vibe she had going.
Jeans with this kind of destroyed detail can make any outfit look like it came straight off the runway. Paired with even the most basic top, they become effortless statement. They are especially great for summer too: the holes allow for both a bit of a breeze make them feel less constricting than a regular pair of jeans.
So why should you invest? Ripped jeans are a versatile piece that can be cuffed with a pair of sneakers and dressed down, or dressed up with a nice pair of strappy sandals. You could grab a boyfriend style for a more laid back look ,or a white pair for a summer barbecue. (Or, if you’re a DIY kind of Fashionista, then you can even make them yourself with a bottle of bleach and a pair of scissors, voilà, instant fashion designer).
Whether you are feeling adventurous and crafty, or ready to do some shopping, a quality pair of distressed denim would make a great addition to any Fashionista’s closet.
What is your STYLE ADVICE OF THE WEEK? “I always cuff my jeans—I think it makes them summery and more fun.”On May 15th we’ll be heading to Omaha, Nebraska to run our 11th SocialHRCamp. Like each of our past Camps this one is going to be unique. This will be the first time the Omaha (and near-by Lincoln) HR community will have the opportunity to experience SocialHRCamp. The agenda is currently being created and curated with the local community in mind—meshing together their immediate needs with hot industry trends. We will be publishing version 1 of the agenda very soon, but what we are also excited about is the opportunity to experiment with new ideas and take a few risks. For those that know us they know that we are not averse to risk-taking. Many worked out and may did not… but… we know that you can’t progress without taking a few risks.
So what tricks do we have up our sleeve this time around? Well… we will be integrating the popular IgniteHR platform into SocialHRCamp Omaha. Led by industry thought-leader Jason Lauritsen of Camp sponsor Quantum Workplace, we will dedicate a good portion of the morning to run IgniteHR.
Why Are We Doing This?
Why not? In all seriousness, we view the IgniteHR platform as another method of learning. It’s interesting, inspiring and creative, just like SocialHRCamp. It’s also a well-recognized initiative in the local Omaha HR community, and it complements what SocialHRCamp is all about. It just makes sense.
What is IgniteHR?
Inspired by the original Ignite platform, IgniteHR runs a series of high-octane, thought-provoking and energetic 5-minute presentations that consist of 20 slides that change every 15 seconds. A facilitated discussion is followed up after each session with the audience to talk about key learnings, ideas and strategies that the audience can potentially take away and use.
One of the cool things about IgniteHR is the speakers are not professional, or even amateur speakers. They’re HR & Recruitment Practitioners like you and I who have a bold idea, want to share it with the world and have the guts to get up in front of a crowd and make their case heard. We are currently looking for speakers and we encourage anyone and everyone to submit a short proposal—click here to access the main SocialHRCamp Omaha page, and scroll down to access the submission form.
There are only 2 conditions. First, your topic must relate in some fashion to social media and/or technology in the workplace, and second, you can’t pitch a product or service. It’s about learning, inspiration, idea generation and pushing boundaries.
The deadline for submissions is April 13th. So what are you waiting for? Get on it immediately and submit your proposal and be part of the IgniteHR and SocialHRCamp Omaha 2015 experience.Life in Silicon Valley revolves around the high tech industry. At any gathering, you’ll probably encounter engineers and scientists who work for the region’s high-tech companies. (The unfortunate side effect is that it’s very common to “talk work” at social events.)
More than half of the adult residents of Silicon Valley have college degrees, and close to a quarter have advanced degrees.
Entertainment
With its large and diverse population, and high income levels, it’s not surprising that there are many things to do in Silicon Valley. The region supports multiple major-league sports teams, as well as a wealth of museums, performing arts venues, and world-class restaurants.
In addition, there are large areas of government-protected open space in the area, providing opportunities for hiking, bicycling, swimming and horseback-riding.
And finally, for those who enjoy a “city” experience, San Francisco is less than an hour away from Silicon Valley.
Diversity
More than 36% of the people in Silicon Valley are foreign-born. Many enter the county on work visas sponsored by high-tech companies.
In addition to large numbers of people from China, India, and Mexico, you’ll encounter small communities representing virtually every country, including Korea, the Philippines, Russia, England, Japan, Israel, and more.
Visit a local park and you’ll be likely to see people playing cricket and soccer, or practicing Tai Chi.
Go out to lunch with people from work, and you’ll likely end up arguing about whether to go a Thai restaurant, or try the new Afghani restaurant.
People in Silicon Valley quickly grow comfortable working and socializing with people from different cultures and ethnic groups, and enjoy experiencing the traditions, food, and entertainment from around the world.
Housing
Although Silicon Valley includes parts of San Jose – California’s third-largest city – most of the area is suburban, made up of single-family homes, condominiums, and apartments.
Because of the high-income levels in the area, and the limited availability of real estate, housing is very expensive. Silicon Valley includes 3 of the nation’s 10 most expensive housing markets.
The average rent in Silicon Valley is around $2,500. Rent for a single-family detached home can run $4,000 to $5,000. The average purchase price for a home exceeds $1 million.Top Rated Indian Restaurant in Cincinnati OH

Très belle carteThe Federal Government will continue to improve the deteriorating infrastructural facilities in the country’s universities, President Muhammadu Buhari said on Saturday.
According to the President, education would continue to be a high priority item in his government’s drive to transform the economy.
Buhari stated these at the University of Abuja’s 24th convocation.
His address was read by the Executive Secretary of the National Universities Commission, Prof Abubakar Rasheed.
The President said that tertiary institutions needed to be with uninterrupted academic activities if they would achieve the overall objective of contributing to national growth and development.
He said: “The Federal Government will continue to provide Nigerians’ equal and massive access to education at all levels such that they can fulfil their dream of participating in the nation’s socio-economic development and empowerment of our youths.
READ ALSO: Buhari felicitates with Nasir el-Rufa’i at 60
“The task of overcoming the problems of the education sector is not a responsibility of government alone. It should emerge through a concerted effort of government, parents, stakeholders and the society.
“The government will continue to improve the deteriorating infrastructural facilities in the universities, teacher development, and curriculum review in tandem with the needs of our society.
“This is expected, in the long run, to address deficiencies in all the segments of our educational system.

“The Minister of Education has since directed the NUC to initiate the process of reviewing the curriculum of universities which would, among other relevant activities, include provision for the minimum level of qualification for university teachers.”
The Vice-Chancellor of the university, Prof Abdulrasheed Na’Allah, said the institution graduated 10,331 undergraduate and postgraduate students.
He said 26 were awarded First Class and 866 Second Class Upper degrees.Ozzy Osbourne
Destiny (Expression) Number 9
“ I am a raging alcoholic and a raging addict and I didn't want to see my kids do the same thing.” is the humanitarian. He is attracted to a cause or a movement whose purpose is to make a better world. Ozzy is extremely idealistic, sometimes to the point of being naive about people or methods. He has great compassion and seeks to create a more humane society. Ozzy is drawn to those who suffer physically or are at the hand of injustice. He is the righter of wrongs. Ozzy Osbourne's deepest intention is to transform the world.
He is willing to sacrifice in order to advance his cause. Indeed, this seems to be a theme in Osbourne's life. From time to time, he finds himself involved in a project whose very life depends upon his willingness to sacrifice something that relates directly to his ego.
Ozzy Osbourne is highly idealistic. He is also a visionary, with the ability to influence and direct the masses. Deep inside, Ozzy longs for the love and approval of the many, and seeks fame.
Part of Ozzy's hunger for fame has to do with his need for validation; Ozzy is his own harshest critic.
Ozzy Osbourne realizes his greatest satisfaction when he is involved in some activity that directly benefits the public good. Politics, law, protection of the environment, teaching, and healing are areas in which Osbourne would succeed.
Ozzy has a broad view of humanity and is not shackled with prejudice. He should have friends and associates from all walks of life, all colors and religious backgrounds. People fascinate and enrich him. A wide diversity of people and experiences stimulate and bring forth qualities within Ozzy Osbourne that would otherwise lay dormant.
He has an abundance of artistic talent. Many with Ozzy's Destiny number find themselves in the arts, especially in literature, painting, and the visual and performing arts.
The number 9 indicates the completion of a cycle or a block of learning. The 9 Expression suggests that Ozzy Osbourne has reached the point where a breakthrough can occur; during this lifetime Ozzy can apply all that he has learned along his evolutionary path and complete a major stage in his development. This is why we find many geniuses with Destiny 9.
Ozzy Osbourne has the ability to synthesize many diverse bits of knowledge into a unified whole.
His appearance is important. Osbourne is keenly aware of how others perceive him. As a result, others see Ozzy as a person with a great deal of control. Conversely, Ozzy Osbourne is charismatic. Despite the cool and distant personality he projects, people are attracted to him.
Ozzy tends to express his love somewhat impersonally. He tends to be preoccupied with his vision or cause, and sometimes overlook the needs of those closest to him. Osbourne needs to be reminded to give his love more personally and more openly. Ironically, Ozzy Osbourne is a very loving and sincere person, but often neglectful in expressing what he truly feels.
In the same way, Ozzy can overlook his own needs. He can avoid sharing his deeper feelings, creating a reservoir of emotion. Ozzy Osbourne tends to postpone his personal satisfaction in favor of some larger work. He should try to be more spontaneous and courageous about showing his real self, including his vulnerability.
Osbourne's basic belief in the goodness of humanity is unshakable. This causes him to encourage the best in people, but occasionally makes him vulnerable to being taken advantage of. Ozzy is not a very good judge of character.
The surest way to personal satisfaction is for Ozzy Osbourne to become part of some larger social cause. His nature is to serve. Ozzy is happiest when he feels he is helping to advance the human race.
You and Ozzy
About Ozzy's Destiny (Expression) number
The Destiny number reveals the talents, abilities, and shortcomings that were with Ozzy Osbourne when he entered his human body. His name, and the numbers derived from it, reveals Ozzy's development, as well as the talents and issues he will be working with during this life.
Read more about our interpretation of Ozzy Osbourne's destiny (expression)The first chapter of a science fiction that is full of thrill and mystery is always a treat for the people who love literature with a spark. The story starts the series well and has everything one can imagine in a story. Thus it provides a surety that you wouldn’t get bored once so start flipping the pages.
Curtis C. Chen’s has given a nice kick to the series as this is the first one that starts the Kangaroo series. Kangaroo the master spy in the start of the story gets entangled in the most dangerous mission of his life for which he had to risk everything, a mission because of which the whole human race is at stake
Kangaroo after the completion of another successful mission at the start of the novel moves to Mars for a comfy vacation that he desired but on his arrival on Mars, he gets to know about a conspiracy that could start the planetary war once again between Mars and the Mother Earth.
Kangaroo seems to be the only hope as he is not only a spy of first-class but also the only being who can travel to anywhere from anywhere as he can open a dimension portal in a parallel universe and can move to distant lands in an instant.
Even his superpowers seem to be worthless at the climax as he cannot stop a planetary war or cannot transfer the whole of humanity to a safe place at the time of war. The narration also keeps a good pace with the story throughout and P.J. Ochlan the narrator depicts the intensity of was in the right way in the whole novel.
Many people also have liked and endorsed The Last Man – Vince Flynn and Kingdom of The Blind – Louise Penny as good stories.

ABSTRACT
'Intracranial mesenchymal tumor, FET-CREB fusion-positive' occurs primarily in children and young adults and has previously been termed intracranial angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma (AFH) or intracranial myxoid mesenchymal tumor (IMMT). Here we performed genome-wide DNA methylation array profiling of 20 primary intracranial mesenchymal tumors with FET-CREB fusion to further study their ontology. These tumors resolved into two distinct epigenetic subgroups that were both divergent from all other analyzed intracranial neoplasms and soft tissue sarcomas, including meningioma, clear cell sarcoma of soft tissue (CCS), and AFH of extracranial soft tissue. The first subgroup (Group A, 16 tumors) clustered nearest to but independent of solitary fibrous tumor and AFH of extracranial soft tissue, whereas the second epigenetic subgroup (Group B, 4 tumors) clustered nearest to but independent of CCS and also lacked expression of melanocytic markers (HMB45, Melan A, or MITF) characteristic of CCS. Group A tumors most often occurred in adolescence or early adulthood, arose throughout the neuroaxis, and contained mostly EWSR1-ATF1 and EWSR1-CREB1 fusions. Group B tumors arose most often in early childhood, were located along the cerebral convexities or spinal cord, and demonstrated an enrichment for tumors with CREM as the fusion partner (either EWSR1-CREM or FUS-CREM). Group A tumors more often demonstrated stellate/spindle cell morphology and hemangioma-like vasculature, whereas Group B tumors more often demonstrated round cell or epithelioid/rhabdoid morphology without hemangioma-like vasculature, although robust comparison of these clinical and histologic features requires future study. Patients with Group B tumors had inferior progression-free survival relative to Group A tumors (median 4.5 vs. 49 months, p = 0.001). Together, these findings confirm that intracranial AFH-like neoplasms and IMMT represent histologic variants of a single tumor type ('intracranial mesenchymal tumor, FET-CREB fusion-positive') that is distinct from meningioma and extracranial sarcomas. Additionally, epigenomic evaluation may provide important prognostic subtyping for this unique tumor entity.

ABSTRACT
Capillary hemangiomas are benign vascular tumors usually diagnosed in infancy and involving skin and soft tissues. We report a rare case of an adult capillary hemangioma of the left sphenoid sinus extending into the intrasellar and parasellar regions. A 71-year-old woman presented with complaints of headaches and diplopia. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a T2-hyperintense mass-like lesion involving the left posterior ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses and left cavernous sinus, that had extended into the intrasellar and parasellar regions. Dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed enhancing vessel-like structures within the lesion during the arterial phase, which were observed to expand further in the late phase of the examination. This characteristic feature indicated increased vascularity, suggesting the presence of a capillary hemangioma. The patient underwent endoscopic resection via the endonasal transpterygoid approach, and the lesion was diagnosed histopathologically as a capillary hemangioma. To aid diagnosis and clinical management, radiologists should be aware of the imaging findings related to capillary hemangiomas.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Venous malformations (VMs) are the most common type of vascular malformations. Intramuscular venous malformations (IMVMs) are lesions involving the muscles, excluding intramuscular hemangiomas. The purpose of this study was to compare clinical outcomes between patients with IMVMs who were treated with sclerotherapy and those who were treated with surgical excision.
METHODS: Of 492 patients with VMs treated between July 2011 and August 2020 at a single medical center for vascular anomalies, 63 patients diagnosed with IMVM were retrospectively reviewed. Pain, movement limitations, swelling, and quality of life (QOL) were evaluated subjectively, while radiological outcomes were assessed by qualified radiologists at the center. Complication rates were also evaluated, and radiological and clinical examinations were used to determine which treatment group (sclerotherapy or surgical excision) exhibited greater improvement.
RESULTS: Although there were no significant differences in pain (P=0.471), swelling (P=0.322), or the occurrence of complications (P=0.206) between the two treatment groups, the surgical treatment group exhibited significantly better outcomes with regard to movement limitations (P=0.010), QOL (P=0.013), and radiological outcomes (P=0.017). Moreover, both duplex ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging showed greater improvements in clinical outcomes in the surgical excision group than in the sclerotherapy group.
CONCLUSIONS: Although several studies have examined IMVM treatment methods, no clear guidelines for treatment selection have been developed. Based on the results of this study, surgical excision is strongly encouraged for the treatment of IMVMs.

ABSTRACT
Liver dysfunction occurs in up to 3% of pregnancies and can be due to pregnancy-associated liver injury, exacerbation of pre-existing liver disease, or co-incident with pregnancy. The most common form of pregnancy-associated liver injury is intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP). This condition is typically benign and self-limited, but is associated with fetal morbidity and mortality with high levels of serum bile acids. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP) and the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (including pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets [HELLP] syndrome) are more commonly associated with maternal and fetal complications and may necessitate expedient delivery. Histologically, ICP shows nonspecific features of cholestasis, while AFLP and the hypertensive disorders have more characteristic histologic findings. While not a true liver disease, hyperemesis gravidarum can cause elevated liver enzymes. Pregnant patients are at increased risk of developing severe hepatitis E and herpesvirus infections, Budd-Chiari syndrome, and gallstones, and they may also experience worsening of known chronic liver disease. Mass lesions in pregnancy including hemangiomas, focal nodular hyperplasia, and hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas can present unique challenges for diagnosis and management. This review will explore the pathophysiology, presentation, histologic features, and management of these conditions.

ABSTRACT
INTRODUCTION: Little information about clinical presentation of mesenchymal tumors of the lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract due to their extreme heterogeneity is available for clinical management. Usually, small solitary asymptomatic polyps are accidently found during a screening colonoscopy performed for hematochezia, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, and bowel obstruction. In this case series, we illustrate our experience with mesenchymal tumors of the lower GI tract, which are a group of unusual and quite challenging lesions.
CASE PRESENTATION: We retrospectively collected mesenchymal tumors of the lower GI tract in our institution (Fondazione IRCSS Ca' Granda - Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico di Milano) during the last 10 years. We reviewed the histological slides, and, when necessary, we performed immunohistochemical analyses to better characterize the tumors. A total of 99 cases were identified: 45 GISTs, 42 lipomas, 4 leiomyomas, 3 Kaposi sarcomas, 1 schwannoma, 1 ganglioneuroma, 1 hemangioma, 1 inflammatory fibroid polyp, and 1 challenging case of spindle cell melanoma. We focused on the most rare entities excluding therefore all GISTs and lipomas from re-evaluation.
CONCLUSION: Mesenchymal tumors of the lower GI tract represent a highly heterogeneous group of lesions encompassing GISTs, lipomas, smooth muscle tumors (leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma), GI schwannomas, inflammatory fibroid polyps, solitary fibrous tumors, and other unusual spindle cell tumors. Immunohistochemistry and, in selected cases, molecular biology remain a useful tool which, in addition to a meticulous study of the morphology, helps the pathologist in the tangled jungle of differential diagnosis.

ABSTRACT
Spindle cell hemangioma (SCH), a non-neoplastic reactive vascular lesion, rarely locates in bones. We herein report a successful case of intralesional curettage for an infant with SCH of fibula. An 11-month-old boy was admitted to our center with a painless mass in the right proximal calf. Preoperative digital radiograph demonstrated a massive vascular lesion with an irregular bone destruction of proximal fibula. The lesion was removed via the intralesional curettage approach and pathologically diagnosed as SCH. The patient gained bone structure recovery of right proximal fibula. Two years after the surgery, he experienced no local recurrence. For the management of SCH of fibula with partial bone destruction, we suggest early-stage intralesional curettage as its safety and effectiveness.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Renal pelvic hemangioma (RPH) is often misdiagnosed as renal pelvis cancer (RPC) due to its similarity in presentation, and there are few reports on the imaging findings of RPH. This study is aimed at improving the understanding of imaging findings specific for RPH by a retrospective analysis of the imaging findings of RPH.
METHODS: RPH cases confirmed by pathology and with high-quality images were collected in the analysis. Nine cases of RPH were enrolled, of which 6 cases underwent ultrasound (US); 7 cases underwent computed tomography (CT), including 6 cases with an enhanced scan; and 2 cases underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including 1 case with an enhanced scan. All images of cases were analyzed and sorted independently by two senior attending radiologist blinded to the pathological results, according to the imaging indicators, such as the density and intensity on CT and MRI respectively. When the opinions between radiologists were inconsistent, images were re-evaluated together until a consensus was reached.
RESULTS: Nine cases of RPH were collected from 5 males and 4 females, aged 16-70 years old, with a median age of 41 years. Five cases were located in the left kidney and 4 cases were located in the right kidney. The clinical symptoms mostly presented with hematuria. Nine cases demonstrated solitary masses, with 4 cases with blurred margins and 5 cases with well-defined margins. The size of the mass was about 1.5-8.0 cm, and the median size was 2.5 cm. The US showed mostly hypoechoic masses and color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) showed minimal to no blood flow signal. Unenhanced CT scans showed mostly hypodensity and mostly mild continuous enhancement on an enhanced scan. The intensity of lesions was commonly heterogeneous on MRI due to hemorrhage and necrosis. One case showed mild continuous enhancement on an enhanced MRI scan.
CONCLUSIONS: The imaging findings of RPH commonly present as a focal lesion with blurred or well-defined margins, mild and continuous enhancement, and no cachexia of the clinical symptoms. RPH should be differentiated from malignant tumors of the renal pelvis for treatment.

ABSTRACT
As medical diagnosis and treatment level improved, patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) live longer and may develop conditions that need laparoscopic surgery. The safety of laparoscopy in patients with VPS continues to be challenged due to pneumoperitoneum. Here, we report a patient with medical history of VPS and hemangioma, diagnosed with ovarian borderline mucinous cystadenoma, received laparoscopic surgery in supine position and 10 mmHg pneumoperitoneum pressure, in which no clamping or externalizing catheter, no perioperative or postoperative complications. We also present a literature review and discuss the precautions needing considering during laparoscopy. For patients with VPS, laparoscopic surgery can be recognized as a potentially safe and feasible procedure.

ABSTRACT
Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia (ALHE) is an uncommon, benign inflammatory vasoproliferation. The literature is divided regarding whether it embodies a vascular neoplasm or a reactive process secondary to various stimuli. ALHE presents as solitary or clustered papules or nodules primarily on the head and neck, especially on or around the auricle. Histologically, ALHE is characterized by a proliferation of blood vessels lined by plump epithelioid endothelial cells and a prominent perivascular infiltrate rich in lymphocytes and eosinophils. ALHE follows a benign clinical course, yet treatment is challenging because of its high recurrence rate. We present the case of a 37-year-old Filipino man with lesions located on the central face. Kimura disease was considered due to his age, sex, and ethnicity; however, his clinical features-specifically, the presence of discrete papules and lack of lymphadenopathy-and his histological findings were consistent with ALHE. He reported trauma prior to the onset of the lesions, suggesting a reactive etiology.

ABSTRACT
Hepatic hemangiomas are benign liver tumors, and most of them progress asymptomatically. We report a case of hepatic hemangioma considered the cause of fever. A 53-year-old woman had a fever of 40°C for about 3 months without infection. Hepatic hemangiomas with internal bleeding of 10 cm in size on liver S8/7 and S3/2 were observed. These were resected laparoscopically for diagnostic treatment. She was afebrile after the operation. The pathological diagnosis was hematoma inside cavernous hemangioma. It should be noted that a bleeding hepatic hemangioma may cause fever of unknown origin and be indicated for resection.

ABSTRACT
Soft tissue vascular anomalies show a wide heterogeneity of clinical manifestations and imaging features. MR imaging has an important role in the diagnosis and management of vascular lesions of the head and neck. MR angiography is mandatory in cases of arteriovenous and combined malformations to assess the high-flow nature/component of the lesions and plan therapy. Infantile hemangiomas can be differentiated from congenital hemangiomas by clinical course. Reactive vascular tumors have nonspecific features similar to infantile hemangiomas. Locally malignant and malignant vascular tumors have irregular borders, infiltration of different tissue planes, and lower apparent diffusion coefficient values than benign vascular tumors.

ABSTRACT
Timolol, a non-selective β-adrenergic receptor blocker, is well-tolerated and is becoming increasingly popular in dermatology especially after its use in the management of infantile hemangiomas. Its effects are mainly due to vasoconstriction, inhibition of angiogenesis and keratinocyte migration promotion for re-epithelialization and wound healing. We review the evidence behind the use of timolol in several dermatological conditions including infantile hemangiomas, pyogenic granulomas, Kaposi's sarcoma, chronic wound healing, post-surgical wounds, acne vulgaris, rosacea, eczema and red scrotum syndrome.

ABSTRACT
Cystic liver lesions (CLL) are common and, in the majority of cases, benign. However, the range of differential diagnoses of CLL is wide. A combination of medical history, blood test results, and imaging can help find the correct diagnosis. We report the case of a 38-year-old immunocompromised female patient with a history of thymectomy and postoperative radiation 3 years prior due to thymoma. Subsequently, the patient was referred to our department for clarification of a cystic liver lesion. During short-term follow-up, the lesion increased in size, and due to the contrast agent behavior in the ultrasound and MRI examination, the suspicion of a biliary cystadenocarcinoma was considered.Furthermore, imaging showed several subcentimetric liver lesions of unknown dignity. Finally, pericystectomy and atypical partial liver resection was performed. Histology revealed a cystic metastasis of the malignant B3 thymoma and a cavernous hemangioma. Liver metastases of a thymoma are rare, and this is the first case of a cystic liver metastasis of a thymoma. The presented case illustrates that in the management of CLLs beside imaging techniques, the medical history with previous conditions should be considered, especially in past malignancies.

ABSTRACT
Composite hemangioendothelioma (CHE) is considered a borderline malignant vascular tumor defined by an admixture of distinct vascular neoplastic components. A 21-year-old female is presented herein with a 1 cm painless mandibular vestibular mass of less than a year duration. The infiltrating tumor was characterized by dilated vascular channels lined by endothelial cells with bland ovoid or round nuclei exhibiting, occasionally, hobnail/matchstick-like arrangement. Intravascular cell proliferations with hyaline globular deposits were also present. Additionally, lobular spindle and epithelioid cell aggregates, as well as slit-like spaces exhibiting a retiform or angiosarcomatous morphology were observed. Intracytoplasmic signet-ring or lipoblast-like vacuolization was also noted. Mitotic activity was exceptionally rare. Vascular spaces and the stroma featured lymphocytes and plasma cells. Neoplastic cells were positive for CD31, CD34, D2-40 and ERG, negative for CAMTA1 and synaptophysin, while type IV collagen highlighted the plasmalemma of most vessels and hyaline globules. Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed gene rearrangements in both YAP1 and MAML2 genes, in keeping with a YAP1-MAML2 fusion. Whole exome sequencing (WES) identified three missense mutations FLT1 [p.R1016G], PIK3CA [p.H1047L], and C11orf42 [p.A304P] and a mitochondrial frameshift insertion MT-ND4 [c.1107_1108insC; p.P370fs]. These WES results suggest that FLT1 and/or PIK3CA variants may contribute to tumor growth/transformation while the MT-ND4 variant may relate to proliferation, angiogenesis and/or inhibition of apoptosis.

ABSTRACT
Pericardial tumors are very rare. It can be primary or secondary, of which secondary tumors are more common. Pericardial hemangiomas are extremely rare primary neoplasms and there are only very few cases published in the literature. These patients can be asymptomatic. When symptomatic, they present with dyspnea, palpitation, or atypical chest pain. Severity of symptoms depends on the size and location of the tumor. Pericardial effusion with features of cardiac tamponade can lead to a life-threatening situation. Here, we report a case of pericardial hemangioma in a patient who presented with breathlessness and tamponade which was diagnosed preoperatively with computed tomography.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Maffucci's syndrome is characterized by the coexistence of multiple enchondromas and soft-tissue hemangiomas. It has been clear that somatic mosaic isocitrate dehydrogenase type 1 (IDH1) or isocitrate dehydrogenase type 2 (IDH2) mutations are associated with Maffucci's syndrome and Ollier disease, but the mechanisms underlying hemangiomas of the Maffucci's syndrome is still obscure. This study aimed to determine the mechanism of hemangiomas in Maffucci's syndrome.
METHODS: We received a 26-year-old female patient with typical Maffucci's syndrome, and exome sequencing was conducted using DNA from her peripheral blood and enchondroma tissues. Somatic mutations were characterized by a comparative analysis of exome sequences and further confirmed by the sequencing of PCR products derived from original blood and tissue samples. The mutations of an additional 69 patients with Ollier disease were further tested. The functional impacts of these somatic mutations on Maffucci's syndrome, especially the development of hemangiomas, were evaluated.
RESULTS: We reported a typical case of Maffucci's syndrome, which was confirmed by both imaging findings and pathology. Through exome sequencing of this patient's DNA samples, we identified an R132C mutation in the isocitrate dehydrogenase type 1 (IDH1) gene and an L309I mutation in the ELKS/RAB6-interacting/CAST family member 2 (ERC2) gene in this patient. Approximately 33.3% of the clones were positive for the IDH1 R132C mutation, and 19.0% of the clones were positive for the ECR2 L309I mutation. The IDH1 R132C mutation was detected in most of the patients with Ollier disease (51/69 patients), and the mean frequency of this mutation was 63.3% in total sequence readouts, but the ECR2 L309I mutation was absent in all of the patients with Ollier disease. In vitro experiments confirmed that the IDH1 R132C mutation promotes chondrocyte proliferation, and the ERC2 L309I mutation enhances angiogenesis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that while IDH1 is a known pathogenic gene in enchondromatosis, ERC2 is a novel gene identified in Maffucci's syndrome. The somatic L309I mutation of ERC2 contributes to the pathogenesis of hypervascularization to facilitate the development of hemangiomas in Maffucci's syndrome. The combination of the IDH1 R132C and ERC2 L309I mutations contributes to the development of Maffucci's syndrome, and these results may enable further research on the pathogenesis of Maffucci's syndrome.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: When Echinococcus multilocularis infects humans as a false intermediate host, alveolar echinococcosis (AE) usually manifests primarily intrahepatically and is initially asymptomatic. If the disease remains undiagnosed and untreated, progressive growth occurs, reminiscent of malignant tumours. The only curative therapy is complete resection, which is limited to localised stages, and palliative drug therapy is used otherwise. Consequently, early diagnosis and reliable detection of AE lesions are important. For this reason, abdominal ultrasonography, as the most common primary imaging for AE, relies on classification systems.
AIM: To investigate how hepatic AE lesion sonomorphology changes over time in the Echinococcosis Multilocularis Ulm Classification (EMUC)-ultrasound (US) classification.
METHODS: Based on data from Germany's national echinococcosis database, we evaluated clinical and US imaging data for 59 patients according to the AE case definition in our preliminary retrospective longitudinal study. There had to be at least two liver sonographies ≥ 6 mo apart, ≥ 1 hepatic AE lesion, and complete documentation in all US examinations. The minimum interval between two separately evaluated US examinations was 4 wk. The AE reference lesion was the largest hepatic AE lesion at the time of the first US examination. To classify the sonomorphologic pattern, we used EMUC-US. In addition to classifying the findings of the original US examiner, all reference lesions at each examination time point were assigned EMUC-US patterns in a blinded fashion by two investigators experienced in US diagnosis. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, United Stated). P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: The preliminary study included 59 patients, 38 (64.5%) women and 21 (35.6%) men. The mean age at initial diagnosis was 59.9 ± 16.9 years. At the time of initial ultrasonography, a hailstorm pattern was present in 42.4% (25/59) of cases, a hemangioma-like pattern in 16.9% (10/59), a pseudocystic pattern in 15.3% (9/59), and a metastasis-like pattern in 25.4% (15/59). For the hailstorm pattern, the average lesion size was 67.4 ± 26.3 mm. The average lesion size was 113.7 ± 40.8 mm with the pseudocystic pattern and 83.5 ± 27.3 mm with the hemangioma-like pattern. An average lesion size of 21.7 ± 11.0 mm was determined for the metastasis-like pattern. Although the sonomorphologic pattern remained unchanged in 84.7% (50/59) of AE reference lesions, 15.3% (9/59) showed a change over time. A change in pattern was seen exclusively for AE lesions initially classified as hemangioma-like or pseudocystic. A total of 70% (7/10) of AE lesions initially classified as hemangioma-like showed a relevant change in pattern over time, and 85.7% (6/7) of these were secondarily classified as having a hailstorm pattern, with the remainder (1/7; 14.3%) classified as having a pseudocystic pattern. A total of 22.2% (2/9) of AE lesions initially classified as pseudocystic showed a relevant change in pattern over time and were classified as having a hailstorm pattern. For AE lesions initially classified as having a hailstorm or metastatic pattern, no pattern change was evident. All patients with pattern change were on continuous drug therapy with albendazole.
CONCLUSION: The sonomorphology of hepatic AE lesions may change over time. The hemangioma-like and pseudocystic patterns are affected.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Choriocarcinoma is a subtype of gestational trophoblastic disease, gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. Patients with brain metastasis are rare and information on the optimal treatment and patient outcome is limited. In order to improve the prognosis of this disease, accurate and timely treatments are very important for the patient of brain metastasis by choriocarcinoma.
CASE SUMMARY: A 17-year-old unmarried girl was misdiagnosed with a cerebral hemangioma with intracranial hemorrhage in a local hospital after presentation with severe head pain. She underwent craniotomy three times for treatment. The pathological results of posterior intracranial hematoma showed choriocarcinoma, and the patient was diagnosed as choriocarcinoma (21 points in stage IV). After uterine artery embolization, etoposide, methotrexate, actinomycin D, cyclophosphamide, and vincristine chemotherapy for 7 cycles, and whole brain radiotherapy, the patient achieved remission. She has been followed for 2 years with no signs of tumor recurrence.
CONCLUSION: For female patients of childbearing age with an intracranial hematoma, the possibility of brain metastasis by choriocarcinoma should be considered. It is necessary to obtain a detailed history, including menstruation, beginning age of first sex, contraception, etc. The level of β-human chorionic gonadotropin should be tested at the beginning, and a stratified treatment should be administered according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging and World Health Organization prognostic scoring systems.

ABSTRACT
PURPOSE: Assessment of the clinical effectiveness and safety of 755-nm long-pulse alexandrite laser combined with 0.5% timolol maleate eye drops in treating thicker infantile hemangioma (IH).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of IH treated with 755-nm long-pulse alexandrite laser and topical timolol in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University from October 2019 to October 2020. Seventy-eight cases were included, with a five-week laser treatment interval. Treatment status was documented during the 35 weeks before each treatment, the effect was assessed at the visual analog scale (VAS), and side effects were recorded. During the 6-month follow-up period, the recurrence and residual skin lesions were monitored. The relationship between IH thickness, treatment duration and VAS was analyzed.
RESULTS: Among the 78 children with hemangioma, 4 children were treated with a combination of propranolol, fractional laser and cinnamyl alcohol injection due to poor curative effect. Finally, the lesions were effectively alleviated. At the 5th, 15th, 25th, and 35th weeks of treatment, the average VAS of 74 children were 3.56 ± 1.20, 4.61 ± 1.43, 5.63 ± 1.60, and 6.63 ± 1.72, respectively. We analyzed VAS in different thickness groups with Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance(RMANOVA). The results show that the VAS of the thickness 2-3 mm and 3-5mm groups were higher than the 5-7mm and 7-8mm groups (F group = 440.54, P <0.05, F time = 448.31, P <0.05). During the 6-month follow-up period, none of the 74 children relapsed and the residual skin lesions gradually vanished.
CONCLUSION: Combined treatment of IHs with a 755-nm long-pulse alexandrite laser and 0.5% timolol maleate eye drops which has apparent clinical efficacy and safety reduce residual skin lesions and decrease the IH recurrence rate.

ABSTRACT
Introduction: Ultrasound is used commonly to detect and diagnose intra-abdominal and pelvic cystic masses in the newborn as it is easily available, relatively low cost, and non-invasive. Discussion: The diagnosis can be made or narrowed down by determining the location, size, sonographic features, organ involvement, and internal vascularity. The differential diagnoses include hydronephrosis, multicystic dysplastic kidney, adrenal haemorrhage, cystic teratomas, ovarian cysts, enteric cysts, meconium cysts, and liver haemangiomas. With the appropriate radiological knowledge, the ultrasound practitioner can help obtain an accurate diagnosis. Conclusion: This pictorial essay will familiarise the reader with the different common causes of intra-abdominal and pelvic masses detected on ultrasound through a wide range of conditions. The role of ultrasound in the evaluation of these conditions will be discussed and alternative imaging correlates will be offered.

ABSTRACT
Pulmonary sclerosing pneumocytoma is a rare benign neoplasm of the lung, commonly occurs in middle-aged persons with a marked female predominance. Earlier, it was known as sclerosing hemangioma. Here, we present a case of pulmonary sclerosing pneumocytoma which was diagnosed as carcinoid of the lung, based on imaging, in a 14-year-old female. Besides radiology, the uniqueness of this case lies in the young age (14 years) of the patient. She was presented with a 3.3 × 2.5 × 2.2 cm soft tissue density mass with a tiny speck of calcification in the anterior basal segment of the lower lobe of the right lung. Based on imaging findings on fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) scan and DOTANOC scan, a diagnosis of carcinoid was made. We performed a video-assisted thoracoscopic right lower lobectomy. Histopathological examination showed features of pulmonary sclerosing pneumocytoma. Surgery is an established method of treatment for pulmonary sclerosing pneumocytoma. Enucleation, lobectomy, sleeve resection are possible treatment options. To define the role of adjuvant therapy, further direct evidence is required. The metastatic potential of this disease is yet to be established.

ABSTRACT
Hemangiomas are benign proliferations of blood vessels, and urethral hemangiomas are extremely rare presentations of this condition. As the condition is quite rare, there is very little literature about best management strategies. The best resources for determining management are case reports which focus on treatment via transurethral ablation or endoscopic resection. However, there is no guidance on management of urethral hemangiomas which are refractory to these minimally invasive methods. Herein, we summarize the literature for urethral hemangioma management, present the case of a male presenting with refractory hematuria due to a hemangioma in the penile urethra, and describe the operative technique for the open excision and reconstruction of this hemangioma.

ABSTRACT
Background: Simultaneous resection of bone tumors in the fronto-naso-orbital region is a great challenge due to the need for adequate reconstruction of the facial skeleton. Pre-operative virtual planning of resection margins and the simultaneous fabrication of the cranioplasty using computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology could allow combining the tumor resection and cosmetic restoration steps into a single procedure. Methods: We present five consecutive cases of patients with bone tumors of the fronto-naso-orbital region. The indications for surgery included: (1) the presence of a major cosmetic defect; (2) progressive tumor growth. The histological examination revealed vascular malformation, hemangioma, and fibrous dysplasia in two cases. Tumor resection was performed with the help of a drilling template in form of a tumor. The computer-designed cranioplasty formed based on the non-involved side of the skull of the patient was manufactured. In one patient, the reconstruction was performed using two separate implants. Results: The position of the implant fits in with pre-operative planning in two cases; in those cases, the additional trimming of the implant or bone defect was required. Good cosmetic outcomes were noted in all patients, and no complications occurred. No repeat surgery was necessary. The template has proved to have high application potential. Conclusion: Simultaneous resection and CAD/CAM cranioplasty in the case of bone tumors in the fronto-orbital region is a promising technique with the aim of minimizing operation time and achieving a good esthetic outcome.

ABSTRACT
The Notch signaling pathway is crucial in both adipogenesis and tumor development. It serves a vital role in the development and stability of blood vessels and may be involved in the proliferative phase of infantile hemangiomas, which express various related receptors. Therefore, it was hypothesized that the Notch signaling pathway inhibitor N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT), a γ-secretase inhibitor, might help accelerate the regression of infantile hemangiomas. The present in vitro study evaluated whether inhibition of the Notch signaling pathway using DAPT could alter adipogenesis in hemangioma stem cells (HemSCs) derived from infantile hemangioma (IH) specimens. A total of 20 infants (age, ≤6 months) with hemangiomas who had not yet received any treatment were selected, and their discarded hemangioma tissues were obtained. HemSCs were isolated from the fresh, sterile IH specimens and treated with DAPT. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting were used to demonstrate the inhibition of the Notch signaling pathway by DAPT. A proliferation assay (Cell Counting Kit-8), oil red O staining, flow cytometry and a transwell assay were used to detect proliferation, adipogenesis, apoptosis and migration of HemSCs. Treatment with DAPT upregulated the expression levels of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) α, C/EBPβ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, adiponectin and insulin-like growth factor 1, and promoted the proliferation, apoptosis, migration and lipid accumulation in HemSCs in vitro. Targeting the Notch signaling pathway using DAPT may potentially accelerate the regression of infantile hemangiomas.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND Sclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation (SANT) of the spleen is a rare benign disease of the splenic red pulp of unknown etiology. Definite diagnosis is made on histopathology alone as it has no diagnostic radiologic characteristics. CASE REPORT We present a case of a large incidental splenic mass in a middle-aged man, whose refractory anemia resolved with splenectomy. Our initial imaging studies failed to differentiate this lesion from other splenic lesions like hamartoma and haemangioma. To the best of our knowledge, no SANT cases in the literature have been investigated with red cell scan, as performed in our patient, nor has any case had resolved anemia after treatment. Splenectomy was offered as malignancy could not be safely excluded. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of SANT. The patient made good recovery and had no signs of recurrence 2 years later. CONCLUSIONS SANT of the spleen is a rare condition that can mimic many other splenic tumors and poses diagnostic challenge when histopathology is unavailable. Our case adds to the number of SANT reported in literature in the hope of elucidating the pathophysiology of this rare condition.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (HEH) is a rare tumor type. No effective medicine or standard treatment for HEH has been established.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: From March 2014 to April 2021, 62 patients with pathologically diagnosed HEH were observed regularly, and interferon-alpha 2b (IFN-a 2b) was administered to patients with progressive disease or reoccurrence. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed and recorded, and a tumor assessment scan was performed every 3 months.
RESULTS: A total of 42 patients with HEH received IFN-a 2b treatment in this study. No severe (grade ≥3) AEs were reported in the group overall. The most common treatment-related AEs in patients receiving IFN-a 2b were fever (50.0%) and fatigue (21.4%). Partial response and complete response were achieved in 20 patients (47.6%) and 2 patients (4.8%), respectively, and the objective response rate was 52.4%. Stable disease was observed in 12 patients (28.6%), and the disease control rate was 81.0%. Progressive disease was observed in 8 patients (19.0%). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year progression-free survival rates were 81.0%, 69.2%, and 62.3%, respectively. Only 1 patient died as a result of disease progression during the study. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 100%, 97.2%, and 97.2%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: IFN-a 2b is a safe and effective treatment for patients with HEH. The encouraging results with IFN-a 2b use make it a promising option for patients who have other types of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma; additional clinical trials are needed.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: The Compound Danshen Dripping Pills have been widely used in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy (DR), but there is a lack of systematic review of reports on this topic. To explore the efficacy of Compound Danshen Dripping Pills combined with western medicine in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy, we conducted a meta-analysis.
METHODS: Randomized controlled trials published in the Chinese Medical Literature Database (CBM), Embase, PubMed, and Medline databases from January 2010 to August 2021 were searched. After screening the qualified literature, literature quality was evaluated by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Meta-analysis was performed on outcome measures including effective rate, visual field gray value, hemangioma volume, hemorrhagic plaque area, and visual acuity after diabetic retinopathy treatment with Compound Danshen Dripping Pills using Revman 5.3 analysis software to comprehensively evaluate the utility of Compound Danshen Dripping Pills.
RESULTS: A total of 167 documents were preliminarily searched, and 8 studies involving 524 patients were included for meta-analysis. Meta-analysis showed that the statistical value of the effective rate of diabetic retinopathy treatment in the intervention group and control group was OR =5.00, 95% CI: 2.84, 8.83, P<0.0001. The statistical value of visual field gray value comparison was MD =-0.93, 95% CI: -0.98, -0.89, P<0.00001. The statistical value of hemangioma volume was MD =-3.16, 95% CI: -3.48, -2.84, P<0.00001. The statistical value of hemorrhagic plaque area comparison was MD =-0.65, 95% CI: -0.97, -0.32, P<0.0001. The statistical value of visual acuity comparison was MD =0.15, 95% CI: 0.10, 0.19, P<0.00001.
DISCUSSION: The Compound Danshen Dripping Pills combined with western medicine are effective and safe in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy.

ABSTRACT
Epitheloid hemangioendothelioma is a very rare tumor, with a variable presentation and unpredictable clinical behavior. The etiology and the triggering risk factors have not been specified. Unlike other primary liver tumors, it does not arise in the background of chronic liver disease. The approach is challenging due to the spectrum of possibilities and the need for immunohistochemistry to establish the definitive diagnosis. The information available so far is limited due to the few published cases, this favors that the therapeutic options are few or that there is insufficient evidence to standardize them when the lesion is not resectable.

ABSTRACT
Objective: To improve the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (P-EHE). Methods: Sixteen patients diagnosed with P-EHE in Fuzhou Pulmonary Hospital of Fujian Province from January 2009 to July 2020 were collected. Their gender, age, imaging findings, pathological characteristics, treatment protocols, survival and other clinical data were summarized and analyzed. Results: The ratio of male to female among the 16 patients was 1∶1; and the average age of onset was 47.75 years. Most cases of PEHE (9/16) were found by physical examination, while some cases developed respiratory symptoms such as cough, sputum, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, chest pain, etc. (7/16). In most patients the lesions were localized to the lungs (11/16), while bone metastasis (1/16), lymph node metastasis (1/16), and pleural metastasis (4/16) also occurred. The pathological tissues were obtained mainly through surgical thoracoscopy. Chest CT images showed multiple nodules in both lungs, with most of the nodules less than 2.0 cm in diameter, and calcifications were seen, while solitary nodules and masses were rare, and pleural metastases could be manifested as pleural thickening and pleural effusion. The pathological findings were well-defined eosinophilic nodules with irregularly arranged nest-like structures. Those eosinophilic nodules had few central cells and abundant peripheral cells, which extended into the alveolar cavity like papillae. The tumor cells were epithelioid with small atypia, and vacuoles and red blood cells could be seen in the cytoplasm of individual tumor cells. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive to CD34, CD31, Factor Ⅷ andvimentin (VIM). Follow-up of 0.5 to 11 years showed that four patients died, two lost to follow-up, and the rest of the patients were in good condition, with a median overall survival (OS) of 4.58 years. Conclusions: PEHE is a rare low-grade lung tumor with no specific clinical manifestations. It can be diagnosed with chest imaging and pathological immunohistochemistry. Moreover, there is currently no standard treatment for PEHE, and most patients have a good prognosis.

ABSTRACT
The off-label use of imiquimod (IQ) for hemangioma treatment has shown clinical benefits. We have previously reported a selective direct IQ-cytotoxic effect on transformed (H5V) vs. normal (1G11) endothelial cells (EC). In the present study, we investigated the mechanism underlying this selective cytotoxicity in terms of TLR7/8 receptor expression, NF-κB signalling and time-dependent modifications of oxidative stress parameters (ROS: reactive oxygen species, catalase and superoxide dismutase activities, GSH/GSSG and lipid peroxidation). TLR7/8 level was extremely low in both cell lines, and IQ did not upregulate TLR7/8 expression or activate NF-κB signalling. IQ significantly induced ROS in H5V after 2 h and strongly affected antioxidant defenses. After 12 h, enzyme activities were restored to baseline levels but a robust drop in GSH/GSSG persisted together with increased lipid peroxidation levels and a marked mitochondrial dysfunction. Although in normal IQ-treated EC some oxidative stress parameters were affected after 4 h, mitochondrial health and GSH/GSSG ratio remained notably unaffected after 12 h. Therefore, the early alterations (0-2 h) in transformed EC breached redox homeostasis as strongly as to enhance their susceptibility to IQ. This interesting facet of IQ as redox disruptor could broaden its therapeutic potential for other skin malignancies, alone or in adjuvant schemes.

ABSTRACT
Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma is a rare malignant vascular neoplasm caused by the proliferation of neoplastic endothelial cells. Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma may develop in any organ, but it is commonly observed in the extremities. The tongue is a very unusual location for epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. A 55-year-old male patient presented to the outpatient head and neck clinic with lumps in the tongue, pain, and limitation of motion. The polypoid mass detected in the anterior midline of the tongue was excised. Microscopically, the tumor cells included slightly pleomorphic oval or round vesicular nuclei with an eosinophilic cytoplasm that variably contained vacuoles. There were 4 mitoses per 10 high power fields and there was no necrosis. In immunohistochemical study, the tumor cells were positively stained with CD31 and CD34 whereas they were negatively stained with TFE3, SMA, S-100, HHV-8 and EMA. The patient was diagnosed with "epitheloid hemangioendothelioma". Only ten cases have been reported in the tongue in the literature. Our case was the eleventh case, and we aimed to report this case as a rare entity with an unusual location.

ABSTRACT
Epithelioid hemangioma (EH) is a benign vascular lesion, typically consisting of small vascular channels lined by epithelioid endothelial cells and associated with a dense lymphocytic infiltrate with eosinophils. Here, we report a rare case of EH involving large arteries. The patient presented with a 9-month history of an asymptomatic nodule on the forehead, which was thought to be an epidermal inclusion cyst. Skin biopsy revealed large arteries with clusters of epithelioid cells in the vascular walls and lumen. Scattered eosinophils were noted in the walls. Adjacent areas showed groups of small-caliber vessels lined by prominent endothelial cells and associated with a dense lymphoid infiltrate with eosinophils. No significant cytologic atypia was noted. Given the presence of the classic small-vessel involvement, along with CD31 reactivity for the epithelioid cells in the large vessels, the findings are classified as EH involving large arteries, which is an uncommon subtype. There have only been a handful of such cases reported in the literature.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Infantile hemangiomas (IHs) are the most common childhood benign tumors, showing distinctive progression characteristics and outcomes. Due to the high demand for aesthetics among parents of IH babies, early intervention is critical in some cases. β-Adrenergic blockers and corticosteroids are first-line medications for IHs, while itraconazole, an antifungal medicine, has shown positive results in recent years.
CASE SUMMARY: In the present study, itraconazole was applied to treat two IH cases. The therapeutic course lasted 80-90 d, during which the visible lesion faded by more than 90%. Moreover, no obvious side effects were reported, and the compliance of the baby and parents was desirable.
CONCLUSION: Although these outcomes further support itraconazole as an effective therapeutic choice for IHs, large-scale clinical and basic studies are still warranted to improve further treatment.

ABSTRACT
We report a 43-year-old female who presented with recurrent non-massive hemoptysis for four months. Chest radiograph was normal. Thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 0.8-centimeter intraluminal polypoid mass abutting the middle part of trachea. A fiber-optic bronchoscopy demonstrated a lobulated reddish mass at dorsolateral aspect of the right side of tracheal wall. Cryotherapy to remove the mass and argon plasma coagulation to stop bleeding at the stump was performed. The histological evaluation conﬁrmed the diagnosis of a tracheal lobular capillary hemangioma. There was no recurrence hemoptysis nor the recurrence of tumor during a one-year follow-up.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Pure epidural spinal cavernous hemangiomas (SCH) account for only 4% of all spinal epidural lesions. Our literature review identified 61 publications reporting on, a total of 175 cases in the magnetic resonance imaging era. Here, we reviewed those cases, and have added our case of what appeared to be a multifocal SCH.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 72-year-old male presented with a progressive paraparesis attributed to a T5/T6 dorsolateral extradural mass extending into the right T5/6 foramen. Surgical excision documented the lesion, histologically, was a SCH. A second similar lesion was noted involving the left C7/T1 foramen; as the patient was asymptomatic from this lesion, and no additional biopsy was performed. The patient returned to normal neurological function within 2 months postoperatively.
CONCLUSIONS: Here, a 72-year-old male presented with a pathologically confirmed T5/T6 epidural SCH and a secondary C7/T1 foraminal lesion suspected to represent a secondary focus of an epidural SCH.

ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the role of CD161+CD4+ T cells in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.
METHODS: A total of 94 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), 73 with liver cirrhosis (LC) and 28 healthy controls were enrolled to determine frequency, cytokine production and chemokine receptor expression of circulating CD161+CD4+ T cells. Among these, 50 CHB and 34 LC patients were followed up for a period of 52-week entecavir monotherapy to assess the association of CD161+CD4+ T cells with seroconversion of HBV e antigen (HBeAg). In addition, 15 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 15 with hepatic haemangioma (HHA) were enrolled to compare the paired circulating and intrahepatic CD161+CD4+ T cells.
RESULTS: CD161+CD4+ T cells were found to accumulate in the circulation of HBV cohorts, which showed a significant correlation with the clinical parameters of disease progression. In addition, higher numbers of circulating CD161+CD4+ T cells were associated with an improved serological response of HBeAg to antiviral treatment. Moreover, CD161+CD4+ T cells as compared to homologous CD161-CD4+ T cells produced more pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-17 and interferon (IFN)-γ and expressed higher levels of liver-homing chemokine receptors including CCR6, CXCR6 and CX3CR1. Notably, a significant enrichment of CD161+CD4+ T cell subsets co-expressing IFN-γ and IL-17 was observed in HBV-associated cirrhotic livers. During in vitro co-cultures, circulating CD161+CD4+ T cells in the chronic HBV setting exhibited prominent pro-fibrogenic effects by regulating primary hepatic stellate cells through a regenerative IFN-γ/IL-23/IL-17 axis.
CONCLUSIONS: In chronic HBV infection, CD161+CD4+ T cells play antiviral, pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrogenic roles.

ABSTRACT
PURPOSE: Infantile hemangioma (IH) is the most common benign tumor in infancy, and superficial IH is the most common type. IH can reportedly resolve spontaneously, but this is associated with complications, such as scars, atrophy, hypopigmentation, telangiectasia, and skin sagging, in 70% of cases. This study explores the safety and feasibility of therapeutic intervention with the 595-nm pulsed-dye laser (PDL) combined with 0.5% timolol maleate solution in superficial IH and compares the difference in efficacy between the early group and the late group.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study examined 167 patients with superficial IH who underwent combination therapy at the Dermatology Clinic of the Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University between July 2019 and July 2020. The early and late groups were composed of children aged ≤2 and >2 months, respectively. Treatment was administered for 6 months, and patients were followed up for another 6 months. Two independent, double-blinded physicians reviewed photographs of the skin lesions before and after treatment to evaluate efficacy.
RESULTS: The early group demonstrated higher treatment efficacy than the late group. The early (n = 45) and late (n = 122) groups had treatment efficacy rates of 95.5% and 86.1%, respectively; the difference was statistically significant (P< 0.05). The early and late groups underwent 3.51 ± 0.50 and 4.73 ± 0.68 months of treatment, respectively; the difference was statistically significant (P< 0.05). Seventeen (44.4%) patients in the early group had immediate adverse reactions but no permanent sequelae, whereas 25 (20.49%) and 13 (10.7%) patients in the late group had immediate and permanent sequelae, respectively. The difference was statistically significant (P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: This retrospective study demonstrated that 595-nm PDL combined with 0.5% timolol maleate solution was a safe and effective local treatment for superficial IH. Early treatment required fewer treatments, had better curative effects, and a lower probability of permanent sequelae.

ABSTRACT
INTRODUCTION: Hemangioblastomas (HMB) are extensively vascularized and benign neoplasms that are diagnosed predominantly in adults. The solid type of HMB is technically challenging to operate. The piecemeal resection of the tumor has been shown to have devastating intraoperative complications. Therefore, en-bloc tumor resection was shown to be the safest procedure to reduce the risk of intraoperative bleeding and facilitate the removal of large solid tumors. Unfortunately, most of these tumours are also not amenable for embolization, as they are fed by multiple pial vessels. However, the large arterial feeders may be embolized.
OBJECTIVE: This video abstract presents a case of en-bloc resection of a giant solid type of Vermian HMB.
SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: A 38-year-old male patient presented with headache and vomiting for 1 year, imbalance during walking for 6 months, and hoarseness of voice for 2 months. He underwent a CSF diversion procedure in another hospital and was referred to our center for definitive surgery. Contrast-enhanced MRI showed a large heterogeneously enhancing solid lesion of size 46 × 33 × 40 mm3 with central necrotic area in the posterior fossa with perilesional edema and several large flow voids on T2-MR sequence. Preoperative embolization was performed; however, there was no significant reduction in the vascularity of the lesion. The patient underwent a wide midline suboccipital craniotomy with C1 laminectomy and gross total en-bloc resection of HMB.
RESULTS: The patient had an uneventful recovery in the postoperative period.
CONCLUSIONS: The safest approach in the resection of giant solid HMB involves proper preoperative planning and understanding the vascular pattern of the lesion, wide exposure, circumferential dissection, and the en-bloc delivery of the tumor.

ABSTRACT
This study aimed to analyze the role of the FcepsilonRI (FcεRI) signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of benign lymphoepithelial lesion of lacrimal gland (LGBLEL). Transcriptomic analysis was performed on LGBLEL and orbital cavernous hemangioma (CH) patients diagnosed via histopathology in Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, between July 2010 and October 2013. Four LGBLEL and three orbital CH patients, diagnosed between October 2018 and August 2019, were randomly selected as experimental and control groups, respectively. RT-PCR, immunohistochemical staining, and western blotting were used to verify genes and proteins related to the FcεRI signaling pathway. Transcriptomic analysis showed that the FcεRI signaling pathway was upregulated in the LGBLEL compared with the CH group. The mRNA expression levels of important genes including SYK, p38, JNK, PI3K, and ERK were significantly increased in the LGBLEL group (P = 0.0066, P = 0.0002, P = 0.0003, P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001, respectively). Immunohistochemical staining results showed that SYK, p38, and ERK were positively expressed in LGBLEL, while JNK and PI3K were not. The protein contents of P-SYK, P-p38, P-JNK, P-PI3K, and P-ERK were significantly higher in the LGBLEL than in the CH group (P = 0.0169, P = 0.0074, P = 0.0046, P = 0.0157, P = 0.0156, respectively). The FcεRI signaling pathway participates in the pathogenesis of LGBLEL.

ABSTRACT
Verrucous venous malformations (VVM) are rare, congenital, slow-flow vascular anomalies that have been historically difficult to characterize due to clinical mimics and unclear histological evaluation. A life-threatening complication of VVMs is localized intravascular coagulation. Herein, we describe a male neonate who presented with a congenital VVM on the left lower extremity with associated severe thrombocytopenia. We discuss the multifaceted diagnostic approach used to identify this VVM, while highlighting the use of WT-1 as a negative predictive marker; we additionally outline novel treatment options and management beyond cutaneous involvement.

ABSTRACT
INTRODUCTION: Cavernous malformations in the pediatric population are exceedingly rare, especially in infants. Giant cavernous malformations (GCM) are even more rare and have a diameter >4 cm. The onset of symptoms predominantly occurs in adulthood, but the rate of hemorrhage is significantly higher in the pediatric population. Similar to non-GCM, GCM can be misidentified as tumors on imaging due to their tumefactive pattern with edema. Here, we present a rare case of a right frontotemporal GCM in a 2-month-old girl, the youngest recorded case in the existing literature.
CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy 2-month-old girl presented to the emergency department following an increasing frequency of seizure-like activity that began 3 days prior to presentation. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain with and without contrast characterized a large (5.8 × 4.3 × 4.2 cm) heterogeneous lesion of the right temporal lobe with diffuse scattered blood products of various ages seen throughout the lesion. She underwent a right-sided craniotomy where a gross total excision was achieved. Pathology confirmed the diagnoses of a GCM. The patient's seizures subsequently resolved, and she continues to do well postoperatively.
DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: GCM can be mistaken for tumors due to their large size, cystic nature, and surrounding edema, but a vascular lesion should always remain in the differential diagnosis before operating, even in infants. Surgery is generally recommended in patients that present with a symptomatic hemorrhage, recurrent hemorrhages, persistent seizures despite medical management, or progressively worsening neurological deficits if the GCM is in a safe location. It has been shown that 70-99% of patients undergoing surgery with successful removal of the GCM can achieve seizure freedom 2 years postoperatively. Complete surgical excision of this infant's GCM was successful in treating her neurologic symptoms; therefore, pathological confirmation of this lesion is critical and should prompt a complete surgical excision.

ABSTRACT
IMPORTANCE: Propranolol for infantile hemangiomas (IH) has been shown to be effective and relatively safe. However, other less lipophilic β-blockers, such as nadolol, may be preferable in individuals who experience propranolol unresponsiveness or adverse events.
OBJECTIVE: To document the noninferiority and safety of oral nadolol compared with oral propranolol in infants with IH.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This double-blind noninferiority prospective study with a noninferiority margin of 10% compared propranolol with nadolol in infants aged 1 to 6 months with problematic IH. The study was conducted in 2 academic pediatric dermatology centers in Canada between 2016 and 2020. Infants aged 1 to 6 months with a hemangioma greater than 1.5 cm on the face or 3 cm or greater on another body part causing or with potential to cause functional impairment or cosmetic disfigurement.
INTERVENTIONS: Oral propranolol and nadolol in escalating doses up to 2 mg/kg/d.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURE: Between-group differences comparing changes in the bulk (size and extent) and color of the IH at week 24 with baseline using a 100-mm visual analog scale.
RESULTS: The study included 71 patients. Of these, 36 were treated with propranolol. The mean (SD) age in this group was 3.1 (1.4) months, and 31 individuals (86%) were female. Thirty-five infants were treated with nadolol. The mean (SD) age in this group was 3.2 (1.6) months, and 26 individuals (74%) were female. The difference in IH between groups by t test was 8.8 (95% CI, 2.7-14.9) for size and 17.1 (95% CI, 7.2-30.0) for color in favor of the nadolol group, demonstrating that nadolol was noninferior to propranolol. Similar differences were noted at 52 weeks: 6.0 (95% CI, 1.9-10.1) and 10.1 (95% CI, 2.9-17.4) for size and color improvement, respectively. For each doubling of time unit (week), the coefficient of involution was 2.4 (95% CI, 0.5-4.4) higher with nadolol compared with propranolol. Safety data were similar between the 2 interventions.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Oral nadolol was noninferior to oral propranolol, indicating it may be an efficacious and safe alternative in cases of propranolol unresponsiveness or adverse events, or when faster involution is required.

ABSTRACT
Background: Angiosarcomas are a broad category of vascular origin neoplasms that are poorly characterized in veterinary species. Lymphangiosarcoma (LAS) is an uncommon type of angiosarcoma reported in humans and canines arising from lymphatic endothelium. LAS can be differentiated from other angiosarcomas in dogs based on expression of Prospero-related homeobox gene-1 (PROX-1) or lymphatic vessel endothelial receptor-1 (LYVE-1). Composite hemangioendothelioma (CHE) is a rare angiosarcoma subtype described in people and characterized by a variable biologic behavior and infrequent metastasis. This variant of angiosarcoma histologically combines features of retiform hemangioendothelioma and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. Information regarding the cytologic and histopathologic appearance and clinical course of dogs with vascular tumors that exhibit features of CHE are unknown. Here, we report a case of pleomorphic LAS with features of CHE arising in a dog and treated with surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. Case presentation: A 10-year-old intact male Labrador retriever presented with an approximately 6-cm-diameter cutaneous mass caudal to the left elbow that was progressively growing over 1.5 years. On physical examination, palpable extensions were identified coursing proximally over the triceps with concurrent loco-regional peripheral lymphadenopathy. Fine needle aspirates (FNA) and cytologic assessment of the cutaneous mass, left prescapular, and accessory axillary lymph nodes reported that this appeared to be a metastatic epithelial neoplasm, although a mixed carcinoma or collision tumor could not be excluded. An incisional biopsy of the mass was submitted for histopathology and was consistent with a well-differentiated angiosarcoma with features of CHE. The neoplasm expressed vimentin, CD31, von Willebrand factor (vWf), and PROX-1, supporting the diagnosis of LAS. Complete staging was performed, and no additional metastatic lesions were identified. Left forelimb amputation and lymph node removal were performed. Based on the diagnosis of metastatic LAS, doxorubicin chemotherapy was administered. 7 months post-amputation, the tumor recurred at the amputation site without evidence of metastatic disease. Conclusion: This report describes a malignant, locally aggressive lymphatic origin vascular tumor in a dog, with features consistent with descriptions of CHE in humans. Cytologic features in this case were discordant with its true mesenchymal etiology, obfuscating diagnosis. The morphologic features of the mesenchymal neoplastic population and immunohistochemistry (IHC) labeling ultimately supported a diagnosis of pleomorphic LAS with features of CHE.

ABSTRACT
Objective: To explore the feasibility of navigation-guided nasal endoscopy for removal of the cavernous hemangioma of the orbital apex through the sphenoid approach. Methods: Retrospective case series study. From May 2012 to December 2019, 12 patients (12 eyes) with imaging findings of cavernous hemangioma in the orbital apex were collected at the Eye Hospital Affiliated to Nanchang University, including 3 males and 9 females aged 32 to 59 years. All patients underwent navigation-guided sinusoscopy through the sphenoid approach to remove the cavernous hemangioma of the orbital apex (video attached). Changes of visual function and complications after operation were analyzed. Results: In 3 patients without visual impairment, the postoperative visual function was still normal. Among the remaining 9 patients with preoperative visual impairment, visual function was fully recovered in 3 patients after operation, was improved in 2 patients, and had no change in 4 patients. There were no complications in 3 of the 12 patients, and 9 patients had transient, mildly limited intraocular rotation with diplopia after operation, which all returned to normal within 1 month. Conclusion: Navigation-guided sinus endoscopy through the sphenoid approach is effective and feasible in the removal of the cavernous hemangioma of the orbital apex.

ABSTRACT
Vascular tumors of bone can be diagnostically challenging because of their rarity and histologic overlap with diverse mimics. Vascular tumors of bone can be categorized as benign (hemangioma), intermediate-locally aggressive (epithelioid hemangioma), intermediate-rarely metastasizing (pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma), and malignant (epithelioid hemangioendothelioma and angiosarcoma). Recurrent genetic alterations have been described, such as FOSB rearrangements in pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma and a subset of epithelioid hemangiomas; CAMTA1 or TFE3 rearrangements in epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. This review discusses the clinical, histologic, and molecular features of vascular tumors of bone, along with diagnostic pitfalls and strategies for avoidance.

ABSTRACT
Giant cell epulis (peripheral giant cell granuloma) typically appears as a reactive benign lesion in the oral cavity in areas following local irritation or chronic trauma. Here we describe the case of a 45-year-old male patient who presented with the chief complaint of a large gingival mass in the anterolateral maxilla. There had been progressive growth within the past few months, with increased painless discomfort during mastication. The patient also reported bleeding during interdental cleaning. A full physical work-up led to the suspicion of giant cell epulis alongside other differentials including mucosal hemangioma and squamous cell carcinoma, with unremarkable laboratory values. Imaging including computed tomography showed signs of previous insertion of metal implants on either side of the lesion alongside mucosal hyperplasia. A confirmatory biopsy was taken and showed multiple giant cells on a reactive bed of stroma, in line with the diagnosis of giant cell epulis. Oral inflammatory conditions such as giant cell epulis have greater chances of local recurrence and, therefore, careful investigation with timely and accurate diagnosis is imperative for appropriate early treatment. Complete surgical excision should then be employed to prevent relapses, as incomplete removal can lead to further recurrence. Identification and eradication of potential sources of irritation should also be considered when treating the patient, to avoid further recurrence.

ABSTRACT
Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE) is a rare vascular tumour with an intermediate behaviour between benign hemangioma and malignant angiosarcoma. There is scarce data on the penile EHE's management and its natural history, as our knowledge is based on few reported cases with a short follow-up period. We present a case report and conducted a literature review, including 17 cases. The relevance of this case report derives from the need for better clinical characterization of patients with penile EHE and the importance of defining the outcomes. We report the case of a 53-year-old male with a 1-year history of sleep-related painful erections. Imaging techniques showed a well-defined hypoechoic and hypervascular solid nodule on the dorsal aspect of the penis. It was surgically removed, and the histopathological study revealed a low-risk EHE of the penis. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography did not demonstrate local recurrence nor metastases. According to the literature review, most of the patients were in their fifth and sixth decades of life at the time of diagnosis and lesions were usually located in the glans. The most common clinical presentation was as a painful mass. Follow-up period ranged from 2 months to 5 years. Three patients showed systemic metastases, two of which died due to cancer. The conclusions from the literature review are limited by the reduced number of cases and the short follow-up. This case report highlights the importance of understanding the diagnosis and treatment of this type of rare non-squamous malignant tumours of the penis. Penile EHE is a malignant vascular tumour that is very rare in this location. The best treatment is local excision, with re-excision or intraoperative margins assessment. Occasionally, systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy can be useful. There is consensus on the importance of very strict follow-up of these patients.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND/AIM: Brain metastasis is a rare condition among patients with soft tissue sarcoma (STS), and its precise incidence remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate which patients should be screened for brain metastasis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified all patients with STS diagnosed between 2010 and 2015 in the SEER database. Incidence of brain metastasis at initial presentation and higher incidence of brain metastasis by histological subtype were investigated. In addition, risk factors for brain metastasis were examined.
RESULTS: A total of 26,676 patients were included for analysis, of whom 162 patients (0.6%) had brain metastasis. Alveolar soft part sarcoma (6.3%), malignant hemangioendothelioma (3.1%) and malignant schwannoma (2.6%) showed higher incidence of brain metastasis. Deep-rooted tumor, trunk tumor, and histological high-grade tumor tended to show higher incidence of brain metastasis.
CONCLUSION: Risk factors for brain metastasis were deep location, trunk development and histologically high-grade tumor, or specific histological subtypes.

ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of HNF1A-AS1 on the proliferation, migration and invasion of IL-6-induced hemangioendothelial cells (HemEC) and possible mechanism.
METHODS: RT-qPCR was used to detect the expression level of HNF1A-AS1 and miR-363-3p in the tumor tissue and adjacent normal skin tissue from 35 patients with hemangioma. Pearson correlation was used to analyze the correlation between the expression of HNF1A-AS1 and miR-363-3p in tumor tissues. HemEC were isolated and cultured in vitro.Dual luciferase reporter gene experiment was used to study the regulatory effect between HNF1A-AS1 and miR-363-3p. IL-6 was added to HemEC transfected with si-NC, si-HNF1A-AS1, si-HNF1A-AS1 and anti-miR-NC, or si-HNF1A-AS1 and anti-miR-363-3p, respectively. CCK-8 method and clone formation experiment were used to detect cell proliferation in each group. Transwell method was used to detect cell migration and invasion in each group. Western blotting was used to detect the expression of Ki67, MMP-2 and MMP-9 proteins in each group.
RESULTS: Compared with normal skin tissues, the expression of IL-6 mRNA in hemangioma tissues was increased (P<0.05), and the expression of IL-6 mRNA in the proliferative phase was lower than that in the degenerative phase (P<0.05). Expression of HNF1A-AS1 in hemangioma tissue was increased (P<0.05), while that of miR-363-3p was decreased (P<0.05), and the two were negatively correlated (r=-0.758, P<0.05). HNF1A-AS1 down-regulated the expression of miR-363-3p in HemEC.IL-6 promoted the expression of HNF1A-AS1, OD value, number of colonies, number of migration and invasion of HemEC cells, and the expression of Ki67, MMP-2 and MMP-9proteins (P<0.05), while reduced the expression of miR-363-3p (P<0.05). Down-regulating si-HNF1A-AS1 reduced the IL-6-induced HemEC cell OD value, colony numbers, migration and invasion and the expression of Ki67, MMP-2 and MMP-9 proteins (P<0.05). Down-regulating miR-363-3p attenuated the inhibitory effect of down-regulating si-HNF1A-AS1 on the proliferation, migration and invasion of HemEC cells induced by IL-6 (P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: Expression of HNF1A-AS1 is increased in hemangioma tissues. Down-regulating HNF1A-AS1 may inhibit proliferation, migration and invasion of IL-6-induced hemangioma endothelial cells by targeted up-regulation of miR-363-3p.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Epithelioid hemangioma (EH) arising from the skin is a benign vascular tumor with marked inflammatory cell infiltration, which exhibits a high tendency to persist and frequently recurs after resection. So far, the underlying pathogenesis is largely elusive.
OBJECTIVES: To identify genetic alterations by next-generation-sequencing and/or droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) in cutaneous EH.
METHODS: DNA and RNA from an EH lesion of an index patient were subjected to whole genome and RNA sequencing. Multiplex PCR-based panel sequencing of genomic DNA isolated from archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue of 18 cutaneous EH patients was performed. ddPCR was used to confirm mutations.
RESULTS: We identified somatic mutations in genes of the MAPK pathway (MAP2K1 and KRAS) in cutaneous EH biopsies. By ddPCR we could confirm the recurrent presence of activating, low-frequency mutations affecting MAP2K1. In total, 9 out of 18 analyzed patients showed activating MAPK pathway mutations, which were mutually exclusive. Comparative analysis of tissue areas enriched for lymphatic infiltrate or aberrant endothelial cells, respectively, revealed an association of these mutations with the presence of endothelial cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data suggest that EH shows somatic mutations in genes of the MAPK pathway which might contribute to the formation of this benign tumor.

ABSTRACT
A 42-year-old man presented with a headache and right hemiparesis and was found to have a cystic mass with a calcified mural nodule in the left thalamus. Because the thalamus is surrounded by vital neurovascular structures, the surgical approach to thalamic lesions can be challenging. We decided to remove the mass for decompression and pathological diagnosis. The mass was removed through a contralateral interhemispheric transcallosal transchoroidal approach with less retraction and parenchymal injury than other approaches to avoid brain retraction and cortical injury. The pathological diagnosis was cavernous malformation. Temporary worsening of the preoperative hemiparesis was recovered over two months following surgery. Tolerable thalamic pain syndrome remained. Here, we report a rare case of thalamic cavernous malformation with a favorable outcome through a contralateral surgical approach.

ABSTRACT
Identification and assessment of extramammary findings on contrast-enhanced breast MRI scans is particularly important in the setting of newly diagnosed invasive cancer as metastatic lesions may be encountered in the liver, lungs, pleural cavity or bones. Establishing that stage IV disease is present has a profound effect on patient management. The sternum is routinely included on breast MRI studies and can be an early site for breast cancer metastases. These appear as enhancing lesions with high signal on fat-suppressed T2-weighted images. However, incidental benign lesions, notably haemangiomas, may also be encountered, and careful analysis is required to avoid false-positive results. Clinical context is important with a much lower likelihood of malignancy in the setting of routine screening of young women with no personal history of breast cancer. This pictorial essay illustrates findings encountered with lesions in the sternum and offers insights into how to interpret and manage them.

ABSTRACT
Hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (HEHE) is a vascular tumor with a low incidence rate. We report a case of a 26-year-old man who was referred to our hospital with a misdiagnosis of liver cirrhosis. On physical examination, ascites was noted. Chest and abdominal computer tomography scans showed coalescent lesions involving the peripheral liver with heterogeneous contrast enhancement and portal vein dilation due to portal hypertension. Extrahepatic metastasis was not observed. The biopsy with immunohistochemical stains suggested HEHE (Factor VIII, CD31, and CD34). This report describes an uncommon case of HEHE with non-cirrhotic portal hypertension.

ABSTRACT
Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is a relatively new approach for the definitive diagnosis of focal liver lesions (FLL). The essential advantages of CEUS are affordability, absence of radiation, and negligible nephrotoxicity-making this diagnostic approach more preferable. This review includes data from 39 different research studies published during the last 10 years, selected through the MeSH strategy in PubMed. We conclude that CEUS is a promising approach for diagnosing primary liver neoplasms and it is an excellent radiological approach for children and pregnant women because of the absence of radiation and nephrotoxicity. Studies showed that CEUS is a very good approach for the differentiation of a variety of hemangiomas and for a detailed description of those findings. Therefore, CEUS is an important and progressive method for the diagnosis of liver neoplasms. The regular use of CEUS will facilitate the diagnosis of primary liver lesions.

ABSTRACT
Maffucci syndrome is characterized by multiple hemangiomas and enchondromas. Somatic mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 are associated with the development of Maffucci syndrome, and these patients develop various malignant nonskeletal tumors in addition to malignant skeletal tumors. We report a case of Maffucci syndrome with IDH1 mutation complicated by intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The patient was a 35-year-old woman who was diagnosed with Maffucci syndrome in childhood. She was referred to our department because of a large hepatic tumor. Serum carcinoembryonic antigen was 27.1 ng/mL upon laboratory examination. CT scanning showed a large low-density tumor (90 × 70 mm) in the right lobe of the liver, and MRI revealed a multilobulated and fibrous tumor, which was observed as high signal intensity on T2- and diffusion-weighted images and low signal intensity on T1-weighted images. Positron emission tomography-CT revealed peritoneal dissemination and cancer spread to the muscles of the back. Finally, she was diagnosed with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with dissemination and metastases. We performed a tumor biopsy to determine a treatment plan for chemotherapy. Sanger sequencing of a tumor biopsy identified a mutation in IDH1 at c.394C>T (R132C), but the patient died of rapid cancer progression before the chemotherapy could be initiated. Although rare, malignant tumors can develop in patients with Maffucci syndrome; therefore, it is necessary to monitor these tumors through careful and periodic observation.

ABSTRACT
We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of propranolol gel at various concentrations with infantile hemangiomas after proliferative phases. We designed a single-center, randomized, double-blind, dose-dependent trial with placebo control and randomized patients to receive propranolol gel at 0%, 1%, or 5%, twice daily for 24 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage change in redness of the tumors. Safety endpoints were skin characteristics changes and systemic symptoms. We made two comparisons to evaluate the superiority of 1% and 5% propranolol gels against placebo for primary endpoint analysis and used the t-test to compare parents' satisfaction with these treatments. Initially, 19 patients were enrolled, but 8 were excluded from the analysis. We were underpowered to answer the question of efficacy. In the per-protocol set, we found similar results for the redness percentage change among the patients on placebo, 1% and 5% gel. However, the difference in redness before and after treatment suggested a slight decreasing trend of lesion's redness as the propranolol concentration increased. The difference in parents' satisfaction between the placebo and 5% propranolol gel groups was significant (p = 0.08). We observed no serious adverse events. We did not find an obvious dose-dependent effect for the propranolol gel treatment against infantile hemangiomas after the proliferative phase. However, external applications twice daily were less burdensome for parents and led to good compliances. It had a favorable safety profile in Japanese pediatric patients with infantile hemangiomas.

ABSTRACT
As a member of the long non‑coding (lnc)RNA family, lncRNA maternally expressed 8, small nucleolar RNA host gene (MEG8), has been reported to serve an oncogenic role in several types of malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma, non‑small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer. The current study aimed to investigate the effect of the knockdown of MEG8 on human hemangioma endothelial cell (HemEC) proliferation, apoptosis and invasion, in addition to determining the underlying molecular mechanism. The knockdown of lncRNA MEG8 was achieved by transfecting lncRNA MEG8 small interfering (si)RNA into HemECs, while the combined knockdown of lncRNA MEG8 knockdown and microRNA (miR)‑203 was established by co‑transfecting lncRNA MEG8 siRNA and a miR‑203 inhibitor into HemECs. The cell proliferation, apoptosis and invasion and the expression levels of miR‑34a, miR‑200b, miR‑200b and Notch signaling pathway‑related factors were detected via CCK‑8 Kit, flow cytometry, Transwell, reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR and western blot assay, respectively. The knockdown of lncRNA MEG8 significantly inhibited proliferation (P<0.05) and invasion (P<0.05), but promoted apoptosis (P<0.01) in HemECs. Furthermore, lncRNA MEG8 knockdown upregulated miR‑203 (P<0.01) expression, but did not alter miR‑34a or miR‑200b expression (both P>0.05). Subsequent experiments revealed that miR‑203 silencing exerted no significant effect on the expression levels of lncRNA MEG8 (P>0.05) in HemECs. In addition, miR‑203 silencing increased cell proliferation (P<0.05) and invasion (P<0.01), but suppressed apoptosis (P<0.05). miR‑203 silencing also reversed the effect of lncRNA MEG8 knockdown on the proliferation (P<0.05), apoptosis (P<0.001) and invasion (P<0.01) of HemECs. Moreover, lncRNA MEG8 knockdown downregulated jagged canonical notch ligand 1 (JAG1; P<0.05) and Notch1 (P<0.05) expression levels, while miR‑203 silencing upregulated JAG1 (P<0.01) and Notch1 (P<0.01) expression levels and reversed the effects of lncRNA MEG8 knockdown on JAG1 (P<0.01) and Notch1 (P<0.01) expression in HemECs. In conclusion, the findings of the present study suggested that lncRNA MEG8 knockdown may inhibit cell proliferation and invasion, but promote cell apoptosis in hemangioma via miR‑203‑induced mediation of the Notch signaling pathway.

ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE: To present a rare case of a middle ear capillary hemangioma in an adult.
PATIENT: A 31-year-old woman with a 6-month history of left ear fullness, pressure, tinnitus, and progressive hearing loss.
INTERVENTION: Endoscopic laser-assisted resection.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical, radiographic, and histopathological findings of a capillary hemangioma.
RESULTS: Otoscopy revealed an erythematous and slightly pulsating multilobulated middle ear retrotympanic mass. Her audiogram demonstrated a left-sided mixed hearing loss with air-conduction thresholds in the severe-to-profound range. Computed tomography (CT) imaging was significant for total opacification of the left middle ear and mastoid air cells. She underwent a combined endoscopic transcanal and transmastoid excision of the mass with ossicular chain reconstruction. A KTP laser was used to ablate and shrink down the periphery of the lesion. Pathology of the specimen was consistent with a capillary hemangioma. The patient's pulsatile tinnitus and spontaneous vertigo resolved postoperatively.
CONCLUSIONS: Capillary hemangiomas are an uncommon cause of vascular middle ear lesions in adults and typically present with symptoms of aural fullness, pulsatile tinnitus, conductive hearing loss, otalgia, and vertigo. Surgery resection provides definitive treatment and the use of laser ablation techniques can allow for hemostasis and excellent visualization.

ABSTRACT
Vascular anomalies are subdivided into vascular tumors (hemangiomas) and vascular malformations. They are frequently located in the head, neck, and oral cavity. They are common complaints reported in patients seeking treatment for aesthetic or functional issues. However, recent advances in the diagnosis and management of these lesions are improving treatment strategies. This review provides both basic and up-to-date knowledge on the most common vascular anomalies encountered by practitioners. Due to the wide variability of treatment options which often generates debate, this paper work aims to provide a comprehensive approach of these lesions based upon current concepts and practical clinical experience. Our article is about 4 patients who had consulted for one or several purplish, elevated, well limited and soft lesion. These lesions was not painful, but worrying for patients. Therapies for VAs continue to generate a dilemma for oral surgeons. Several treatment options were reported, including conventional surgery with or without adjunctive preoperative embolization, and drug therapies, such corticosteroids, intralesional injection of corticosteroids and intralesional injections of sclerosing agents. All of these therapeutic approaches carry a high risk of severe side effects such as scars, pain, and bleeding [7]. Nowadays, advances in the use of lasers have allowed doctors an effective treatment with minimal side effects [9]. All our cases described in this article were done by Pr Haitami, using the 980 nm Diode laser, and a complete healing was observed in about 8 months at the most. The laser is therefore a great help in the management of this type of lesion.

ABSTRACT
PHACE(S) syndrome combines: posterior fossa brain malformations, face hemangioma, arterial cerebrovascular abnormalities, cardiovascular abnormalities, eye abnormalities, and ventral developmental defects (Sternal defects or supra-umbilical rope). The diagnosis is based on the association of an infant hemangioma exceeding 5cm in size on the face, neck, scalp with 1 major criteria or 2 minor criteria. Imaging, especially Gadolinium MRI and MRA of the brain, neck, and aortic arch, transthoracic echocardiography, or even cardiac MRI play a key role in the detection of associated neurological and cardiovascular abnormalities. We report 2 cases of PHACE syndrome revealed by 2 different clinical presentations.

ABSTRACT
Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE) is a rare tumor of the vascular endothelial cells. It can originate from any tissue; however, it occurs most frequently in the liver and lung. Pleural epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (PEH), EHE developing from pleura, is even more infrequent and less reported in the literature. In the following report, we discuss a 40-year-old man who initially presented with right-sided chest pain. Computed tomography revealed pleural thickening and effusion in his right thoracic cavity. PEH diagnosis was confirmed with immunohistochemistry. In order to provide the readers with an inclusive understanding of the disease, we collected the PEH cases reported in the literature. Despite the scarcity of the reported PEH cases (to our best knowledge), the compiled literature review of the disease enables the readers to grasp a better comprehension of the disease.

ABSTRACT
The umbilical cord constitutes a continuation of the fetal cardiovascular system anatomically bridging between the placenta and the fetus. This structure, critical in human development, enables mobility of the developing fetus within the gestational sac in contrast to the placenta, which is anchored to the uterine wall. The umbilical cord is protected by unique, robust anatomical features, which include: length of the umbilical cord, Wharton's jelly, two umbilical arteries, coiling, and suspension in amniotic fluid. These features all contribute to protect and buffer this essential structure from potential detrimental twisting, shearing, torsion, and compression forces throughout gestation, and specifically during labor and delivery. The arterial components of the umbilical cord are further protected by the presence of Hyrtl's anastomosis between the two respective umbilical arteries. Abnormalities of the umbilical cord are uncommon yet include excessively long or short cords, hyper or hypocoiling, cysts, single umbilical artery, supernumerary vessels, rarely an absent umbilical cord, stricture, furcate and velamentous insertions (including vasa previa), umbilical vein and arterial thrombosis, umbilical artery aneurysm, hematomas, and tumors (including hemangioma angiomyxoma and teratoma). This commentary will address current perspectives of prenatal sonography of the umbilical cord, including structural anomalies and the potential impact of future imaging technologies.

ABSTRACT
PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S): Choroidal hemangioma (CH) is a benign vascular tumor that induces exudative retinal detachment and consequent visual symptoms. Current standard treatments for CH include cryotherapy, diathermy, photocoagulation, PDT, transpupillary thermotherapy, and Radiation. SRS is preferred in the treatment of CH because of its characteristic stiff dose-fall-off and accuracy. Current retrospective study evaluated tumor volume reductions and improvements to visual acuity following multisession Radiosurgery in the treatment of symptomatic circumscribed choroidal hemangioma.
MATERIALS/METHODS: Study comprised of Thirteen patients with symptomatic circumscribed CHs diagnosed between August 2012 to December 2019 (8 Male & 5 female). 3 pts. had Sturge-Weber syndrome. All patients underwent frameless SRS following retrobulbar block, Thermoplastic immobilization & Imaging (CT & MRI). A total of 15-18gy / 3 frcs was planned using a 5mm collimator, prescribed to 90% isodose and treatment delivered on a frameless robotic radiosurgery system with skull tracking or C arm Linac equipped with hexapod robotics. Best corrected visual acuity, funduscopic findings, basal tumor diameter and tumor thickness were recorded at baseline and at follow-up visits every 6 -month intervals.
RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 33 years (range: 12-61 years) and the mean duration of clinical or radiological follow-up was 33 months (range: 16-80 months). The mean volume, Basal diameter, tumor height & tumor thickness at baseline were 533.5 mm3 (range: 124-1150 mm3); 8 mm (range: 5-12mm, ± 2.3); 2.8mm (range, 2.0 - 4.5mm); tumor thickness was 5.1 (range: 3.0-11.0, ± 2.7) mm respectively. 6 tumors were subfoveolar, 4 were juxtafoveolar, and 3 were extrafoveolar. Exudative retinal detachment resolved within a median of 5.5 months (response rate, 100%; 95% CI, 48%-100%). Median best-corrected visual acuity was 20/50 (range, 20/22-20/90) at diagnosis and 20/25 (range, 20/20-20/60) 18 months after treatment. The visual acuity of the affected eye had improved at the latest follow-up examination (P = .018) in all patients. Tumor height had decreased a median of 32% (range, 10-40%) by 6 months and 41% (range, 17%-59%) by 20 months. No recurrence of exudative RD occurred. Thinning of the CHs was observed in most patients; however, symptomatic radiation toxicity had not developed in any of the patients.
CONCLUSION: Multisession radiosurgery could be an acceptable alternative treatment for symptomatic circumscribed CH with resolution of exudative RD being achieved within 5-6mo.

ABSTRACT
Propranolol has been used in the first-line therapy of infantile hemangioma (IH) for a number of years; however, the mechanisms through which propranolol regulates IH are not yet fully understood. In the present study, microRNA (miRNA/miR) sequencing analysis was performed to identify differentially expressed miRNAs in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with propranolol. Cell viability and apoptosis were detected using CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Cell migration was assessed using wound healing, Transwell, and tube formation assays. Methylation-specific PCR was then used to investigate the promoter methylation status. The levels of oxidative stress indicators, including superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and malondialdehyde were also detected. Finally, cell cycle analysis was performed using flow cytometry and western blotting. It was observed that propranolol induced the upregulation of miR-206 in HUVECs, which was caused by demethylation of the miR-206 promoter. Moreover, propranolol significantly inhibited the proliferation of HUVECs by inducing apoptosis, while these phenomena were reversed by miR-206 antagomir. VEGFA was found to be a target gene of miR-206. In addition, propranolol notably inhibited the migration and induced G1 arrest of the HUVECs, whereas these results were eliminated by miR-206 antagomir. Collectively, the findings of the present study demonstrated that propranolol may inhibit the proliferation and migration in HUVECs via modulating the miR-206/VEGFA axis. These findings suggest a novel mechanism through which propranolol suppresses the progression of IH.

ABSTRACT
Vascular birthmarks are common in neonates (prevalence: 20-30%) and mostly incidental findings sometimes with spontaneous regression (salmon patch and nevus simplex). Capillary malformations are found in about 1% and infantile hemangiomas are found in 4% of mature newborns. Vascular malformations are classified according to their most prominent vessel type. The term "capillary malformation" (port wine stain) includes a wide range of vascular lesions with different characteristics; they may be isolated or part of specific syndromic conditions. Part of the infantile hemangiomas and of the vascular malformations may require treatment for functional or cosmetic reasons, and in rare cases, investigations are also necessary as they represent a clue for the diagnosis of complex vascular malformation or tumors associated with extracutaneous abnormalities. Complex vascular malformations are mostly mosaicism due to early somatic mutations. Genetic advances have led to identify the main pathogenic pathways involved in this disease group. Diffuse capillary malformation with overgrowth, Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, CLAPO syndrome, CLOVES syndrome, and megalencephaly-capillary malformation belong to the PIK3CA-related overgrowth. Capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation underlies a fast-flow vascular malformation, sometimes manifesting as Parkes-Weber syndrome. Recognition of these different types of capillary vascular stains is sometimes difficult; however, associated findings may orient the clinicians while genetic testing may confirm the diagnosis. Lymphatic malformation frequently manifests as large masses that compress and/or infiltrate the surrounding tissues, representing a neonatal emergency when airways are involved. Infantile hemangiomas may cause functional and/or permanent esthetical damage, depending on their localization (such as periorbital area, lip, nose); large (more than 5 cm) infantile hemangiomas with a segmental distribution can be associated with obstruction or malformations of the underneath organs with complications: PHACE syndrome, LUMBAR/SACRAL syndrome, and beard infantile hemangioma. In our review, we discuss controversies regarding the international classification and emerging concepts in the field of vascular anomalies. Finally, we discuss potential developments of new, non-invasive diagnostic techniques and repurposing of target therapies from oncology. Complex and/or life-threatening vascular tumors and malformations are extremely rare events and they represent a considerable therapeutic challenge. Early recognition of clinical signs suggestive for a specific disease may improve therapeutic outcomes and avoid severe complications.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Despite improvements in surgical techniques, cranial nerve (CN) deficits remain the most frequent cause of disability following cavernous sinus (CS) surgery. The most common tumor affecting the CS is meningioma. They originate from lateral wall and have their blood supply from meningohypophyseal trunk (MHT) and inferolateral trunk (ILT). Pituitary adenomas commonly invade the CS through its medial wall and receive blood supply form medial branches of the internal carotid artery (ICA) (superior and inferior hypophyseal arteries). Some tumors may grow within the CS (e.g. trigeminal schwannomas, hemangiomas). These tumors are fed by all the intracavernous ICA branches. Tumors involving the CS may also displace the neurovascular structures, therefore, a better understanding of intracavernous neurovascular anatomy may reduce the postoperative morbidity associated with approaching CS tumors. In this anatomical study, the anatomic variations and their clinical implications of the intracavernous CNs' blood supply were evaluated through transcranial and endonasal routes.
METHODS: Twenty sides of ten adult cadaveric formalin-fixed, latex-injected specimens were dissected in stepwise fashion under microscopic and endoscopic magnification. The origin and course of the intracavernous ICA branches supplying the intracavernous CNs are studied.
RESULTS: The proximal segment of the oculomotor nerve receives blood supply from the ILT in 85%, and the tentorial artery of the MHT in 15% of specimens. The distal segment is exclusively supplied by the ILT. The proximal trochlear nerve receives blood supply from the ILT (75%) and the tentorial artery (25%); the distal segment is exclusively supplied by the superior orbital branch. The proximal third of the abducens nerve receives its vascularity exclusively from the dorsal meningeal artery, and its middle and distal thirds from the ILT. The ophthalmic and proximal maxillary segments of the trigeminal nerve also receive blood supply from the ILT. The distal maxillary segment is supplied by the artery of the foramen rotundum. All ILT branches terminate on the inferomedial aspects of the intra-cavernous CNs. Extensive anastomoses are found between ILT branches and the branches arising from external carotid artery.
CONCLUSION: Understanding the anatomy of the intracavernous ICA's branches is important to improving surgical outcomes with tumors involving the CS.

ABSTRACT
INTRODUCTION: Hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (HEHE) is a rare tumor of vascular origin. Liver involvement is often multinodular simulating metastases. Herein, we report a rare case of HEHE mimicking liver metastases in a female patient.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 43-years-old female patient, presented with complaints of pain in the right upper quadrant. Laboratory tests were all within the normal range. Abdominal ultrasound revealed multiple heterogeneous hypoechoic liver lesions. A thoracic and abdominopelvic computed tomography showed bilateral pulmonary micronodules with multiple hypodense hepatic nodules involving both lobes. Percutaneous ultrasound-guided biopsy with pathological study and immunohistochemistry staining revealed the diagnosis of hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma.
DISCUSSION: HEHE usually involves both liver lobes with three radiological presentations: single nodular, multiple nodular, or diffuse types, the diffuse type reflects an advanced stage. 3/4 of the cases are initially misdiagnosed as liver metastases or primary liver tumors. The pathological study with the immunochemistry stainings confirms the diagnosis. There is no standard treatment for HEHE due to its rarity and lack of prospective randomized studies.
CONCLUSION: HEHE is a rare tumor of vascular origin of unknown etiology with malignant potential and unpredictable course. The therapeutic management of this rare condition is not codified and is discussed on a case-by-case basis. Surgical treatment remains the best option with an excellent outcome.

ABSTRACT
A middle-aged female with history of multinodular goiter, Hashimoto disease, and chronic vitamin B12 deficiency presented with palpitations and subsequent exertional dyspnea. Initial radiographic analysis suggested mediastinal cavernous hemangioma, but biopsy showed features consistent with pleural hemangioma. Pleural hemangioma should be considered among the differential diagnoses for recurrent unilateral pleural effusion. Pleural hemangioma should be distinguished from other more common entities including the similarly benign pulmonary hemangioma and the more aggressive pleural hemangioendothelioma.

ABSTRACT
Intramuscular hemangioma (IMH) is rare in the ocular adnexa and is uncommonly found in infants. We describe a 1-month-old female infant with an unremarkable birth history presented with subacute onset of right upper eyelid swelling. Clinical examination revealed a purplish subcutaneous mass over the right upper eyelid causing mechanical ptosis. MRI revealed a well-defined subcutaneous mass, which was hyperintense on the T1 weighted images and showed intense enhancement after administration of intravenous gadolinium. Our working diagnosis was infantile capillary hemangioma, and the patient received two intralesional steroid injections without diminishing the lesion size. The lesion had become static in size and the subsequent MRI 14 years later revealed the same lesion had become hyperintense on the T1 weighted image. An excisional biopsy revealed mixed type IMH. IMH should be considered among young patients with upper eyelid swelling, particularly in those who show a poor response to steroid treatment.

ABSTRACT
The aim of the study is to report on the indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) and OCT findings in patients hospitalized for severe COVID infection. In this observational prospective monocentric cohort study, we included patients hospitalized for severe COVID infection. The main outcomes were ICGA and OCT findings. A total of 14 patients with a mean age of 58.2 ± 11.4 years and a male predominance (9/14 patients; 64%) were included. The main ICGA findings included hypofluorescent spots in 19 eyes (68%), intervortex shunts in 10 eyes (36%), and characteristic "hemangioma-like" lesions in five eyes (18%). "Hemangioma-like" lesions were both unique and unilateral, and showed no washout on the late phase of the angiogram. The main OCT findings included focal choroidal thickening in seven eyes (25%), caverns in six eyes (21%) and paracentral acute middle maculopathy lesions in one eye (4%). All patients hospitalized for severe COVID infection had anomalies on ICGA and OCT. Lesions to both retinal and choroidal vasculature were found. These anomalies could be secondary to vascular involvement related directly or indirectly to the SARS-CoV2 virus.

ABSTRACT
Here, we report a novel truncating mutation in the ubiquitin-specific peptidase gene (USP53) causing low-γ-GT (GGT) cholestasis. Genetic testing was carried out, including clinical exome sequencing for the proband and Sanger sequencing for the proband and his parents. The proband harbored a novel c.1017_1057del (p.(Cys339TrpfsTer7)) mutation in the ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase (UCH) domain of USP53; we describe the clinical and laboratory features of the patient with a rare type of low-GGT cholestasis caused by this variant. The clinical presentation was found to be similar to that of phenotypes described in previous studies. However, there was an unusual presence of liver hemangiomas observed in our patient. Thus, our report reinforces the link between USP53 mutations and cholestasis. With this report, we confirm USP53 as the gene for low-GGT cholestasis and describe liver hemangiomas as a possible additional symptom of the phenotype spectrum. The inclusion of USP53 in the OMIM database and liver gene panels can further increase the effectiveness of molecular genetic studies.

ABSTRACT
Infantile hemangioma (IH) is the most common benign vascular tumor of infancy, affecting about 5% of infants. It has a characteristic growth pattern of early rapid proliferation followed by progressive involution. Although most IH evolve favorably, complications are observed in 10-15% of cases, justifying treatment. For over 10 years now, propranolol has become the first-line therapy for complicated IH, revolutionizing their management and their prognosis. In this article, we review the clinical features, associations, complications/sequelae and therapeutic approaches for IH, focusing on current medical therapy. Indications for treatment and various treatment options, including propranolol and other oral β-blockers, topical timolol, and corticosteroids are presented.

ABSTRACT
Various treatments for oral vascular malformation (VM) have been reported. Polidocanol and absolute ethanol have also been reported for sclerotherapy. However, there are still few reports on the therapeutic effect and dosage of polidocanol sclerotherapy. Therefore, we examined its therapeutic effects on oral VM. There were 17 sites of VMs, with nine patients diagnosed with oral VM at the Department of Dental and Oral Surgery, Tsukuba University Hospital. The medical records were retrospectively investigated to determine the site, hemangioma volume, polidocanol injection volume, and therapeutic effect. The volume of hemangiomas was calculated using magnetic resonance images. Based on the site, oral VMs were observed in the tongue, buccal mucosa, lips, and oral floor in eight, three, five, and one patients, respectively. The average size of the site was 3071 mm3. The average injection dose of polidocanol at one site was 2.86 mL, the average number of administrations was 1.6, and the response rate was 88.2%. No adverse events were observed. The median numerical rating scale scores were 2/10 (0-6/10) and 0/10 (0-1/10) the day after surgery and 1 week after surgery, respectively. Univariate regression analysis of the total dose in successful cases provided the following formula: 1.3 + 0.00025 × volume (mm3) (mg). Polidocanol sclerotherapy is an effective treatment method for oral VM.

ABSTRACT
Epithelioid haemangioendothelioma is a rare angiogenic tumour originating from vascular endothelial or pre-endothelial cells, and it can occur anywhere in the body, such as the liver, lung, bone, spleen, lymph nodes, parotid gland, and thyroid. In the fifth revision of the WHO classification, epithelioid haemangioendothelioma (EHE) was described as a malignant vascular neoplasm composed of epithelioid endothelial cells, distinct from epithelioid angiosarcoma. We, herein, report one patient with EHE of the left upper mediastinum who underwent resection and radiotherapy during the first therapeutic process. Multiple metastases occurred in the thoracic vertebrae 6 years later, and resection and multiple radiotherapies were performed. The condition of the patient remained stable at the last review in October 2020, and it has been more than 8 years since her first admission. The reasonable "take-away" lessons from the case are active treatment and prolonged surveillance.

ABSTRACT
Cavernous hemangiomas are benign malformations of vascular origin, usually well circumscribed and slow to grow. These lesions can be asymptomatic, being discovered unintentionally in imaging exams or symptomatic, indicated mainly by the presence of proptosis, diplopia, and visual disturbances by optic nerve compression. The complementary exams involve computed tomography associated with contrast, color Doppler, magnetic resonance, and angiography. Treatment can be conservative or surgical depending on the case, and the open therapy usually involves lateral, supraorbital, transconjunctival, transantral, pterional, transnasal, and extradural endoscopic orbitotomy. The present study aims to report a recurrent case of hemangioma in the orbital cavity signaled by ocular proptosis, hyperemia, and ocular pain.The lesion was achieved through the Weber-Ferguson access with zygomatic osteotomy and preservation of the infraorbital nerve. The excision of the lesion was performed, and the previously displaced fragments were fixed with 1.5 mm mini plates. The patient has a chance of progressing with visual impairment due to considerable manipulation of the optic nerve and is being followed up.The reported case showed a successful diagnosis and therapeutic conduct, remaining now in the evolution and follow-up scenario.

Everybody in the pool!
As you spend this May Gray morning in Los Angeles charting potential Tony nominees for your completely disinterested cubicle mates, we want you to know we're here for you. Now turn down that "Cats" soundtrack and get back to work.
Nods for theater's top awards come out tomorrow, and maybe there's still hope for that office derby if you point out that it's been more than three whole months since there's been an Oscar-(down)sized awards show.
If that doesn't help, how about this: there are a number of Hollywood movie connections to this year's crop of potential honorees. Never mind that some started out in the theater in the first place, then bounced to movies and back again. Or vice versa. Or something like that.
We've already waxed on about "Xanadu," not to be confused with an award-winning film, but there's also "Grease," "South Pacific," "Gypsy," "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof," and a $20 million musical version of "Young Frankenstein" (pictured) in the potential running for awards. Some theater-watcher predictions here.
Have to say, though, that we'd held out some hope that Nathan Lane would host next month's airing of the Great White Way awards, never tiring of the spit-take we're sure he'd work into that role somehow. It's always funny, right?
It'll be Whoopi Goldberg, herself a Tony winner. Apparently she's not soured on the whole awards show gig, even after being dissed by one of those tribute reels at this year's Oscars that "forgot" she hosted four times.
Check back tomorrow for the nominations and our rendition of "Puttin' on the Ritz."How to Grow Your Business Through Online 20. November 2016 Alexander Online Marketing Software Comments (0) In today’s modern time, online presence of a business is a must requirement. Online business, also known as e-business includes providing any sort of online services. A wide range of businesses can be found on internet in many different industries. Any person with a unique product or idea can start an e-business and can find their way to sell or trade online. Online businesses can have different online business-fronts, such as websites, social media accounts, blogs etc. All kinds of businesses carry on business transactions on a daily basis. These transactions are carried out using business invoices. Generally, invoices are created at the end of every billing time and then they are printed, put in an envelope and mailed to the customer, which is also called “Manual Invoices”. There are a number of problems that can strike when processing invoices manually, for example, missing or incorrect line data, several issues develop while dealing with papers, duplicate invoices etc. All these factors can be costly for business as well. Therefore, several small business owners and freelancers recognize the benefits of moving from manual invoices to online invoicing solutions that speed the process of invoicing and payment. This way the freelancers can also keep track of their companies' financial information. Online invoicing communicates on a modern company image. It is not only a perfect way to reduce costs on papers, envelops and stamps but also saves time. As a basic rule, the faster you send out your invoices, the sooner you are likely to get paid. Speed is just one competitive advantage of invoicing online, but the benefits don't stop there. The payment status can easily be viewed and the owner can easily find out which invoice has been paid, and which is due. Online invoicing is also a best way to reduce the time between sending an invoice and receiving payment, therefore, there is no more worrying about whether or not the invoice arrived. Online invoicing is the best way of building a positive image with the customer. Not only it is convenient but also it is highly professional. It makes the e-business, environment friendly. Online invoicing makes it easier for e-business owners to access the invoices anytime, anywhere. The level of services that an owner can provide to client is by resolving disputes by accessing invoices and account statements from anywhere. In case of urgency, the estimates and purchase orders can be sent to the client anytime, anywhere. As the demand has increased for affordable online invoicing solutions, several companies have appeared with the tools and platforms that offer a way to send online invoices. But it is very difficult to know which one is the best choice for which business. To narrow down the options, one must look at those online invoicing companies that offer more than just invoicing. So the freelancers get additional tools and features that help them streamline other aspects of their business. This way, the clients will expect the owner to provide services quickly and efficiently. Tags:Houston Solar Solutions

SOLAR PANEL FAQs
Absolutely! In the Sunny city of Houston, Solar adds value to your home, but don’t take our word for it. The US Department of Energy sponsored an extensive study indicating that homes with solar increased in value by more than $15,000. While uniform real estate market adoptions are relatively slow, there is an increasing number of homes and communities that are switching to solar power. In a similar study by Zillow, they found solar homes sold for on average 4% more than homes without.
Having no energy bills reduces the cost of owning a home, which translates into a higher value for the home. Homes with solar also sell quicker than similar homes without solar.
Energy Independence! Just because you live in Houston, TX does not mean you can't have solar energy freedom. When we say unplug from “the grid”, we mean you are no longer relying on the electricity coming from the network of power lines that connect to other homes and the power plants. With solar you are producing your own electricity, instead of pulling from the grid, you will actually add power to the grid when you are overproducing.
Your lights will stay on! Think about it this way, when you go to the beach on a partly cloudy day will you still get sunburnt? Yes. While you aren’t producing at the same level on a sunny day, your solar system will still be capturing energy from the sun. If you are worried about going multiple days without the sun, you have options. Even with solar you still have access to “the grid” and can buy power when needed. The other option is energy storage, which allows for living completely off the grid and it’s as simple as it sounds. While your solar is powering your house it also charges your batteries. So when your panels aren’t absorbing, at night for instance, or when the power goes out, your energy storage is ready to work.
The short answer is no, the long answer is also no. Unlike your computer, solar panels are water, snow, dust, wind, and even coffee proof! They won’t rust over time either and can take a hit. Despite being very high-tech, solar panels have no moving parts making them pretty carefree. They have even been known to survive a Houston hurricane or hail. If anything does happen to your solar panels there are warranties and home owner’s insurance!
Pretty instantly. Solar energy is a highly valued investment that is not subject to the market’s fluctuating costs. This is because your new energy source doesn’t require fossil fuels. Once we agree upon a quoted cost and/or related financing that payment is locked in with a set payment schedule. That price is not affected by varying monthly usage or fluctuating electricity rates. Not to mention the tax benefits you will receive for switching to solar power.
Yes!
The 22% federal solar tax credit is available for a purchased Texas home solar system installed by December 31, 2022.
Long story short, the best time to add solar is now! Take advantage of the Solar Tax Credit while it is still around. If you can’t make it before the 2022 deadline you still have one more year to automatically earn a 22% return with the federal tax credit. Solar energy is a long-term investment that yields almost immediate returns. Produce your own energy from an abundant and predictable resource. Not to mention by improving your home with a solar system it will sell faster and for a higher price than a home without solar.

You may never even think of a cork as being dangerous to your eyes. It’s simply just the thing that is between you and the liquid inside the bottle! But, corks can be quite damaging to the eye. The high-pressure level can hit an eye with great force. This can cause major ocular issues, like a retinal detachment, which could lead to blindness. Other issues, like glaucoma, may not be felt for years to come.
How To Open A Champagne Bottle Safely
The next time you’re about to celebrate a joyous occasion with champagne, use these tips to keep your eyes (and your guests’ eyes) safe:
- Open and point the cork away from any faces.
- Do not shake the bottle, as this just creates more pressure (even though we know you are very tempted to do so).
- Chill at least 45 degrees. The cooler the bottle the smoother the “pop”.
- Hold a towel over the bottle and then open it.
Don’t Assume Your Eye Will Just Heal!
If you have suffered an eye emergency like a blow to your eye, always get it checked out from your optometrist/hospital. Doing so can make the difference between seeing and not seeing. At Inner Harbour Optometry we treat eye emergencies as a priority, because time is of the essence. So don’t forget to tell the front staff if you have one!
We hope you have lots of fun this holiday season, but remember to protect your eyes! Happy Holidays from Inner Harbour Optometry – you local Victoria eye doctors!

“then He said, ‘Behold, I have come to do your will.’ He takes away the first in order to do the second. By this will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.” (Hebrews 10:9-10) In Psalm 40, David ponders the emptiness of Jewish religion. He concludes “sacrifice and offering you have not desired.” (vs 5) Everyone already knew it. People were faithfully going to church, observing the rituals commanded by God’s word, but missing power! It was a real problem for the man who would build the temple and establish this ceremonial/sacrificial form. In a prophetic moment, David hears Christ speak. He will do the Father’s new will. He will be the needed sacrifice. Perfect in obedience, perfect in effect, perfect in example. We must never go back to a system of religion. Only Christ has the power to cleanse our hearts. He is the new chapter.

To live is Christ!Last Sunday, as part of a brunch with friends, I planned a “chocolate tasting.” The impetus, which I wrote about in last Sunday’s blog post, was a sale on Vivani organic chocolate bars.
I had bought eight of them: Organic Cappuccino, Organic Dark Cassis, Organic Dark (71 percent cacao), Organic Dark Mint, Organic Milk Hazelnut, Organic Dark Orange, Praliné, and Organic Milk.
There were seven of us at brunch, and the first order of business was to figure out in what order to taste the chocolate. The consensus, more or less, was milk before dark, in ascending order of cacao content.
I think in future, I’d save mint for last, because it had the strongest flavour. None of us had done this kind of tasting before, but as we went along, we figured out what type of things we should be taking note of: sweetness, creaminess, texture, mouthfeel, flavour, aftertaste, smell, and “chocolatiness.”
Although we didn’t agree on our ratings for each individual chocolate bar, our unanimous favourite was the Organic Cappuccino. This came as a big surprise. Not only is this a milk chocolate bar – and my friend Marlene said at the outset that she’s a dark chocolate person (like me) – but each square is topped with a layer of white chocolate, which doesn’t necessarily “count” for chocolate lovers. Personally, I thought it would detract from the taste.
But the creamy sweetness of the chocolate combined with the mild bitterness of the coffee won us all over.
I was a little taken aback at the sugar content listed on the label. Um, 47 grams for the cappuccino… but that’s per bar. Fortunately, the bars are made up of small squares.
It was also interesting to note that the plain dark chocolate bar is much higher in iron than its milk chocolate counterpart, 40 percent (for the entire bar) compared to 8 percent of the (recommended) daily value, according to the label. The plain dark chocolate is also significantly lower in sugar than our “winner,” at 24 grams for the entire bar. These are also things I take into consideration.
The Organic Dark Cassis – the one I thought would be my favourite – is a filled dark chocolate that at least one of us found overly sweet (53 grams of sugar per bar!). We preferred the unfilled bars – a matter of personal taste – and found the Organic Dark Orange (solid, not filled) to be tasty, yet subtle in flavour. “It’s very nice,” was one comment.
Our friend Sheldon summed up the tasting this way: “It was an interesting chocolate experience.”
It was fun.Property Attributes

Sat 23 April and Sun 24 AprilAbuse of power accompanied by diabolical cruelty is unfortunately everywhere. In particular, the 20th century has seen some unfathomable evils committed by various groups and nations. The Stalinist Communist tyranny killed millions of people perished through genocide, intentional starvation, gulags, forced resettlements, political and ideological purging of so many people.
Between 1900-1999 110 to 148 million people perished under the Communist China in similar ways. The Holocaust committed by Nazi Germany stood out in its unflinching focus and efficiency in mass killings. Beginning in 1895 the militant and imperialistic Japan invaded neighboring countries, committed war crimes, mass killings, human experimentations, forced prostitution among other atrocities until it was finally stopped in 1945.
The ruthless malice to Jesus inflicted by Pilate and the Jewish authority was no less terrible. Against this background, the question posed by Pilate has an added poignancy: “So you are a king?” Assumptions about kingship and power are vastly different among various people.
This King will change the world order that has never seen. Jesus answered: “You say I am a king. For this I was born and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.” Yes, he is “the” King for certain. Yes, he has the absolute authority over the whole universe and its history. Yet his kingdom is of a totally different kind.
An early Christian writer spoke of this eloquent paradox: “Do you think that Jesus was sent [by God], as might be supposed, to establish some sort of political sovereignty [tyrannis], to inspire fear and terror? Not so. But in gentleness and meekness has He sent him, as a king would send a son who is himself a king…. Christians are not distinguished from the rest of humanity either in locality or in speech or in customs…. They dwell in their own countries, but only as sojourners… Every foreign country is a fatherland to them, and every fatherland is a foreign country.”
To testify to the truth about our merciful God and His plan for all of us, Jesus came. Our God offers us his self-giving love and gentle mercy and invites us to love Him and one another as sisters and brothers of our King. As the Word of creation and eternal life, he is the beginning and the end, the origin and goal of the human and cosmic history. “I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “the one who is and who was and who is to come, the almighty” (Rev. 1:8).
Jesus is our King, whose throne is his cross, and we are his people sharing his royal dignity and mission. Yes, we are a royal people! His way is neither violence nor deception. He overcomes evil with good. May we always remember who we are and retain our royal demeanor imitating our King on the cross and living His mercy and truth! He is the same yesterday, today, and forever.

With the opening of a new office in the Spanish capital, the event staff, PR and protocol agency aims to reinforce its structure in Spain.
Market Development, a benchmark event and corporate image agency, has begun 2018 with the opening of new offices in Madrid, thus continuing its expansion. The new offices are located in the Paseo de la Castellana 179, one of the capital’s business centres, while the firm’s main headquarters are in Sant Cugat del Vallès (Barcelona).
‘The opening of new offices in Madrid is a very important step which forms part of the agency’s expansion plans in order to offer our clients the best possible service,’ says Mónika Blasco, CEO of the agency.Harry and Meghan considered breaking protocol by springing a surprise visit on the Queen when they believed they were being blocked from seeing the monarch, a new book claims.
Finding Freedom, serialised by The Times and Sunday Times, says the Sussexes were "unable to secure time with the Queen" despite repeated follow-ups with Buckingham Palace.
Harry was told his grandmother would not be available until 29 January.
"He felt like he was being blocked," a source told the book's authors.
"As their Air Canada flight made its early morning touchdown at Heathrow, and still with no appointment to see Her Majesty, Harry and Meghan toyed with the idea of driving straight to see the Queen."
Released extracts of the book, written by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, shed fresh light on allegations of a downturn in relations between members of the Royal Family.
Rift between the Sussexes and Cambridges
The book claims that the relationship between the Sussexes and the Cambridges grew so bitter that by March the couples were barely speaking.
The couples hardly acknowledged each other at a service to celebrate the Commonwealth at Westminster Abbey on 9 March despite not having seen each other since January.
"To smooth things over, the Cambridges agreed to take their seats at the same time as the Sussexes and the Earl and Countess of Wessex," the book says.
"But if looks were anything to go by, the Cambridges were unhappy with the decision. While Harry and Meghan both greeted William and Kate with smiles, the Cambridges showed little response."
Although Meghan tried to make eye contact with Kate, the duchess "barely acknowledged her", the authors said.
Mr Scobie told the Times: "To purposefully snub your sister-in-law... I don't think it left a great taste in the couple's mouths."
The book explains that while the couple had been in a "slightly better place" after Archie's birth, "relations fell apart again in January as the family negotiated Meghan and Harry's new roles."
It says: "William, a Kensington Palace source explained, remained upset that private family matters were made public by the couple. 'It's not anger', the source told the authors. 'It's hurt'."
Growing tensions with family members and palace staff
The book describes a culture of increasing tension between the Sussexes and other members of the Royal Family.
"Every conversation, every issue, every personal disagreement, whatever it may be, involves staff," a source told the authors.
"It creates a really weird environment that actually doesn't allow people to sort things out themselves."
The book claims Harry and Meghan felt their complaints were not taken seriously and believed other royal households were leaking stories about them to the press.
"There were just a handful of people working at the palace they could trust," the book states.
"A friend of the couple's referred to the old guard as 'the vipers'.
"Meanwhile, a frustrated palace staffer described the Sussexes' team as 'the squeaky third wheel' of the palace."
Struggles with negative press
Unpleasant comments in the media were "getting to be too much" for Harry, the authors write.
One newspaper headline, "Doesn't the Queen deserve better?", was read by the prince online.
He later told a friend: "These people are just paid trolls," the book says. "Nothing but trolls… and it's disgusting."
"Scrolling on his iPhone, he sometimes couldn't stop himself from reading the comments on the articles."
Meghan 'willing to do whatever it takes'
Harry and Meghan felt they had been "patronised" by other family and staff members for too long before they made the decision to step down, the book says.
"People had humoured them when they brought up grievances, never thinking the couple would actually do anything drastic.
"The explosive reaction was a direct result of their growing impatience. If other members of the family and those working with the households had taken their requests more seriously, it wouldn't have reached that point."
Either way, a source told the authors: "The courtiers blame Meghan, and some family do."
While the media speculated that Meghan was behind the couple's move to LA, the book claims she was "willing to do whatever it takes" to remain in the Royal Family.
She is said to have told a friend in March: "I gave up my entire life for this family. I was willing to do whatever it takes. But here we are. It's very sad."
Harry stripped of honorary military appointments
The authors write that the "most demoralising aspect" of the deal was Harry being stripped of his honorary military appointments.
"That's been a tough pill to swallow, and one that has been most painful to Meghan witness him go through," a source close to the couple told the authors. "It's the one that made Harry emotional."
Meghan apparently later told a friend the move was "so unnecessary".
The book says she told a friend: "And it's not just taking something away from him; it's also that entire military veteran community. You can see how much he means to them, too. So why? The powers [of the institution] are unfortunately greater than me."
The latest revelations come after Harry and Meghan launched legal action in Los Angeles after drones were allegedly used to take pictures of their 14-month-old son Archie.
A spokesman for the Sussexes said: "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were not interviewed and did not contribute to Finding Freedom.
"This book is based on the authors' own experiences as members of the royal press corps and their own independent reporting."FULL HARVEST MOON IN PISCES- celebrate your achievements!!!

Perarivalan has filed a writ petition in the Madras High Court seeking a direction to the Tamil Nadu State Information Commission (TNSIC) to dispose of a second appeal preferred by him against the failure of the Home Department to provide details sought by him under the Right to Information Act of 2005 regarding the status of his plea for premature release.
Justice M. Dhandapani on Tuesday directed advocate Niranjan Rajagopalan, representing the TNSIC, to get appropriate instructions by November 29.

Even the second appeal was pending for long, the litigant complained and sought for a direction to the commission to dispose it of within a stipulated time.

The establishment of a trustful and secure environment is essential for teaching and working with migrants. Although this is an essential part of all teaching processes and social services, the question of trust and security gains even more prominence under the situation of migration especially, forced migrants. First of all, migrants are often confronted with a social situation which is alien to them. They may face the problem that people and their habits, neighbourhoods and communities, organisations and institutions work in a way that migrants are unfamiliar with. This leads to uncertainty and puts migrants in an uneasy and insecure situation. Teachers and other professionals dealing with migrants have to reflect this specific situation, be absolutely transparent about the goals, the tasks, and the methods used in the course/programme and make sure that all feel secure in the environment. (see also the section on ethics on our website:).
Trust is essential in the society, but specifically of relationships between professionals and their clients. To trust means that you rely on another person (trustee) who will not take advantage of your vulnerable situation and will takes care of what is entrusted. It is always a relation between a trustor, a trustee and someone or something that is taken care of by the trustee. For example, the teacher and other professionals have to make transparent which secrets are kept safe in the teaching environment. There are always asymmetries between trustor and trustee as the trustor is in a vulnerable situation. To trust means to show oneself vulnerable. It is essential for teachers and other professionals to value if someone entrusts something and that none of the participants take advantage of this situation.
Particularly, forced migrants have experienced that trust is betrayed. They often experienced traumatic situations in their country of origin when the social order erodes, the state and its institutions no longer care for the security of their members, when war and violence unsettle their basic trust. Furthermore, forced migrants are often separated from their folks who they trust and have to trust often unreliable persons. Finally, when they arrive, they realize that the resident population often distrusts the arriving population and that it is hard to orient themselves in the new environment with its institutional regulations, organisations, and professionals.
It is important to clarify this issue in the very beginning and to remind participants from time to time as well as to intervene systematically if there are signs of an erosion of trust.
It is all the more pivotal to explain all steps in a course/in a programme slowly, to make sure that the language is well understood, to provide translation wherever is necessary, to give time to talk and to reflect, and to enable participation in the process.Episode 4

Professional Removal CompaniesLocust Projects presents Remnants, a new site-specific project by Miami-based multidisciplinary artist Loni Johnson. The exhibition opens to the public with a reception on Thursday, September 9 from 6-8pm, and is on view through November 6, 2021 Wednesdays-Saturdays from 11am-5pm. Admission is free.
"This installation is based on creating a safe space for Black women. To serve as a platform for Black women to be seen and to reflect on who we are. How we navigate through the world and beyond. This installation will propose and engage in thoughts of how ancestral and historical memory informs our existence in a society that continuously tries to silence and erase us." – Loni Johnson.
The installation pays its respects to Black women through altars that include photos from the artist’s matriarchy alongside traditional elements from the West African Yoruba cosmology that can be found and gathered in neighborhood botanicas and Dollar Stores. Everyday objects and decorations such as sequin, lace, and cowrie shells are offered as tributes together with hair beads, gold bamboo earrings, and mirrors – objects found in local beauty supply stores and used in women’s’ daily life to adorn and enshrine.
Remnants invites visitors to pause, breathe, and reflect within the space, offering welcoming, comfortable, and cozy seating and cushions. Painted the very same pink color Johnson lovingly remembers from her maternal grandmother’s home, the space fosters a feeling of nostalgia and belonging. Johnson encourages visitors to engage with the work, presenting offerings within the space from which viewers can collect a piece of the installation to bring home with them, such as cowrie shells, hair beads, and candies, leading guests to ponder the question of what remains of them within the spaces they exit from.
The project will be accompanied by a series of public activations intended to engage and provide access to contemporary visual and performance art throughout Miami’s varied communities. These programs within the public sphere will provoke intimate, inclusive dialogue between Miami’s BIPOC communities, artists, and creatives of all ages, encouraging an exploration of creative expression and self-discovery.

Unless you’re trying to grow a fiddle leaf fig in a small Brooklyn apartment, plant care is fairly uninvolved. But three-dimensional digital gardens need focused tending. They need to be constructed from scratch within a digital environment, with thought behind the shape, color, and animation.
In this workshop, artist Rachel Li will teach participants the basics of creating plants in 3D using Blender and Unity. Attendees will learn the basics of how to construct different types of plants before being taught how to animate them to properly react to light. Interested participants must have access to Blender (2.8 and above) and Unity (2018 and above). They will be expected to have a basic understanding of 3D modeling and animation, as well as game development tools in Unity. It will be helpful, but not required, to have some knowledge of game programming and Unity Shader Graph.
This is part of Killscreen’s Method programming (see below)

1 in 8 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime…. Join Melissa Wade every Wednesday at 10am for Working Mom Wednesday’s for important issues and topics that deal with women. Today we recognize national self check month and President of NC Sisters Network of the Triangle– breast cancer awareness – Valerie Worthy joined us to tell us the importance and best way to self check, and what to do in case there is a concern.
SOME FACTS:
1. 1 in 8 women in America will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime.
2. For women in the U.S., breast cancer death rates are higher than those for any other cancer, besides lung cancer.
3. Most women (about eight out of 10) who get breast cancer do not have a family history of the disease.
4. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women, besides skin cancer.
5. On average, every 2 minutes a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer and 1 woman will die of breast cancer every 13 minutes.
6. Every 19 seconds, someone in the world will be diagnosed with breast cancer.
7. The most significant risk factors for breast cancer are gender (being a woman) and age (growing older).
MY GUEST:
Valarie Clark Worthy has been a registered nurse for over 33 years and has been employed by Duke University Health System for 13 years. Currently she is a Patient Navigator Manager at the Duke Cancer Institute.
Valarie, a. She is frequently sought after as a dynamic speaker and compassionate healthcare professional.A will is a written document that explains how you want your “assets” — your belongings, money and real estate — to be “distributed” (who they will be given to) after your death. A will only applies to assets that do not pass automatically to joint owners or persons designated as a “beneficiary.” In your will, you can name the person you want to be in charge of following your wishes. This person is called your “executor.” After your death, your will must go through the Probate Division of Superior Court before any distributions can be made. (See our page about “Going Through Probate.”) Even if you think you don’t need a will, having a will is a good idea. A will lets you decide how your assets will be distributed. If you die without a will, your assets will be distributed to your family based on standard rules for everyone in Vermont. (See “What If There Is No Will?” on the Going Though Probate page.) A will can also provide a plan for the guardianship of your children who are under 18 years old. Do I need a will? If you have children who would need a guardian if you died, a will is a good way to plan for the guardianship of them. In addition, a will is particularly useful if you have assets which will go into your estate upon your death. If all of your assets pass to other people when you die and you do not anticipate coming into other property of value, then you might not need a will. Sometimes people are told that they should do a trust rather than a will because going through probate is expensive and time consuming. Despite what you may have heard, it is not always expensive or time-consuming to go through probate in Vermont. Consult with a lawyer if you have any questions about whether you should have a will or how your property would be distributed upon your death. Examples of how property can be distributed at the time of your death without going through probate court. Even if there is a will, all assets in the table above will be distributed according to the table, and not according to the will. How do I make a will? You must be over age 18 and must be of sound mind when you sign a will. Being “of sound mind” means that you know what property you own, who it would normally go to (even if you do not want it to go to them), and that you have a plan for how you want it distributed. You must sign the will in front of two witnesses who must watch you and each other sign the document. A person who will get something under your will cannot be a witness. When you sign a will, you are “executing” a will. Do I need a lawyer? You do not need a lawyer to draft your will, but it is a good idea to have a lawyer do it. While there are many forms available on the internet, they are not all valid or good. Many are not written with Vermont laws in mind. Because your will becomes final at your death, you will not have a chance to “fix” it or to change it if you have made a mistake. A lawyer can write the will taking into account your unique needs. A lawyer will make suggestions about what to include in your will. Anybody can “file a claim against your estate.” That means they want to inherit some of your assets after you die. Just because someone has filed a claim does not necessarily mean that he or she will win. A properly written will can reduce their chances of getting money or property you intended to go to some else. How do I revoke or change a will? You can “revoke” (cancel) your will by: executing a new will and signing it according to the law where you sign it signing a document revoking it in the presence of two witnesses, or physically destroying the will with the intention of revoking it. You can change your will by writing a new will, or by executing a “codicil.” A codicil is a document that changes a part of your will. The codicil must be signed in accordance with the same rules for signing a will. (See “How Do I Make a Will?” above.) More information about wills Contact us if you have more questions. We can’t usually draft wills, but we may be able to answer basic create your will by contacting the Vermont Bar Association’s Lawyer Referral Service at 1-800-639-7036.

The majestic St Cyprian's Cathedral adorns Du Toitspan Road in Kimberley with the timeless beauty that many a cathedral imbues. This building has the longest nave of any church in South Africa, which is partially illuminated by the hues that emanate through its stained glass windows.
With figures from the Old Testament lining the Dean’s side and those from the New Testament on the Precentor’s side, these richly symbolic windows serve the purpose of not only beautifying the cathedral but of instructing viewers by depicting selected events from the Bible.
Although it has a history of more than a century, this building isn’t the first St Cyprian’s church building in Kimberley. Even in the unruly days of the first diamond diggers’ camps, there were those of the English Church who met together in a tent in 1871 – which was the founding of the Parish of St Cyprian. Later this progressed to meeting in the first St Cyprian’s church building in Market Street, to the iron church building in Jones Street from 1880-1908.
Today’s cathedral is still very much in use. For more information contact the church on Tel 053 833 3437 or visit their website5.0

K. Joshi) (6 June 1935-15 May 2020) was an Indian physicist. He was born in the village of Anarpa in Kumaun,UP (Now Uttarakhand), India. Dr. Joshi is an example of a person with hard work rising from a humble family background to the highest levels in the field of Science and Technology of India. Dr. Joshi studied at the Allahabad University and did his Ph.D. in Physics from there in 1962. His broad field of research interest. After retiring in 1995, he was awarded the Sarabhai Research Professorship in Physics and worked on condensed matter theory at the National Physical Laboratory in New Delhi.
Prof. Joshi’s life journey from a small village of Uttarakhand to raising the position of Director General of Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, (DG, CSIR), New Delhi is motivational example for the aspiring youth of rural areas of the country that with their determination and hard work they can also achieve any position in science and technology fraternity. During his schooling days, he used to walk everyday several kilometers of tough terrains of Himalaya to reach his school. For his higher education, he moved to Allahabad University and obtained BSc and MSc (Physics) degrees, both with first class. In 1957, being the Gold medalist in MSc, he was offered the position of Lecturer in Physics at Allahabad University. In parallel, he started his research work in measurement of diffuse X-ray scattering from organic crystals for his doctoral degree with K Banerjee and received his PhD degree in 1962. In 1965 he was offered a position of Visiting Lecturer by University of California, Riverside, USA. After working two years in USA, he returned to India and joined as a Professor of Physics, at a pristine age of 32 years, at the University of Roorkee (now IIT Roorkee). His experimental work during his PhD and his experience in US, got him seriously interested in theoretical studies of lattice vibrations, i.e. phonons in metals and insulators. In metals, the frequencies of phonons depend on the response of conduction electrons to ion motion, and he proposed a successful phenomenological model incorporating electron response. He was one of the pioneers to understand the lattice dynamics of d-electron metals (e.g. copper and nickel) using a non-interacting s and d bands model. He investigated the electronic band structure using Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker method. The virtual crystal and the coherent potential approximation were used to calculate the electron states in a number of disordered binary alloys. He was one of the rarest Indian scientists who contributed a Chapter in Solid State Physics, published by Academic Press in 1968 on Lattice Dynamic of Metals, and other contributors in this book include Charles Kittle.
He also proposed a new variational method for the periodic Anderson model to study the ground state behavior of heavy fermions and estimated the c-axis resistivity of high temperature superconductors. NPL also started the work on nanotechnology. He investigated transport of electrons in mesoscopic systems, particularly, the conductance of a single quantum dot and a double quantum dot system. Apart from being an outstanding scientist, he was a visionary leader as well. Prof. S.K. Joshi was elevated to the position of Director General of CSIR and Secretary, DSIR, Government of India. It was the time that coincided with beginning of the economic liberalization in India and he successfully steered CSIR for the national scientific and technological needs. He served the nation in various ways. He played a crucial role in establishing new institutes of higher learning viz IISER, NISER, New IITs etc. He guided leading institutions of the country through the Chairmanship of their apex Boards, including IIT Roorkee, Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai, Institute of Physics, Bhubaneswar, Indian Association for Cultivation of Science, Kolkata, Recruitment Assessment Center (RACDRDO), Recruitment Assessment Board(RAB CSIR), Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology (VNIT Nagpur), Inter-University Accelerator Centre (IUAC), UGC-DAE, Indore etc. He also served as a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee to Government of India. He also served as Chairman of selection committees to select Directors and Vice Chancellors of many prestigious Institutes and Universities.
Research contributions:. Latest research interest of Dr Joshi was related to strongly correlated electron systems like high temperature superconductors. He also worked in nanoscience, especially electron transport in quantum dots and nanotubes. Dr Joshi has supervised the Ph.D. thesis of 20 scholars and has published more than 190 research papers.
Academic recognitions: He received D.Sc (honoris causa) from Kumaon University in 1994, from Kanpur University in 1995, from Banaras Hindu University in 1996, from University of Burdwan in 2005 and from Bhimrao Ambedkar University (Agra University ) in 2008.

Final words:
Prof. Joshi immensely contributed to Indian science and academies by serving at various positions. His passing is a great loss to the nation. His immense contributions to the Indian science and technology will always be remembered and will always act as guidelines for the growth of science and technology in the country with simple living and high thinking attributes. Professor S K Joshi has been known as one of the best science leader and condensed matter physicist of the country. In the last phase of his life, he was suffering from cancer in his thigh and was confined to bed but had his usual charismatic smile beneath which the deep pain of the illness was evident. Prof. S.K. Joshi was married to Hema, a gracious and charming lady, who during their 55 years of togetherness supported him in his personal (a strict follower of early to bed and early to rise) as well as professional (follower of simple living and high thinking)life. He leaves behind his wife and a son Sanjay, who is well settledat a high position inUSA with his family.As November came to a close, the Charlottesville Area Tree Stewards continued their work on improving the landscape at Charlottesville’s Jackson-Via Elementary School. Elise Burroughs, who spearheads this project, worked with Kay Flanagan, Allen Ingling and Kathy Nepote to remove invasive vines and brush. This cleared the way for a follow-up planting day, when Elise, Allen and Kathy were joined by Camille Wilson, Robert Orton and Toine Wyckoff. They added 10 native trees and shrubs to the school grounds, including hackberries, redbuds and red twig dogwoods. They finished up by placing wire cages around the new plantings to protect them from browsing wildlife and other hazards.Image Source: Amazon One sure way to give your patio or backyard a touch of style and creativity is to

I am yet to be able to sell a single one of my paintings. For over twenty years I have been painting diligently with fervent dreams of artistic success. Unfortunately, I seem to be the only one left who believes that this success is still possible. People see my paintings and they do not understand what I am doing. They think I am untrained and naive. An unenthusiastic “interesting,” is the most often used descriptive response to my work. I have left my paintings on sidewalks to see if anyone would steal them- but the paintings just sit there. Getting galleries, restaurants, museums or any other establishment to hang my art upon their walls is like pulling teeth. Nobody seems to want to see my art except me, myself and I.
The other evening when I was talking to my wife about my decades old desire to earn a living as a Painter, we had another fight. She is frustrated by my inability to see the reality of my situation. “You have been painting for over twenty years and can not get shows. No one has shown any interest your work for years! I love you and I like your art but come on, when is it time to get real real?- you are yet to sell a single painting!” she replied. “This does not mean I will never sell a painting. I mean look at van Gogh or…. (I was unable to come up with another name), they could not sell a single painting in their life time and now their work is worth millions,” I replied like a man defending his property. “Who is they?” my wife rhetorically replied. “You only referenced van Gogh, that is only one out of thousands. Are you equating yourself to van Gogh? -because to be honest with you honey- you are no van Gogh.”
I beg to differ. I think that my talent as a Painter is equal if not greater than any Painter that has ever lived. It may be a latent and unskilled talent but this does not invalidate it. My ability to portray a world that does not exist any place other than in my head- is unrivaled by any other artist I have ever seen. I do not believe that there is anything quite like my art in the world. My value as a Painter is greatly underestimated and unappreciated. So what, gallery owners and museums do not respond to my submissions. Does this mean that I am helpless? What I know for certain is that if I do not find a way soon to make the world realize my artistic value- than I am afraid that my life will be relegated to a nine to five job, salary, health benefits, certifications, and a mortgage that I can barley afford. I will have become a mere image of what I had dreamed myself to be and my painting studio will be cleaned out to make room for the baby and its crib. Shit.
I can tell no one who knows me about being a Plop Artist. If my wife finds out that I am taking my paintings and hanging them upon walls illegally- I know that she will not only loose respect for me but she will become infuriated. She wants a comfortable life where there are no concerns about her husbands arrest. She takes comfort in believing that I am a law abiding Anarchist who has never been in jail. If she found out that I was jeopardizing her domestic dreams by illegally hanging my paintings on museum, gallery and corporate office walls (without permission) I know it would not only destroy her illusion of me but also end my marriage. But this is only if I am caught. If on the other hand, I am discovered, and someone wants to buy one of my paintings or provide me with artistic representation- than not only my career as a Painter but also my dreams and my marriage will be salvaged. My despair will float away like ripples in a stream and I will be entered into Art History books. I am willing to take the risk.
I always check the garbage first. The following day, after plopping my painting upon a wall, if my painting is not yet in the garbage than I know that it is either still hanging on the wall or someone has kept it. I have hundreds of paintings in my cob web ridden painting studio- so giving a few away for free is the sacrifice that I have to make to get my name out into the world. I often leave my business card with my website address besides the painting that I have just plopped down- and it has just occurred to me that this is not such a good idea since it could lead to my arrest. “Never leave a paper trail,” my grandfather used to say to me. Shit.
The other day I hung one of my paintings in the San Fransisco Modern Art Museum right besides Paul Klee’s “The Tightrope Walker.” There was no security in the room at the time and there was a small open space upon the wall which I could not resist. I took the painting out from under my long black coat and stuck a tack into the wall upon which I hung my painting. It was a little out of place but I desperately wanted to hang one my paintings right besides Paul Klee. Just as I was straightening the painting out, a group of what looked like Japanese students walked into the room. I quickly backed away from where I was standing and waited to see if they noticed my painting. They did not. They walked right past it without even a subtle remark.
My heart sank when I was putting one of my paintings on the wall of the TransAmerica building. I stuck the tack in the wall and put my painting up right when a security guard said to me “sir, you are not allowed to handle the art.” “Sorry officer, I just accidentally ran into the painting on my way out to lunch and I was trying to straighten it out,” I replied. “Just please step away from the art sir,” he said and I continued on my way.
At this moment in San Fransisco I have art hanging in several galleries, two museums, a few corporate office buildings and in some restaurant and bar bathrooms. If you are in San Fransisco and you go to the Museum of Modern Art, Hang Gallery or the TransAmerica building- you will see my work (if it has not yet been taken down). I have been plopping for almost a month now and I am determined to make a name for myself before the school year starts and I have to go back to my day job as a high school English Teacher. “When are you going to take the certification test and get your Teaching credential?” my wife keeps asking me. She wants me to secure my career as a high school Teacher so that we can begin to plan having a family and maybe even buy a house. “I will do these things soon, soon,” I tell her with the intention of putting it off as long as I can hold out. Maybe I am trying to avoid the inevitable, maybe there is no hope for success in my artistic career. Maybe I am a 37 year old burn out. But I only have one life to live and I am determined to live and dream. I will keep plopping my paintings on walls all over this city until I either get caught or discovered by somebody who recognizes the artistic genius that I know I am. In the meantime, I still have not sold a single painting.

I have been following your blog for some time. I would like to discuss with you a possible opportunity to turn your blog into a book. I will email you, but please contact me if you are interested.
I appreciate your humor and good intention- but you must be kidding?
Is Pequin Books the eastern division of Penguin Books then? Shit, Randall maybe they have different tastes…
Wouldn’t that be ironic? To blog about not being able to sell your paintings, or write this elusive novel and someone couldbe – I say that with a truck load of salt – interested in publishing The Life of Randall.
Don’t say I didn’t say this a week ago!
And then you can use your art as cover design for the book. Success! Plop Art sounds like guerilla art. Brilliant idea except the not getting arrested bit. I think you should get arrested, get a civil rights lawyer, plead your rights as an artist, front page of the paper, instant fame. We will organise a Free Randall campaign and sell tshirts to pay for your defence. When you get out you will sell a million. Your wife might object though.
And that link does go to Penguin Books… who knows,
That is quite funny Paul. And I must admit, Mr. Sanders- I thought this was a prank pulled by you since you did indeed say it a week ago. As far as The Life Of Randall- that may be a little too incriminating for me. How about, The Life Of A Nobody Particular.
However I did receive an email and the comment was earnest. Who knows how this new pitch will turn out, but I am curious to see who would be crazy enough to offer me a book deal. The irony, oh the irony of this strange life of mine…and all of yours.
Moi?
No, no… I would do no such thing as to play with the wants and desires of those who are enlightened enough to have them.
Have fun though and if it does, one day, hit the shelves I will be there – if only to ‘plop’ my own novel in front of it.
Hilarious. Well said Mr. Sanders. Well said.
I hope you except my apology for momentarily incriminating you.
Oh, I would buy Your art! I like this one: It’s weird and wonderful. But in order to afford it I would have to sell some of my own paintings first… which is easier said than done… 😉
You know Randall…it doesn’t actually take a lot of time to make a book in the pdf format, with all the writings in this blog and name it as you did “The life of Nobody Particular.”
I know that you are a procrastinator when it comes to writing big books, but your short story writing style equals that of great writers. You are on an equal footing with them.
Yes, I am a perpetual procrastinator. Today however I have to mop the hardwood floors in our house or else the flees are going to eat my wife and I alive (I have been putting this off for months).
Your compliment has really made me feel very good. Thank you, since today has been yet another day of heat, challenges and delusions. The flees are even jumping upon my computer as I write this!!
I must go- but thank you again Sajins!
I think you are multi talented. Your paintings and your words are unique and in a good way! I struggle with both.
Tell your wife you can’t stop painting..’tis an addiction, a disease, a curse!! Hmm..maybe we could start a support group. Oh wait a minute those are called workshops.
So you are an English teacher…now I am nervous about you visiting my blog! I already covered myself though on my about page, but I am asking your forgiveness for all of my spelling and grammar errors. So as my girl Amy Winehouse says: “I told you I was trouble, you know I’m no good.”
Please keep us posted about the book…put me down for a signed copy!
Well, I’m starting to shake so I’m going to the studio for my daily fix/hit/shot of painting.
Hey are contractions legal?? :O
No, contractions never count in my book. I see grammar only as a kind of tyranny that needs to be dis-empowered and re-invented by creative writers and thinkers. One needs to learn grammar only so that they can then break it down.
Thank you for your heart warming comment…maybe the reason why I have been having a perpetual anxiety spell is because I have not been getting may daily fix. Thanks for the reminder and the support- If I am ever published I will send you a dozen signed copies (to give out to friends, pets and uptight co-workers and grammatically correct employers).
laughter is good for the soul… 20 years, thaz not so long… passionate plopping painter and rebel to boot… is it really true..yr on the verge of divorce again… oh lordy…
No more, all is well since I sold a painting.
Wow!
Can you take me under your wing?
I’m working for more than 20 years.
I was very luck moving my art around
when I was monk.
Anyway I’m not making any money with my work.
It’s hard to believe that you never sold nothing.
But it’s no new about how horrible the art market can be.
So… Let’s cry out together.

Yes, I am all for a partner to cry with.
Oh, and Carlos Luis, this man is a friend of mine. The two of you must meet!
I don’t know about your art, but your writing is great.
Thank you for the compliment. Maybe I should plop my writing instead.
I went back to The San Fransisco Museum Of Modern Art today and my painting was gone- so I put another one up in the mens bathroom.Tag: Deputy Communications Minister

Building homes in Ringwood New Jersey back in the early eighties, I watched a thriving sales market whither as mortgage rates rose. The higher the rates followed the mortgage market trend of adjustable rates. This was the same mortgage market trend mirrored in recent times.
The lambs are led
I cringed now as I cringed then. Eager homeowners lured by the lower rates and the more lenient approval process of the adjustable-rate yielded by the mortgage market. Now, as then many of the buyers were first time buyers who needed the leniency edge. Notice I said edge and not break. Even I could foresee the long term would offer them no breaks as rates were sure to rise. The result for many of the families was a financial slaughter.
Is there survival in this mortgage market?
Going back to the early eighties’ experience, I can say yes there will be a survival in this mortgage market. On all sides, the building, the buying, and the selling. Each sector will have its hurdles but it can be done.
New home prices rise in a mortgage market like this.
Believe it or not, it is a selling strategy that works. The market slows and new construction home prices begin stepping up gradually. It is a technique that takes new buyers on the edge and pushes them into action before the home they want goes out of reach. The reason being these people find ways to deal with the higher rates now in anticipation of the downward swing. Furniture and accessories are put off and down payments many times are supplemented by family. It is a short term method to attract sales that work.
People who sell in this mortgage market
Usually the sales in the high-end market or smaller homes for empty nesters looking to downsize remain active. Of course, companies that supplement transferees, (think the acronym for I’ve Been Moved) also feed the real estate and mortgage market. Also, some people choose to relocate from a high-end market to a lower-end market during this downswing. They get more bang for the buck and have the equity already behind them. Plus they usually can afford to wait it out for a buyer.
The prudent buyer
This person scours for reseller home deals in this mortgage market. Again this is a person with equity behind them that can afford to wait out the mortgage market. A lot of home flippers act on homes where the price has significantly lowered because the family needs to get out from under their adjustable mortgage. Their loss is someone else’s gain. A true entrepreneur sees opportunity in this market. If you’re inexperienced with buying a home and unsure of the mortgage setup to maximize the buying opportunity, it doesn’t hurt to get an expert opinion about these things from professionals like the spearmortgage team.
So, yes there is survival in this mortgage market.
For those with savvy, there will be the benefit of making a profit. I was privy to know a young couple that was renters during the eighties. The started during the most difficult part of the mortgage market to buy their first home. They never moved in. The husband is a master carpenter even at his young age performed a few inexpensive improvements. They flipped the house two months after purchase. For several years they continued to rent while flipping houses. By the time the mortgage market began its downturn, they lived in a home worth short of half a million with a fifty thousand dollar mortgage. They both also by that time had become real estate agents. Today they live in an even bigger house and deal in high-end real estate.
Opportunity can be had in any mortgage market.
Yes, you do have to have certain resources. You have to do your homework on both the real estate and mortgage market. You have to be willing to have alternatives and a backup plan. You also have to weigh your risks and not be so quick to jump in. Going back to my experience in the eighties, it was tough for builders. Those that survived were the owners and the tradesman willing to find ways to employ their skills. And of course people with determination, savvy, and the willingness to look for opportunity or even create it do more than survive. They profit. Just explore your options fully before you decide. You may find your silver lining in the cloud of an upswing mortgage market.
Charging Your Mortgage Payments
Would you want to earn cash points for your credit card by charging your mortgage? American Express allows cardholders to charge their mortgage payments. American Express is the first credit card company to provide this.
Well, don’t get too excited. You have to have a mortgage with American Home Mortgage Company. However, is this the beginning of a new trend?
American Express has a Cashback program with the American Express Blue Card. I have had it and it’s pretty good. They also have other point programs. However, so far it appears to apply to the American Express Blue Card cashback program.
There are limitations to this program besides using the American Home Mortgage Company as the lender. American Express is limiting this to cardholders it pre-authorizes before enrolling them in this program. American Express will examine the mortgagee every month before the payment is charged to ensure that the loan is current.
This is also limited to new home prime loans or refinancing prime loans. This means no subprime features which have become less popular these days with lenders. Adjustable Mortgages are also allowed, however, with limitations. This appears to be more geared towards those with good credit and conventional loan to value ratios. Higher ratios are given to government loans like FHA and VA. Those type loans are not permissible under this program. I have not seen any restrictions for investment loans or vacation homes. There could also be a minimum down payment above what you could normally get without this program. You would have to contact American Home Mortgage for further information on that.7 Best WordPress Twitch Plugins for Online Streamers 2021
Are you looking for the best WordPress Twitch plugins for your website?
Twitch plugins offer an easy way to display your Twitch streams and activity on your WordPress website without writing any code. As a result, you can grow your Twitch followers quickly and engage them with your website content.
In this article, we share the best Twitch plugins for WordPress you can use to grow your channel.
Why Do You Need WordPress Twitch Plugins?
There are several reasons for connecting your Twitch channel with your WordPress website. The most notable is it allows you to display streams from Twitch directly on your website.
By streaming content to a standalone page on your website, you make it easier to find in search engines like Google. And with good SEO optimization practices, you can attract tons of organic traffic to your site, with the potential to increase your subscribers and Twitch followers.
Typically you can do this by pasting the Twitch embed code on your website. But this isn’t so straightforward if you’re unfamiliar with code snippets.
Yet, a Twitch plugin uses the Twitch API to handle the complicated details for you, making it a lot easier for non-techy users to integrate Twitch with WordPress.
But that’s not all.
You can also use WordPress Twitch plugins to:
- Broadcast your streaming status
- Publish your steam’s schedule
- Promote other Twitch streamers
- Grow your email list
- Attract more social media followers
- And more
So with the right tools, you can use your Twitch channel to grow other areas of your business.

You can even include the action to leave a blog comment. This is an excellent tactic many bloggers use to increase user engagement. And with photo contests, you can get free content for your website.

A 10-year-old boy from Fulwood who taught himself how to solve a Rubik’s cube has raised almost £500 for Rock FM’s Cash for Kids by completing a timed challenge.
Oliver Coupland watched YouTube videos to learn how to complete the puzzle using algorithms. He then set himself the challenge of solving a Rubik’s cube in between two and six minutes in line with the 2.6 Challenge.
In an uncanny twist, Oliver completed the challenge in two minutes 26 seconds.
Oliver said: “I started learning the cube a few months ago and during lockdown I had lots of time to practise and watch the online videos about how to solve it. I really struggled to understand the first video on how to solve the third layer. I then found another video and put them both together to teach myself. It’s all about learning different algorithms and looking for the available pieces to work with that algorithm.
“On the day I solved it for the first time, my Mum had read about the 2.6 Challenge and suggested I could do something with my Rubik’s cube. Cash For Kids help children who haven’t always got the best living conditions and are sometimes short of food and basic supplies, so Mum and I thought this would be a great charity to raise money for. They also support the school where my Mum works.”
Oliver set himself a fundraising target of £100 but has so far raised over £450.
“I felt a bit nervous about doing the challenge in case I didn’t manage to do it. I was also really excited because if I did manage to do it then I knew I would raise a lot of money.
“I feel really happy about all the support I’ve had and so many people are really proud of me. I feel so excited when my iPad pings to tell me I’ve received another donation!”

In a world where the amount of lifestyle related preventible illness and disease is at an all time high, it’s becoming common knowledge that we need to make lasting changes that will support our bodies so we can continue achieving and doing all we want to in life. This is often easier said than done. Everyone knows that we ‘should’ eat more vegetables, sleep more, drink more water, move more. But actually knowing ‘how’ to incorporate these healthy habits into your already well established, busy routine is hard.
After leaving school, I went straight into working in the Film and TV industry. The hours were long and very unsociable, there was a lot of travelling, living out of a suitcase and hotel rooms without a kitchen or time to cook anything fresh. Over the years the combination of very little sleep, no time or energy to exercise, and surviving off catering and sugary processed food took a toll on my health. I gained weight, had bad skin, developed debilitating migraines and stomach problems. I felt anxious and depressed most of the time - I completely lost touch with bubbly, positive, carefree Hannah that I had been growing up. I knew I needed to make a change.
I became fascinated by the theory that food could be used as medicine and how what we eat impacts our health. Almost over night I stopped eating processed foods and refined sugar and instead turned to cooking everything from scratch. I was astonished by how almost immediately my symptoms subsided, if not went away completely. I actually had more energy to get through my long days and started to get my confidence and glow back. With this knowledge, I have been able to take control and heal my symptoms and health complaints, including a parasite I picked up whilst travelling which made me very ill and left my gut incredibly unhappy. I managed to get rid of the parasite and heal my gut through diet alone and no antibiotics or need for conventional medicine.
Although the quality of what we put into our mouths plays a vital role, this isn’t just a diet, it is a lifestyle and a way of prioritising your wellbeing. I have found yoga incredibly beneficial throughout the process of healing my gut. Taking some time out of our fast paced lives everyday, connecting to our breath, calming down and reducing stress has such a huge affect on our mental and physical wellbeing including proper functioning of our heart rate, blood pressure and digestion. Plus it leaves you with an extra spring in your step.
Having changed my life so dramatically for the better, I want to help and inspire you to take control of your own health and wellbeing. It is my goal to overthrow the belief that being healthy is boring or hard work and inspire everyone to get back into the kitchen and start cooking again. When I first made the change to eating more home cooked whole foods, I was amazed by how simple and how much tastier it was than my previous heavily processed diet - now I would choose a homemade, crunchy oat and gooey date caramel millionaire slice over a shop-bought, sugar laden option any day.
So if you are feeling ready to jump in and make the shift too, I would love nothing more than to help guide you towards better health.

My question regards the surprise resignation of CIA chief Petraeus. Is it truly a matter of having an affair to end the service of a man who has served his country for so many years? Is there more involved? Any relation to the pending announcement? [and from another] Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has demoted the former head of U.S. Africa Command who was accused of spending thousands of dollars on lavish travel and other unauthorized expenses. The demotion came after retired Army Gen. David Petraeus resigned as CIA director because of an extramarital affair and Marine Gen. John Allen was being investigated for potentially improper communications with a woman. [and from another] 5 US generals reprimanded or investigated in past 2 weeks. CIA Director David Petraeus, the former four-star general and top commander in Afghanistan, resigned as spy chief after the FBI uncovered evidence that he was having an extramarital affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell. Ward, former head of U.S. Africa Command, was demoted and ordered to repay more than $82,000 for inappropriate and lavish spending on travel. Brig. Gen. Jeffrey Sinclair is facing multiple sexual misconduct charges, including forcible sodomy, involving five women, including female officers who served with him. Gen. John Allen, top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, is under investigation for potentially inappropriate communications with Florida socialite Jill Kelley. Adm. James Stavridis, Supreme Allied Commander of NATO, was cautioned by Navy Secretary Ray Mabus to exercise better oversight of his staff after an investigation into travel and expense questions, including a trip to a wine dinner in France.
If the DIA and the CIA were the primary source of the 3% fighting to keep
the cover-up in place, what might they be planning to unseat Obama?
Petraeus and Allen were both among the top brass working to keep the
cover-up, and trying to embarrass Obama. When Libya erupted, the embassy
attack, it was at the hand of Israel who hoped to make Romney look strong,
Obama a failure in the Middle East. But al Queda was an opportunist and
mustered a stronger attack against the Libyan embassy, and this fact was
kept from the White House by Petraeus, though his excuse is that he was
keeping covert operations secret. How else were Rice and the initial
briefing of the Congressional committee ignorant of the fact?
Petraeus hoped to make the Obama administration look inept, and the truth is only now coming out. Thus as soon as Obama had won the election, those within the administration who knew this approached him about replacing Petraeus, with the information they had in hand for some time – the affair. This is obviously not an accident, as these two generals are in powerful positions and the planned announcement ran amuck of the cover-up crowd, of which the DIA is a player. Petraeus was forced to resign, though Obama feigned reluctance. The FBI was instructed to involve Allen, as his flirtations were likewise known. Both these men have now been removed from power, and others within the military wanting to block Obama’s announcement have gotten the message.
The plan in midsummer was to put those who were aggressively carrying out the Reagan Executive Orders for secrecy on the approach of Planet X via assassination under house arrest until after the announcement. But how does one do this to the Director of the CIA or someone as powerful as General Allen, currently under consideration for promotion to a yet more powerful position? House arrest was not possible, but removing them from power and diminishing their status within the military is possible. Three other generals were added to the mix – Sinclair, Stavridis, and Ward – all prosecuted almost simultaneously though their offenses were known for months or even years. The 3% are being warned.
Now the Obama administration has won a second term what is going through their heads in relation to the announcement? With all the major obstacles dealt with prior to the election are they ready to try again or are they going to wait until after Xmas in the New Year? With the Mayan date close by do they want to wait until this has passed so the populace do not link this false end of the world date and Planet X together and panic or do they perhaps want to do it this year so people make an association between the two and start thinking about the end of the world and consider that the calendar is a bit of out sync and therefore start to think that the passing will be more extreme than what the announcement implies (assuming the announcement does not mention a Pole Shift as an outcome)? [and from another] A central tenet of the Muslim faith is the future coming of Imam Mahdi or the Imam at the end of time. He is also known as Q'aim or the promised one. Mahmoud Armhedhinajad is a firm believer in the imminent arrival of Imam Mahdi. Almost every one of his major speeches make references to the Mahdi and has even said that he expects his arrival within a matter of a few years.
Will the supposed end of the Mayan Calendar on December 21, 2012 create a
conflict for the planned announcement of the presence of Planet X by
Obama? This was always a concern, but the visibility of the Planet X
complex in the skies and the increasing Earth wobble has pressed the
establishment to make this announcement as soon as possible. It matters
not if the announcement comes before or after the December date, as the
connection will be made by some in the public. The connection will also be
made to Biblical talk of the End Times, the Rapture about to happen, the
Antichrist about to emerge, and a final battle about to erupt in the
Middle East. Muslims would look for their Madhi to arrive.
The announcement also runs amuck of all the cover-up excuses that have been used – Global Warming, Solar Flares, Quad Poles on the Sun, a skewed Galactic Plane, various comets such as Elenin, or earthquakes caused by HAARP. None of these have any basis in fact but will continue to be argued with even more vehemence after the announcement as the real cause of the Earth changes, because those who promulgated these lies don’t want egg on their faces. It will even be claimed that the real cause of the Earth changes – Planet X – is itself a lie.
The press to finally explain to the public why the Earth has a wobble, erratic weather, increasing earthquakes, and bright orbs around the Sun has not gone away. Those perpetuating the cover-up concluded that unless they explain, the public will realize the truth on their own and blame the government for the cover-up. If they tell the truth, they stand a chance of being one of the good guys, rather than one of the bad guys perpetrating a cover-up and withholding information. There is frankly no way to avoid the circus that is about to ensue, though the announcement by NASA is planning to include mention that Planet X has been in the inner solar system for years, and is moving slowly, to counter the expectation by some that something dramatic is to happen on December 21, 2012.
The supposed end of the Mayan Calendar was, as we have explained, incorrectly determined. It was the basis of a plethora of books making profits, even though meticulous avoidance of a passing planet as the cause was the norm. The authors did not want the harassment that ZetaTalk received for telling the truth. Thus there is little nexus between the pending announcement by Obama and the end of the Mayan Calendar, though many wanting the stage will attempt to make that nexus. Prophets of every color will try to grab the stage. The circus is about to begin and there is no avoiding it.
With the upcoming visit by President Obama to Myanmar to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi who is one of the most compassionate leaders of any country, and following the full eclipse tomorrow in Australia, it appears that this could be a synergistic moment for disclosure. There are so many major quakes in Myanmar and I assume that his visit is going to focus on the upcoming events, could the Zetas ascertain whether there is a coincidence in this coming meeting? [and from another] As President Barack Obama prepared Sunday to become the first U.S. president to visit Burma, he defended his decision to make such a historic trip even as deadly ethnic violence continues in the country long viewed as a pariah state. Human rights groups have argued that Obama’s trip comes before Burma’s regime has undertaken sufficient reforms to justify such a visit. The president landed here Sunday to begin a four-day Asia trip on which he’s set to make history by becoming the first U.S. president to visit Burma. The trip to Thailand, Burma and Cambodia had the potential to be a post-election, international victory lap for Obama.
Why did Obama chose to go to Myanmar, Thailand, and Cambodia when his
schedule is crowded with the Fiscal Cliff and he is planning to restart
the announcement process? He feels he must personally warn them about his
upcoming announcement. Cambodia is where the East Asia summit is to take
place, so all the countries on the Sunda Plate will be available. But why
Myanmar and Thailand? They form the coastline across from Bangladesh and
India, which are sinking. Already there are tensions between Myanmar
and Bangladesh land. What will happen when a frantic populace from
Bangladesh and India try to migrate in earnest?
Indonesia has sought to explain the sinking in its lands with a rain excuse, and when that failed, with claims of water extraction from the ground causing subsidence. Malaysia is murdering their buoy maintenance men to keep the cover-up going. What will they all do when the truth explodes in the press? Obama has explained that the US cannot be viewed as a haven for those displaced by the flooding, as it will have its hands full when the New Madrid adjusts and the Aftertime flooding arrives. Asia must look to its own, though it clearly has scarce resources.
Where the conference is billed as an economic summit to counter China’s influence, there is an obvious conflict in that China has land that could absorb drowning refugees from Asia, as does Australia and New Zealand. Australia has punished those attempting to immigrate, and New Zealand closed its borders firmly as has China. Africa is poor and will be above the waves that will engulf much of the world eventually, and has yet to be explored as to its willingness to partner with countries in Asia. At the very least, Obama is planning to tell Asia to brace for the announcement and its likely impact on the plans of its peoples.
The Zetas have stated that the announcement will not be made until after the election. While the public vote will be known this week, the actual vote that elects the President isn't until December 17 when the Electoral College registers their official vote. Is it possible that due to a potential "rigging" of the Electoral vote that the announcement may not come until after December 17?
Given that Focus Groups assembled to test the likely public reaction to Obama’s public announcement indicated disbelief, is there any concern in the Obama administration that restarting the announcement shortly after the election, and before the official Electoral College vote on December 17, might cause the college to declare him “crazy” and not fit to be President? In that NASA’s role is to present the factual portion of the announcement, why can’t they go first? If there are any glitches in the system to prevent Obama’s announcement from streaming to the public, the glitch would hit NASA’s presentation, and spare Obama embarrassment. This is the current plan.
We have seen a rapid decrease in the buoys now reporting near Australia. A quick glance today at ndbc.noaa.gov indicates that only four of the eleven buoys are now operational, two northwest of Australia and two south of New Zealand. All other buoys around New Guinea have been taken offline. The two buoys southwest of Thailand in the Bay of Bengal are not in tsunami event mode, yet reflect missing information. Also, north of New Guinea toward Japan numerous other buoys are no longer relaying information. Might the Zetas confirm if TPTB are taking these monitors offline, or if they are truly becoming non-operational due to the ocean conditions where they are sited.
There has been a steady pattern whereby government provided information
sources that show the visible presence of the Planet X complex, or the
twisting of the magnetosphere, or earthquake prevalence and force, or any
other means by which the public can plot or prove
that the government have been lying be removed from public view. This
happened early when the magnetic simulator located in Japan was closed
down, supposedly for lack of funds. An alternate simulator is now in
operation, which is more difficult for the public to read and understand.
SOHO has periodically been taken down ostensibly for maintenance but it was deemed that removing this facility permanently would raise too many question, so the SOHO was always returned to operation. Earthquakes have long been skewed on the charts, so they are at least a magnitude lower on average than their true magnitude.!
Please tell us about the discovery "for the history books" that NASA's Mars rover Curiosity recently made. [and from another] Mars Mystery: Has Curiosity Rover Made Big Discovery? The discovery was made by Curiosity's Sample Analysis at Mars instrument. SAM is the rover's onboard chemistry lab, and it's capable of identifying organic compounds — the carbon-containing building blocks of life as we know it. The $2.5 billion Curiosity rover landed inside Mars' huge Gale Crater on Aug. 5, kicking off a two-year mission to determine if Mars has ever been capable of supporting microbial life.. the news will come out at the fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union, which takes place Dec. 3-7 in San Francisco.
NASA is obviously creeping closer to announcing life on Mars, which is
patently obvious given the live mouse recently captured on film. Why now?
For decades Hoagland has tried to get NASA to film the Face on Mars with
more detail, while NASA has studiously avoided that part of Mars on their
flyover missions. When evidence of dust covered city streets, roads, and
irrigation ditches show up, NASA falls silent. Now that the high
definition Curiosity is roving about, and the results released to the
public almost directly, even more has become evident. The Annunaki were
there, Mars sustained life such as herds of goats and sheep, and sustains
life still.
The cover-up over the presence of Planet X is collapsing. The cover-up over the presence of alien life, intelligent life other than mankind, has proved burdensome. Having lied for decades, it is hard to come clean. Roswell happened, and Skinny Bob was the survivor. Pilots and astronauts have seen and filmed UFOs regularly. Why not just say it? They would prefer to avoid the sharp slap of anger and disgust from the public, would prefer to ease into so as to dilute the public’s anger. They will say that Mars sustained life in the past, hinting that such life bearing planets may exist elsewhere in the Universe. Meanwhile, the public is meeting with the visitors on spaceships in increasing numbers, two billion and rising as of last count, leaving the cover-up muttering in their cups at geophysical conferences.
The head-honcho of Catholicism etc, Joseph Ratzinger aka Pope Benedict XV1, has apparently released a book , in which he is publicly casting doubt on the accuracy of the purported year in which Jesus died, and thus also the accuracy of the christian calender itself, claiming it to be up to 7 years out. Mr Ratzinger aka the Pope stating: "The entire christian calender is based on a miscalculation". Of course this is nothing new, however, it is the source and timing of this being trumpeted on the web, in the mainstream, which makes this notable. Many have cocked a suspicious eyebrow at this, it being, most suspicious. Perhaps this is a little obvious, but, would the Z care to enlighten us re this? Is this an Establishment attempt to befuddle the Common Man, re when to expect the coming Cataclysms aka Pole Shift? [and from another] The Pope Says The Entire Christian Calendar Is Wrong. Nov. 21, 2012. The assertion that the Christian calendar is based on a false premise is not new – many historians believe that Christ was born sometime between 7BC and 2BC.. [and from another] 2012 Mayan apocalypse calculation might be off. October 19, 2010. The accepted conversions of dates from Mayan to the modern calendar may be off by as much as 50 or 100 years. That would throw the supposed and overhyped 2012 apocalypse off by decades and cast into doubt the dates of historical Mayan events.
If the doubts about the date of the birth of Jesus have been known for years, why is the Pope waiting until a month prior to the supposed end of the Mayan Calendar to make his official announcement? He is casting doubts on many aspects of the myths surrounding the birth of Jesus too. Question what your experts tell you, seems to be the message. That the December 21, 2012 date for the end of the Mayan Calendar is subject to debate is also nothing new. As we have stated, it is wrong. This too is likely to get more press as the date approaches, because those who have used this 2012 date to placate the public’s anxieties about End of the World theories will need to reset.Proper estate planning allows you to make personalized, informed decisions about your finances, health and other goals. You can look after yourself and your family, all while meeting your financial goals.
You can avoid mistakes and instead make informed decisions about your future by familiarizing yourself with myths about estate planning.
1. Everything will already go to my spouse.
Although the fact that your marriage does make asset division easier, you also need to think about what will happen if you do not have a will or trust. For example, if your spouse remarries, if you choose to leave money or property to your children or if you and your spouse die at the same time, you need estate planning documents to control the division of your assets in these situations.
2. My family will automatically honor my wishes.
Family relations are unpredictable so you never know how your relatives will behave after your death. Estate planning makes your intentions very clear and ensures that after your death, your family will follow your wishes.
3. My estate plan is set in stone.
Consider updating your estate plan after any major event in your life. This includes a birth of a child, death of a named beneficiary, a separation from your spouse, your remarriage or retirement.
You can keep your wishes for your estate up to date by changing your will, trust and other documents as life happens.
4. Estate planning is only for the wealthy.
When it comes to estate planning, your wealth is significant. No matter what valuables you own or how many assets you have, you can still have direct control over their distribution.
5. I do not need to plan my estate now.
You are never too young to begin thinking about estate planning. Since life is full of unpredictable events, developing a proper estate plan, no matter where you are in life, will give you and your family peace of mind.The Pet Report Is Here To Stay
It is an absolute sick feeling when you can't find your pet. The mind starts racing as you try to stay focused while looking for your best friend. We are going to focus on dogs today since April 23rd is National Lost Dog Awareness Day. These anxious moments when the dog goes missing can quickly turn to joy when you are reunited with Fido or Max.
Let's focus on the reunion aspect. Many times owners and pets see each other again thanks to shelters, vets and social media. The other tried-and-true approach to make sure that a happy reunion takes place is the Townsquare Media Pet Report. This is good old-fashioned radio that many label as archaic but we still get calls each week asking us to announce a dog that got away.
It is one thing to post it on the station website and on our station facebook page. But social media probably has already been attempted so it is time to announce this on-air. The important info to announce is, when the dog was lost and where. Then we need the dog owner to describe your canine as much as possible. We have never calculated the success rate but we have assisted with numerous joyous reunions over the years.
This is what local radio is all about. In a small market like this, getting the word out on our Otsego County, Delaware County and Chenango County stations(depending on where you are) can be invaluable. So while some may bristle at hearing the pet report, they don't see what we do. Hearing the panic in the owner's voice when they call in and then having them call back showering us with thanks after they find their dog is beyond worth it. It is National Lost Dog Awareness Day but you can call us any day at 607-353-9042 and we will get your lost pet on the air as quickly as we can.By: B.J. Dinesh Kumar

Social Engineering Course Summary
By: B.J. Dinesh Kumar
October 2, 2020
Some people consider hacking to be all about the use of technical capabilities or software. Well, they are wrong - in part. Everyone can learn how to use individuals to get confidential information, which would help them in their tasks, called Social Engineering—wondering how this is useful? Most of them would have read this famous saying over the internet, stating, "it is much easier to fool someone into giving you their password than it is for you to try hacking their password (unless the password is weak)." Now let's get into the review of the social engineering course.
The course is divided into four modules. Module 1 is an introduction to social engineering. Module 2 explains phishing and explains how to use it in a lab environment. Module 3 is a conclusion with a skills assessment test. The final module is a course assessment for this course, "Social Engineering."
In module 1, the first part of the introduction explains the three components of social engineering: elicitation, interrogation and pretexting. It also explains the different types of social engineerings, such as phishing, spear phishing, whaling, pharming, hoaxing, shoulder surfing, baiting, tailgating. The second part explains the different ways to protect against social engineering attacks focusing on the behavioral and technical type of control. Behavioral control is nothing more than the concept of "If you didn't request it, don't click on it." Some of the basic behavior controls are to validate links before clicking them, validate the sender, or scan the links, which would protect them from getting hacked. Technical control includes Sandbox, Endpoint protection, application/execution controls, whitelisting, and compartmentalization.
In module 2, they will learn about Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET), an open-source Python-based toolkit that can be used to perform social engineering attacks. SET is part of Kali Linux. Using SET, they can perform various attacks, such as email phishing or Web-based attacks. In this exercise, they will learn about using SET. After completing this exercise, they will be able to:
- Create a Malicious Payload
- Copy the File to the User's System
- Download the Payload
- Execute the Payload
- Collect Evidence of Compromise on User's System
- Conduct Social Engineering Using a Cloned Website
Lab 1 is a phishing lab where everyone will create a phishing email, observe how phishing emails can allow outside access, and generate a phishing awareness email. Everyone will be using SET in Kali Linux to launch a mass email attack using an Adobe pdf file as an attachment to the email. This exercise displays how a malicious email can be used to gain escalated privilege on a target system. Lab 2 will use social engineering to create a cloned website. A cloned website is a phishing website that resembles the original and steals user credentials. This tactic is also known as website spoofing. Our task is to set up a spoofed or cloned twitter website and capture user credentials using SET.
Module 3 concluded with the things covered in the previous modules and suggested courses after finishing this if they are interested in penetration testing. In this course, everyone has learned penetration testing and ethical hacking, phishing, advance, and offensive penetration testing. Finally, everybody is provided with a social engineering skill assessment, which is nothing but small testing of the skills learned in this course. There is also a course review in module 4, which is also a skill assessment test that can be taken to test their skills. By the end, everybody will understand different types of social engineering attacks, behavioral and technical controls that can be used to prevent attacks, and how to communicate basic security awareness to others. Overall this course provides a strong foundation on the topic of social engineering.LOOKSEE LOOKSEE

You know what I firmly believe? That online jobs are the future. But, well, that’s just me. Now, one of the jobs with a low barrier to entry are article writing jobs. There are several article writing sites but today, let’s focus on iWriter. Godfrey, a good friend of mine, was kind enough to write for me this guest post. He’s earning more than $300 every week on iWriter, and he’s eager to tell us more about it. Here goes the iWriter review!
I joined iWriter in 2012 and I am now an Elite writer. I’ll tell you later what Elite is all about. iWriter is a legitimate company and if you don’t like bidding sites, you’ll be happy to know that all you need to do is sign up and pick a job depending on your rank.
I’ve gathered lots of experience writing for the company and I want to share with you some important factors that will help you start making $300 and more every week at iWriter. You will find these tips to be very helpful, whether you are a newbie or an experienced writer who is looking for writing jobs on iWriter.
I specifically get special requests from clients. I am currently on more than 60 requesters’ favorite writer lists. I sometimes feature on the iWriter homepage as one of the highest rated writers. Guess what, you can do it too!
Where Do I Start?
To begin, you need to register an account using your email address which will only take a few minutes. You will need a Paypal account too. After registration, log in to your account and click “Write Content” button on the main menu.
A new window will appear, listing the Available orders. As a new writer, you are only able to work on the standard articles, which are listed on the very last page of the orders (navigate to the last page, the pages are listed as 1, 2, 3 etc.). Click the (+) button to expand on an order. You will be able to either read the “instructions” or “write the article”. For now, you need to click on any standard article, which will lead you to a simple 15 question test. After passing the test, you will be able to start your article writing career on iWriter. This can happen in less than 30 minutes.
Read: 7 Mistakes that newbie writers make
Every new account is limited to one order after every 45 minutes. This means after you write an article, you will have to wait for 40 minutes before you pick another one. This limitation is placed on all new accounts, until you have 5 article approvals. The process goes faster if your requesters approve your work immediately you submit. You can only pick and work on one order at any given time. You will however be able to work on as many orders as you want in a day. Payment is prompt and you can choose to be paid on either 5th of the month, 25th of the month, Tuesdays weekly or Wednesdays weekly.I like that while competition for orders is high, you will always get enough orders to work on everyday.
IWriter New Site Updates
Test: A few months back, anyone looking to work on the iWriter platform only needed to register and start working on the site. Today, iWriter has introduced a small test – basically 15 simple grammar questions. The test is easy and most of the time you will get 14 or 15/15. If you fail the exam, you can contact Brad Callen and they will send you a link for another test trial after every 24 hours.
What About Ratings?
Initially, iWriter had only three tier ratings: standard, premium and elite. The company recently added a fourth one: Elite plus. Standard is the lowest rating, elite plus is the highest rating. From my experience, it’s not easy making even $30 weekly with a standard rating. You can make about $70 with a premium account weekly and you can easily make $40 daily with an elite account. Unfortunately, there aren’t many writing jobs in the elite plus section. If you are lucky though, you will be able to get even a $52 for 500 words (really motivating).
These images show you how the ratings look like. Note the highlighted colors.
Standard
Premium
Elite
Elite Plus
Exciting huh? Now, before you proceed, please note:
1. There are only a few jobs at iWriter Elite plus.
2. You will need to keep refreshing to get good jobs.
3. iWriter is not a get rich quick scheme. Be patient, submit quality articles and you will do more than just pay your bills.

iWriter Tips and Tricks
1. Rating: Again, the money is in elite and elite plus levels. From the very beginning, as a newbie, focus on your rating with little emphasis on the money. From the very first time you join iWriter, aim to get several 5-stars. The money will begin to trickle in after you hit a strong rating. It is important to note that hitting a premium or an elite level may seem easy, but maintaining the rating is an uphill task.
2. Your ability to pick good orders quickly before someone else picks them.
Use F5 key, Ctrl + R, or your mouse to keep refreshing until you get the right job to work on.
3. Your ability to quickly identify con requesters/ identify good orders.
Some requesters are cons. They will always cancel your order however good your quality may seem to be. I find most of my orders being approved because I choose the right requesters. You are probably asking how? Any requesters with threatening words like “I will report you to iWriter” “I will mark you as spam”, “Native English only”, etc. I avoid like Ebola. I personally ignore requesters who have very long instructions or poorly written instructions. And requesters who always give a 3.5 or lower rating even after doing a wonderful job? Hate it!
Read: Why writers need a pick a niche. Don’t write about anything and everything!
A good order will have a high approval rating, I advise 80% and above for newbies. Short, but clear instructions. I love re-writes because they are always approved most of the times, unless you do a really shoddy job. If a requester approved your work earlier, chances are high that he/she will approve your work again. I easily maintain my 5-star rating by going for $1 articles, or $2 articles (in the standard section) as the requesters will always go with my default 5 star rating. Only do orders you understand and have the confidence you can deliver on. If I were a new writer, I will also want to avoid working on orders listed by new requesters, they are likely scam.
4. Quality! Quality! Quality!
I cannot stress this enough. To earn good money on iWriter, your quality has to be unquestionable. A 5-star article must have a good structure, an attractive title, and you guessed it, no spelling or grammatical errors. Make use bullets, numbers, sub-titles too. A high quality article is informative, answers all the requester questions, is well researched and educates the reader (Not fluff to fill the number of pages). Learn how to use the iWriter editor, write somewhere else (probably on a Word document) then paste on the editor. Note that copy pasting from Word doc to iWriter editor distorts some characters.
Quality check: After writing your article, say a draft, you need to polish to ensure everything is perfect. To get the best results: First, manually proofread your document for errors on the word document. Secondly, use the word document spell checker to correct errors. Thirdly, use a free tool like ginger software to check for grammar errors (you can also use paid plagiarism checkers like Grammarly or Copyscape). Lastly, read manually again for any errors. You will never go wrong with this simple four step quality check. Use images where necessary, or you can add image links (be careful though, some image links are reported as plagiarism by Copyscape).
5. SEO Skills
It’s very easy mastering basic SEO for iWriter purposes. You need to learn how to use your keyword. You also need to understand the keyword density. Basically, for a 500 word article, use your keyword once in the first paragraph (within the first 150 words). Use the keyword once in the last paragraph. Also add one keyword in the body of the article. Always go with requester keyword density and note that the more keywords you add, the higher the density climbs (you can learn this from the iWriter keyword density button just above the editor).
Read: What they don’t tell you about writing jobs
Underline, bold and italicize the keyword. Do not use the names of competitors or mention other products. Also, do not talk negatively about a product. Avoid talking about personal views. This applies always when doing other article writing jobs, from other websites.

6. Communication
When did you last send a private message to a requester? Well, if you have ignored this, it is high time you start talking to all your requesters. I literally ask my customers to give me a genuine 5-star rating, and I ask for it in a good way. Only ask for a good rating if you are sure you have written a great article. I have developed the habit of communicating to all the requesters. Not all requesters love being talked to and some will put you off from the very beginning. It is however critical that whenever you are handling a big project, say 2000 words or an eBook, talk to your requester before working on the order. If you need any clarification, please ask your requester as most of them will be glad to answer.
I always PM my requesters with a line like this:
“Hi, I wrote you the article [title], I know you will love it, kindly give me a good rating and review. I will also appreciate future special requests from you. If you however need any corrections or additions to the article, kindly send it back as a revision, I will be glad to fix it. Thank you very much”
What You Need To Know About iWriter Ratings
It is true that the more you stay in a venture, the more you learn. After having been in iWriter for quite some time, I have come to understand some unique aspects about writing jobs on iWriter:
Rating: The rating system on iWriter is designed in a way that it can either build or ruin your writing career on the platform. Example: If you write 10 articles on iWriter, and all the 10 articles are rated 5-stars, your account default rating changes to 5-stars. If you write 10 articles and all are rated (average rating) 4-stars, you will end up with a default 4-star rating. iWriter system takes the latest 10 articles you have done, calculates the average rating on the 10 articles, and uses the average as the default rating.
‘What are you blabbering about?’ you ask? Well, iWriter instructs requesters to rate a writer every time an order is submitted. The truth is that about 90% of the requesters will never give a genuine rating. Instead they use the system default rating (they just click “rate/enter” without moving the rating down/up). The trick is to always submit high quality articles for every 10 continuous 5-star ratings to ensure that your default rating is a 5-star. That way, whenever a requester rates you without changing the default, you accumulate several other 5-star ratings.
Note: If your article gets cancelled, your default rating drops down drastically. For every cancelled order, you need about five 5-star ratings to recover. You don’t want that.
When Will iWriter Ban Your Account?
- Consistently submitting poor quality articles.
- When a requester clicks on the button “spam” on your order.
- Rating yourself.
- Running more than one iWriter account in a single IP/Computer.
- Continuous complaints to support.
- Exchanging contact with requesters.
- Using abusive words.
- Login to different IPs with your account over a short period of time or when you use a proxy.
These may seem as a lot of work in the beginning, but once you jump the boat, it’s as easy as plug and play. You can also make it easier by always seeking for the help of an expert. You can depend on iWriter to pay some major bills, in fact, if things work out well for you, making $300 weekly on iWriter is a breeze.

Once again Sheeroh you have done it, made something that is authentic and powerful.
This post deserves a 5 star rating. thanks for such a post, I am sharing this with my network.
I thought it was awesome too! All thanks to Godrey. Glad you enjoyed it!
Very informative. I had a question to the writer, why do one source content?? Do you search content from the net or you be creative on a given topic?? Do you cite white you have acquired from any other source?? Thanks in advance.
Good guest post. Thanks Sheeroh
You’re welcome Samm.
Sheeroh thanks for posting the article. Am glad readers love it. It is now time for action, anyone looking forward to making money online. All you need is to read the article, get your computer and internet and you are ready to go, with the help of the experts around.
‘Action breeds confidence and courage’ said Dale Carnegie. Make it happen people! Take action as Godfrey says.
Aaaah!! hiyo article ni kali aki, I think we should always appreciate the power of everyone thanks sheeroh nice update.
I thought it was kali too! Godfrey really wrote an amazing piece here.
Godfrey and Walter Akolo are the guys behind my success on iwriter and online. Since I discussed how to succeed on iwriter with Godfrey, my ratings have improved.
Well done Anthony! It’s always good to have a mentor/ to network.
Walter and Godfrey are awesome guys. Good to know your ratings went up Anthony!
Nice article Sheeroh. Thanks for sharing
Welcome Rhena.
@Samuel, while it is advisable that you write the topics you are well versed in, sometimes you can also work on orders you have no hard facts about. The best way to go about it, is to look for information online, using related and relevant keywords, or the title given. Note that quality work is not taking one website as a source and changing words (most requesters will detect copied content from a single given website). While using three or more websites as your source, be creative to present your article in a new perspective. And never forget to format the entire article in your own way, using images, bullets, paragraphs, subheadings etc.
There is no need for citing an originally written work, however, only do so when a requester mentions anything to do with referencing. Note that you are writing website content here, not academic articles.
Its also important to note that all articles submitted to iwriter are subject to pass Copyscape, failure to which, they are returned to you for re-writting. You get banned from the site for submitting plagiarized work three times in a row.
@Godfrey
I know I can upload images to and get a link to inset within the article content. However, the submissions page currently has no ‘image upload’ button So, how do I paste a photo into iWriter’s text editor if I don’t want to use a link?
Great read. My learning journey continues.
Yes it does Faith. We’re always learning. And the person who refuses to learn, learn and learn some more, stagnates. Thanks for your comment.
This post is quite informative, and it has helped me identify some of the mistakes I make.
Point no 3, has helped me learn how to identify cons.
Keep the good work Sheeroh.
That’s great to hear George. We earn as we learn 🙂
Informative. IT still comes down to being helpful, writing like you are not doing it for the requester and the money he or she is willing to pay, but thinking about the ultimate reader, who eventually are going to benefit from the article the most.
Well said Philos
Very informative. I was however hoping to get information on the most appropriate time to take an order in out time zone.
i have always wanted to know how to go about online jobs and thanks alot Sheeroh for sharing.Godfrey u helpd alot wit tha info.
This my next job.
Welcome Nduati. Take action and start earning online. Online work, works!
just opened an i writer a/c.hoping to get my first job soon..
Hi Edwin. That’s great. How are you doing so far?
Hi there Sheero,
Superb post! I May have come into the party a couple of weeks later, but I like it. I am a Premium Level Writer on iWriter, and it’s true what Godfrey says about the site; from the writer levels and earnings potential.
Not sure though about the iWriter system using the last 10 ratings to score the overall writer’s rating. But am pretty sure a poor rating for a single article really messes your ratings in addition to requiring you to write around 5-7 5-star rated pieces to get even.
At other times iWriter is short of jobs. So I was wondering if you knew of other iWriter alternatives that a brother can deep his net. I understand there’s iWriter fierce rival, Textbroker.com, but they won’t allow non-Americans to pen content. Hate that!
As for bidding sites, Elance & Co, the bidding process is one of those things I totally wish brimstone rained on.
Would love to hear from you, Sheero. Superb content, I can’t stop reading your blog.
I just bookmarked this site. Wonderful work Sheeroh.
Thank you Polycarp 🙂
Very informative article. I opened an iwriter account about a month ago and I have the fear of taking up my first job but after reading your article I feel more encouraged n ready to getbon it.
Thank you Sheeroh
Hey Mercy,
Great to hear that. No fear here! 🙂
Read this and oh my, i definitely want to go for it. Never done online work before because i never believed it was authentic. I’m now signing up. Will appreciate any guidance i can get.
It is completely authentic Jackson and pays well. You just need a huge dose of determination, patience and the passion to keep learning.
Wonderful advice.It has really helped as I figure out how to start.Thanks Sheeroh
Most welcome Martin.
Sheeroh i think it’s a great experience, i just started iwriting today and i can say am still an amature. I’ll make sure we connect on facebook and may be you can be my on line tutor
Hi Stephen, My area of expertise is transcription but I’d be happy to connect you to Godfrey.
hi, your article is awesome and informative. i have created an iwriter account, but am not able to start. pls can you give me follow ups,as an assistance from the initial stage.
Hi. Where exactly are you stuck?
”Note: If your article gets cancelled, your default rating drops down drastically. For every cancelled order, you need about five 5-star ratings to recover. You don’t want that.”
I do not understand this?
I have canceled articles before even starting them or only a sentence or two written..
It may be the article is cut short and ended because someone arrives at the door. the computer acts up or any other number of reasons.
I saw no change in my star rating what so ever.
Also contacted support and asked of there was any penalty, they said ”no”.
Interesting point on the 90% rating the way they do, good to know!
@Bill, “if your article gets cancelled” this is what I mean: when you write an article on iwriter, upload it for approval, and then the customer gets discontent with your work and then cancels the article, your ratings reduces sharply. In short, when a customer cancels your work, the rating drops drastically.
On the other hand, when you pick an article and cancels it on your own, it goes back to the board for other writers to pick it. There is therefore no effect when you cancel an article on your own.
Note the difference: Nothing happens when you cancel your own article, but when the customer cancels your articles your rating reduces.
A very informative piece that was. I know better now especially that part on contacting a requester, sometimes i feel i wrote a brilliant piece only to be rated at 4. perhaps if i had asked humbly for a worthy consideration i would have got better. Keep up.
It’s not a great feeling is it? Now you know better 🙂
Hi. Great advice right there. I was wondering, how long does it take for one to be promoted from standard writer?
It depends on how hard you work. I think you can get it within a week if you wrote 5 articles per day.
Very informative article, thank you. I recently reached ‘Elite’ status and I was wondering what piece of advice you have to offer on tackling projects in this category. Anything I need to look out for? What should I do or avoid? Please guide me further
hi sheero…I read this article some time back in Feb this year and in late march i went ahead to register at I writer for the testimony given made me feel so inspired… luck I did the grammar test and got 13 out of 15 thus passed, then went ahead to take assignments,after a couple of days after submitting my first article I got some pay and felt happy about it.sadly barely a weeks time i logged on to my account for another assignment and got a message from the “admin” sayn my account is clossed due to low rating and bear in mind I had only 3jobs approved.
please advice on where I went wrong and what to do about it.
reach me at ngugi.nduati165@gmail.com.
will very much appreciate
Hi Nduati,
I can imagine how disappointed you must have felt. Many writes feel that way too. Accounts get closed many times due to submission of low quality articles. Continue to work on your writing skills: grammar, spelling etc and then open a new account.
I second the person who says the article should be a mini-eBook, its very detailed and to the point. However, i need clarification on something. How do you insert images when submitting articles on iwriter? I always have challenges when inserting images because the iwriter formatting automatically distorts the images. How do i go about it?
This is super-charged info! Thanks Sheeroh and Godfrey.
I’m an Elite iWriter myself after joining around November 2014 and writing over 200 articles to date. For someone with good writing skills, iWriter is definitely one of the easiest ways to start working online and earning a consistent income. But one thing I attribute my quick rise to Elite (and almost Elite Plus) rating was my ability to communicate with Requesters and getting Special Requests. I just needed to be on a few good Requesters’ Favourite List and I got more special requests than I could complete in a day.
Once again, thanks for the well written iWriter Review.
Hey Hillary,Thanks for sharing your experience working at iWriter. It just goes to show that if you are conscientious about the work you submit to your clients, and you are reliable and professional, you can make good money on this site. Cheers
This is excellent information Sheeroh. Though I’d learned some of this from my experiences over the last month, I didn’t realise ratings are based on the last 10 posts. I’ve only written 14 so far and earning 2 dollars per article isn’t encouraging. (I’m working my way up to elite status). That means a single poor rating e.g. 1 star from a disgruntled poster can massively drop your rating. I thought it was the average of all your writing, which would in effect “dilute” any negative reviews quite easily.
I strongly agree with what you said about carefully selecting articles to write. I don’t pick any location based ones, ones with complex, picky instructions, those demanding “native born” writers or articles from requesters who threaten to give you 1 star. The funny thing is that the requesters who make the most demands often have the worst grammar!
I too love rewrites, but there are rarely any at standard level. The good thing is how researching helps me educate myself in all sorts of areas. One last thing I do is read my article aloud to myself before submission. It’s great for spotting errors and punctuation needs. Thanks for a great post. Quite encouraging.
And God bless you Kevin! Thank you for being a hard working and focused student. It was a pleasure training you.
Thank you for your comment Bola. Very insightful. And I agree, when you’re researching and looking up stuff to write for the specific topic, it helps you learn so much more than even what you were initially researching about.
I recently joined iwriter as a new bie and failed the quiz .I got 12 out of 15 but im now happy after reading this great article.Im ready to keep it a try again and i believe through iwriter i will emerge a great artcle writer. My question is how to improve writing skills and grammar so as to be among elite plus writers? .Thanks Godfrey and God bless you so much.
There are plenty of free resources and quizzes on the net that help improve your grammar. You can also get courses on sites like Udemy or Lynda.com too. The courses are very helpful, though at a fee.
You may also need to have some tools at hand. Ensure you install Grammarly (spelling and grammar checker) for your browser. It is not available for Opera. FireFox and Chrome (and their derivatives) are supported. I am not sure about Microsoft’s Internet Explorer and Apple’s Safari because I do not use Windows.
This plugin will help you to improve your written English (Both American and British). Ensure you confirm the language the requester needs. If it is English (UK), you need to change the setup on Grammarly to match (British English). This way, you will submit grammatically correct articles.
You may also need CopyScape account. However, if you have Grammarly premium, you can identify more plagiarism than Copyscape.
Another thing you need to do is familiarize yourself with the US English writing style. You can achieve this by reading more of news articles from the US websites. Try to grasp the different ways and structures and how they differ from the UK English we learn in Kenya.
Please ensure you write more and more. Write emails, articles, etc. At least 3000 words a day can keep you going forward. Avoid chats and text messages that make you familiarize yourself with Sheng and shortcuts. Keep off ungrammatical language use.
Hope this little bit helps.
If you need more, you can email me at motukaminda[at]gmail[dot]com. Please replace [at] with “@” and [dot] for “.” for the sake of bots.
Best Regards in your endeavors,
Motuka Minda.
This is great info! I also want to share this article on how iWriter newbies can find article writing mentorship through Facebook
Thanx Sheero for such an informative post on making money on iwriters. I opened an account and I tell you it was hell for me. The standard level is filled with requesters about computers and software, something I have no expertise about.
I always looked at premium jobs and knew that I could handle them but not as a standard writer. I had written only 4 articles and yesterday, my account was banned due to low rating and I got disappointed. This account had over $10 and that money went just like that.
But after reading this post, I hope to get a premium account and get back to my feet again. Although I am very sad, I am in this article writing work to stay.
Thanx again.
Sorry to hear that Giddy. Those are just some of the things we have to grapple with as online entrepreneurs. But we don’t give up. It can be a bit demoralizing but you can improve on your skills, choose your clients better, and open another account. You can also try getting writing jobs in sites like Upwork, PeoplePerHour and Fiverr.
[…] () Writing Online Articles on iwriter: What makes it attractive? […]
I was searching for tips before getting started with iWriter and ended up stumbling upon this little gem. Your article is very informative and i will be sure to take into account every piece of advice listed here. Thank you for your help.
You are so welcome Jerome!
Following your advice has helped plenty, I do however have a question. What kind of formatting can be applied to iWriter articles? So far, I haven’t seen any tools aside from spell check.
Thank you again
Thank you sir for showing the way in such a good manner. It helped me a lot.
The article is very informative, it gave me an insight about how to be a successful writer in iWriter. As a newbie, I’ll use this information effectively to take strides ahead.
You are welcome Aden.
[…] Read Sheero’s review of iWriter right here to learn more. […]
Hi sheeron,
This is the best writing guide I have come across so far. Exactly what I needed. Shooting straight on my writing issues. Keep up the good work.
Welcome Moses.
I was just Surfing through the web when I came across this and I must say, it’s a much needed piece of information. Very informative.
I quit my job to focus on a full time online career and I must say, as much as being a newbie feels like tough luck, iwriter is not so bad.
Focus on the rating not the money. Got it!
That was a bold move, quitting to pursue full-time freelancing. But it’s well-worth the risk.
Yah, it was a bold move inspired by strong will to just have things how i want them. I don’t have the slightest regret though, it was an **dia* company and it sucked!!
The going is not so bad in i writer, last week i made 46.28, this week i made 66.something) i have really been improving.
They even made me a standard writer with 29 reviews and 4.4 star rating. I got a chance to meet one of those mean clients too, gave me a 1 star for some very wierd reason, but i worked again and raised it back to 4.46 star.
I am happy so far because i have not been really dedicating a lot of time to my writing, despite the fact that it is my sole source of income but i managed to make a not so bad amount. i will keep doing this and share the feedback with you.
One thing that made me want to pull all the hair off my head is that there is no means to get my hard earned money. I researched and got to learn that there are only 3 methods you can get money from Paypal in Kenya.
1. If you have a payoneer account(which Paypal no longer accepts from new users. Poor me.)
2. E-pay Kenya (with their outrageous commissions 11%)
3. Equity bank(got an email from Paypal saying that i can actually download my funds to Equity Bank) Pros; Decent Charges. Cons; It takes a whooping 5-8 business days to finally have the money in your account. Talk about a long wait.
Anyway, i ended up going with E-pay, Ouch!
I just needed money urgently, but….
Never again!
I agree. It’s takes way too long to get our funds, especially with Equity Bank. Why should it take so long to get my money? Is a question many a freelancer has asked. They ought to do something about that. Good progress on iWriter though. Keep it up!
Well, I started writing on iWriter two days ago, and did not consider some points, but my instincts gave me a clue… not to write many articles before confirming approval/rejection. As it were, my first article of 700 words was rejected with a 3-star rating. Second article of 500 words approved with a 3-star rating. Yesterday I only wrote one article of 500 words, the requester was good enough to send it back with more instructions, after which he approved it with a 5-star rating. Now I am beginning to understand how to get the best out of iWriter. I suppose if very careful, doing 4 articles a day is not going to be too bad, since $$$ is not the problem, but going up with the reviews.
Nice article,am looking forward to be on the same level with you guys
Good on you Allan. It’s very possible. Believe it!
This must be the most authentic and straight forward website I’ve came across in…Years. Good people,great content,and so much to learn. I appreciate everyone and everything on here. Great job! Thank you.
Sheeroh! I noticed you face a challenge with PayPal in kenya,with getting the money on time,or the 11% some take in order to wire it quickly,and I have to wonder:why don’t you find a way to solve it? I bet theresrmoney to be made there,too
You are so welcome Ari. It takes about eight days to get your cash when you withdraw funds from Paypal. Good thing is we have other options, like Skrill and Payoneer. But ofcourse Paypal is the mother when it comes to online payments. Feel to free to share the thoughts you had.
Sheeroh,
There now comes the story. I withdrew my funds last week from PayPal to Equity Bank. It has not arrived yet, and my rent has to be cleared by tomorrow. (Don’t mind my story, I was only saying it is slowwww.)
I have an objection about ratings.
Every rating you receive, even if it is years old and you have thousands of ratings on your profile, counts a lot. If it were the latest 10 ratings, many of us could have entered Elite Plus long ago. However, this is not the case. That is why I am still a premium member after 57 ratings on my profile, and an average of 4.2544/5.0
The very first articles had horrible ratings, averaging 3.something. When I received my 8th rating, my average was 3.1 and I was warned of a ban after I reach 10 with less than 3.2 but at 10, I was well above 3.3.
Things started going right for me until I became premium. When I was 4.29, some people drastically brought me down to 4.109, but I have again gone up a bit. One thing to remember, though, is that as you get more reviews, the more consecutive 5-star ratings you need in order to go higher. A single 1-star can ruin you for several weeks while you are getting good rartings. This is how important 5-stars are more important than the $$.
Let us keep going up. Meet you at Elite Plus.
Best Regards,
Motuka Minda.
Very true. A single bad rating will surely ruin you. So sad, wish they change that, say to at least three bad ratings before your overall ratings drop drastically.
Great informative article. Will you please elaborate that part about last 10 ratings, and default ratings?
Wow this is awesome. And you’re talking about 30$ weekly as a slow start for a standard writer, that’s 3k. Am good with that hehe.
Great content shiro! Iwriter.com has no jobs these days though. Thanks.
Hey Shiro. Have you tried logging in at night, say from 9 pm onwards?
“Hi, it was really interesting while reading it, well done great job sir”
I am looking for a Premium or Elite writer to help me get started on iWriter because I’m new to article writing. I appreciate your help in advance.
Hey, this is fascinating. It’s very useful for a start. What should be the target no of articles per week for a start to achieve the figure that you stated? I mean the standard level? I like your posts be it in transcription or article writings. What other article writing sites do you recommend that do not require bidding? Thank you in advance.
This guest post provides great info for beginners and thanks Sheeroh for the platform. You are doing a great job sharing useful info.
Danson, you have asked a great question, and I’ll try to share my thoughts. As the author said, you need to reach Premium, Elite or Elite plus status because payouts are better at those ranks. If you want to earn $300 every week, it comes down to deciding how much you want to get paid per article and how many articles you are willing to write every day.
After working your way up, you can choose to go for high paid articles only. So, let me give an example on how to go about hitting the above mentioned target. Amusing you decide to write 4 x 1000+words Elite Level articles daily, which usually have payouts of $14.99, you could earn $299.8 working Mon-Fri. Write one more article over the weekend and BOOM!, you’ll have earned $300 that week. Of course, you’ll have to produce original, high quality articles so that every write up gets approved.
To be honest, earning $300 every week on iWriter is easier said than done. High paid articles are not easy to come by because writer’s are quick to pick those kinds of requests. Unless you start getting large volume Premium or Elite level special requests, earning $300 on iWriter every week can be tough.
If you want to make income targets, visit >>> to see iWriter’s payout rates based on article word counts for the various ranks they have for writers.
Good luck.
Thanks for your comments Paul. Quite insightful.
it”is an informative article especially for beginners like me .i am now well informed about academic writing.can someone work as a part-time writer ?
This is exactly the way Iwriter works. But did you know that they are sometimes banning Kenya? What are some of the reasons why they ban Kenyans and deny them this much earnings?
very informative for a newbie like me,and so straightforward, thanks Sheeroh
I concur with much of the information provided on this article. It is especially quite helpful for any new writer. However, i also have an objection on the latest 10 articles. This is definitely not the case. The average is calculated from all the work done from day one. Thanks for the information though, its quite helpful.
Can you do this using a phone?
Write articles using a phone? It would be quite tedious.A laptop or desktop is recommended.
Sorry for being late.
All I can say is this is a Killer guest blog post.
A deep and composed information.Free? yea free.
Thanks for generosity showed.Surely we can help people get ti make money online in Kenya.
Big up.
Karibu.
Sheeroh, you wrote the best article I’ve seen on how to write for iwriter. I just signed up, but I want to make sure I understand the nuts and bolts of what they’re looking for. I’ve written online articles for Yahoo network, Helium, and now, Hubpages, the only one left, but articles for those sites are different than iwriter. I asked iwriter if I could view some sample articles to study them, but they don’t want to submit me any. Do you know where I can study sample articles that fit what they’re looking for? You mentioned linking images. How about linking references? How are they about that? Do they admit one link per paragraph, up to five per 500 words, or what? Good informative article, Sheeroh.
Hi Sheeroh,
Read your post at a time when I was really hoping to get encouragement on whether to continue writing on iWriter. I have written 3 articles so far and I currently have a rating of 2. I seriously need assistance. Can u help me get samples or tips especially on how to write quality articles. I am determined to make this work for me coz I love writing
I highly appreciate this informative post of yours.
However, I am worried about a few things like the “payout”.
You see, here in Nigeria, it’s not allowed to receive money into your PayPal account.
The only option is Payoneer.
I want to know whether Iwriter pay with payoneer.
No. On iWriter, the payment method is Paypal. You can register on Upwork as there are many payment methods to choose from there.
This is just awesome my sister. I will improve on a few areas that i was struggling with.
Great to hear that.
Hello…I like writing articles though… Unfortunately am trying to log in as a new iwriter but it doesn’t work..what might be the mishap?
It seems you are no longer accepting new writers?
Hi. Thank you for the informative writing. I am new on iwriter. At standard level, it is not easy to get an order. However, am working hard to achieve thirty 5-star rated articles to get to the premium level. I would any person who is passionate about writing to join iwriter. It is far much better than academic writing. thank you once again.
Very good article!
Can you please send me Godfrey’s contact information. I’m interested in hiring him.
Iwriter recently launched their “iWriter Blogger Pro” service here. However, looking at it they directly copied and pasted EVERYTHING from The Hoth who had launched their service earlier, here.
I find this is quite low and cheap if not shameful of them!
I believe they were bought by the guys from the HOTH. Brad sold the business last year, the HOTH are doing great things with it, there are a lot of orders on Iwriter of late.
The Hoth did a mass ban on Kenyan iwriter accounts citing IP fraud. What they are doing is not great but discriminatory. In fact, iwriter now has locked out African writers from signing up on the website.
Here is a tweet complaining about the issue. >>Common lithium before you buy?
As a consumer, let's hit pause and take a look at some of the most common questions people ask about lithium-ion rechargeable batteries and generators.
Are Lithium-ion Batteries Safe?
One of the top questions people ask about lithium batteries is whether or not they are safe to use. A lot of these concerns come from stories of these batteries exploding unexpectedly, but rest assured that these are extremely rare occurrences. Lithium-ion batteries are actually considered relatively safe compared to other batteries. And not all lithium is the same. Lithium iron phosphate batteries are the highest quality and safest type of lithium. Lithium polymer is the type of lithium in cell phones and hoverboards.
That being said, there is always the possibility of a random battery malfunctioning or operating incorrectly. Some things to watch for are weird smells, overheating, swelling, or leaking. Again, these are rare things to see in these batteries, but it's best to know what to look for in case there is a risk of fire or explosion.
Something you should be careful of with lithium-ion batteries is air travel. You can take these batteries on airplanes safely, but you can only take up to a certain size of battery onto an airplane. Check the restrictions on lithium-ion batteries for your airline before flying and you should be safe from battery malfunctions as you fly.
Why Choose Lithium-ion Over Lead-acid?
People sometimes buy lead-acid batteries when they need portable power. While lead-acid batteries can work, there are actually several disadvantages to choosing lead-acid batteries over lithium-ion batteries.
The biggest advantage of lithium-ion batteries over lead-acid batteries is the maintenance. Lead-acid batteries require a fair amount of maintenance the whole time you have them. They need to be cleaned and stored at proper temperatures for safety and longevity. And you can only use about half the stated energy of lead acid batteries, not to mention they are much heavier. On the other hand, lithium-ion batteries typically need no maintenance, can use all the stated energy and are lighter weight.
Another advantage of lithium-ion is its ability to hold a charge. When you use a lead-acid battery you have to be careful with the level of charge left in the battery. If you completely drain the battery, it can damage it. Lithium-ion batteries can be completely drained and recharged over and over again without damage. Additionally, if a lead-acid battery sits on a shelf fully charged, the charge will drain out in a couple of months. But a good lithium-ion battery can maintain a full charge for up to a year or more.
What Can You Use Lithium-ion Batteries For? How Long Can You Use Them?
Lithium-ion batteries can be used for a lot of different things. Smaller batteries or portable power units can be used to charge phones and laptops and even run lights for several hours. Larger units are capable of much more, powering things like TVs, refrigerators, and even RVs.
Because these batteries are so versatile, it's hard to say exactly how long the charge will last. Much of that depends on the size of the battery, how much power is needed to run or charge the device you're using, and how long you have the battery attached to the device. However, most batteries are able to run a device or appliance for several hours at a time.
How Durable Are Lithium-ion Batteries?
The durability of lithium-ion batteries depends a lot on the brand of battery you purchased. Some are designed for affordability over durability. That doesn't mean the batteries can't be effective but they may not last as long as more durable batteries.
The best lithium-ion batteries are built with a rugged, durable design that lasts a long time. They're made to be taken anywhere - camping, hiking, fishing, tailgates, road trips, and who knows where else - without being damaged. These batteries can last years if they’re well-built.
How Do You Dispose of Lithium-ion Batteries?
Because lithium-ion batteries are built with a variety of valuable materials and potentially hazardous chemicals, you can't just throw them into your municipal trash or recycling. If you do, they could cause fires or contaminate the environment. Instead, you need to make sure that they are disposed of properly.
To dispose of a lithium-ion battery correctly, you need to take it to a collection point for battery recycling or hazardous materials. This ensures that it is disposed of properly and not mixed in with the municipal trash. It's also a good idea to put the batteries in plastic bags or to cover the battery terminals with tape or plastic. Doing so will keep the battery from coming into contact with other metals and reduce the risk of fire.
If you choose to purchase a high-quality lithium-ion battery, you should be able to have it for several years at least before needing to dispose of it. But as the battery wears out, then it needs to be disposed of in a way that is safe for everyone and the environment. You'll need to check local guidelines for battery disposal to ensure that your batteries are disposed of properly.

The WallAdler Seeks New Valuer for Assets Disputed by Viceroy Report
(Bloomberg) -- Embattled landlord Adler Group SA is seeking a new valuer for some of its most contentious assets following accusations by Fraser Perring’s Viceroy Research that the company had inflated their worth.
The German firm invited real estate brokers to bid for a role valuing its development portfolio late last month, people with knowledge of the process said. The successful broker will assess the value of the company’s pipeline of construction projects which has been in focus because of widespread delays, they added, asking not to be identified because the process is private.
A spokesman for Adler didn’t respond to requests for comment.
Adler was plunged into turmoil in early October when Viceroy published a report including allegations that the firm’s approach to valuation was aggressive and out of step with peers. The company rejected the allegations and said it would appoint external independent advisers and auditors to conduct a comprehensive review, without specifying that the process would include a revaluation or providing further details.
Adler has also pledged to provide a more detailed response to the Viceroy report. While executives at the company have yet to speak publicly about the allegations, Cevdet Caner, the Austrian tycoon whose family owns a minority stake, has given interviews dismissing the research as fabrication. Caner’s lawyer has also filed a criminal complaint against the short-seller.
Adler’s 3.7 billion euro ($4.2 billion) development portfolio was last valued by NAI Apollo, and was then reviewed by KPMG, the landlord said in a statement last month. The portfolio includes projects owned by Consus Real Estate AG, several of which have stalled or are behind schedule, Bloomberg News has reported.
It’s unclear whether any new valuer will have time to conduct a full independent assessment of the development portfolio before Adler reports earnings at the end of November.
CBRE Group Inc. is the valuer for Adler’s so-called yielding portfolio of existing apartments which is valued at about 8.9 billion euros. Adler is selling off large chunks of that portfolio to rival LEG Immobilien SE and private equity firm KKR & Co. in a bid to raise cash and pay down debt.
While sales of those assets at book value would confirm Adler’s reported numbers weren’t inflated, the appointment of a new valuer to assess the development projects is designed to further reassure investors.
So far the company’s efforts have done little to resuscitate its share price. Adler currently has a market value of around 1.3 billion euros after a sharp-sell off following the Viceroy report, meaning the company trades at a steep discount to the reported value of its properties.
Meanwhile, German apartment prices in major cities have continued to rise even as the crisis around Adler has unfolded. Rival landlord Deutsche Wohnen on Friday reported a 1.5 billion euro increase in the value of its properties for the first nine months of this year, while Vonovia SE last week announced a 2.6% like-for-like increase in the third quarter.

Cognitive Skill Building For Business Effectiveness: CPG Industry Perspective
Swift decision-making, disruptive agile thinking, and collective learning are a few of the in-demand skills after the recent radical evolution. Change-makers and people leaders from the consumer product goods industry came together to discuss the major areas that require attention, to foster cognitive capabilities. The conversation also highlighted the need for recalibration of organisational learning and development strategies, to identify high potential talent and equip them with cognitive intelligence, for a future-fit workforce

The COVID-19 pandemic crisis has compelled businesses to take the lead in creating strategies that could move the company forward in the face of ever-present volatility in an unprecedented reality. Skills like agility, quick decision making, crisis management, upskilling, and adaptability were crucial in coping with disruption.
The ability to embrace uncertainty, active resilience and swift adaptability has become necessary, resulting in a rise in the need for cognitive abilities. Changemakers across industries chose to spot the invisible opportunities despite the intensively complex scenarios. The unconventional disruption has brought about a paradigm shift, whether it is in leadership approach or individual thought process.
“Team players and managers have to wear an entrepreneur hat. It is critical to derive the meaning of cognitive skills, specific to a particular organisation. Identify, define and then embed it in the success profile of every key role,” mentions Milan Chattaraj, Chief People Officer, MTR Foods. Adding to it, he said, “At MTR, we have developed strategies to build intellectual agility and decision-making frameworks to train the workforce for the unprecedented challenges.”
Cognitive Skill Development To Build Crisis-Proof High Potential Talent
Industry leaders from the CPG sector shared their observations and valuable insights during a virtual round table discussion on skilling a high potential talent pool, re-strategising organisational L&D plans, and the critical need for cognitive capability building. The discussion further emphasised how the recent disruption impacted the ever-evolving consumer expectations, demanding a revisualising of organisational strategies and plans, especially in the consumer packaged goods industry.
Crediting the pandemic for initiating numerous transformations, Souravi Sinha, GM-HR, IFB Industries said, “This disruption has given an ignition to the process of upskilling, but it was always there. We do recognise talent’s potential and offer opportunities post assessing to do cross-functional roles if one is capable in emulating skills to suffice the job requirements.”
From recruitment to each performance assessment, it is a critical process to identify various cognitive skills in talent to enable optimum productivity, along with mapping employee potential and interest inclination. Sales and more sales are the ‘core dharma’ (key) for most CPG businesses.
Accentuating the critical need to understand the current uncertainty, as cognitive abilities are highly subjective and difficult to measure, Sidharth Verma, Director Enterprise Solutions, Harappa stresses the top cognitive skills that are increasingly coming into play. He also points out “To be competitive has gone beyond the adoption of amalgamation of enhanced business processes and digital analytical solutions, but also to skilling up talent at all levels to build next-generation leadership bench, to build resilience and to bring in thought leadership is the core.”
Exponential Transformation of CPG Industry, Hyper Customisation In The Focus
Discussing the changing dynamics of the specific industry, panellists agree that it is highly needful to keep the central purpose of the organisation crystal clear across levels. A firm organisational purpose will help navigate managers, teams, and partners, for the future directional roadmap and serve business goals. These were insights coming from a recently concluded virtual roundtable discussion organised by BW Businessworld in association with Harappa, thoughtfully moderated by session chair Noor Warsia, Group Editorial Director, BW Businessworld.
As the market strategies are evolving, companies have to entirely focus on modern trade, e-commerce in place of traditional transactional business models. Consumers are highly focused on 'What’s In It From Me (WIIFM)’ which leads to customisations. Furthermore, consumers have varied demands and to suffice the same, companies need to realign their processes to be able to hyper-customise products accordingly.
“Now we live in a different kind of a world because the pace of change is very fast. There is huge competition in the market from both branded and non-branded players, the companies have to evolve. The companies must have clear upskilling strategies, cognitive skill-building has to be in sync with the business requirements,” Manas Martha, Senior VP, and Head HR, TTK Prestige points out.
Thanks to the pandemic, companies have been forced to transform their functional frameworks. CPG companies have had to ensure goods delivery in the ‘No Touch, No Meet’ scenario, and ideate a virtual set-up, to fulfil the business and market requirements.
Pivotal Need Of Strategies’ Recalibration To Build Future Fit Workforce
Thinking the unthinkable would always demand groundbreaking discussions, which could result in the development of disruptive models to work with. This is where employees’ competency framework comes into play, as it’s a huge part of the cognitive skillset.
As an unconventional learning platform, Harappa offers high-impact programs that help drive transformative career success. These programs focus on highly personalised learning, at scale. Harappa’s upskilling journeys foster must-have Thrive skills - an essential set of social, cognitive and behavioural skills to enable individuals to continuously succeed at every stage of their career. Nilanjan Kar, Chief Revenue Officer, Harappa presented research findings on the learning curve for cognitive skills. He also highlighted the emerging trends in the CPG industry and the factors moulding the workforce. Here are a few major key points from his presentation:
● AI technologies, machines, robotics, advanced digitisation are taking over in the industry. In 2018, only 18 per cent of reasoning and decision making was expected to be done by machines, but 28 per cent is expected to be done by machines in 2022.
● Around 76 per cent of CPG businesses reduced revenue goals by 23 per cent, but digital businesses helped in relatively faster recovery. The overall sector was prepared for the disruptive change and hence adapted swiftly.
● High-performing leaders, first-time managers, young talent have the element of these five habits framework i.e. think, solve, communicate, collaborate, and lead.
● Work that requires higher-order cognitive skills like leadership, decision making, mentoring would always demand human skills and is not going to be replaced by AI anytime soon.
● One size fits all doesn’t work with CPG; the leadership approach needs to resonate with the culture of the company. CPG as an industry would always require curated pathways and a growth mindset.
● According to Harappa’s skill map, the CPG industry shows that embracing change, thinking critically, and swift decision making are high priority competencies to focus on.
Diving deeper into the specifics of cognitive abilities, Satyajit Mohanty, CHRO, CG Consumer Electricals highlighted their current five major focus areas i.e. growth mindset, execution excellence, business priority, deep understanding of consumer data, innovation project management. He further stated these five as the emerging themes for capability building among the talent pool. He also shared that his current favourite area to work on is how to establish these successfully in a virtual work setup.
Cognitive Skill Building: An Imperative In The VUCA World
“The opportunity is to identify the areas to leverage technology and upskill talent for higher-order job roles, like judgment-based jobs which require decision making, 360-degree thinking, or the combination of empathetic understanding and intellect,” mentions V Krishnan, CHRO, Havells. The companies need to synchronise their fundamental frameworks, innovative design, and the right positioning of the right talent to get optimum performance.
“First, consider best performing talent as the organisation’s resource instead of function-specific top players. Second, don’t get carried away with data and analytics,” Krishnan points out.
During the discussion, BW Businessworld's Noor Warsia adds, "Many jobs are becoming redundant because of automation or advanced digitalisation, but in today’s market reality, increasingly research have shown that artificial intelligence can’t take over every aspect, but it shall be called augmented reality or enhanced human intelligence to be able to achieve business goals."
There is a need to build an environment that encourages constant unlearning and relearning. As technology improvises, learners demand more personalised learning programs. In the wake of an unprecedented crisis, the skilling strategy is being reshaped to become an integral part of the learning and development plans for an organisation. People leaders are highly committed to discovering various ways to offer learning programs, and build a learning environment that equips their high potential talent with cognitive skills, along with other high order abilities.

PEMBROKE WATERFRONT : Outdoor Activities, Best Boardwalk, Beach
Pembroke’s waterfront on the Ottawa River offers up to two kilometres of varying terrain, activities and spots to settle-in on its waterfront. It begins on the east end with a marina and a walkable pier, and extends all the way to Riverside Park on the west end by sauntering the pristine Kiwanis Boardwalk and paths. On arriving to the park you will discover the city’s own life-guarded beach and endless activities.
Pembroke’s waterfront is the best of both worlds, replete with options–peaceful if you are alone and engaging if with family and friends. It delivers an “ooh!” and a “wow!”
For picnics, you can hardly get this close to the water in a more immaculate setting while seeing and hearing the waves. You may get misted if the wind is blowing–no Evian spritzing required (it’s a thing.)
An excursion to downtown for unique shopping and its famous “outdoor gallery” is a short walking distance. Pembroke is the “Mural Capital of Canada.” Bring your photo devices as the murals are magnificent.
Kiwanis Boardwalk, Pembroke Waterfront, Pembroke, Ontario PHOTO BY theWedge.LIVE
Riverside Park offers much more than a beach. There is a city-owned and managed 75-acre campsite for tents and trailers with all the creature comforts, and endless activities for the public. The list includes a mini-golf, eight horseshoe pits, four baseball diamonds, five soccer fields, a basketball court, a playground, a brand new splash pad and a dog park–it reads like a Christmas song.
Every evening there are musical performances in its bandshell and on Tuesdays, movies in open air.
A canteen, two covered picnic pavilions, washrooms, laundry, and ample free parking conclude this location as our first pick for an extended waterfront stay.
Ice cream find : You’ll have to get into the car to get to the town’s two popular haunts, Brum’s and Lang’s, but on-site you will find a unique creperie on wheels–an adjunct to a gourmet crepe restaurant in town.

SMITHS FALLS WATERFRONT: Charming Walks, Kids’ Waterworld, Two Swans
Smiths Falls offer an uncommon experience on the Rideau River. This is our first choice for kids of all ages–and the kid in all of us.
Along the northern side of the Rideau, a manicured walkway undulates along water’s edge. It is charmingly populated with boaters speaking in other tongues especially French and German.
The walkway leads to watercraft and bicycle rentals–you can be in the water in minutes, kayaking, canoeing or pedaling a craft. Its canteen hydrates and feeds visitors without having to leave the site.
From this point, the waterfront becomes a diving site, a favorite for tweeners and teenagers. It is entertaining to watch them make cannonballs, climb up the ladders and do it again and again. The children are never happier than at this place, Centennial Park-Murphy Park.
Beyond this region a sandy, shallow beach reveals an oasis for toddlers. Parents can sit under shaded trees and keep close watch. There are two swans, the famous Duke and Duchess, who linger among visitors. It is conceivable they think themselves the same specie.

Almost all visitors walk over the suspended pedestrian bridge onto idyllic Turtle Island. Along with Duck Island they sit at the centre of the Rideau as it flows around them and you, 360 degrees. The views from this tourist enclave, its boaters and lock are best from here–and perfect for photos.

The pathway along the South side of the Rideau connects Victoria Park–where a yellow airplane adds to the view–to Lower Reach Park, under the Beckwith Street Bridge. It’s a healthy extended walk that will open to charming, Old Slys lock.
The south shore also features a campsite run by the Chamber of Commerce, a popular locale for seasonal trailers. Smiths Falls is our second best pick for day trips and longer stays.
Ice cream find : A brand new ice cream parlour in-town at the northeast end of the park serves visitors daily until 10:00 pm–it is conceivably the finest in East Ontario.

BROCKVILLE WATERFRONT: Stunning Views, Endless Attractions
Brockville offers a visual experience on the St. Lawrence–stretching 1.4 kms–as no other. Plan a whole day as there is so much to do. If you like the scene to change on the hour, Brockville delivers the ‘buzz.’ The town is beautiful–stunning–and replete with things to do.
You can watch cargo ships and scuba divers–from adirondack chairs on Centeen Park’s shore. Hardy Park and Blockhouse Island are glorious spots to ‘watch the show’ under shaded trees. When you have taken in enough nature, the famous First Railway Tunnel and Aquatarium are ‘must see.’
Cargo ships pass frequently and close to the shore, Brockville, Ontario, Canada
Interaction with the waterfront in Brockville prefers teens and adults as the water entrance points are limited to two concrete stairways at Centeen Park. They lead to short cement floors followed by a drop for divers and swimmers. Centeen is the leading soft water scubadiving site in the world and what lies beneath is exceptional : a memorial sculpture garden, its first underwater site for scubadivers.
The St. Lawrence’s numerous historic shipwrecks are popular draws for divers. Scuba diving classes are always in progress; they are easy to join and experience.
Westward between Hardy Park and Tall Ships Landing there is a boat launch that is the haunt of toddlers and parents interacting with ducklings–an amusing impromptu spot to wet their feet. It is also the best central area to park, right by a charming inlet.

Hardy Park, west of Tall Ships Landing, is a great destination to enjoy the views while picnicking. You can hardly get closer to the St. Lawrence. Imagine you are enjoying your meal while waves lap near you and cargo ships pass blowing their horns, “Hi Ho Brockville,” they seem to say. Children squeal at their sightings.
The park features a fountain on water’s edge, benches along the waterfront and under a gazebo, a public piano. This urban planner was thinking about people in its design.
A walk into Blockhouse Island, the most southern land mass, places you squarely into the St. Lawrence. It offers parking, souvenirs and a large eatery. It is also a good place to obtain orientation from one of its tourist information offices.
This writer enjoyed the breeze while sipping craft beer with a U.S. production company–they were in awe of this place. This is where you can sit back and soak your soul.

If you find your way to 10 Market Street, downtown, you can obtain a day parking pass. Take the worry off and drop-in. Here too you will get plenty of info.
Brockville’s waterfront is our first pick for “mixing it up.”
Ice cream find : Tall Ships Landing has an exceptional ice cream parlour neighbouring Aquatarium, offering a patio with views of the marina and river.

Rep. Erico Aristotle â€œArisâ€ Aumentado (Bohol, 2ndÂ District) recently assumed the â€œspiritual leadershipâ€ of the Bohol United Opposition (BUO).
Even Senator Ferdinand â€œBongbongâ€ Marcos Jr., during his recent visit to Bohol, recognized his leadership because the former knows well Aumentadoâ€™s lineage and pedigree of good performance â€“ drawn from the records of his services rendered.
In accepting the post, Aumentado said he did so â€œreluctantlyâ€ because as a neophyte in politics, he knows there are a lot of leader materials who are very senior than he is.
With Aumentado at the helm, the opposition is now united and has now become a force to reckon with.
The opposition chose him because of his untainted name and topnotch performance as replacement candidate for his father in the 2013 elections.
To note, the solonâ€™s immediate past predecessor and namesake father, Erico Boyles Aumentado passed away on Christmas Day in 2012 â€“ at the height of the campaign.
This prompted the son to file his candidacy, and the rest, so they say, is history. The Aumentado leadership, his colleagues say, gives good alternative in terms of governance.Â (June S.

The Dynamics 365 App Source concept allows ISVs and partners to bring their addons to a centralized marketplace. App Source can help partners and customers find business users and customers. On the flip side, customers can find validated solutions that have gone through a validation and approval process.
Unlike a traditional App Store, business apps are generally more complex to implement than a PC or mobile app. Many times code, business processes, and data need to be tested and promoted to various systems to make the solution work. The Dynamics 365 for Operations App Source site connects to a management toolkit called Lifecycle Services that helps strategically deploy the key assets into various environments.
At the tech conference, Shefy Manayil Kareem (@Shefymk) from Microsoft discussed the following key features of App Source:
- A new publishing portal for Dynamics 365 due later in 2017
- For ISVs, improved actionable insights for App Source hits and leads
- New predictable trial experience
- Announcement of “Test Drive”, where a managed environment is already running and ISVs can temporarily allow access to an environment for a prospective customer
- Leveraging multiple components from D365 Operations, Sales, PSA, PowerBI, Common Data Service, and Power Apps
- Reviews and ratings displayed in App Source based on the trial experience
The App Source concept is a few years old, and continues to round into form. Key upcoming features like Test Drive should lead to simpler trial experiences should significantly increase the value of having a solution on App Source. Ultimately, ISVs and partners hope to decrease the time for prospects to investigate the features of an product and drive sales.Stimulate your senses with this orange, lemon and lime essential oil combination.

They are good guys and I guess they will do a good job.” The manager was making a mistake many of us make. Thinking that people working in teams is the right solution to solve all problems.
The best way to get quality work done is to put together a team, right? Wrong! Research indicates that for many tasks, performance in teams is only 75 % as effective as the performance of the aggregate of those same individuals working alone- the “social loafing” or “free rider effect”.
This was illustrated by Max Ringleman way back in the 1880s! He attached a rope to a dynamometer and got volunteers to pull their hardest. The average force for one man was 85.3 kilograms. Ringleman wondered if with two men the force would be 170.6 kilograms, with three, 255.9 kilograms, and so on. Ringleman took it up to 8 volunteers, predicting a force of 682.4 kilograms. The result surprised him and everyone else! That didn’t happen. The total force went up with each new man, but the average per man went down.
This is called social loafing. In the Ringleman experiment, it turned out the team was pulling at only 75 % of the aggregated work of individuals pulling alone. You must have seen this many times at work. In a team task, individual effort becomes invisible. Without the reward of recognition, motivation goes down. Slacking off also becomes invisible, so there is less pressure to do well. Each one expects the other to do the work.
In training facilitation, I insist that individual effort precede a group task for the very same reason. Team members put in differing amounts of efforts in the group task. Some are wildly enthusiastic, many take the cue from others and do what most others do, some simply goof off.
This does not mean that teamwork doesn’t get you results. Of course it does. But it does not happen automatically. The team leader has to be sensitive to the dynamics affecting a team and its performance. He/she has to engage the team members. Make sure they put in their best efforts and do not merely go through the motions of task completion.
Team members do much better when they realize their individual contributions are being tracked and measured. They take to social loafing when the team leadership is weak. When they think they can get away with less than effective performance.
So, go ahead and assign work in teams but be ready to manage the team effectively for optimal results.

Fox 44 NewsOn October 19, shares of the Bitcoin Strategy ETF from ProShares will be available to investors on the New York Stock Exchange. Why can this be considered a pass to the digital asset market for large institutional players
On October 19, the first US exchange-traded fund (ETF) based on bitcoin futures of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME Group) will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The Bitcoin Strategy ETF from ProShares has been approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and will be traded under the ticker BITO.
Various companies, including ARK Investment, Fidelity Investment, VanEck, One River and others, have been trying to get SEC approval to launch bitcoin ETFs since 2013. Until now, the regulator has rejected all applications to launch exchange-traded funds based on cryptocurrency.
What is an ETF
ETFs (exchange traded fund) are investment funds that form portfolios of assets and issue their own shares, where each security is linked to a certain part of the fund’s assets. Thus, ETFs allow you to purchase an asset without actually owning it.
In the case of the Bitcoin Strategy ETF from ProShares, the fund will be linked to bitcoin futures, which have been traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange since 2017. On the ProShares website, potential investors are warned that the price of bitcoin futures may differ from the value of the first cryptocurrency on spot markets.
After the start of trading of the Bitcoin Strategy ETF on the NYSE, institutional and retail investors will be able to access bitcoin directly through a regular brokerage account, explained Gleb Kostarev, director of Binance in Eastern Europe. According to him, investors wishing to purchase the first cryptocurrency will not need to independently use the functionality of crypto exchanges and store digital assets.
Perspective for the market
The launch of the first bitcoin ETF in the United States is important primarily because it is another fully regulated tool that allows you to invest in cryptocurrencies, according to a financial analyst of the crypto exchange Currency.com Mikhail Karkhalev. In his opinion, against the background of strict prohibitions against cryptocurrencies in China, a more loyal position of the United States allows the industry to develop and grow further, despite the fact that there is no legislation regulating the crypto market in the country yet.
Tough measures against cryptocurrencies began to be introduced in China at the end of May this year after the call of Vice Premier of the State Council of the People’s Republic of China Liu He to tighten the regulation of digital assets. The authorities of the local provinces began to prohibit the mining of cryptocurrencies, and the crypto business began to leave the country. In September, the Chinese authorities completely banned cryptocurrency transactions, equating them to illegal financial activities.
The launch of the bitcoin ETF is one of the most important milestones of 2021, Kostarev is sure. He believes that in the near future there will be a large influx of institutional investors into the cryptocurrency market. Many investors, who are often very far from digital assets, have been quite actively interested in bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market as a whole over the past year, explained the director of Binance in Eastern Europe. According to him, many such investors were stopped from investing in cryptocurrency by insufficient regulation of the industry, a low level of trust in it, as well as low awareness of digital assets.
“The barrier that exists between potential investors and cryptocurrencies, thanks to the bitcoin ETF, will be overcome,” Kostarev said.
The start of bitcoin-ETF trading in the United States actually means the adoption of cryptocurrencies by the regulator and permission for large institutional investors to enter the crypto market, said the head of the data analysis department. CEX.IO Broker Yuri Mazur. He recalled that Tesla was one of the first public companies to invest in bitcoin directly, but this strategy is not suitable for all organizations.
How Investors can Use Bitcoin ETFs
The Bitcoin ETF will be of interest not only to institutional investors, but also to retail investors, says Mazur. He explained that an exchange-traded fund based on cryptocurrency will be available on regular stock exchanges, which will greatly simplify the process of investing in bitcoin. Mazur called a lower entry threshold another advantage of the bitcoin ETF, since the cost of one share of the fund will be significantly lower than the price of bitcoin. According to ProShares, Bitcoin Strategy ETF trading will begin with a set price of $40.
Investors will be able to use bitcoin ETFs to diversify their portfolios, as the instrument will be less risky and volatile, Karhalev explained. According to him, thanks to the bitcoin ETF, investors will have less chance to run into fraudulent projects when trying to make money on cryptocurrency.
“Perhaps the profitability will not be as high as if you invested on a HYIP in Shiba Inu, but there are significantly fewer risks of losing all your capital,” Karhalev added.Come and enjoy a summer special show and dance the night away outside on the grass (weather permitting) with two great bands.

Official Spokesperson Harry Roque declared the lockdown Saturday after the nation revealed 9,838 new Covid-19 cases - the country's most elevated single day increment, as indicated by true state media Philippines News Agency. Philippines has announced more than 720,000 Covid cases, including 13,170 passings, making it one of the most noticeably awful influenced nations in Asia.
The nation has seen a lofty ascent in day by day detailed cases since February, and the nation is currently revealing in excess of 9,000 new cases a day. There are in excess of 105,000 dynamic cases, as per the Philippines' Department of Health.
In excess of 25 million individuals across Metro Manila and close by regions Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna and Rizal will be influenced by the lockdown.
The lockdown starts Monday, and runs until April 4 - or Easter Sunday, a day when Christians frequently celebrate with uncommon chapel gatherings. Strict get-togethers are not permitted during the blessed week.
That is a blow for the Philippines, where over 90% of the populace are Christian, as per the CIA World Factbook.
The actions incorporate a time limitation from 6 p.m. until 5 a.m. - fixed from the past 10 p.m. time limitation. Social affairs of in excess of 10 individuals outside are not permitted, and non-family individuals can't accumulate inside, the public authority said.
Burger joints are not permitted to eat in cafés, in spite of the fact that take-out and conveyance administrations can go on.
The Philippine National Police has conveyed a great many officials in designated spot territories to help implement the principles, as per according to PNA Report.
Antibodies are being carried out to clinical frontliners, and a week ago the Department of Health encouraged individuals who were not medical care laborers to abstain from bouncing the line.
"Try not to stress. Our objective is still to guarantee that everyone will be immunized. Yet, while we do this, the public authority is focusing on medical care laborers as they are the most uncovered and the most in danger of getting Covid," National Task Force Against Covid-19 boss implementer and antibody ruler secretary Carlito Galvez said.
"More immunizations will show up, we make certain of that. We simply need to trust that our turns will be inoculated."

If you’ve never roasted a whole chicken, here’s your opportunity. It’s hard (not): put it in the oven and close the oven door is about it.
Dave’s been smoking salmon. I’ve been decorating them to take to parties. I’m trying to avoid too many cookies. You?
There are a plethora of recipes and many ways, temperatures, and accompaniments for your little bird. I say little because I like a small, young chicken (12 weeks and 3-4 pounds), but you can choose a big old roasting (I’d call it stewing) hen if you really want one. I find the larger birds doughy, strongly-flavored, and–of course–slow to roast. My choice would be to roast two smaller sweet, tender, and mild chickens if you need more servings. Famous roast chicken recipes:
- Zuni Cafe Chicken
- Julia’s Favorite Roast Chicken
- Dorie Greenspan’s Garlic Chicken in a Pot
- Thomas Keller’s Roast Chicken
- Mark Bittman’s Roast Chicken
But if you want a simple, luscious dinner that you can throw in the oven and enjoy your guests in the meantime or grab leftovers from the next day, try my version with an Oregon Pinot Noir or an inexpensive French red Burgundy. Make some chicken stock after you’re done. Then there’s chicken soup on the way fast the next time a cold hits. (Freeze your broth if need be.)
My mom always said, “I like the breast and all the rest” when you asked her what piece she’d like. But I like to say:
CHICKEN AND VEGETABLES
Serves 4. Doubles easily. “Elevator” Directions down below recipe.
This chicken is totally forgiving. If I have no fresh thyme, a little dry will work — or none at all. A quartered small onion might be as tasty as the lemon tucked into the cavity. Have a jar of purchased pesto? It could serve in place of the homemade sauce. You can use other vegetables, such as just carrots and onions, or all Brussels Sprouts or only potatoes, if those are what you have. My tasty chicken recipe was inspired by Tyler Florence, one of my very favorite chefs. Listen to his podcasts; they’re great while you’re on the treadmill!
Chicken:
- 1 small, young chicken (3 pounds or so)
- 1 lemon, cut into quarters (grate its rind first for the vegetables–see below: Vegetables)
- Kosher salt, fresh ground pepper
- Sprig fresh thyme
Vegetables:
- 1 pound each small potatoes (1-2 inches), cut in half if 2 inches and Brussels sprouts (trimmed, outer leaves removed, cut in half if large)
- 2 large onions, peeled, trimmed, and cut into eighths
- Olive oil
- Kosher salt and fresh ground pepper
- Pinch crushed red pepper
- Grated rind of one lemon
Sauce: (Can sub a cup or more of purchased pesto) You’ll use half for roasting the chicken and half at the table with red wine vinegar added.
- 1/2 cup fresh parsley
- 5 large fresh sage leaves
- 2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves
- 5 cloves garlic
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon each kosher salt and fresh ground pepper
- Red wine vinegar to taste–added after the sauce is made
DIRECTIONS:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Place chicken in a large, heavy, lightly-greased roasting pan. (A rimmed baking sheet will also work.) Sprinkle the inside with a little salt and pepper; stuff with lemon and thyme. Tie legs together with kitchen string; tuck wings under the bird.* Surround the chicken evenly with the vegetables (potatoes, Brussels Sprouts and onions) and drizzle the vegetables only with about 3 tablespoons olive oil; sprinkle them with 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, 1/8 teaspoon red pepper, and lemon rind. Toss well to evenly coat.
Make sauce (see below) and slowly pour half of it evenly over the chicken. Cover the chicken with greased or sprayed foil. Place pan in preheated oven and roast everything for about an hour. Meanwhile, pour remaining sauce into a small pitcher, add a teaspoon of red wine vinegar, stir and taste. Adjust seasonings, adding more vinegar if you like. Set aside.
After an hour, remove foil ,and continue cooking until the chicken is done, an instant-read thermometer registers 170-180 degrees F when placed in the fleshy part of a thigh, and vegetables are very tender and crispy–perhaps another 30 minutes at altitude. (Less at sea level.) Let chicken rest 5 minutes, carve, and serve hot with vegetables. Pass the reserved sauce at the table.
TO MAKE THE SAUCE: Place all ingredients except red wine vinegar in food processor and pulse several times until well-blended. No food processor? Chop the herbs as finely as possible, place in a bowl with the salt and pepper and mix well. Whisk in the oil slowly. Taste and adjust seasonings. You’ll use half on the chicken while it cooks. The other half, with a little red wine vinegar added to taste, will be served at the table as a sauce for both the chicken and vegetables.
*If you don’t want to do this, as some people don’t, skip it. I like how it makes the chicken look.
Elevator Directions: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Place the chicken in a roaster and stuff with lemon and thyme; tie legs and tuck under wings. Surround the chicken with a pound each of small potatoes and trimmed Brussels sprouts, along with 2 large onions cut into eighths. Drizzle vegetables with olive oil, and season with salt, pepper, fresh red pepper, and lemon rind. Pour half of herb sauce or jarred pesto over chicken. Cover with greased foil and roast for an hour. Remove foil and roast until instant read thermometer reads 165 degrees F and vegetables are tender and crispy. Serve hot with remaining sauce (add a little red wine vinegar to it) at table.

P.S. I don’t decorate much, but it is beginning to look a lot like Christmas at our house:

Nice and tasty recipe
1 – What do you mean about “Elevator Directions?”
2 – So, any type of onions will do? Which type do you prefer for this recipe? In general, which onions do you prefer and why?
Elevator directions are fast. How you would tell someone sbout this on an elevator ride!
Yellow onions unless specified otherwise. I like yellow for cooking and red for salads. Thanks for reading!!
Simple, too. Good for the holidays when we’re so busy. Happy December !

Inscoe, a 40-year-old intersex, transgender woman is waiting to be recognized and treated in alignment with her gender identity and has been housed at Avery-Mitchell since early 2018 when she transferred from another all-men’s facility, Craven Correctional Institution. Her most recent transfer requests have been repeatedly denied. Late last month, Inscoe’s attorney filed a court order against North Carolina’s Commissioner of Prisons, Todd Ishee, asking the court to force Ishee to transfer Inscoe to a women’s facility.
In North Carolina, transgender, gender-variant, and intersex people are housed by the gender assigned to them at birth or their genital characteristics, which puts them at a higher risks of physical and sexual violence.
“I just want to be safe and make it home,” Inscoe, who is expected to serve a prison sentence for robbery until 2031, told the INDY of her incarceration.
In March, Inscoe sent a letter to a group of advocates seeking help with her case and explaining that she has constant pain in her abdomen and needs surgery to remove residual painful gonad material.
“DPS need not wait for a tragedy to respond to the dire needs of intersex and transgender persons in its care,” Inscoe wrote in the letter. “I am facing escalating distress and growing fears for my safety. I have filed grievances within the DPS system and have exhausted those remedies with nothing in return but denials, heartache, and fear of retaliation by officials.”
This summer, North Carolina Department of Public Safety (N.C. DPS) prison commissioner Ishee and his counsel received an 11-page-letter from Emancipate NC, interACT: Advocates for Intersex Youth, and Transgender, Gender-variant, Intersex (TGI) Justice Project, three organizations that are now advocating for Inscoe. The letter details the state’s violations of Inscoe’s human rights and demands that DPS transfer her immediately to the North Carolina Correctional Institute for Women in Raleigh. It also demands that her pressing medical needs immediately be addressed. The advocates gave prison officials until August 24 to discuss remediation.
In their request, the advocates cited the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments and argue that N.C. DPS is violating the U.S. Constitution and even its own policies. Under the federal Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA), prison officials are obligated to protect all incarcerated individuals and assess their risk of sexual abuse and assault and take reasonable steps to keep them safe. They are also obligated to provide adequate medical care.
In North Carolina, requests for transgender accommodations are sent to the Facility Transgender Accommodation Review Committee (FTARC) and the Division Transgender Accommodation Review Committee (DTARC). The committees are expected to review all aspects of the requests and base decisions on whether they protect an incarcerated person’s welfare.
In an August letter, DPS Deputy General Counsel Jodi Harrison said, in response to the advocates’ “myriad allegations,” that FTARC and the DTARC concluded that DPS is providing Inscoe with constitutionally adequate care.
“We are confident the decisions that these committees have made with regard to this offender have been thoughtful, deliberative, and fully in line with NCDPS policies,” Harrison wrote.
Attorneys for Inscoe disagree.
“Unfortunately, many prison officials are transparently hostile to the rights of transgender people, and this adversely affects the judgment of the TARC teams,” says Elizabeth Simpson, an attorney and the associate director of Emancipate NC. “This seems to be what is going on with Ashlee, because medical professionals are unanimous that she needs surgery and is a woman who would be safer in a women’s prison.”
On September 30, Simpson filed a writ of mandamus—a type of court order directed to a government official warning them that they’re breaking the law—in Wake County Superior Court asking the court to direct commissioner Ishee to transfer Inscoe to a women’s facility.
The FTARC met in October of 2020 to review Inscoe’s original requests for a transfer.
In a letter written after Inscoe’s case was reviewed, Shawn Hartzog, an FTARC facilitator and psychologist, says the committee “presented information that endocrinologist E. Klett, MD had recognized this inmate’s intersex condition with the documentation of XX karyotype and recommended transfer to all female facility.”
DPS’s current policy only accomodates transgender people and not anyone with an intersex condition. Therefore, the letter continued, the “team resolves that [Inscoe] will need to accept the rules of the facility, the decision made by administration, and the decisions set by this committee.”
But Inscoe says cases like hers should be considered on individual bases.
“Despite PREA’s mandate and DPS’s formal implementation of it, however, my case and situation demonstrates that intersex and transgender prisoners are being subjected to blanket rules with regard to placement,” said Inscoe in a March letter to the coalition.
Inscoe is not alone in her experience.
Kanautica Zayre-Brown, a transgender woman, was housed in a men’s facility from 2017 until she finally won the battle, with assistance from her supporters, to get transferred to a women’s facility in 2019. Zayre-Brown is believed to be the first transgender person to be transferred from one gender facility to another in North Carolina.
“It is my hope that the struggle and constant battle I’m facing will not only result in my transfer to a women’s prison,” Inscoe said in her letter to the coalition of advocates, “but also help other trans and intersex women who are in prison in North Carolina to be housed where they not only feel safe from physical and sexual violence, but to be free of the systemic hatred, homophobia/transphobia, and binary mentality that plagues prisons.”

Ok, I made up the last one, but as you can see, there is a lot of negative feeling surrounding boosting a post. I’ve been interviewed on a ton of podcasts about online marketing, and the host and I will often discuss Facebook marketing, where I will share some awesome tips and strategies including “boost that post!” More often than not, the host will immediately correct me and give me the opportunity to walk-back my insane statement. Instead, I tell them what I’m going to tell you. It’s ok, even a good idea, to use the Facebook boost post button. Here’s why.
For starters let me explain what the Facebook boost post button is. Hop out to your Facebook page and look at your old posts. See that dandy blue button that says “Boost Post” next to each and every entry? This is the controversial “Boost Post” button that tempts every Facebook Business Page owner.
Now that you know where the Facebook Boost Post button is, let me tell you why you should ignore the haters and use the Facebook Boost Post button.
If you are managing your business’s Facebook page yourself, you probably don’t have the time or knowledge to utilize the power of Facebook’s Ads Manager and mount a successful campaign. Even if you’ve hired a Social Marketing expert to handle the work for you, it may not make financial sense to set them loose on promoting your latest video or blog post. So, instead, you do nothing, hoping that enough of their audience will see your content.
Well, in Marketing 101, they teach Top-Of-Mind-Awareness (TOMA), which is the entire reason you’re creating that content in the first place! This means that your business is first and foremost in your customers’ minds when they are ready to spend their money. Hitting the Facebook Boost Post button a few times a week, for a few dollars a pop, will ensure that more of your targeted fans will have you and your business in their mind, giving you TOMA!
Why You Should Use the Facebook Boost Post Button
- Boosting a post is better than doing nothing! You created that content, let your fans see it!
- Boosting a post can mean a bump in website traffic, and remember, if done correctly, more website traffic means more leads. I have boosted posts for a few dollars which has led to visits to my website, which in turn has led to traffic opting in to my email sequence.
- Boosting a post is super easy and effective. It’s literally clicking a button.
- Boosting a post is really inexpensive. Each time I have a blog post or video I want my fans to see, I will boost it for a few dollars. I have 5000 fans and with literally $2.00, these posts get incredible reach and engagement.
Quick example: I spent less than $2.00 boosting this video to my fans and it got 125 actions, 300 people reached, 16 likes and 4 shares. Of course, I could spend more time and money making sure my post was seen by a larger, more targeted audience, but with something like this, I just wanted to make sure my fans see my content. Reminding so many of my fans of my name and message for $2.00 is a NO BRAINER, even if no action is taken by the user.
Now, with all that said, I want to put some rules in place.
When You Should Hit The Facebook Boost Post Button
- Only boost your post to FANS. If searching for new people to see your content or you are trying to track opt-in’s, etc. don’t use Facebook Boost Post. You are going to be better off spending some time targeting your fans and optimizing your ads.
- Only use the Facebook boost post button if you got your fans LEGITIMATELY. If you have fake fans, fans from a non-targeted “likes” campaign, or your fans are people that do not matter to your business, then you can’t use the button. Using “boost” post is like paying Facebook to be back in the “good ol’ days” when you would post something and a lot of your fans would see it. If your fans aren’t really people that may want to buy your goods and services, it makes no sense to pay money to make sure more of them see your content.
- Only boost your post if you have 5000 fans or less. If you have more than this, it may be smarter to start targeting your fans based on the content you write. If you have less fans then that, spending 2 – 3 bucks boosting your content will mean that each boost has a pretty decent chance of being seen by the same fans that saw the previous boost (hence you will achieve TOPA).
Now let’s address a few of the comments made by Boost Post detractors about why they don’t want you to use the Facebook boost post button:
- “The Facebook boost post button is for amateurs.” This may be true, but most small business owners are armatures! I have studied Facebook Marketing for years and it is complicated! Most small business owners just don’t have the time or money to learn Facebook marketing for themselves or to hire a professional. Therefore, yes, it may be for amateurs, but it’s a legit tool for most DIY small business owners.
- “You can’t target your audience.” This is true, but as I said before, if you have less than 5000 fans and you got those fans legitimately, and you’re just looking to achieve or maintain TOMA, then your $2.00 boost is targeted enough!
- “It does not give you full control over your ads.” True, but if you put some thought into the initial post itself and you feel like it’s quality enough for your fans to engage with it, you don’t need to change it anyway.
- “It will not allow you to set campaign objectives.” When you boost a post, you objective is automatically set to “engagement.” This means it’s going to reach out to those people who will like, comment and share the post. This may not be as sexy an objective as getting your audience to opt-in to an offer or spend some money! But, it’s still a fine objective and works at building a foundation and reputation to make those other objectives easier to achieve.
A quick success story. We run a holistic Facebook campaign for the best bed and breakfast in Lava Hot Springs, Idaho. We performed the following steps and got some awesome results:
- Ran a targeted likes campaign for everyone within a 25 mile radius of the B&B. (Spent about $50.00)
- Fed these fans awesome content on a daily basis. (Spend $10.00 boosting pics of the venue and other cool posts.)
- Boosted the following post for $10.00 to her fans to promote a Valentine’s Day Special.
She called and said she filled up! It was simple and effective.
One more thing to remember, not everything is “boost worthy”. I wouldn’t boost a generic post that didn’t have some sort of branding on it. I also wouldn’t boost a post that promoted someone else’s content, unless you’re a really nice guy and want to give them some free advertising.
Now go… be free… and hit Facebook BOOST post and ignore the haters! At least you’re doing something!This is your Morning Commute. Make the jump for additional links.
The Washington Capitals lost another frustrating one last night, falling 2-0 to the San Jose Sharks. The game was scoreless for a while, but it was the kind of game where it was only a matter of time until the Capitals lost it. San Jose outshot them 36-25, and eventually, they got a couple soft goals on Michal Neuvirth to get the win.
It also continued the Capitals' shocking display of offensive ineptitude this season. This was the eighth time they have been shut out this season, which equals the number of times they were shut out in coach Bruce Boudreau's first three seasons combined. It's also the most times they've been shut out in a season since 1998/99, when they were shut out 11 times. They've faltered in so many ways this season, whether it's been the power play, the inability to crash the net or just plain bad luck. In this game, though, the problem was simple: puck possession. They couldn't consistently advance the puck from their own zone to the offensive zone, and that's not a recipe for success.
In this way, the team desperately missed defensemen Mike Green last night.
Green did not play because he was still feeling the effects of a slap shot to the face in Sunday's win over the Penguins. Without him, the Capitals were missing the one defensemen on the team that's most able to advance the puck out of their own zone. As our Jack Anderson tweeted last night:
Without Green, the #Caps don't have a puck-moving defensemen to shake up the break outs from the D zone.
This speaks to the invaluable role Green plays on this team. He's criticized for his defensive issues, which he's trying to fix this year, but in the meantime, he's needed to jump-start this offense. Green has missed eight games this year, and the Capitals are 3-5 in those games. Only once (11/26 against the Lightning) did the Capitals score more than three goals in a game with him sidelined. They were shut out twice (last night and on December 12 in the memorable 7-0 loss to the Rangers) and scored just one goal twice (both times against the Bruins in October).
The Capitals' offense has many problems, but not having Green in the lineup certainly adds to them.
Today's must-reads from around the SB Nation network:
- Japers Rink recaps last night's loss.
- Hogs Haven has more on the Santana Moss situation.
- Casual Hoya gets us ready for tonight's showdown with Syracuse.Book Lists

They are interested in publishing information via our blog, which I am both honored and flattered to be considered. I am getting nothing in return, although I would love to be on their panel of concussion experts that help form plans, what the CDC gets is another avenue to disseminate information (no Irv and Matt I am not selling out).
I am more than happy to help out, but remember that this is information for everyone to take on their own, TCB does not always endorse all material from third-parties. However giving the reader more information to digest is EXACTLY what we set out to do from the beginning of this blog.
Without further ado here is the recent CDC message;
Getting more eyes on the fieldThere is a lot going on during the course of any practice or game. In some sports there can be more than 20 athletes on the field at one time. And these athletes don’t stay in one place. Just the opposite. Athletes are constantly running, kicking, diving, jumping, and throwing, among other things, with all of their might to help win the game or event. And in the midst of all of this activity, there may only be one athletic trainer who is responsible for their health and safety who is carefully watching for injuries.So what happens when an athletic trainer is busy caring for an injured athlete and misses an athlete taking a hit to the head? Or what if an athlete at hit by the ball out of view of the athletic trainer that causes him or her to act dizzy and is slow to get up? Well, unfortunately, many times that means that injury my go unnoticed and uncared for unless it is reported by a coach, parent, teammate, or the athlete themself. This is particularly important when it comes to concussion because athletes and others may not know the concussion signs, may just try to “shake it off,” or even hide their injury to stay in the game.Recently, the NFL added video monitors on sidelines to help medical staff in diagnosing and treating injuries, as well as independent certified athletic trainers at all games to watch players from the press box. These athletic trainers really serve as “eyes-in-the-sky” to watch for injuries and then call down to either team if a concussion or other injury is suspected. So far the NFL reports they are getting more injury reports with these extra eyes on the field.While these technologies are not available for high school and youth programs, I hope that this at least sends a strong message about the importance of concussion safety and results in a trickled down effect. As the more trained eyes on the field, the better.So what if there is no athletic trainer at all, which is all too common for many high school and youth leagues across the country? Coaches and parents are responsible for being those eyes on the field. Every coach and parent should carry concussion information with them on every sideline and bench– including a list of concussion signs and symptoms and CDC’s 4-step Heads Up Action Plan. CDC makes it easy for you by providing free (yes, free) clipboards, pockets, fact sheets, –pretty much any format—that includes this information. All you have to do is order from their website. You might as well order a couple of each for other coaches and parents just in case you can’t be at every practice or game. Remember, the more eyes on the field spotting a potential concussion, the more likely we can keep our athletes healthy and active in sports.
Thank you for your help! I appreciate your help and your insight on this message!The Choice – Cardio Zone Vs Fat-Burning Zone

By Irene Corchado Resmella
A successful event ticking all the boxes
I believe the three key elements that make an event are great speakers, a practical approach and time for questions and discussion. The event, given by CIOL’s Translating Division, ticked all three boxes.
The presenters, Sue Leschen, Richard Lackey and Maeva Cifuentes, are knowledgeable, experts in their field, and shared what only years of experience can provide.
The practical approach offered by this event included advice, do’s and don’ts, real examples and personal anecdotes, leaving us with a head full of ideas and a notebook full of notes of things we can put into practice.
They shared tons of tips, suggestions and good practices related to anything from the common problems which arise in legal translation to the role of the translator when interpreting the meaning in a legal text, and when to use footnotes. In addition, the afternoon session included two practical exercises related to briefings and stylistic differences.
Questions and discussion
The event provided plenty of room for questions and discussion. The presentations kept the audience engaged at all times, asking numerous questions and sharing opposing views on different topics. The questions unfortunately ran into Sue Leschen’s presentation time which meant she could deliver only the first one of her two presentations. (Her second presentation has since been sent to attendees.)
In the two practical sessions, we started by discussing exercises in groups, and then sharing outcomes between groups.
Read the full event report.
Following the success of the “Legal translation for the terrified” events held in both London and Manchester, this new event is aimed at more experienced translators wishing to advance their legal translation skills. The programme consists of a mix of presentations and practical workshops delivered by three professional legal translators.

Prayer of remembrance of Father Rudy Romano and Father Conrado de la Cruz
Lord so many years have passed we recall their lives of sacrifice they were the true prophets of the poor. They stood as Jesus did to bring justice as the cure. To end violence and oppression, they sought to end the suffering and the pain, They were missionaries and gave their lives without seeking to win or gain. Filipinos with hearts of love, they were killed and disappeared, their bodies never found, Lord we continue to remember them as they lie in unmarked graves in the lost and unknown ground. May their sacrifice inspire, and their selfless lives endure, In the spirits of all who live for justice and serve the wretched and the poor.
Prayer for a Martyr
O Lord, we Catholics revere and pray for those who have witnessed to you
with their lives.
Sadly, martyrdom continues today, even in the midst of a worldwide pandemic which is taking hundreds of thousands of people from their loved ones and communities.
We gather in spirit, in mourning and hope to honor the memory of a true martyr,
who so loved you that he gave his life for you and all of us.
Seminarian Michael Nnadi of Nigeria Witnessed, by word and deed, to Your Divine Love for us all, through Our Lord, Jesus Christ.
This witness, this offering of love and hope to a fellow human sadly did not fall on deaf ears.
The man who Michael so loved that he wanted to share his joy and hope with him became enraged at Michael's love.
Spurning not only Michael but the One God of all humans, the man killed Michael.
Michael is a true martyr to our faith.
He died because of his faith in you, O Lord.
He now rests and rejoices with you, O Lord.
May we Catholics take Michael's witness, faith, hope, and love into our hearts and souls. May we be inspired to live out in our lives your words of peace and love for all humans. May we work together with people of all faiths
to help those in need. The sick, the poor, the mentally challenged,
all who are in need.
Amen. Alleluia. Praise the Lord.
A reflection on the martyrdom of the Michael Nnadi
[CNA Staff, May 2, 2020, / 04:30 pm (CNA).- A man claiming to have killed the murdered Nigerian. Seminarian Michael Nnadi has given an interview in which he says he executed the aspiring priest because he would not stop announcing the Christian faith in captivity.]
They provoke a memory, the image, the story, or your servant Steven who was commissioned by the original Apostles to preach the word. He did so with fire and vigor. And he was hated for it. They, his enemies accused him by saying “This man never stops saying things against this holy place and the law.” But
Steven was filled with the Spirit and wisdom, was emboldened to say: “You stiff-necked people, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always oppose the Holy Spirit; you are just like your ancestors.”
They, his enemies, ran him out of the city, took up stones, and killed him. “But he, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked up intently to heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.
Is final words were: “Behold, I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God O Lord God, you servant Michael is much like Seven. Your servant. Your preacher. Your suppliant. We trust that his final words were those of Steven: “Behold, I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.
Our Prayer, O Lord, is that we too may be inspired with the spirit of Steven of not giving up preaching your word. Inspired by your servant Michael, of not giving up preaching the word. We ask this in the name of Jesus your Son, who was offered up for us. Amen

The online store offers products from different Chyawanprash brands and runs a Blog and YouTube Channel (Chyawanprash Official), dedicated to showcasing the amazing benefits of the ancient Ayurvedic health supplement.
Chyawanprash.ORG is delighted to announce that it has launched the World’s 1st Multi-Brand Chyawanprash Online Store & a Blog for creating awareness about the Age-old Ayurvedic Chyawanprash, and its holistic approach towards one’s health.
The multi-brand store revealed that aside from the various health benefits, Chyawanprash helps in boosting the immune system and contributes to slowing down the process of ageing.
Chyawanprash.ORG insists that the present challenges of the times are compelling a lot of people to live hectic lifestyles. More people find it increasingly difficult to take appropriate care of themselves, resulting in the weakening of the immune system and antibodies, making them easily susceptible to various diseases.
It adds that although recent medical advancements have discovered various methods of strengthening the immune system, it, however, believes that one of the most reliable options is the ancient and time-tested technique from Ayurveda.
Chyawanprash is considered an Ayurvedic Mantra for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Its rich antioxidant properties make it a phenomenal health supplement. And for clarity, Chayanwaprash.ORG indicates specifically that the product adopts a preventive approach, focused on improving the overall health of individuals rather than curing specific diseases.
It also adds that for optimal benefits, a single teaspoon of Chyawanprash should be taken in the morning on an empty stomach, and no meals should be consumed for at least 30mins after.
Chyawanprash.ORG offers a variety of different brands all selling the amazing Chyawanprash health supplement. And also has a YouTube channel Chyawanprash Official through which it visually showcases the product and talks about all the wonderful things it’s capable of.
Anyone willing to extend their kind help by contributing some quality content such as videos, blogs, songs, etc, is welcome to do so and can reach out to Chyawanprash.ORG through its website.

Opinion: Why Reopening Early Frightens Me
Thursday, May 21st, 2020Emily is a horror writer. She’s had a difficult past and uses her writing to maintain some control of her life. She keeps her friends, if you can call them that, at arms length, has no close family and believes she isn’t deserving of more.
Beck had a traumatic brain injury in her youth. She’s never left her hometown, still lives with her mother and takes odd jobs here and there. She longs to buy a boat and follow in the footsteps of her father.
I really appreciated how Morrison manages to illustrate that trauma does different things to different people. Both MCs have experienced trauma and loss that has made them who they are and her characterisations almost depict the two opposites of possible reactions, Emily pushes people away through mean words in an effort not to be hurt, Beck tries to bring people closer to her. Having them fall for each other despite the many things they have to work through makes for a really good read.
I don’t have experience of traumatic brain injuries, but I felt like Morrison explored Beck’s injuries in a way that is both understandable to the reader, but that also expresses Beck as a really great character. Her mother’s worries about her and the way Emily refuses to treat her as anything other than an adult works really well. Morrison also manages to express the additional impact Emily’s harsh words would have on Beck without making the reader feel sorry for her.
I am sure that Emily probably won’t be a popular character, but I can completely understand why she is written the way she is. Her journey is one of my favourite parts of the book, and whilst she falters, making for a hard read at times, it’s a worthwhile narrative to explore.
The pacing of the story works really well – the twists are effective and provide empathy for both characters. I found myself not wanting to put the book down as I needed to know how it would turn out. There are also cats – a definite bonus in my book.
This isn’t the easiest book to read, the trauma both have experienced can be a difficult read and there are flashbacks and nightmares on the page. There are times when discussions are downright mean. There are also incidences of discrimination towards Beck, both for her sexuality and her injury.
This is Morrison’s first foray into contemporary romance, and I hope this continues. I’d definitely recommend giving this book a go as it brings a different approach to romance than I’ve personally encountered before in the wlw arena and for that reason alone it’s worthwhile giving it a try.
I received an e-ARC via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.DEFENSE
NOTE: This story first appeared on FCW.com.
Raj Iyer, the Army CIO now responsible for shaping policy and IT needs, said the service is readying an Army Enterprise Digital Strategy to help shape a needed culture change throughout the organization.
"Going digital is a mindset, it's a culture change," Iyer said during AFCEA NOVA's Army IT Day event Jan. 22. "It's about how we leverage technologies, but [also] how we're going to leapfrog into the future with digital transformation. But along with that we're going to need digital skills talent management...organically grow our workforce."
The strategy was in the works last year and ready for sign off by the former Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy, Iyer said. But they are going to wait for the Biden administration's input before releasing it.
Iyer, who has been on the job about two months, said Army and DOD policies have been "hampered and constrained by legacy policy" and plans to focus on restructuring policies that better align with new technologies and "makes it easier for Army commands to do business."
"If there is a commander in the field that wants to leverage technology to meet the mission outcomes and there's some policy that's standing in the way, to me that's the first thing we're going to go after," while balancing cyber and other risks, he said.
Key to that will be tempering the Army's IT spending and introducing new governance structures.
Iyer said the Army's IT spending is estimated to be $2 billion more than budgeted year over year -- and that has to change.
"When I look at our budget, we're looking at about $14.5 or $15 billion that we budget for on an annual basis. And I look at how much we spend on IT in a year and it's about $2 billion more than that," often due to schedule, priority, and scope changes as well as overrun costs, he said.
The Army is also pivoting to IT category management to get a better handle on spending, budgeting, and "consolidate buying power." This will be informed by the zero-budgeting program reviews, or night courts, happening for the 2022 budget cycle, he said, and the reviews will look at programs' execution and how it aligns with the Army's digital priorities.
The Army also plans to create a virtual IT program evaluation group (PEG) to "take all the IT investments out from each of these pegs and then put that in a virtual peg" so the CIO can evaluate and inform decisions for the 2023-2027 Program Objective Memorandum cycle.
The new CIO hopes to further centralize decision-making from budgets to prioritizing cloud migrations in the CIO role by creating the Army Digital Oversight Council.
The council is expected to function like a board of directors and be chaired by the Army CIO, Iyer said. A charter has been prepared and is receiving feedback to ensure buy-in on the new construct.
IT infrastructure, particularly for tactical cloud capabilities, is another area to expect the Army to develop, especially as it moves to achieve seamless data transmission on the battlefield.
"The big pivot that I'm making now is to focus on the tactical cloud...look at the requirements for sensor-to-shooter," Iyer said, "it's all about connecting the tactical edge to the enterprise and1. Titan Electric Tankless Water Heater

Banker and MP John Baring (1730–1816) rebuilt the 16th century house in the modern Georgian style and added a carriage drive from Magdalen Street, lined with cedar trees.
In 1826 the house became a school, known variously as "Mount Radford School", "The Exeter Public School" or "Mount Radford College". The school remained extant in nearby buildings after Mount Radford House was demolished in 1902. A famous Old Radfordian pupil was the comedian Tommy Cooper.

The 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, which Congress passed Nov. 10 after President Barack Obama vetoed the first version, also includes an amendment ordering the Air Force to send it a report on the RPA manning of remotely piloted aircraft and on plans how it hopes to fix any undermanning problems. that would increase aviation incentive pay for RPA officers from $25,000 to $35,000.
Obama is expected to 60 days after the NDAA's enactment to submit the RPA manning report, including:
- -- An account of Congress wants to know how many RPA airmen the Air Force has now, and how many it needs, in addition to and projections on future staffing and requirements.
- -- A comparison of The Air Force also must compare its RPA units' personnel policies, manpower-authorization levels and projected personnel inventory with that of manned combat aircraft systems and units.
- -- And Congress wants a description, with a timeline, of what it would take to get RPA career field authorizations and manning levels to at least the normal manning and readiness levels of all other combat-aircraft career fields.
- -- A Congress ordered the Air Force to list of what the Air Force is doing to increase RPA unit manning levels -- such as offering recruitment and retention bonuses, incentive pay, allowing enlisted airmen to fly drones, and increasing the weighting of RPA personnel on promotion boards —-- plusas well as an assessment of those strategies' effectiveness.
- -- An assessment of Congress also wants the Air Force's plansto make sure it has enough capability to train new RPA personnel to meet demands.
- -- And Congress wants an analysis of the requirements that determine determining how RPA pilots and sensor operators are selected, such as what prerequisite training or experience is necessary.
- The Air Force is now considering the possibility of allowing enlisted airmen to fly drones, and is expected to announce its decision early next year.
MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper pilots became eligible for retention bonuses worth up to $135,000 beginning this fiscal year, the Air Force said in July. And to help beef up the ranks of drone pilots, the Air Force in August started steering 80 undergraduate pilot-training graduates directly into drone squadrons, instead of traditional manned aircraft.
The Air Force also reduced the number of daily drone combat air patrols from 65 to 60 as part of an effort to lessen the strain on pilots.

Leading with a powerful, immersive and organic introduction – soaked in strings and gentle vocal warmth – Choices goes on to evolve into pop territory with a clean-cut vocal lead and multiple layers of subtle electronic sound play.
The structure of the song is particularly unique, this back and forth between space and fullness – orchestral weight and simple electro-pop colour. Ultimately though, this allows the song to build so effectively – to increasingly gather momentum, as the passion rises and the layers meet and multiply.
Bessing’s voice effortlessly carries the power of the progression as a lead, and the additional voices inject a breathy, soulful accompaniment, which works as a further instrumental support – in line with everything from the strings to the guitars to the rhythm.
In its entirety, Choices feels like far more than a simple relationship song – theres’s a depth to it, a certain relevancy to these times of struggle, and the balance between the two concepts works beautifully. The resulting song is a genre-fusing, cinema-ready extravaganza, with a strong potential to completely captivate a live audience.

This article originally appeared on Forbes.com.
The idea of “emotional quotient,” or EQ, is making a surprising comeback in the business world. Also called emotional intelligence, EQ is the ability to understand other people, what motivates them, and how to work cooperatively with them. Worthy enough, but why would this be rising in importance at a time when we are so focused on advances in artificial intelligence, the impact of increased automation, and the possibilities of machine learning? As machines increasingly take over jobs and complex decisions once the exclusive domain of people, it would not be so far-fetched to think that we are entering a “post-human” or at least “post-EQ” world.
Instead, and perhaps ironically, digitalization is fueling a renaissance in EQ. As digitalization, broadly defined, continues its revolutionary march through the business world, it brings profound implications for the human workforce. If we thought EQ was an “or,” it’s actually turned out to be an “and.” Rather than sideline EQ, digitalization has actually made it more important.
Let’s look first at the data (of course). The evidence shows that if you care about generating and sustaining results in your business, you should also care a whole lot about EQ. A recent study by my colleagues at Bain & Company found that companies that achieve or outperform their stated ambition are focused on the “people” side of the ledger, and significantly so. Culture, behavior change, management alignment, and dynamic capability building surface to the top as critical factors for success. This remains true even as we increasingly automate our businesses. A 2018 study from Singapore Management University found 87% of respondents agreed that culture created bigger barriers to digital transformation than technology, and 80% of C-Suite interviews highlighted the importance of purposefully focusing on “people aspects” during digital transformation journeys.
My recent experience with a large multinational bank is a good illustration of EQ’s revenge. Technology is dramatically changing the banking industry, especially on the retail side. Like most of its peers, this particular bank knew it would need far fewer retail branches as banking moved to phones and online. The CEO hired a chief digital officer, invested millions in a new online platform, and had grand plans to move a significant portion of its customer base toward internet banking.
But as the boxer Mike Tyson once famously said, “Everybody has a plan ‘til they get punched in the mouth.” The bank’s numbers just didn’t move as they were supposed to, frustrating and perplexing the executive team. Despite all the money put into the new, impressive digital platform, employees and customers kept doing a lot of what they’d always been doing. To change behavior, the bank’s employees needed new skills, and their customers needed new routines. None of this was in “the plan,” but it didn’t take this management team long to realize that to accelerate progress, they needed to think about the problem from the human perspective—that of the customer and employee—not just from the standpoint of what was technically possible.
As management shifted focus, the numbers started to improve. Managers realized, for example, that if a customer representative in a branch engaged at least once a day with an online adviser to resolve a customer issue in real time, both the employee and the customer became more comfortable with the new digital platform. As a result, the company began to realize more of the expected savings, customers grew to appreciate the convenience of online banking, and branch employees gave better service. Subsequent leadership debates shifted from pure technology to more human considerations. After all, organizations don’t adopt technology, people do.
With technology increasingly automating routine white-collar tasks, the ability to apply human judgment, inspiration, and creativity carries an even higher premium. Consider, for example, the demographic and societal changes fueling the next generation’s desire to work with organizations with a clear and compelling mission. Part of the psychology behind this shift is the natural human desire for stability and predictability. Against the backdrop of technology-driven change and workforce fluidity, a strong and unchanging organizational purpose or mission provides a solid foundation. Emotional connection, empathy, and the capacity to motivate all take on new importance.
Business concepts that have their roots in technology, like distributed innovation, can also require new ways of managing and unlocking human ingenuity. I hear this all the time from executives across industries, including in the not-for-profit sector. Medair, a global emergency relief and humanitarian nongovernmental organization I collaborate with closely, illustrates the value of pairing distributed innovation with a front line that displays strong EQ. To bring innovative sanitation, health and energy solutions to those in greatest need in areas devastated by conflict, drought or natural disaster, Medair leverages its people-to-people orientation on the front lines. It brings insight and innovative ideas from the field back to headquarters, where Medair taps into a strong network of technologically cutting-edge institutions, both academic and private. Collaborating with these universities and organizations, Medair has developed effective approaches to such critical challenges as clean drinking water and proper nutrition.
Clarity on how digital disruption affects your industry and your business is critical. It is even more important to develop a clear picture of the implications for your workforce, their required capabilities, and your leadership style. Just when one might have thought technology was taking over, human considerations have assumed new forms and importance. Think of it as EQ’s revenge in the digital age.DOG TRAINING 101
Congratulations! You've already taken the first step to becoming a better dog owner. A lot of people look into dog training in order to stop unwanted behaviors, but dog training can also unlock the ability for you to communicate with your dog like never before, allowing you to experience more fun and fulfillment than you could without dog training.
A professionally trained dog will bring more joy into your life.
If this is your first time looking into professional dog training, you are probably noticing a lot of different options. It's normal to feel unsure about where to start. Is dog training something that is right for you and your dog? How should you find the right trainer?
DOES MY DOG NEED TRAINING?
Dogs naturally crave structure therefore they all need training in one form or another. Training can eliminate bad or unwanted behaviors while establishing new and healthy behaviors.
A lot of dog owners start off teaching their dog how to sit, or "shake". While that's a good start, a lot of those behaviors are more "tricks" than true training.
Dog training is designed to teach reliable and consistent responses anytime you communicate with your dog. A lot of dogs may come to us when we have food, or sit for us sometimes, but oftentimes those behaviors are inconsistent. For example:
Are you 100% confident your dog would come back to you if he/she saw another dog across the road?
Are you 100% confident your dog wouldn't pull, bark or bite if they crossed paths with another dog or person on a walk?
We all love our pets and want the best for them. Training is essential to ensure SAFETY for you and your dog while also enabling you to experience more FUN AND ENJOYMENT with them than ever before!
Safety
A good analogy is a car seatbelt. You (hopefully) put on your seatbelt every time you get in a car even though its not put to use every time you go for a ride, however, it's incredibly important when you need it.
It's similar with dogs...
Training will allow you to avoid any potentially negative situations. Instead of your dog barking and chasing the dog across the street, they will instead listen to you to stay next to you, helping you avoid stress, aggravation, and possibly worse.
Fun and Enjoyment
When you got a dog, what did you envision? Most people think of playing with their dog in the house or outside, or going on calm, peaceful walks in a park, a beach, or even just around your neighborhood.
You certainly didn't desire a dog pulling you around on a leash, barking at other people or choosing when to respond when you call them.
This isn't good for you or your dog!
You and your dog deserve a better experience.
Training will dramatically improve the experience you will have with your dog for life. Do the things with your dog you always wanted to do, and much more!
FINDING THE RIGHT DOG TRAINER
Tips for finding the best trainer for you:
Not all dog training is the same, so make sure you ask questions to any trainer that you are considering.
First, ask each trainer about their methods and philosophy. Every dog is different and your trainer needs to have experience with multiple techniques. Similar to humans, different dogs learn in different ways. A one-size-fits-all approach will not be beneficial in most cases. Make sure the trainer has a variety of tools and methods to help YOUR individual dog based on their individual needs.
It’s important to identify the type of training you need. Good trainers have niches and work best with particular cases. Some love working with puppies, some love working with basic obedience, some work best with protection or sport work and some love those difficult behavior cases. Understand what your goals are and start looking for trainers that have experience in that area.
Education and Experience: With so many people getting dogs recently, more and more dog trainers are popping up. Make sure your trainer has plenty of experience, as well as years of formal training. Ask where they received training.
Ask if the trainer does this full-time. There are a lot of part-time trainers out there. In order to provide the best training for your dog, training should be their exclusive focus.
Finally, look for someone who you’re comfortable with. This person will either be in your home or will be responsible for the care of your best friend. Ensure you’re comfortable with the trainer, their techniques, and the services they will provide!A Calendar that Makes you Smile Every Day

"``tailcc``" - Tail callable calling convention
This calling convention ensures that calls in tail position will always be
tail call optimized. This calling convention is equivalent to fastcc,
except for an additional guarantee that tail calls will be produced
whenever possible. `Tail calls can only be optimized when this, the fastcc,
the GHC or the HiPE convention is used. <CodeGenerator.html#id80>`_ This
calling convention does not support varargs and requires the prototype of
all callees to exactly match the prototype of the function definition.

This calling convention is used for the Control Flow Guard check function,
calls to which can be inserted before indirect calls to check that the call
target is a valid function address. The check function has no return value,
but it will trigger an OS-level error if the address is not a valid target.
The set of registers preserved by the check function, and the register
containing the target address are architecture-specific.
- On X86 the target address is passed in ECX.
- On ARM the target address is passed in R0.

Global variables define regions of memory allocated at compilation time

Global variable definitions must be initialized.
Global variables in other translation units can also be declared, in which
case they don't have an initializer.
Global variables can optionally specify a :ref:`linkage type <linkage>`.``.
For global variables declarations, as well as definitions that may be
replaced at link time (``linkonce``, ``weak``, ``extern_weak`` and ``common``
linkage types), LLVM makes no assumptions about the allocation size of the
variables, except that they may not overlap. The alignment of a global variable
declaration or replaceable definition must not be greater than the alignment of
the definition it resolves to.>`.
:ref:`Scalable vectors <t_vector>` cannot be global variables or members of

Parameter Attributes
--------------------:
.. code-block:: llvm(<ty>)```` functions should not write to
``byval`` parameters). This is not a valid attribute for return
values.
The byval type argument indicates the in-memory value type, and
must be the same as the pointee type of the argument..
.. _attr_byref:
``byref(<ty>)``
The ``byref`` argument attribute allows specifying the pointee
memory type of an argument. This is similar to ``byval``, but does
not imply a copy is made anywhere, or that the argument is passed
on the stack. This implies the pointer is dereferenceable up to
the storage size of the type.
It is not generally permissible to introduce a write to an
``byref`` pointer. The pointer may have any address space and may
be read only.
This is not a valid attribute for return values.
The alignment for an ``byref`` parameter can be explicitly
specified by combining it with the ``align`` attribute, similar to
``byval``. If the alignment is not specified, then the code generator
makes a target-specific assumption.
This is intended for representing ABI constraints, and is not
intended to be inferred for optimization use.
.. _attr_preallocated:
``preallocated(<ty>)``
This indicates that the pointer parameter should really be passed by
value to the function, and that the pointer parameter's pointee has
already been initialized before the call instruction. This attribute
is only valid on LLVM pointer arguments. The argument must be the value
returned by the appropriate
:ref:`llvm.call.preallocated.arg<int_call_preallocated_arg>` on non
``musttail`` calls, or the corresponding caller parameter in ``musttail``
calls, although it is ignored during codegen.
A non ``musttail`` function call with a ``preallocated`` attribute in
any parameter must have a ``"preallocated"`` operand bundle. A ``musttail``
function call cannot have a ``"preallocated"`` operand bundle.
The preallocated attribute requires a type argument, which must be
the same as the pointee type of the argument.
The preallocated(<ty>)``. :ref:`llvm.stackrestore
<int_stackrestore>`.
The inalloca attribute requires a type argument, which must be the
same as the pointee type of the argument.
See :doc:`InAlloca` for more information on how to use this
attribute.
``sret(.
The sret type argument specifies the in memory type, which must be
the same as the pointee type of the argument.
.. _attr_align:
``align <n>`` or ``align(<n>)``
This indicates that the pointer value has the specified alignment.
If the pointer value does not have the specified alignment,
:ref:`poison value <poisonvalues>` is returned or passed instead. The
``align`` attribute should be combined with the ``noundef`` attribute to
ensure a pointer is aligned, or otherwise the behavior is undefined. Note
that ``align 1`` has no effect on non-byval, non-preallocated arguments.
Note that this attribute has additional semantics when combined with the
``byval`` or ``preallocated`` attribute, which are documented there.
.. _noalias:
``noalias``
This indicates that memory locations accessed via pointer values
:ref:`based <pointeraliasing>` on the argument or return value are not also
accessed, during the execution of the function, via pointer values not
*based* on the argument or return value. This guarantee only holds for
memory locations that are *modified*, by any means, during the execution of
the function.:
``nocapture``
This indicates that the callee does not :ref:`capture <pointercapture>` the
pointer. This is not a valid attribute for return values.
This attribute applies only to the particular copy of the pointer passed in
this argument. A caller could pass two copies of the same pointer with one
being annotated nocapture and the other not, and the callee could validly
capture through the non annotated parameter.
.. code-block:: llvm
define void @f(i8* nocapture %a, i8* %b) {
; (capture %b)
}
call void @f(i8* @glb, i8* @glb) ; well-defined
``nofree``
This indicates that callee does not free the pointer argument. This is not
a valid attribute for return values.
.. _nest:
``nest``
This indicates that the pointer parameter can be excised using the
:ref:`trampoline intrinsics <int_trampoline>`.
:ref:`bitcast instruction <i_bitcast>`.,
:ref:`poison value <poisonvalues>` is returned or passed instead.
The ``nonnull`` attribute should be combined with the ``noundef`` attribute
to ensure a pointer is not null or otherwise`` attribute does not imply
dereferenceability (consider a pointer to one element past the end of an
array), however ``dereferenceable(<n>)`` does imply ``nonnull`` in
``addrspace(0)`` (which is the default address space), except if the
``null_pointer_is_valid`` function attribute is present.
``n`` should be a positive number. The pointer should be well defined,
otherwise it is undefined behavior. This means ``dereferenceable(<n>)``
implies ``noundef``.
`````.
``noundef``
This attribute applies to parameters and return values. If the value
representation contains any undefined or poison bits, the behavior is
undefined. Note that this does not refer to padding introduced by the
type's storage representation.
``alignstack(<n>)``
This indicates the alignment that should be considered by the backend when
assigning this parameter to a stack slot during calling convention
lowering. The enforcement of the specified alignment is target-dependent,
as target-specific calling convention rules may override this value. This
attribute serves the purpose of carrying language specific alignment
information that is not mapped to base types in the backend (for example,
over-alignment specification through language attributes).
.. _gc:
Garbage Collector Strategy Names
--------------------------------
Each function may specify a garbage collector strategy name, which is simply a
string:

define void @f() gc "name" { ... }
The supported values of *name* includes those :ref:`built in to LLVM
<builtin-gc-strategies>`data:

.. _fnattrs:
Function Attributes
-------------------:
.. code-block:: llvm`` attribute. This is only valid at call sites for
direct calls to functions that are declared with the ``nobuiltin``
attribute.
```.
``hot``
This attribute indicates that this function is a hot spot of the program
execution. The function will be optimized more aggressively and will be
placed into special subsection of the text section to improving locality.
When profile feedback is enabled, this attribute has the precedence over
the profile information. By marking a function ``hot``, users can work
around the cases where the training input does not have good coverage
on all the hot functions.
``` must-inline-line-tables"``
When this attribute is set to true, the inliner discards source locations
when inlining code and instead uses the source location of the call site.
Breakpoints set on code that was inlined into the current function will
not fire during the execution of the inlined call sites. If the debugger
stops inside an inlined call site, it will appear to be stopped at the
outermost inlined call site.
```free``
This function attribute indicates that the function does not, directly or
transitively, call a memory-deallocation function (``free``, for example)
on a memory allocation which existed before the call.
As a result, uncaptured pointers that are known to be dereferenceable
prior to a call to a function with the ``nofree`` attribute are still
known to be dereferenceable after the call. The capturing condition is
necessary in environments where the function might communicate the
pointer to another thread which then deallocates the memory. Alternatively,
``nosync`` would ensure such communication cannot happen and even captured
pointers cannot be freed by the function.
A ``nofree`` function is explicitly allowed to free memory which it
allocated or (if not ``nosync``) arrange for another thread to free
memory on it's behalf. As a result, perhaps surprisingly, a ``nofree``
function can return a pointer to a previously deallocated memory object.
``noimplicitfloat``
This attributes disables implicit floating-point instructions.
``noinline``
This attribute indicates that the inliner should never inline this
function in any situation. This attribute may not be used together
with the ``alwaysinline`` attribute.
``nomerge``
This attribute indicates that calls to this function should never be merged
during optimization. For example, it will prevent tail merging otherwise
identical code sequences that raise an exception or terminate the program.
Tail merging normally reduces the precision of source location information,
making stack traces less useful for debugging. This attribute gives the
user control over the tradeoff between code size and debug information
precision.
`, hence through a return instruction. This produces undefined
behavior at runtime if the function ever does dynamically return. Annotated
functions may still raise an exception, i.a., ``nounwind`` is not implied.
``norecurse``
This function attribute indicates that the function does not call itself
either directly or indirectly down any possible call path. This produces
undefined behavior at runtime if the function ever does recurse.
``willreturn``
This function attribute indicates that a call of this function will
either exhibit undefined behavior or comes back and continues execution
at a point in the existing call stack that includes the current invocation.
Annotated functions may still raise an exception, i.a., ``nounwind`` is not implied.
If an invocation of an annotated function does not return control back
to a point in the call stack, the behavior is undefined.
``nosync``
This function attribute indicates that the function does not communicate
(synchronize) with another thread through memory or other well-defined means.
Synchronization is considered possible in the presence of `atomic` accesses
that enforce an order, thus not "unordered" and "monotonic", `volatile` accesses,
as well as `convergent` function calls. Note that through `convergent` function calls
non-memory communication, e.g., cross-lane operations, are possible and are also
considered synchronization. However `convergent` does not contradict `nosync`.
If an annotated function does ever synchronize with another thread,
the behavior is undefined.
`, then the ``null`` address
in address-space 0 is considered to be a valid address for memory loads and
stores. Any analysis or optimization should not treat dereferencing a
pointer to ``null`` as undefined behavior in this function.
Note: Comparing address of a global variable to ``null`` may``
attribute; this attribute is also incompatible
with the ``minsize`` attribute and the ``optsize`` attribute.
This attribute requires the ``noinline`` attribute to be specified on
the function as well, so the function is never inlined into any caller.
Only functions with the ``alwaysinline`` attribute`` can be used together with ``readonly`` attribute``_memtag``
This attribute indicates that MemTagSanitizer checks
(dynamic address safety analysis based on Armv8 MTE)``.
A function with the ``ssp`` attribute but without the ``alwaysinline``
attribute cannot be inlined into a function without a
``ssp/sspreq/sspstrong`` attribute. If inlined, the caller will get the
``ssp`` attribute.
``` function attribute.
A function with the ``sspstrong`` attribute but without the
``alwaysinline`` attribute cannot be inlined into a function without a
``ssp/sspstrong/sspreq`` attribute. If inlined, the caller will get the
``sspstrong`` attribute unless the ``sspreq`` attribute exists.
``sspreq``
This attribute indicates that the function should *always* emit a stack
smashing protector. This overrides the ``ssp`` and ``sspstrong`` function
attributes..
A function with the ``sspreq`` attribute but without the ``alwaysinline``
attribute cannot be inlined into a function without a
``ssp/sspstrong/sspreq`` attribute. If inlined, the caller will get the
``sspreq`` attribute.
`. LLVM will
not introduce any new floating-point instructions that may trap.
``"denormal-fp-math"``
This indicates the denormal (subnormal) handling that may be
assumed for the default floating-point environment. This is a
comma separated pair. The elements may be one of ``"ieee"``,
``"preserve-sign"``, or ``"positive-zero"``. The first entry
indicates the flushing mode for the result of floating point
operations. The second indicates the handling of denormal inputs
to floating point instructions. For compatibility with older
bitcode, if the second value is omitted, both input and output
modes will assume the same mode.
If this is attribute is not specified, the default is
``"ieee,ieee"``.
If the output mode is ``"preserve-sign"``, or ``"positive-zero"``,
denormal outputs may be flushed to zero by standard floating-point
operations. It is not mandated that flushing to zero occurs, but if
a denormal output is flushed to zero, it must respect the sign
mode. Not all targets support all modes. While this indicates the
expected floating point mode the function will be executed with,
this does not make any attempt to ensure the mode is
consistent. User or platform code is expected to set the floating
point mode appropriately before function entry.
If the input mode is ``"preserve-sign"``, or ``"positive-zero"``, a
floating-point operation must treat any input denormal value as
zero. In some situations, if an instruction does not respect this
mode, the input may need to be converted to 0 as if by
``@llvm.canonicalize`` during lowering for correctness.
``"denormal-fp-math-f32"``
Same as ``"denormal-fp-math"``, but only controls the behavior of
the 32-bit float type (or vectors of 32-bit floats). If both are
are present, this overrides ``"denormal-fp-math"``. Not all targets
support separately setting the denormal mode per type, and no
attempt is made to diagnose unsupported uses. Currently this
attribute is respected by the AMDGPU and NVPTX backends.
`` epilog. It is
currently x86_64-specific.
``mustprogress``
This attribute indicates that the function is required to return, unwind,
or interact with the environment in an observable way e.g. via a volatile
memory access, I/O, or other synchronization. The ``mustprogress``
attribute is intended to model the requirements of the first section of
[intro.progress] of the C++ Standard. As a consequence, a loop in a
function with the `mustprogress` attribute can be assumed to terminate if
it does not interact with the environment in an observable way, and
terminating loops without side-effects can be removed. If a `mustprogress`
function does not satisfy this contract, the behavior is undefined. This
attribute does not apply transitively to callees, but does apply to call
sites within the function. Note that `willreturn` implies `mustprogress`.
``vscale_range(<min>[, <max>])``
This attribute indicates the minimum and maximum vscale value for the given
function. A value of 0 means unbounded. If the optional max value is omitted
then max is set to the value of min. If the attribute is not present, no
assumptions are made about the range of vscale.
Call Site Attributes
----------------------
In addition to function attributes the following call site only
attributes are supported:
``vector-function-abi-variant``
This attribute can be attached to a :ref:`call <i_call>` to list
the vector functions associated to the function. Notice that the
attribute cannot be attached to a :ref:`invoke <i_invoke>` or a
:ref:`callbr <i_callbr>` instruction. The attribute consists of a
comma separated list of mangled names. The order of the list does
not imply preference (it is logically a set). The compiler is free
to pick any listed vector function of its choosing.
The syntax for the mangled names is as follows:::
_ZGV<isa><mask><vlen><parameters>_<scalar_name>[(<vector_redirection>)]
When present, the attribute informs the compiler that the function
``<scalar_name>`` has a corresponding vector variant that can be
used to perform the concurrent invocation of ``<scalar_name>`` on
vectors. The shape of the vector function is described by the
tokens between the prefix ``_ZGV`` and the ``<scalar_name>``
token. The standard name of the vector function is
``_ZGV<isa><mask><vlen><parameters>_<scalar_name>``. When present,
the optional token ``(<vector_redirection>)`` informs the compiler
that a custom name is provided in addition to the standard one
(custom names can be provided for example via the use of ``declare
variant`` in OpenMP 5.0). The declaration of the variant must be
present in the IR Module. The signature of the vector variant is
determined by the rules of the Vector Function ABI (VFABI)
specifications of the target. For Arm and X86, the VFABI can be
found at and,
respectively.
For X86 and Arm targets, the values of the tokens in the standard
name are those that are defined in the VFABI. LLVM has an internal
``<isa>`` token that can be used to create scalar-to-vector
mappings for functions that are not directly associated to any of
the target ISAs (for example, some of the mappings stored in the
TargetLibraryInfo). Valid values for the ``<isa>`` token are:::
<isa>:= b | c | d | e -> X86 SSE, AVX, AVX2, AVX512
| n | s -> Armv8 Advanced SIMD, SVE
| __LLVM__ -> Internal LLVM Vector ISA
For all targets currently supported (x86, Arm and Internal LLVM),
the remaining tokens can have the following values:::
<mask>:= M | N -> mask | no mask
<vlen>:= number -> number of lanes
| x -> VLA (Vector Length Agnostic)
<parameters>:= v -> vector
| l | l <number> -> linear
| R | R <number> -> linear with ref modifier
| L | L <number> -> linear with val modifier
| U | U <number> -> linear with uval modifier
| ls <pos> -> runtime linear
| Rs <pos> -> runtime linear with ref modifier
| Ls <pos> -> runtime linear with val modifier
| Us <pos> -> runtime linear with uval modifier
| u -> uniform
<scalar_name>:= name of the scalar function
<vector_redirection>:= optional, custom name of the vector function
``preallocated(<ty>)``
This attribute is required on calls to ``llvm.call.preallocated.arg``
and cannot be used on any other call. See
:ref:`llvm.call.preallocated.arg<int_call_preallocated_arg>` for more
details.
.. _glattrs:
Global Attributes
-----------------
Attributes may be set to communicate additional information about a global variable.
Unlike :ref:`function attributes <fnattrs>`, attributes on a global variable
are grouped into a single :ref:`attribute group <attrgrp>`.
.. _opbundles:
Operand Bundles
---------------``opt.
.. _ob_funclet:
Funclet Operand Bundles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\ <ExceptionHandling.html#wineh-constraints>`_),
it is undefined behavior to execute a ``call`` or ``invoke`` which:
* does not have a ``"funclet"`` bundle and is not a ``call`` to :ref:`GC Transitions
<gc_transition_args>`.
The bundle.
.. _assume_opbundles:
Assume Operand Bundles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Operand bundles on an :ref:`llvm.assume <int_assume>` allows representing
assumptions that a :ref:`parameter attribute <paramattrs>` or a
:ref:`function attribute <fnattrs>` holds for a certain value at a certain
location. Operand bundles enable assumptions that are either hard or impossible
to represent as a boolean argument of an :ref:`llvm.assume <int_assume>`.
An assume operand bundle has the form:
::
"<tag>"([ <holds for value> [, <attribute argument>] ])
* The tag of the operand bundle is usually the name of attribute that can be
assumed to hold. It can also be `ignore`, this tag doesn't contain any
information and should be ignored.
* The first argument if present is the value for which the attribute hold.
* The second argument if present is an argument of the attribute.
If there are no arguments the attribute is a property of the call location.
If the represented attribute expects a constant argument, the argument provided
to the operand bundle should be a constant as well.
For example:
.. code-block:: llvm
call void @llvm.assume(i1 true) ["align"(i32* %val, i32 8)]
allows the optimizer to assume that at location of call to
:ref:`llvm.assume <int_assume>` ``%val`` has an alignment of at least 8.
.. code-block:: llvm
call void @llvm.assume(i1 %cond) ["cold"(), "nonnull"(i64* %val)]
allows the optimizer to assume that the :ref:`llvm.assume <int_assume>`
call location is cold and that ``%val`` may not be null.
Just like for the argument of :ref:`llvm.assume <int_assume>`, if any of the
provided guarantees are violated at runtime the behavior is undefined.
Even if the assumed property can be encoded as a boolean value, like
``nonnull``, using operand bundles to express the property can still have
benefits:
* Attributes that can be expressed via operand bundles are directly the
property that the optimizer uses and cares about. Encoding attributes as
operand bundles removes the need for an instruction sequence that represents
the property (e.g., `icmp ne i32* %p, null` for `nonnull`) and for the
optimizer to deduce the property from that instruction sequence.
* Expressing the property using operand bundles makes it easy to identify the
use of the value as a use in an :ref:`llvm.assume <int_assume>`. This then
simplifies and improves heuristics, e.g., for use "use-sensitive"
optimizations.
.. _ob_preallocated:
Preallocated Operand Bundles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Preallocated operand bundles are characterized by the ``"preallocated"``
operand bundle tag. These operand bundles allow separation of the allocation
of the call argument memory from the call site. This is necessary to pass
non-trivially copyable objects by value in a way that is compatible with MSVC
on some targets. There can be at most one ``"preallocated"`` operand bundle
attached to a call site and it must have exactly one bundle operand, which is
a token generated by ``@llvm.call.preallocated.setup``. A call with this
operand bundle should not adjust the stack before entering the function, as
that will have been done by one of the ``@llvm.call.preallocated.*`` intrinsics.
.. code-block:: llvm
%foo = type { i64, i32 }
...
%t = call token @llvm.call.preallocated.setup(i32 1)
%a = call i8* @llvm.call.preallocated.arg(token %t, i32 0) preallocated(%foo)
%b = bitcast i8* %a to %foo*
; initialize %b
call void @bar(i32 42, %foo* preallocated(%foo) %b) ["preallocated"(token %t)]
.. _ob_gc_live:
GC Live Operand Bundles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A "gc-live" operand bundle is only valid on a :ref:`gc.statepoint <gc_statepoint>`
intrinsic. The operand bundle must contain every pointer to a garbage collected
object which potentially needs to be updated by the garbage collector.
When lowered, any relocated value will be recorded in the corresponding
:ref:`stackmap entry <statepoint-stackmap-format>`. See the intrinsic description
for further details.
ObjC ARC Attached Call Operand Bundles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A ``"clang.arc.attachedcall`` operand bundle on a call indicates the call is
implicitly followed by a marker instruction and a call to an ObjC runtime
function that uses the result of the call. If the argument passed to the operand
bundle is 0, ``@objc_retainAutoreleasedReturnValue`` is called. If 1 is passed,
``@objc_unsafeClaimAutoreleasedReturnValue`` is called. A call with this bundle
implicitly uses its return value.
The operand bundle is needed to ensure the call is immediately followed by the
marker instruction or the ObjC runtime call in the final output.

``G<address space>``
Specifies the address space to be used by default when creating global

Note: variable declarations without an address space are always created in

when creating globals without additional contextual information (e.g. in
LLVM passes).

.. _objectlifetime:
Object Lifetime
----------------------
A memory object, or simply object, is a region of a memory space that is
reserved by a memory allocation such as :ref:`alloca <i_alloca>`, heap
allocation calls, and global variable definitions.
Once it is allocated, the bytes stored in the region can only be read or written
through a pointer that is :ref:`based on <pointeraliasing>` the allocation
value.
If a pointer that is not based on the object tries to read or write to the
object, it is undefined behavior.
A lifetime of a memory object is a property that decides its accessibility.
Unless stated otherwise, a memory object is alive since its allocation, and
dead after its deallocation.
It is undefined behavior to access a memory object that isn't alive, but
operations that don't dereference it such as
:ref:`getelementptr <i_getelementptr>`, :ref:`ptrtoint <i_ptrtoint>` and
:ref:`icmp <i_icmp>` return a valid result.
This explains code motion of these instructions across operations that
impact the object's lifetime.
A stack object's lifetime can be explicitly specified using
:ref:`llvm.lifetime.start <int_lifestart>` and
:ref:`llvm.lifetime.end <int_lifeend>` intrinsic function calls.
.. _pointeraliasing:
Pointer Aliasing Rules
---------------------- :ref:`undef value <undefvalues>` in *any*ptr````.
:ref:`Metadata <metadata>` may be used to encode additional information
which specialized optimization passes may use to implement type-based
alias analysis.
.. _pointercapture:
Pointer Capture
---------------
Given a function call and a pointer that is passed as an argument or stored in
the memory before the call, a pointer is *captured* by the call if it makes a
copy of any part of the pointer that outlives the call.
To be precise, a pointer is captured if one or more of the following conditions
hold:
1. The call stores any bit of the pointer carrying information into a place,
and the stored bits can be read from the place by the caller after this call
exits.
.. code-block:: llvm
@glb = global i8* null
@glb2 = global i8* null
@glb3 = global i8* null
@glbi = global i32 0
define i8* @f(i8* %a, i8* %b, i8* %c, i8* %d, i8* %e) {
store i8* %a, i8** @glb ; %a is captured by this call
store i8* %b, i8** @glb2 ; %b isn't captured because the stored value is overwritten by the store below
store i8* null, i8** @glb2
store i8* %c, i8** @glb3
call void @g() ; If @g makes a copy of %c that outlives this call (@f), %c is captured
store i8* null, i8** @glb3
%i = ptrtoint i8* %d to i64
%j = trunc i64 %i to i32
store i32 %j, i32* @glbi ; %d is captured
ret i8* %e ; %e is captured
}
2. The call stores any bit of the pointer carrying information into a place,
and the stored bits can be safely read from the place by another thread via
synchronization.
.. code-block:: llvm
@lock = global i1 true
define void @f(i8* %a) {
store i8* %a, i8** @glb
store atomic i1 false, i1* @lock release ; %a is captured because another thread can safely read @glb
store i8* null, i8** @glb
ret void
}
3. The call's behavior depends on any bit of the pointer carrying information.
.. code-block:: llvm
@glb = global i8 0
define void @f(i8* %a) {
%c = icmp eq i8* %a, @glb
br i1 %c, label %BB_EXIT, label %BB_CONTINUE ; escapes %a
BB_EXIT:
call void @exit()
unreachable
BB_CONTINUE:
ret void
}

:Overview:.
), an underlying primitive data type,
and a scalable property to represent vectors where the exact hardware
vector length is unknown at compile time. Vector types are considered
:ref:`first class <t_firstclass>`.
:Memory Layout:
In general vector elements are laid out in memory in the same way as
:ref:`array types <t_array>`. Such an anology works fine as long as the vector
elements are byte sized. However, when the elements of the vector aren't byte
sized it gets a bit more complicated. One way to describe the layout is by
describing what happens when a vector such as <N x iM> is bitcasted to an
integer type with N*M bits, and then following the rules for storing such an
integer to memory.
A bitcast from a vector type to a scalar integer type will see the elements
being packed together (without padding). The order in which elements are
inserted in the integer depends on endianess. For little endian element zero
is put in the least significant bits of the integer, and for big endian
element zero is put in the most significant bits.
Using a vector such as ``<i4 1, i4 2, i4 3, i4 5>`` as an example, together
with the analogy that we can replace a vector store by a bitcast followed by
an integer store, we get this for big1235.
store i16 %val, i16* %ptr
; In memory the content will be (8-bit addressing):
;
; [%ptr + 0]: 00010010 (0x12)
; [%ptr + 1]: 00110101 (0x35)
The same example for little5321.
store i16 %val, i16* %ptr
; In memory the content will be (8-bit addressing):
;
; [%ptr + 0]: 01010011 (0x53)
; [%ptr + 1]: 00100001 (0x21)
When ``<N*M>`` isn't evenly divisible by the byte size the exact memory layout
is unspecified (just like it is for an integral type of the same size). This
is because different targets could put the padding at different positions when
the type size is smaller than the type's store size.
:Syntax:
::
< <# elements> x <elementtype> > ; Fixed-length vector
< vscale x <# elements> x <elementtype> > ; Scalable vector
The number of elements is a constant integer value larger than 0;
elementtype may be any integer, floating-point or pointer type. Vectors
of size zero are not allowed. For scalable vectors, the total number of
elements is a constant multiple (called vscale) of the specified number
of elements; vscale is a positive integer that is unknown at compile time
and the same hardware-dependent constant for all scalable vectors at run
time. The size of a specific scalable vector type is thus constant within
IR, even if the exact size in bytes cannot be determined until run time.

| ``<4 x i32>`` | Vector of 4 32-bit integer values. |

photographer
Interstate 70 through Glenwood Canyon will be fully closed from 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday as crews install some heavy-duty fencing at the site of major rockfalls in February.
Alternative routes include detours through Steamboat and Craig.
Crews will use a Huey helicopter to lift 13 steel posts, weighing from 1,800 to 2,800 pounds each, to two sites along the northern canyon wall just west of the Hanging Lake Tunnel.
The highest of these fences, which are each 16-feet-tall by about 200-feet-wide, will be installed about 300 feet up the canyon wall.
These locations were scouted out by Colorado Department of Transportation geotechnical specialists, and the fencing will be positioned to provide some redundancy of protection, said project engineer Mike Fowler.
After these closures the rockfall mitigation project will continue, with crews working seven days per week, partly to make up for some unexpectedly late supplies, until about Sept. 1.
Two more fences will be installed with a crane at lower elevations during that time, but the project is not expected to require any more full closures past Thursday.
Some of the ongoing work installing the lower two fences may require a 10-foot vehicle restriction on the westbound lane.
These fences, equipped with braking mechanisms, are capable of stopping boulders up to six and seven feet in diameter, said Jim Stepisnik, the project manager. That’s equivalent to about 3.6 million foot-pounds of force, he said.
“These are some of the biggest high-impact fences that will have been installed in the U.S.”
I-70 was closed for nearly a week in February after major rockslides. It was the longest closure in the 24-year history of I-70 through the slide-prone canyon.
Much of the work to prep the sites of these fences, digging and pouring concrete, has been done by hand with crews hiking up to the locations, said Stepisnik.
The fences are first galvanized, then given a protective coating to give them a long working life, said Fowler.
The rockfall mitigation project has a $1.7 million budget, which Stepisnik said has so far come in on time and on budget.
CDOT has a $9 million geohazards budget and about 750 rockfall areas that the agency monitors, the Post Independent reported earlier.
Crews working on the Grand Avenue bridge project plan to take advantage of the closures to get some utility work done on the new pedestrian bridge — hopefully allowing the team to avoid a couple of night detours of Interstate 70.
Detours include routes through Northwest ColoradoDetours include routes through Northwest Colorado
Detours include routes through Northwest Colorado
Drivers heading west from Eagle County should first drive east to Wolcott, head north on Colorado Highway 131, turn west on U.S. Highway 40 in Steamboat Springs, then south on Colorado Highway 13 in Craig and on to Rifle.
Drivers headed east can take Highway 13 up to Craig and get on U.S. Highway 40.
From Wolcott to Rifle, this detour is 204 miles and takes about 3 hours and 45 minutes.
Drivers in Grand Junction can get to the Front Range by taking U.S. 50 east to U.S. 285 for drivers heading to Denver and to U.S. 24 for those going to Colorado Springs.
Some alternate routes have width restrictions that commercial drivers should be aware of — Colorado 131 has an 8-foot width restriction and Colorado 9 north of I-70 has a 12-foot width restriction.
Westbound I-70 traffic will be forced to exit at Dotsero, and eastbound traffic will have to exit in Glenwood Springs at Exit 116. Drivers will not be allowed to queue up on I-70 for the canyon opening.
The Hanging Lake rest area will also be closed early, starting at midnight preceding evening and remaining closed until 3:30 p.m. each day.
CDOT will maintain access for No Name residents.
For alternate routes, motorists coming west from the Front Range can head south on Colorado 91 at Copper Mountain, continue south on U.S. 24 through Leadville and finally turn back west on Colorado 82 and onto Independence Pass.
This route is 123 miles and takes about 2 hours and 40 minutes. It’s important to note that Independence Pass has a 35-foot vehicle length restriction.
Commercial vehicles west of Glenwood Canyon will be able to park in Dotsero off Exit 133.
CSP will also be staging commercial vehicles on I-70 west of the canyon closure.
CDOT does not recommend driving Cottonwood Pass, Frying Pan Road or Hagerman Pass as alternative routes.
Bustang will continue to run routes between Glenwood Springs and Denver.

The model showed that rising temperatures and a growing number of weather-related disasters now cause more migration than lack of income or political freedom.
Each 10 per cent increase in temperature in an origin country caused an increase of 3 per cent in migration from that country to the 16 destination countries, which included Australia, Italy, Spain and Germany.
“
Both developed and at-risk countries need more planning and policy to prepare for what is likely to be a growing trend of people wanting to move.
Dennis Wesselbaum, economist, Otago Business School
The study, published last month in the journal Global and Planetary Change, also found that this migration happens in stages.
Dennis Wesselbaum, the lead researcher and an economist at the Otago Business School, explains that migration actually decreased for around five years after a temperature anomaly, before increasing for the next 20 years.
“One explanation is that people move to places further away and have to save more money to finance migration cost, [or] that it takes time to identify the temperature shock,” Wesselbaum told SciDev.Net.
Raya Muttarak, senior lecturer of geography and international development at the UK’s University of East Anglia, believes another reason for the apparent delay is that people at first try “in-situ adaptation”.
.
Around 244 million people—2.8 per cent of the world’s population—were classed as migrants in 2015 by the UN. However, the UN has said it will not define climate migrants as refugees, a status that comes with more international support, citing concerns about watering down support programmes for those fleeing violent conflict.
A report by the UNFCC, the UN’s climate change body, found last year that, globally, countries are largely failing to deal with climate migration adequately.
“Recognising the causal factors behind this forced migration would require governments to apportion responsibility, both for the initial migration and for the solutions to it,” said Steve Trent, director of the Environmental Justice Foundation, which lobbies on environmental issues in the Global South.
“In many countries this is politically toxic and, without international agreement on shared and coordinated action, proves politically very hard to deal with.”
Wesselbaum is confident, however, that the problem will be recognised “sooner or later”, adding that the results of his study offer a more nuanced understanding of how people respond to climate shocks.
The climate migration model showed that migration remained stable after storms and drought, but increased significantly after floods and extreme temperature events.
“Both developed and at-risk countries need more planning and policy to prepare for what is likely to be a growing trend of people wanting to move,” Wesselbaum added.

Leo James Alex, 78
December 3, 1942 – October 28, 2021
Leo James Alex died peacefully at home on Oct. 28, 2021, following a long illness. He was 78.
Leo was born on Dec. 3, 1942, in Rochester, Minn., the son of James and Gladys (Torkelson) Alex. His father was a proud Greek-American immigrant who believed in the American dream. James came to the United States in the 1920s and his last name, Alexakis, was shortened to Alex when he arrived.
Leo graduated cum laude from the University of Minnesota in 1964 with a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics. He completed a Ph.D. in Mathematics with a minor in Statistics at the University of Minnesota in 1970.
He moved to Oneonta, NY, in 1970 for a position as Assistant Professor of Mathematics at SUNY Oneonta, and never left. His career in the SUNY Oneonta Department of Mathematics, Computer Science and Statistics spanned 43 years. During that time, Leo spent one year as a Visiting Assistant Professor at the University of Virginia and earned the ranks of Associate Professor and Professor at SUNY Oneonta. He was elected department chair in 1988, a position he held until 2012.
Leo made many important contributions to the college’s mathematics curriculum, including creating several courses: Introduction to Finite Mathematics; Discrete Mathematical Structures; Modern Algebra and Theory of Equations I and II; Linear Algebra and Matrix Theory II; and Modern Applied Algebra; as well as writing the algebra requirements for the mathematics major.
A respected scholar in his field, Leo won several research grants and published numerous papers, article reviews and problem proposals in mathematical journals, as well as presenting at professional conferences across the country. His primary research interests were in the areas of group theory, number theory and Diophantine equations. He was a member of the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) up until his passing and served as the SUNY Oneonta MAA Liaison from 1983 to 2012.
Leo was a dedicated teacher and a fierce advocate for the department, its faculty and its students. He was the faculty advisor for the Sanford Society, the department’s student math club. When he retired in 2013, he created a scholarship, in memory of his parents, to support outstanding SUNY Oneonta mathematics majors each year. He was a strong advocate for empowering women to succeed in the traditionally male-dominated field of mathematics, ahead of the times in his commitment to hiring strong female faculty for the department. He was a skilled teacher and strong mentor for many, many female math students – starting with his three daughters and four granddaughters.
Everyone who knew Leo knew he had a favorite number, loved the color purple, and always had time for a board game – or, preferably, two or three. He was a passionate believer in the power of education and was proud of his work not just to teach mathematics, but to train future math teachers.
He is survived by his three daughters, Melissa (Lisa) Maria Miller, Elizabeth Ellen Alex and Katherine Demetra Alex; two sons-in-law, Stephen Miller and Earl Millett; five grandchildren, Abigail Rebecca Miller, Allison Elizabeth Miller, Thalia Alexandra Millett, George Demetri Alex and Phoebe Ellen Alex; his brother-in-law, George Malaktaris; nephew, Tony Malaktaris; and nieces, Maria Carpenter, Jami Thom and Rita Golden.
He was predeceased by his parents, James and Gladys Alex, and his sister, Georgia Malaktaris.
A Greek Orthodox funeral service will be held at 11:30 a.m. Monday, Nov. 8, at the Greek Orthodox Church of the Assumption, 4752 NY 23 in Windham, NY 12496. The burial will follow at Oneonta Plains Cemetery.
The SUNY Oneonta Department of Mathematics, Computer Science and Statistics will also be holding an informal celebration of Leo’s life at a later date.
In lieu of flowers, contributions in Leo’s memory may be made to the James L. and Gladys T. Alex Mathematics Scholarship Award. Checks made payable to the College at Oneonta Foundation, with “in memory of Dr. Leo Alex” on the memo line may be sent to the Division of College Advancement, 108 Ravine Pkwy, 308 Netzer Administration Building, SUNY Oneonta, Oneonta, NY 13820. Gifts can also be made online at or over the phone by calling (607) 436-2535.

The markets were closed on Wednesday to honor the life and passing of President George H.W. Bush, but on Thursday the selloff continued in the market only to recoup most of the losses with a rally going into the close.
So, what’s going on? Robert Luna, chief executive officer & investment strategist at Surevest, shares his insights on what happened this week. “The market volatility this week has been caused by several factors,” said Robert. “There is a lot of uncertainty around the trade talks between the U.S. and China, plus the Federal Reserve is meeting in a couple of weeks and with the recent talks from chairman Powell and other Fed members, the markets are not sure what to make of their new tone.” Robert also mentioned that there were technical patterns that led to the sell off on Tuesday with the S&P 500 trading below its 200-day average, which is seen as a bearish signal. Robert continued, “This break in the technical pattern has caused program trading, automated computer algorithms, to accelerate the selling in the markets.”
The markets are a discount and balancing mechanism that overshoot on the upside and downside until it finds an equilibrium. This process is accentuated when there is high uncertainty, much like what we observed this week. There is nothing abnormal of what we are experiencing; the markets move in cycles and market decreases like what we are seeing now are part of investing. However, we understand that a few of our clients may become concerned with a spike in volatility, especially after coming out of a low volatility year like was 2017.
A Note Directly from Robert Luna
News and headlines while scary, are only important if you’re a trader. As a trader your time frame for full liquidity is between minutes and days; what moves the market in the short run is news and emotion. With today’s trading being dominated by computers, human beings will continue to experience increased frustration and are best to avoid stepping into that arena.
As investors however, if you are able to control your emotions, this noise actually creates opportunities. As an investor, you do not need to cash in your portfolio in minutes or days because your capital is managed to fund long term goals, such as college, weddings, thirty to forty year retirements etc. Trying to predict minute by minute moves is a fool’s game and nobody has the answer—no matter how much conviction they have on television. I can say this because I turned down 2 major media outlets this week that wanted my “view on the volatility.” There is no value in that opinion.
Buy and sell decisions should be made in the context of valuations. True value is only present in the market when there is uncertainty. When everyone feels good because the news is great, you must pay full price. As an investor if you sell every time the news is bad, you have committed to a lifetime of buying high and selling low. You should get out of the market and not re-enter if that is your plan.
The only advantage we have as investors today is the ability to control our emotions. You must be able to use greed as a sell signal and fear as a time to look for opportunity. In order to do that at Surevest we do two primary things for our clients.
- We make buy and sell decisions based on data, such as valuations, and your personal plan. Not on emotion.
- We segment assets in time blocks. This means that assets you need in 4-5 years to fund a goal are not reliant on stocks. Equities, real estate etc. are assets that are expected to outperform assets like cash and CD’s over time, but in the short run you cannot expect them to be an ATM.
If your assets are segmented according to your personal life goals, then when everyone else is panicking you are to able capitalize on that fear. In other words, buy low and sell high. This all sounds simple, but most investors lack a formal plan and end up making the same mistakes repeatedly.
This is the importance of tying your investing to your personal plan. At times like this it’s best to review your plan and check with your advisor if shifts are warranted. If your plan needs to be updated, it should be based on your goals changing not because there is uncertainties over foreign trade.
The U.S. markets are expected to be higher in twenty-four to thirty-six months from now, but I have no idea what the new scary headline will be at that time or what news will be released that frighten investors.
We will continue to navigate this environment for you and keep you updated. This includes both managing risk, but equally important being opportunistic when the emotion of others create bargains.
We appreciate the opportunities to help navigate these markets for you and keep you on track to meet your goal. As always, please reach out to your personal advisor with any questions.subscribE

It flies for a brief time in June, along the northwestern coast of Israel, with the Mediterranean Sea just miles away. It is a rare Protected species, and I played a hunch that I might find them in Hanita, a moshav in that seaside strip. My timing was perfect and here’s one of these beauties. He had just left his night-time perch, and we met as he bathed in the strong rays of the Israel morning sun.
So Israel sports four Parnassians. How many Parnassians are native to the U.S.A.? Remember the U.S.A. is what? 500 times bigger than Israel? Answer? Three Parnassians fly in the U.S.A. and of the three, only one flies only in Alaska. Then, two Parnassians fly in continental U.S.A..
I have never seen an American Parnassian butterfly. What say you?

One thought on “Middle Eastern Parnassian (Israel)”
I also have never seen an American Parnassian. The Israeli one is quite beautiful!Crowds of men, women and young people attended a rally this afternoon to call for improved mental health services across Northern Ireland.
The Storm Stormont event heard speeches and personal experiences from young and old from across Belfast and the united opinion on the day was that "something needs to change fast."
Organised by three friends from across the city, Helena Palmer, Jonny Collins and Chloe Murphy said they want action to help the " growing epidemic".
Helena, 22, told Belfast Live: "We were just talking about it one day, how there is an epidemic of suicide and how many people we know who are suffering now and can't get help.
"Every time someone does die through suicide, all you see throughout your news feed is calls for change, so we just wanted to help that call by organising a rally. We created the protest Facebook group and it blew up.
"We really didn't expect it to be as popular, but we have had such amazing support from everyone and can't give thanks enough to anyone who attended, or helped to organise the day.
"Everybody has been really great. We held a raffle a few weeks ago and the money raised from that went towards insurance and stuff for today and then whatever we have left is going to be donated to local mental health charities."
The West Belfast woman went on to say how delighted they were with the turn out.
She added: "We really hope that today sends a message to out MLAs so they know how much we want these services changed. It's cost too many lives already, so we can't let this go on.
"We also just wish that this will prompt others going through tough times to speak out and seek help. We are going to keep the Facebook page open after today for anyone that would feel more comfortable speaking to a stranger.
"We are here for you if you need to talk, so please reach out to the Storm Stormont Facebook group if you need to talk."

As he is lopes ahead through the knee-high tawny grass two magpies chatter and gripe, swooping low over his back. He seems indifferent.
We are on our annual family holiday to Ynys Enlli, a scrap of land off the north–west coast of Wales. I have set off towards the sea at the north end of the island and it is hot, dry and dusty – more like Galicia than Gwynedd. The world seems slow and amiable. On a pond an absent bird has swum some Jackson Pollock patterns though the algae and duckweed, leaving a casual unsigned art work for all to admire. Slender thistles are bristling burnt-out candles, bar a last flicker of soft purple on each tip. A meadow pipit lifts out of the grass peeping feebly as I approach.
I keep doing this (naming things) as I go along; it is an old indelible habit, both pleasure and compulsion. But I would prefer not to think that way this afternoon. I know how complex it is to keep this island running smoothly but right now I don’t want to evaluate or problem solve – just let the place permeate me.
There is a slight but priceless northerly breeze that keeps me from being fried. The dog and I settle on some flowery turf (centaury, hawkbit, milkwort, burnet saxifrage…….!) just above the rocky shore and overlooking the blue-green of the sea which shades to steel at the horizon, as sharp as a knife cut. All I can hear are gently lapping waves and the softly panting dog. I remember an old friend, long gone now, who used to like this spot; when he could no longer get to the island, he asked me to come and sit here for him. Enlli gets you like that.
At the north-west tip of the island I can’t resist lying down on the soft quilt of heather and dwarf willow which over the last 20 years has, thanks to careful management, arisen from near dead, over-grazed contortions into thriving maritime heathland. Favouring lolling over listing I marvel at the delicacy of a miniature world studded with yellow tormentil flowers and the palest pink cups of bog pimpernel. Yet this headland is often exposed to weather that would kill me in a few unprotected hours. The stone-faced earth banks (cloddiau in Welsh) that divide the fields in this part of the island are peppered with guano-splattered holes. There are thirty thousand (30,000!) pairs of Manx shearwaters nesting on Bardsey, in holes like these. In the hot of the afternoon the birds are either underground incubating their single egg or feeding out at sea. But at night, once it is properly dark, thousands of them will fly in, weaving a cat’s cradle of flight traced by their demonic howls and chatter – thus inverting the daytime world so that all of life appears to be in the sky.
Picking myself up from my reverie I realise the dog has gone – frustrated by the lack of progress I suppose. Pity, I liked him. Now I am completely alone with the glittering sea and lichen-black rocks; the only sounds are indolent waves and the music-hall moans of seals hauled out on the rocks at Honwy. I have nowhere to go, nothing to do – and yet somehow everything to experience: thistledown tumbling across the grass, the stink of sheep on the breeze, the clank of a closing gate, the steady gaze of brown–eyed cattle. In a tight black inlet bootlace seaweed sways laconically in the slack of the tide, further out patches of sea are that gorgeous azure-blue beloved of travel agents. But this is here, now – not some other longed for place accessible only by credit card.
Later on I make my way to a favourite place on the side of the ‘mountain’: a platform of white rock that juts out like a box at the opera above the steep slope of the cliffs to the swirling sea 200 feet below. This is where the gulls nest and there is constant movement of birds making slow elegant patterns in the airspace in front and below me. Several hundred herring and lesser black-backed gulls nest here – species that cannot be taken for granted anymore. Provoked by my intrusion many more take to the air yelping and chuntering – sounds more evocative of spilt chips than wild places these days. Purposeful groups of guillemots, razorbills and puffins speed across the view just above the sea – it is hard to identify them from up here, but I can just pick out the pale-faced puffins. As I stand up to leave the sound from the gulls rises to a crescendo of fear or indignation – either way I don’t linger.
Late that night after the moon has set I go out into the pitch black and listen to the shearwaters that have come ashore in their thousands. Pointing a torch upwards their ghostly, blinded forms criss-cross the beam uttering ghoulish cries. It is a wild, thrilling spectacle. Equally abundant and even more heartening are the number of moths, pale as x-rays, fluttering and darting above the grass. This is something like Michael McCarthy’s ‘moth snowstorm’, which was a common sight sixty years ago. I am awed by so much life.
After a while this ‘bum in the dirt’ sort of island softens and spreads you out like dough set to rise. Light and dark, high and low tide, wind speed and direction – those sorts of things start to become a rhythm in you. You don’t have to want to find out or even be interested, it just begins to happen. Seeing millions of stars in the night sky; breathing in the scent of sun-dried grass or watching the red sun become an anvil or a puddle just before it slips below the sea-line takes you there. Your animal body knows the way home -the trick is learning to get out of the way.
I am hushed and awed. This might just be the perfect bed time story for settling unruly thoughts.
A beautifully descriptive piece that instantly transports me to the island.History of Battery B:; One Hundred Third Field Artillary Twenty-Sixth Division

Over 100,000 extra people grieving in isolation amid Covid-19 pandemic, study suggests
Over 100,000 people are grieving in isolation as a result of the Covid019 pandemic, according to bereavement charity Cruse Bereavement Care (CBC).
The study reported for every person that dies, six people are suffering intense grief resulting in at least 108,000 people who are currently grieving as a result of the coronavirus.
The charity revealed, on average 50 people attend a funeral, and with funerals currently unable to go ahead as planned, resulting in roughly 900,000 people who have been unable to attend funerals, or hold a funeral in the way they would have wanted.
The charity attributes the coronavirus to the rise in people grieving in isolation saying current social distancing rules and restrictions around funerals means that many of those left behind are grieving in isolation, alone, unable to seek much needed comfort from friends and family, also, many will have been unable to say goodbye or attend the funeral.
Cruse Bereavement Care clinical director, Andy Langford, said: “Grieving is a normal part of life, and even during periods of global stability can be massively distressing. Unfortunately, the death toll we are currently experiencing, whilst hugely tragic in itself, means that hundreds of thousands of people are going to be left grieving in isolation.
“Some of the things that would be considered ‘normal’ in terms of coping with grief, such as attending a funeral and spending time with friends and family have not been possible. This will only serve to compound grief., Messe Düsseldorf intends to make a contribution to the fight against global food losses.

Congress has passed a second bill responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, including paid leave for coronavirus-related reasons for many Americans.
On Thursday, the Senate overwhelmingly voted to pass the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (H.R. 6201), a $2.5 billion stimulus package. The White House has previously said that President Trump would sign the legislation.
The House passed the stimulus package early on Saturday morning by an overwhelming vote of 363 to 40. Of those voting in favor, 140 Republicans joined 223 Democrats while 40 other Republicans voted against the bill.
Although the bill received broad bi-partisan support, Sens. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), James Inhofe (R-Okla.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), James Lankford (D-Okla.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), and Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.) all voted against the bill.Сара

The Tottenham manager spoke to Onda Cero's El Transistor programme about life in London and Guardiola's problematic remarks about SpursChelsea - Barcelona U - 19 live: UEFA Youth League final
Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino spent a short while chatting to Onda Cero radio programme El Transistor last night. The Argentine coach spoke about a number of topics including adapting to life in London, the rivalry between Barcelona and Espanyol, his feelings on Guardiola's broadside about Spurs and taking tips from Carles Puyol and Sergio Ramos.
LaLiga: "Despite having spent the past few years in England, I still actively follow what's going on in Spain and the Spanish league. Last night I went to bed worried about what has been happening in Galicia and Asturias with the forest fires. And unfortunately, I am also following everything that's going on in Catalunya. I am an open-minded person who finds it hard to put up frontiers and barriers - especially as both of my sons were born in Barcelona and are diehard Espanyol fans".
Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino getting some ball practice in at the Bernabéu yesterday JuanJo Martín (EFE)
Pochettino, true to his values because I would feel like a traitor to myself. You have to remain true to yourself and respect your own values".
Differences between Barça and Espanyol: "The values of both clubs are completely different - that's not to say that one's club's values are better than the other's - it's just that they are different".

I went to England without knowing a single word of English and now I can defend myself quite well in the language but for a year and a half I was unable to give interviews other than in Spanish".
War of words with Guardiola: "It was a lack of respect on his behalf and maybe I should have responded to it but I'll continue having the same admiration I've always had for him".
JuanJo Martín (EFE)
Spurs idol, Kane
Harry Kane: "Kane is worshipped at Tottenham and I hope that with Spurs he can have the kind of career Totti enjoyed with Roma. He's a very mature, level-headed person and domestically and personally he has the right structure in place for him to become a great player".
Sergio Ramos as a role model: "Sergio Ramos has quality and leadership. When I was coaching Espanyol I would tell the younger defenders like Víctor Ruiz and Jordi Amat to go to Camp Nou to watch how Puyol times a challenge. Now I tell our young centre-back to watch Sergio Ramos".
Future at Real Madrid? "I am completely focused on my project with Tottenham because at the end of the day, it's the results which will determine your sell-by date".

Is London Expensive to study?.Daniel and William Clarke share a passion to save the orangutan in Borneo and Sumatra. Their desire to help the orangutan happened after a series of events helped shape Daniels decision to take a stand (read more about it here).
Daniel has cerebral palsy and is mostly confined to a wheelchair however this doesn’t stop him from doing what he believes is right.
So far the boys have raised over $967,000 (Sept, 2021) to save the orangutan, sponsored 111,000 acres of orangutan habitat and and have been actively promoting the orangutan’s plight throughout the media.
Over time, Daniel and William have grown to understand the issues facing the orangutan regarding deforestation of their habitat due to illegal logging, establishment of palm oil plantations and the illegal pet trade.
When they started their quest in 2006 at just 8 and 10 years old the boys set out to raise just $10,000. This was achieved quickly with the help of family and friends. Soon after the Orangutan Project made Daniel their National Youth Ambassador and their enthusiasm grew from there.
Over the next 10 years they have journeyed to the jungles of Borneo twice, written two best-selling books, have had their literary work incorporated into the NSW Department of Education curriculum, been recognised by US Presidents, Prime Ministers, Royalty as well as Eco-Royalty such as Dame Jane Goodall and Sir David Attenborough. They have also been recently recognised by the Australia Day Council as the 2021 Queensland Young Australians of the Year.
Their first book Tears In The Jungle: A Children’s Adventure to Save the Orangutan was created as a result of their first journey into the jungles of Borneo in 2008 while their new book “Fight for Survival“ details their return to Borneo four years later to see where the funds they have raised have been invested and update everyone on the progress made for orangutan conservation.
While the boys have received significant media exposure in regards to their quest, some of their other achievements are;
Presented at many schools (80,000+ students) regarding their trips to Borneo and the plight of the orangutan.
Met with the Duchess of Cambridge on their tour of Sydney Opera House and presented the Duchess with a copy of their book.
Awarded the 2012 NSW Pride of Australia Medal (Environment Category), 2012 National Pride of Australia Medal (Environment Category) and the Pride of Australia Medal People’s Choice Award.
Recognised by US President Barack Obama for their conservation efforts in a personally signed letter.
They received a personally signed letter from the Honorable John Howard pledging $500,000 towards the conservation of orangutans in Indonesia as a result of meeting Daniel.
their conservation and fund raising efforts (Award presented by their regional director)
Recognised by the National Australia Day Council as the 2021 Queensland Young Australians of the Year.

How to choose a Catholic child education provider
Child education providers across Ireland are struggling to fill their vacancies, despite the fact that the majority of their students attend Catholic schools.A new report, which will be presented to the National Council of Catholic Education (NCCE), paints a bleak picture for parents, with over a quarter of Catholic primary schools reporting a shortfall of students between the ages of […]Categories: GallerySpencer Ackerman fears that violence in Iraq is again on the upswing. And, though he doesn't say this, if violence jumps again, we will almost certainly leave. By letting the surge redefine success as a reduction in violence rather than sticking to its original aim, political reconciliation, we created a situation in which our efforts in Iraq were totally dependent on a side variable, and thus we focused on that side variable. If that side variable explodes, we're out -- there's nothing, at this point, with our military as overstretched as it is, that we can even do. The problem is, we have no end game, no final push that uses the relative quiet of the current moment to set in place some path that pushes the country towards reconciliation. When the surge didn't originally create reconciliation, the Bush administration, and the Republican Party, decided to embrace the short-term imperative of security gains as a political lifeline. But now, as the insurgents adapt to our tactics and as other Iraqi actors who were waiting us out grow restless, we've really got no strategy pushing towards any more enduring stability, and because domestic Republican actors have made the institution of a timetable into some sort of partisan argument, we can't even use the ordered and predictable pressure of withdrawal to make a final, massive, push.On-Site Survey

I was lucky enough to be in the beta pilot for Stripe Payment Links.
What are they - you might be wondering?
Glad you asked because I tested them thoroughly!
They allow people to purchase a product/service from you, via a unique URL generated and branded by Stripe!
Much more fun and easier than integrating the whole checkout, if you ask me as you can plug those in any service that allows anchor links.
My use case
Have you ever been in that situation where someone wants to pay you for some consulting time (dev/design/marketing or anything else) - but you don’t want to deal with the awkwardness of sending them an invoice etc?
Also, maybe you have the issue where people kinda like to take advantage of your availability and end up wasting a lot of your time that you could spend doing other things you love. 😅😅
I feel you!
As a solution to this personal problem, I decided to create a consulting page on my blog: when someone asks to meet for some consulting-related work, I link them to this page. Here I created two Stripe Payment links for them to choose from (they can pick whichever works for them).
They’re just Anchor links that point to a Stripe subdomain.
They can pay for a session of short or long duration, get an invoice (super important) and if they change their mind ask for a refund!
It’s really cool because Stripe handles for me routing to the right product, charging/refunding and invoicing!
All I had to do was create two products in Stripe and then generate a Payment link that I linked directly on my blog’s page - copy pasted into it as a simple HTML Anchor tag.
Here’s how you can create your first Stripe Payment link
If you don’t already have a Stripe Product to sell it’s very straightforward to set one up - takes under a minute. It could be a physical product or a service or something else!
To do this go to Stripe Products in the Dashboard - create a product, give it a price and fill in any other info as you may see fit.
Then create a Payment Link for that product by creating one - from the Product menu, as shown in the picture.
You can also customize the look and feel of your Payment page!
The way I use the payment link is to replace a “Buy Me a Coffee” and Patreon kind of services - not that I have anything bad to say about them, I just prefer the neat look of the Stripe checkout experience.
For example here I automated getting Stripe Payments into a Google Spreadsheet….because why not, if I can append to a spreadsheet I can then do anything!
I could automate things further to automatically send an email (using SendGrid or my Google account) to everyone who has been purchasing a certain product (I do that by filtering on the price paid!)
Faster and safer selling
If you’re also excited by this Stripe feature join the hype train!
I hope this makes more people want to create awesome things on the internet (and get paid for them)…. and starting today ANYONE can do it!

The introduction of the Companies Act, 2013, paved the way for the emergence of new ideas into the business/corporate legal system of India.
These new ideas were afresh and provided unique ways for conducting operations of a company. The Companies Act, 1956 had got outdated because of the changing dynamics in the corporate world and the need for a modern law that embraces and fulfills the requirements of the current world obligations. Previously, if an individual wants to start and register a private company, he needs at least one more partner other than him because the Companies Act of 1956 mandated for at least two shareholders. An expert committee which was headed by Dr. JJ IRANI in the year 2005 was the first to recommend the concept of Online ONE PERSON COMPANY registration or OPC company registration.
The term “One Person Company” was applauded on a big scale because it brings forth a wide span of opportunities for individuals looking forward to start their own ventures with the structure of an organized business.
The former Companies Act, 1956 provided for the obligation of at least 7 members for the establishment of a Public Limited Company, what’s more, regarding investors, it requires 2 of the investors to be available to approve the organization, and subsequently, as a result of this very arrangement, there was no development of One Person Company in the nation of India.
Companies Act, 2013 laid down the provision of ONE PERSON COMPANY under Section 2(62), which defines the term ONE PERSON COMPANY as a “Company which has only 1 person as a member” and brought it into effect on 29th August 2013. Another significant highlight to be thought about is that Section 3 of the Companies Act groups One Person Company as a private Limited organization for every one of the lawful purposes yet with only one individual in the organization. Also, each of the arrangements identified with a private limited company is applicable to an OPC, except if they are explicitly avoided by a free condition.
SOLE PROPRIETORSHIP AND OPCS ARE USUALLY CONFUSED WITH EACH OTHER, BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM:–
A sole ownership kind of business could seem to be primarily the same as one-individual organizations since the two of them embrace a solitary individual possessing the business; however, there exist a few contrasts between them.
The principle distinction between the two is the idea of the liabilities they convey. Since OPC is a different legitimate substance recognized from its member, it has its own resources and liabilities. The member is not accountable for reimbursing the obligations of the organization.
Then again, sole ownerships and their owners are similar people. Thus, the law permits connection and provides for the proprietor resources if there should be an incident of non-satisfaction of the business’ liabilities.
IMPORTANT FEATURES OF ONE PERSON COMPANY:-
- ONE DIRECTOR:- Each “One Person Company” should have only one Director and not more than that under any clause.
- ONE SHAREHOLDER:- Each One Person Company is needed to have just a single shareholder.
- NOMINEE FOR SHAREHOLDER:- Each One Person Company requires having one individual who might additionally select an investor, and this designation would happen as per the notice. The individual whose name has been expressed in the reminder would, in general, be an individual from the organization in case of one or the other demise or inadequacy of the individual from the One Person Company.
- ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING:- One Person Company does not require itself to conduct the annual general meeting.
- CHARACTERISTIC OF A PRIVATE COMPANY:- Unless excluded by the individual of OPC, the One Person Company has all the characteristics of a private corporation.

ADVANTAGES OF ONE PERSON COMPANY:–
- PRIVATE COMPANY:- Section 3(1)(c) of the Companies Act says that a single person can create a company. It further detailed OPC as a private company.
- LEGAL IDENTITY:- One Person Company is known to have a different legitimate character from its investors, which implies the organization and the investors go about as two distinct personalities in every conceivable case.
- LIMITED LIABILITY:- One Person Company will, in general, restrict the risk of entrepreneurs as the organization has its own personality. Limited Liability is viewed as the most valued benefit controlled by the One Person Company. President Eliot of Harvard once thought to be the restricted responsibility of One Person Company as the most valuable attribute of the organization, and it was thusly respected that the individuals go back and forth yet the organization keeps on excess as a different lawful substance.
- INDEPENDENT COMPANY EXISTENCE:- The additional benefit which the One Person Company has free character from that of its chief investors and chief. This very guideline appeared from the milestone instance of Salomon v. Salomon and Co. Ltd. For this situation, it was held that the Company shapes a particular lawful character from that of its individuals. Consequently, an organization ought to be treated as an individual in law.
- COMPLIANCE:- In contrast to privately owned businesses, One Person Companies have not been dependent upon different procedural conventions like Annual General Meeting, General Meeting or Extraordinary General Meeting, and so on. The exception from these conventions makes the activity of One Person Company helpful and inconvenience-free.
- ANNUAL RETURN FILING:- One Person Company’s yearly return is required to be signed by a director of the Company. The mandatory requirement of CS Signature does not applicable to OPC.
DISADVANTAGES OF ONE PERSON COMPANY:–
- INVESTMENT:- As the domain of the One Person Company is new and similarly, untested financial backers may careful to put resources into the organization, and this goes about as a significant impediment.
- TAXATION:- One Person Company is burdened both on pay just as the conveyance of benefits, and this is viewed as a significant inconvenience that doesn’t act for the One Person Company. The One Person Company is henceforth said not to appreciate any tax reductions at the same time, despite what is generally expected, the duty goes about as a weight with respect to the organization.
- MAINTENANCE COST:- Consistence cost of association firm or exclusive is low contrasted with One Person Company.
- ONE PERSON MANAGEMENT:- An investor is one, and that individual settles on every one of the choices. The organization’s prosperity and development are altogether subject to one individual’s dynamic capacity.
- COMPULSORY APPOINTMENT OF NOMINEE:- The actual reason for One Person Company’s idea was to empower the single individual to go into undertaking alone without burning through his time and energy searching for an accomplice. This whole reason has been crushed because of the legitimate order, which requires the investor to name a candidate, who will, in case of the endorser’s passing or his inadequacy to contract, turns into the individual from the organization at the hour of joining of the One Person Company. This makes procedural difficulty for the endorser, like searching for a candidate, getting his assent, and so forth.
- NBFC ACTIVITIES:- An OPC cannot take up the activities of non-banking finance companies.

According to the Sunday Mirror, Labour MP Stella Creasy, who is under the impression that the short term loan industry has a dire and “urgent need of reform”, is looking into ways to break the chain between those who finance the payday lenders and the organisations themselves.
The crux of the brief Mirror article is the ‘sky-high’ APR rates applicable to short term loans; it fails to mention that a 4,000%+ APR rate stretched over a short term loan spell can very often be actually less than slipping into an unauthorised overdraft or the accrued amount of interest one incurs by skipping a monthly payment on the worn out credit card.
Wonga are coming in for criticism and the paper dropped their name into the article (twice), labelling them as ‘controversial’, but seemingly just as padding as there was no other substance or detail into exactly how the fresh-faced Ms Creasy is going to lobby the investment firms who prop up what is becoming an essential service for such a huge portion of the UK population.
Recent press coverage may start to serve as a warning to the company, though. If the media are going to start using their name to highlight anything awry within the short term loan industry, the long-term effects may be damaging for their already-tarnished image. Although one would have to question whether they have actually done anything wrong. Immoral, perhaps; unlawful, maybe not.
The last thing the instant cash loan specialist want is to begin to become synonymous with the few irresponsible borrowers who flout the contracts they take out with payday lenders and then run crying to the media when their debts start to spiral out of control. Payday loans work well if they’re utilised properly, even helping to repair a poor credit history, providing that all of the criteria set out in the short term loan agreement are met.

Michael Dourson is a toxicologist known for mingling science and religious ideas. Two religious leaders were quoted in an Environmental Protection Agency press release announcing his nomination.
Michael Dourson.
“First, it is assumed that the natural law (Nature) and the written law (the Bible) have the same dignity and teach the same things in a way that one of them has nothing more and nothing less than the other because they have the same author—God (St. Augustine, 354-430),” he wrote in Linen Cloths.
It also seems that he may read the Bible literally.
“Second, it is assumed that the inspired word of the Bible, in its various translations, reflects what actually happened, but using words that were most appropriate at the time of writing,” he wrote.
See this #AmazonGiveaway for: The Linen Cloths: ...Jesus left behin.... NoPurchNec:
Dourson told BuzzFeed News that he writes these books outside of his day job as a toxicologist at the University of Cincinnati and at the nonprofit consulting company Toxicology Excellence for Risk Assessment, a group he founded in 1995 that assesses whether chemicals are safe.
“I do that in my spare time,” Dourson said, before referring additional questions to either the EPA's or the University of Cincinnati's press team.
The EPA noted Dourson's experience working at the agency. He was a scientist there for more than a decade.
“The EPA is calling for the swift confirmation of Mr. Dourson, so the EPA can carry out the Administrator’s agenda to serve the American people,” EPA spokesperson Amy Graham said in a statement emailed to BuzzFeed News. “Dourson has a proven resume to lead the EPA’s chemical and pesticides office having served multiple positions at EPA, American Board of Toxicology, Society of Toxicology, Society for Risk Analysis, and Toxicology Education Foundation.” (The University of Cincinnati's press team deflected questions to the EPA.)
TERA has close ties to the chemical manufacturing and tobacco industries, according to a 2014 investigation by the Center for Public Integrity and InsideClimate News. Responding to criticism about conflicts of interest between TERA and its funders in an interview with reporters, Dourson defended himself with a biblical reference.
“Jesus hung out with prostitutes and tax collectors. He had dinner with them,” he said. “We're an independent group that does the best science for all these things. Why should we exclude anyone that needs help?"
Environmentalists remain concerned about Dourson’s close ties to an industry he would help regulate at the EPA.
“We are deeply concerned over the nomination of Michael Dourson to head the toxics office at EPA,” Richard Denison, lead senior scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, wrote in a recent blog post. “Dr. Dourson has extensive, longstanding ties to the chemical industry (as well as earlier ties to the tobacco industry). He also has a history of failing to appropriately address his conflicts of interest.”
According to one example from the EDF blog post, West Virginia hired TERA to organize a health effects expert panel following a massive chemical spill in 2014. Dourson chaired the panel and served as its sole spokesperson. The panel’s resulting report did not disclose that Dourson and TERA had done consulting work for the companies that produced the spilled chemicals.
Trump nominated Dourson to lead the EPA’s Office of Chemical Safety And Pollution Prevention. This is one of the top jobs at the agency, overseeing a group that handles pesticides, pollution prevention, and chemical accidents, and decides which chemicals are safe.
The EPA announced the nomination in a press release that included a roundup of praise from people familiar with Dourson. Along with endorsements from five toxicologists, two religious leaders were also quoted.
“My primary context for knowing Michael is at a Christian retreat center where I lecture each summer,” Rev. John Arthur Nunes, president of Concordia College in New York, said in a statement. “For years, Michael’s judicious integration of faith and the sciences has struck me as impressive as it is rare. Far too often the proposal of a relationship between science and religion is viewed with incompatibility at best or with inimicality at worst. Not with Dr. Dourson.”
An executive director of a religious camp cited Dourson’s work on environmental study apparently related to the camp.
“Mike chaired a beach erosion peer review study about 12 years ago. His professionalism and his ability to work with others well allowed him to deal with a very contentious issue at our camp successfully,” said Chip May, executive director of Camp Arcadia in northwest Michigan. “Mike listens well, learns from others, and is able to work with people with different views. I highly recommend Mike for this position.”
Independent toxicologists are more upset about Dourson’s scientific views than his religious ones.
“I don’t have any problem with people bringing moral values, even religious values into risk assessment,” said Adam Finkel, a clinical professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Michigan and former director of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s health standards program.
Finkel and Dourson worked together years ago on a group that critiqued a set of National Academy of Sciences’ recommendations for calculating chemical risk. (Finkel left the group before it published anything because of disagreements.) The two do not agree on the best methods, Finkel said, with Dourson tending to think that the EPA overestimates risk. This is worrisome, Finkel said, particularly for people most vulnerable to exposure, such as factory workers, children, and the elderly.
From Finkel’s perspective, the most relevant biblical quote to toxicology work is Matthew 25:40: “If you have done good things to the least of my brethren, you’ve done it for me.”

Recent changes in Washington state's drug laws mean that marijuana users enjoy new privileges. If you plan to visit Washington in the near future, this is a good opportunity to brush up on what's different so you can avoid any unfortunate incidents during your trip. Here are the basic marijuana transportation and consumption laws for Washington State:
The Basics
Yes, marijuana usage is now legal in the state of Washington. With other substances like alcoholic and behaviors such as gambling, there are rules in place to regulate the industry. The obvious one is that everyone in Washington cannot legally imbibe pot. As is the case with alcohol and gambling, only adults can legally partake in marijuana usage.
While state laws apply to Washington's legality, the United States Department of Justice interceded in clarifying that Washington must also enforce the laws for the country in this manner. People under the age of 21 cannot lawfully enter a marijuana facility. So, no minor can visit a pot restaurant, much less work in one.
Possession
You now have the legal right to carry marijuana. The law makes no distinctions between visitors and residents. This is slightly different from Colorado, whose law states that visitors can buy only a fraction of the amount entitled to citizens.
How much can you carry? If you're not a member of the voluntary database of medicinal pot users, there is a smaller limit to how much you have the right to hold. It's lawful to possess up to an ounce of dry marijuana, 72 ounces of liquid, seven grams of concentrate, or 16 ounces of marijuana-infused solids. If you sign up for the voluntary database as an infirm person, the amount you can possess triples. So, if you are in need of some medical relief, it's in your best interest to join the database.
For those who aren't clear on how much an ounce is, don't worry. It's a lot. Even the largest rolled joints are nowhere near that size. In fact, a fair estimate is that an ounce of pot equals more than 50 marijuana cigarettes.
Consumption
Once you own marijuana, consuming it is less straightforward. While the new laws are indulgent toward home usage, you still can't use pot in public sight. If a police officer cites you for public consumption, you'll have to pay a modest $27 fine.
Fortunately, that's not a lot of money and politicians have instructed law enforcement officials to hand out warnings rather than citations as much as possible. In other words, it's like underage drinking on a college campus. It's illegal by all definitions of the law, but cops aren't out to get you unless you're shameless about it. Along those lines, if you're carrying more than the legal limit of marijuana, police officers have the right to seize marijuana and related paraphernalia. Don't antagonize cops. It's just common sense.
Transportation
Colorado is a state whose surrounding territories frown upon pot. As such, politicians wrote their laws to discourage interstate transportation. Washington has no such concerns, so you might expect that their legislation is much more liberal. It's not. Marijuana purchased in Washington is ineligible for transport. There is no looking the other way on this one, either. Any pot taken across state lines represents a violation of the laws of both Washington and the new state, so you can face prosecution twice for the same crime.
Comparing Vices
Smoking and vaporizing laws in Washington represent a good point of comparison for the recently introduced marijuana initiatives. Note that neither of them are legal in many public places as well. Since 2005, a ban on smoking exists in any building where people are likely to gather. This applies to places of work, as well as public events. The city of Seattle recently went so far as to ban smoking in all parks.
The state's vaping laws are about to become even more draconian. A recent proposal by state representative Gerry Pollet called for a 95 percent tax on vaping products. Until Washington state politicians ratify that bill, the laws on vaping are currently a grey area. People under the age of 18 can't purchase or participate in vaping, but the existing anti-smoking legislation doesn't apply. In lieu of a state ruling, King County proactively banned vaping in public places.
Washington's hallmark legislation enabling marijuana possession within the state borders has ramifications across the country. If you live in Washington or plan on visiting, the information above should aid you in enjoying legal pot for the first time in American history.

Dammed If You Don’t
Chris Kalman (USA, 2021)
Kalman’s third book asks a very topical question: Can we love a place to death? Kalman answers this question with a spare quality that evokes a bit of James Salter. His portrayal of a lush, pristine Chilean valley is immediate and profound. His writing is peppered with the intimate details that also bring the characters, their foibles, and struggles to life. Their dilemmas soon become our dilemmas. Perhaps the best thing about Dammed If You Don’t are the plot twists, building to a final scenario that is plausible, disturbing, and strangely uplifting.

Structured Chaos
Victor Saunders, Vertebrate Publishing (UK, 2021)
In his unique, conversational style, Victor Saunders has taken us on a wonderful journey; sometimes heartbreaking, often hilarious. His observations are surgically precise, his evocative descriptions are skillfully penned and his personal reflections are unstintingly honest.

Finding the Mother Tree
Suzanne Simard, Allen Lane Canada, an imprint of Penguin Random House Canada (Canada, 2021)
Suzanne Simard has proven, without doubt, the power of storytelling in the communication of science. A forest ecologist who is renowned for her breakthrough research into the underground communication of trees, she has brought this mind-boggling world she calls the ‘wood-wild web’ into our minds, and perhaps more importantly, into our hearts. From her childhood, growing up in a logging family in rural British Columbia, to her life as a celebrated scientist battling cancer, she has woven together stories of relationships – both human and ecological – so skilfully that her book reads like one seamless, interconnected tale. In doing so, she bridges the gap between science and emotion in a way that feels more like a call to action: save the forests so that they can, in turn, save us.

Irish Peaks
Mountaineering Ireland (Ireland, 2020)
A wonderful showcase of the rugged beauty of the island of Ireland’s upland landscapes, Irish Peaks made me want to head for these hills. This book combines detailed route guides to the highest 101 mountains with incredible photography and comprehensive guides to their natural and hill-walking history. Ireland is a country where access to the mountains is not a given. Irish Peaks shares the invaluable route knowledge of local experts with the visitor; clearly mapping and explaining established lines into and over the ground. This is an inspirational guidebook that will surely entice many hill-goers to further explore these mountains.

Letters to a Young Climber
Doug Robinson, Alpinist Magazine (USA, June 2021)
A thoughtful meditation on the power of mentorship. A legendary climber and guide for most of his years, Robinson draws on personal history to show us what mentorship is. He reminds us that the ever-evolving process extends beyond a climber’s personal ambitions — into something more meaningful. Through sharing and teaching, climbing becomes a potent vehicle for growth, one that adapts as our world changes.
– Pete Takeda, 2021 Book Competition Jury
Climbing Literature
$2000 - Sponsored by Mountain Life
A Feeling for Rock
Sarah-Jane Dobner, Dob Dob Dob (UK, 2021)
A Feeling For Rock is a unique take on climbing. The sensuality of movement on the rock, the feelings for place, of sea cliffs, gritstone and mountain crags. Sarah-Jane Dobner explores in fresh ways and is not afraid to question perceived norms. Provocative pieces, climber interviews and cartoons sit alongside poetry, prose and photography that show and describe the beauty she sees and feels in the rock landscapes around her. Sarah-Jane makes this eclectic mix work, binding it together with her love for the climbing life.

Finally, and in addition to the Category Awards:
Special Jury Mention
More than It Hurts: And Other Stories of (Mis)Adventure by Womxn Who Climb and Mountaineer
Wendy Bruere, Climb and Wine (Australia, 2020)
More Than It Hurts is in a class of its own — a compilation of fourteen climbing stories by women who climb and mountaineer. In these pages, one discovers a deeper acknowledgement of fear and joy; discussions about identity and dysphoria; climbing’s power to nurture the love for nature and for others; and how the vertical world can foster the peculiar courage required for personal growth. This is an important book, selected and edited to, “celebrate a broader and more diverse range of adventures on rock and in the mountains.” Each story is a refreshing reimagining of the climbing narrative.

Fourth seeded Angelique Kerber faces a potentially dangerous opening round opponent on Monday at the Brisbane International when she comes up against Italian Camila Giorgi.
Angelique Kerber is another player who has a real opportunity to climb up the rankings during the Australian summer. The German has very few points to defend over the next couple of weeks, Angie was ousted in the second round in Brisbane last year by Elina Svitolina and suffered a shock first round exit at the Australian Open with a loss to Irina-Camelia Begu. A return to the top 5 is within reach, Angie will be very determined to play much better tennis in Australian this year.
There is no doubt that Camila Giorgi’s best is very good, however she has very rarely been able to sustain consistently good tennis throughout tournaments or even matches. 2016 is a big year for the Italian, Giorgi is now an experienced player and given the obvious talent that she possesses she should be pushing towards the top 20 in the rankings.
The only previous meeting between the pair took place in Wuhan last year, Angie won that match quite comfortably 6-2 6-4. Giorgi has the ability to trouble anyone on her day, she seemingly has the weapons to trouble Kerber especially with her return of serve. However Angie is infinitely more consistent and will probably be too solid for the Italian.China’s effort to cut the burden of insolvent companies weighing on its slowing economy has kicked into higher gear, with a slew of bankruptcy filings that’s set to enrich the case history of debt resolutions for bond investors.
Local courts have accepted or plan to accept at least five bankruptcy applications from firms that defaulted on publicly issued bonds since early November. That’s roughly on par with the number seen over the previous four years. The new pace may continue: China’s top planning body called on Dec. 4 for local officials to clean up the debt of firms with excess production capacity or insolvent balance sheets by 2020.
The bad news is that some bondholders may find they’re going to get less back from defaulted issuers than they anticipated. The good news: there’s likely to be swifter resolution once court procedures take over from ad-hoc work-out negotiations. And the process will give both creditors and debtors the chance to gain experience in restructuring obligations, little more than four years after China began embracing the concept of defaults in the world’s third-largest bond market.
“Bondholders could face considerable losses after bankruptcy proceedings, but what is more important is that they can learn how to fight for their rights via the legal system, and how to choose among debt proposals,” said Ivan Chung, an associate managing director at Moody’s Investors Service in Hong Kong.
As with many things in China, government direction is probably behind the latest development, market players say. China is steadily encouraging a financial system where the pricing of credit bears more relation to the risk of the borrower. Local and central authorities have for decades moved to support – or press creditors to support – troubled companies that could fuel unemployment and social unrest if they collapsed.
“Usually, local governments would only allow firms or creditors to file for bankruptcy proceedings if they couldn’t come to any agreement with financial institutions and other creditors after long negotiations,” said Chen Sheng, a Shanghai-based senior partner at Rolmax, a Chinese law firm.
China’s bankruptcy law has been in place for more than a decade, though corporate bond defaults in the modern era only began in 2014.
The National Development and Reform Commission, in its statement earlier this month, encouraged local governments and courts to coordinate and support the acceptance of applications for bankruptcy. At stake is helping to shut down less productive parts of China’s industries, improving productivity and pricing power.

I love the smell, it's easy to use and only have to apply once after my shower, then I'm good for up to 3 days! Which means it lasts for ages. No smell! And no itching! And the tin can be recycled (I think). The one thing is I'm wondering how it's going to go in the hot summer, just haven't got there yet to try that out. Fortunately it washes out of clothes easily as it does rub off on dark clothes a bit. Best deodorant I've found in years and will be getting more.
While I use the EN lemongrass and coconut deodorant during the day, this mandarin baking sofa free deo is perfect post shave. I find that it works really well overnight and love the fact that I wake up smelling fresh. Beautiful fragrance and super easy to apply!
Mandarin is my favourite scent! Highly recommend!!!!
beautiful scent and texture. effective and great for sensitive skin
Perfection, best deodorant on the market!Question: How Much Money Does A Football Player Make?

I had the privilege of being part of the Buffalo Roundup in 2014. Standing in the bed of a pickup truck, I rode alongside the cowboys and cowgirls as they cracked their whips. The ground shook as the thundering herd of 1,300 bison kicked up dust. I felt like I was in the midst of a western movie.

Such great stories and memories everyone ................. really enjoyed reading them and couldn`t help but smile at some of them ......... thanks for sharing
Whilst I have been to quite a few concerts of some amazing oversea`s artist, I never had the privilege of bumping into any. The only 'tiny' claim to fame meeting was with a New Zealand singer/song writer Shona Laing. We went to a winery in Gisborne and she was performing there. Before she came on stage, i thought i would go find the bathroom and whilst i was outside the winery looking for the bathroom, i saw this cute black fluffy little dog, it had really curly hair and so i was calling it and trying to pat it. This older woman who was outside having a cigarette and who obviously owned the dog was looking at me and said it was her dog, so we talked briefly about dogs as I have a dog too. Anyway, with that off i go to get my seat so i can watch the show and on comes Shona Laing and guess who i had been talking to
It was Shona but i hadnt recognised her as she had matured a bit by then and the funny thing was that gorgeous little black dog actually was down on the ground by the stage and from time it literally danced/pranced on all fours to the music Shona was singing making the crowd laugh.
Here is link to Shona through her years incase you dont know who she is.

For those firmly in the 'anti-ageing' camp, we broke down every single possible way to minimise the appearance of fine lines, no matter your price point, your pain tolerance, or your patience. Check out your options, below.
LEVEL 1: TOPICALS
Unless your trusty eye cream is packed with one of the following ingredients, toss it out and find a moisturiser (which, fun fact, is essentially the exact same thing as an eye cream, but in a bigger jar) specifically formulated with either:
Vitamin C
Dermatologists love vitamin C, and for good reason: The little antioxidant “softens rough patches, shields your skin from damage, and fades acne scars and dark marks,” says Dr. Gohara. It even helps prevent fine lines while smoothing the ones you’ve got by stimulating your collagen production.
The cons: It’ll take a few months to see any impact on your lines, and even then, don’t expect miracles. “The anti-ageing, that's not fun, but you need to tough it out for the anti-ageing 2: BOTOX
“Botox temporarily paralyses three-four months of line-smoothing action before the Botox wears off.
LEVEL 3: MICRONEEDLING
Microneedling (AKA four-to-six." So save the face-puncturing for the professionals.
LEVEL 4: LASERS
And now for the laser portion of our wrinkle treatments: Fraxel. Fraxel (which is a brand name for a whole class of lasers used to resurface your skin) is magical, face-changing, and pretty painful (basically like a hot rubber band snapping your face over and over again).
“Resurfacing lasers use heat energy to create trauma within your skin that leads to new collagen,” says Dr. Gohara. In case you haven’t noticed, most anti-ageing treatments just damage your skin to make it “better.”—or, basically, as bright and smooth as you 20 years ago, before life hit you in the face.

The Anne Arundel County Department of Health has free "Parents Who Host, Lose The Most" campaign materials for all Anne Arundel County organizations, businesses, schools and residents to help reduce the occurrence of underage alcohol drinking. The campaign's goal is to decrease the number of underage youths whose source of alcohol was provided or funded by a parent or other adult. Materials include table tents, banners, stickers, fact cards and DVDs. The campaign is funded through a grant from the Maryland Highway Safety Office.
The materials will be distributed around the county in conjunction with educational presentations by the Department of Health's Strategic Prevention Framework coalitions. The coalitions help to mobilize the community to decrease underage drinking and substance abuse.

The Takeover Appeal Board (TAB) have ruled the South Africa-based businessman was working "in concert" with three other shareholders when he launched the takeover which forced the former ruling regime out of Ibrox.
King was able to secure power back in March 2015 when he and a group known as the Three Bears - wealthy fans Douglas Park, George Letham and George Taylor - secured a stakeholding which combined equated to 34 per cent of the club's total shares.
But now TAB have ruled they were acting as a "concert party" when they made their purchase, rather than as individuals.
And it says under takeover rules, King - as leader of that group - is obliged to make an offer to buy the rest of the shares in the club's holding company Rangers International Football Club (RIFC), with the price set at 20p a share.
King has criticised both the ruling and the share price valuation.
In a statement on the Rangers website, he said: . My view on one individual not being able to exert undue influence on Rangers is already well known.
"The complaint to the Takeover Panel was made by RIFC's former chairman David Somers as part of the old board's efforts to preserve their positions without regard to what was best for Rangers Football Club, its supporters and shareholders. Today do not believe that there is any substantial group of RIFC shareholders that would be willing to sell its shares in RIFC at the price at which the TAB has determined I should make an offer. Twenty pence is not a price that I personally believe represents a fair price for RIFC's shares, nor is it the price at which shares in RIFC are currently trading.
"I would anticipate that, if I was to proceed with an offer on the terms TAB require, it would be rejected by the overwhelming majority of RIFC's shareholders and therefore not receive the level of acceptances necessary to proceed. I cannot see how making an offer that is doomed to fail can benefit RIFC's shareholders."crown gift cards contact

For 15 years in the profession I filmed in 83 countries. Worked on feature and documentary films, commercials, reality shows and travel shows.I have officially been back on the east coast for three weeks, and, unsurprisingly, it is the weather that is hardest to adjust to. Although I only lived in Los Angeles for a few years, it was more than enough time to grow accustomed to mild winters, sandals all year round, and a tan that didn’t fade. Now that I am back on the east coast, 50 degrees feels far colder, and as a result of living in California, I haven’t purchased real warm weather clothes in quite some time!
Although it was sunny, I truly felt freezing while taking these photos, and I half blame my sister who told me it was warm enough to wear a jean jacket! Though I love this denim jacket from Lucky, I think the time has finally come to put my summer clothes away and transition into fall.

I’m still just so frustrated about the no show at Chelsea on Saturday as, it would seem, are an awful lot of Brentford fans given the response to yesterday’s column on Dean’s team selection and set up at Stamford Bridge. Yet straight off that we’ve Tuesday night’s televised home game with Aston Villa. If that wasn’t a tough enough challenge already, we’re waking up to the news that West Ham have finally sold Dimitri Payet to Marseille.
The news is official. Does this mean Scott is next?
I really feel for Dean Smith on this one. Having a full programme of fixtures at the same time as the transfer window slams shut (TM) is just ludicrous. How on earth does a manger / head coach (whatever) prepare for a game at the same time as those final thrusts of frenetic bargaining are due to reach their denouement?
Will West Ham finally budge over Scott Hogan? Will Brentford have to compromise on the valuation that we have long held out for? If no sale has gone through today will he even be in contention to line up against Aston Villa? Just how on earth can these last minute negotiations which have become so much an unwelcome part of our game take place when the exact same subjects of such haggling are supposed to be plying the very trade for which they are now sought?
Presumably if not sold then he’s a Brentford player for the rest of the season and goes straight back into the team – the club then able to conduct the inevitable sale at their leisure over the summer.
Scott will go. I won’t be crying if it doesn’t happen this time around. And if only for the two figures it will stick up to those agents who have been doing their best to disrupt his, and our, preparations over the last few weeks.
None of this glosses over the Chelsea selection. Try the same against Aston Villa and we’re doomed. Dean HAS got the players that can win big games. He’s done it himself, too. Just look at Brighton away, the home humping of Reading or even the psychological triumph of the trip to Loftus Road. Yet for all of those is a Wigan (H&A), Rotherham, Fulham or Barnsley (all home).
The QPR game just one of those when Dean’s Bees rose to the occasion
This is not me being ungrateful. I’ve said many times that the simple fact Brentford are approaching a fourth season in the Championship is cause for huge celebration in itself. But it is perplexing how the team have played so inconsistently this season. It is confusing as to why the formation change seems, at times, more and more about crowbarring in the centre backs and favoured midfielders than playing to our strengths.
I’ve not seen a team put in such a no-show as they did on Saturday in a long, long time. And let’s just discount who we were playing or where. If the FA Cup has shown us one thing this weekend, it is that a well organised and positive outfit can perform heroics against supposedly superior opposition. Sutton United, Lincoln City, Wolves and a desperately unfortunate Wycombe Wanderers are all proof of that.
Dean , if you are reading (you aren’t) Saturday was desperately disappointing. Moreso the subsequent press conference where there didn’t seem to be any perception of just how badly he’d got it wrong, this time around. Most of us expected to lose but at least to go down fighting or to even just give it a go from the off. I’d rather have lost 7(seven) – 0 and tried for 90 minutes than lose by four yet only turn up for the start of the second half. I take no pleasure from writing what I did yesterday. But sometimes things need to be said.
We’ve already been through the cold fish approach of Marinus – a man whose touchline routine appeared to be modelled on a game of musical statues. Let’s not go there again . We aren’t worldbeaters but at least it would be good to see Dean cares – something I have no doubt on. At least it would be good to see Dean get vaguely animated or just to follow up on his pre-match words.
Aston Villa aren’t going to be easy by any strength of the imagination. Specialists in the 1-1 draw (6-1 with 888sport, for the record), setting up as we did against Chelsea is a recipe for a 0-X scoreline. Reinstalling some width and remembering that the trick to scoring goals is to go forward then things could well be different – regardless of whether Scott Hogan is leading the line or trying on a West Ham shirt.
Chelsea is over. To coin that most awful of phrases, ‘We go again’. Let’s just hope it is in a different direction.
On Tuesday night, we find out.
An early season trip to Villa Park saw another solid performance from the Bees

The Gypsy King has previously hinted at a switch of codes after he finishes his boxing career.
He has already dipped his toes into the world of WWE, making his wrestling debut against Braun Strowman last month.
Fury is next due to return to boxing to take on WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder in a rematch in February but insists he then plans to “takeover” combat sports.
The 31-year-old has already teased a potential transition into mixed martial arts by training with British UFC fighter Darren Till.
And he has now confirmed that he is due a trip to Dublin to train with UFC royalty McGregor.
"I think Conor is an absolutely fantastic fighting man," Fury told RTE Radio 1. "He has offered to train me if I ever want to go into MMA.
“What better trainer could I have than the Notorious Conor McGregor?”
Fury added: .”
Fury has already called out UFC heavyweight champion Stipe Miocic and contender Francis Ngannou in recent times.
But UFC president Dana White was left less than impressed, insisting the boxer would get “smashed” if he traded boxing for the octagon.
Fury is expected to fight Wilder for the WBC belt on February 22 - but first the American has to come through his rematch with Luis Ortiz on November 23.
The Gypsy King has said if Wilder loses to Ortiz, he will target the winner of Anthony Joshua's rematch with Andy Ruiz Jr for the WBA Super, IBF and WBO belts on December 7.
Then, who knows, but in the wild world of Fury, all that can be left to say is watch this space!May 4th 2015 5:30 am sunrise
Goals:
- Carry journal & supplies with me and work from life.
- Create small thumbnail sized art using watersoluble ink for line and watercolor for wash.
- Pay attention to design as the art is placed across the spread… balance.
- Journal one gratitude each day and see if a story would emerge as the month went on.
- What type of person would create this journal? Someone busy. A young mother balancing family demands and her desire to be herself. No real story needed, just a daily entry conceived as part of a year long project.
Results:
- Hated the paper (Richeson’s Finest Studio Watercolor – CP – 135 lb.). It was fine for the art work but was irritated with every word I wrote. Tough on pens… too rough.
- This was the second year in a row using the same small-sized journal but there was too much writing this time. I found I really missed the white… too little negative space on the page.
- Project fit easily into my day… the art thumbnails took only a few minutes; thinking & writing actually took a little longer, especially at the start, as I worked to get a grasp on my character.
- Loved the spontaneity and unpredictability of working with watersoluble ink. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn’t, but it was always fun.
- Loved designing the spread for balance and eye-appeal. Thinking of that design choice also had an effect on what I painted. Some days design drove the subject choice, others, the subject drove the design. I also thought of the book as a whole and made sure the thumbnails varied from spread to spread.
- all events were drawn from my memories. They actually have occurred but all names and relationships are fictional and years have passed since the actual events.
2016? Oh yes! But I definitely will work in a larger journal with smoother paper. Thanks Roz, this is a great
art project creativity project!
If you just came upon this post by chance and you’re wondering

How Do Cash Advance Payday Loans Work?
If you have ever felt the immediate dependence on money, it is possible to know very well what a relief it is to obtain sufficient money with minimum fuss. Instant payday cash advances are often called by many names. Some contact them cash advance loans while some contact them a check advance loan. Regardless of what you refer to it as, these financing options are short-term, unsecured, high interest loans.
These days, money advance payday cash advances are nearly always disbursed online. Generally, lenders have an online prescence where borrowers can submit the sign-up form. This form requests basic information like personal details, details associated with occupation, current financial information and banking information. Most lenders also obtain personal references. And that is all there is certainly to it!
As you are able to see, cash loan payday cash advance bad credit advances are all about convenience. Borrowers are asked for minimal information. However, there are a few issues that should be met before these financing options are sanctioned. The borrower must:
1.Have a regular task for no less than 90 days before they make an application for the loan
2.Have a minimum take-home pay (as stipulated through the lender)
3.Possess a valid bank account for at least 3 months prior to loan application
It has to be noted the are broad terms for sanctioning the money. Different lenders have different requirements. You must ascertain the regards to your loan before you decide to avail it.
Cash advance payday loans are a good boon in common situations. Firstly, they are readily available to everyone types of consumers, regardless of credit score and credit scoring. Secondly, these loans are sanctioned quickly if things are all in order. Generally, the bucks might be deposited within the borrower's bank account within hours of sending within the application. Delays happen only if the application is filled in after working hours or over the weekend, in which particular case many lenders consume a queue system to process the credit.
Payday financing will not involve too much processing time or processing fee mainly because these plans require no submission of papers. If a borrower meets the minimal requirements of the lender, the borrowed funds is sanctioned. The amount of the loan will be decided by the lender and will be communicated for the borrower via email. The allowable amount you borrow is fixed using several criteria and is different from lender to lender.
Cash advance pay day loans are generally short term installment loans and borrowers are required to pay off these financing options in just a short period of time, as fixed by the lender. However, in the event funds are unavailable before closure, most financiers may allow a roll-over. In other words, they are going to sanction that the term of the loan be extended. This facility is restricted and most lenders don't let several roll-over. In any case, extending the definition of of a payday advance should be a careful decision and has to be approached with caution due on the high rates of interest it attracts.Welcome to your FREE 12 Wonders of Britain supplement

The Consort here striding confidently to the microphone to amuse and confuse you while The (lovely and very talented) Princess deals with her commitments to the community. Now that the temperature is climbing my thoughts are turning to golf. To be more precise, golf fashion and a dash of fun. Ready? I believe we are up on the tee.
Let’s begin with some golf fashions that have caught my eye recently.
Maide Golf is rolling out a great line of pants, shirts and more. You’ve likely heard of their parent company Bonobos. The pants come in a variety of colors and the attention to detail is exciting. I’m loving the 2″ zipper on the hem to allow you to adjust the break of the pants on your shoes. Nice touch. Next time you have a spare minute give them a look and envision yourself sporting those clean lines the next time you step to the tee.
Or you could make a bolder statement with our friends from Loudmouth Golf. You’ve no doubt seen their memorable patterns for pants, shorts, shirts and accessories. Here’s one of the new looks for this season:
This is the “Dropcloth” pattern but I imagine you figured that out for yourself. They have a wide variety of patterns with a price tag for pants of around $100. Go ahead and let the world know you have confidence in your game.
When I was younger we all believed there would be flying cars in our garages by the year 2000. We’re not quite there yet but pro golfer and Masters Champion Bubba Watson might be taking us closer to that reality.
Bubba and Oakley have reportedly created a hovercraft golf cart that might just usher in the next great age of golf cart racing. Is it for real? It seems to work in the video. All I know is that this hovercraft might be just what I need to lower my handicap a few strokes. The cost? Who cares? It’s a HOVERCRAFT GOLF CART!
It’s time to wrap this up for the day. The Princess will be back here next time with information you can actually use. Until then remember to take care of your waitperson tonight because they’re working hard for you. Good night, my friends!What if my health fails? What if the economy gets worse? What if this pandemic lasts longer than they say it will?
Have you been asking these questions?
As I ponder these inquiries, I’m reminded of a recent study known as The Legacy Project, conducted by Dr. Karl Pillemer at Cornell University.
He surveyed over 1200 senior citizens living in an assisted living community. He asked them to reflect on what the biggest regret of their life was.
Here’s what they recorded as the number one answer: The amount of time they wasted worrying about the future.
They regretted worrying about the worst-case scenarios that never became a reality.
Will you look back with regret when you reflect on this pandemic season?
We are currently isolated from one another. Instead of meeting face-to-face, we use Zoom.
Our computer screens are starting to resemble the opening introductions of the Brady Bunch TV Show!

Stop Playing the “What If” Game
There are always two sides to playing the “what if?” game. For example, you can ask, “what if this pandemic lasts longer than forecasted?”
But you could also ask, “What if a miracle cure is discovered next week?” The bottom line in both cases is that we don’t know.
By attempting to answer either question, we would be speculating, which as mentioned earlier, is a waste of your time.
The best use of your time is to focus on doing the right things right now. All you can do is make the best decisions based on the current information you have.
I know what you’re thinking: “Thanks for sharing Twiggs, but I need more specifics. If only there were a tool that could help me to stay focused on the right things.”
Well, today is your lucky day! The tool you seek is The Rule of Five.
Apply the Rule of Five
What’s the first idea that pops into your head when you think of increasing your car count? I’ll bet you answered, “Email a special to my customers.”
When under pressure, the tendency is to go with what you know. Especially if the tactic has worked for you.
The problem is that what you already know doesn’t always work. Your chances of success would increase if you had to come up with four additional strategies.
At least two of your ideas would stretch your comfort zone because you wouldn’t normally try them. Uncomfortable methods tend to be the most effective!
This is what makes The Rule of Five such a great tool!
Here’s how it works: For any major business goal, pick at least five different things you can do this week to make it happen.
Below is a real-world example of The Rule of Five:
- Write a handwritten thank you letter to every customer and leave it on their steering wheel!
- Thoroughly clean every car before and after the service, and advertise this on all our social media platforms!
- Offer hands-free transactions (ex: text to pay) and emphasize this on the phone!
- Call the top 300 customers to say we are open, essential, and here for them!
- Call every customer that hasn’t visited in the last seven months and ask why they may have stopped coming and if there is anything we can do for them.
Applying The Rule of Five will force you to focus on doing the right things right now. Here’s a challenge to consider:
Conduct a weekly meeting with your team asking them the following question: “What five things can we do to improve business this week?
Conclusion
So, there you have it. By eliminating the “what if” game and applying the rule of Five, you can thrive during a pandemic.
When you are surveyed during your senior years, you will reflect on 2020 without feeling regret.

Starting 3rd April, 2021, the Doge Cup is being played in two titles: Free Fire – A Mobile Game and Valorant – A PC Game, allowing esports athletes the opportunity to win 50,000 DOGE Coins equivalent of $5000 at peak value.
Doge Coin is a meme-based cryptocurrency that has been promoted by multiple prominent personalities, including Elon Musk and Snoop Dogg. The upcoming Doge Cup event will not offer cash prizes, but it will offer cryptocurrency equivalent prize money. The event seeks to engage the viewers and content creators and promote cryptocurrency awareness.
The invited teams comprise some of the top teams and influencers of the region with their cumulative following crossing 50 Million gamers across the world. There will be 12 teams for Free Fire and 8 for Valorant.
Dr. Rushindra Sinha and Mohit Israney, Co-Founders of Global Esports said, “The concept of using DOGE Coins, a cryptocurrency, stemmed from the fact that Esports and cryptocurrency are the fastest growing ecosystems of this generation, so combining both to create something fun and innovative seemed interesting to us. With DOGE Cup, we aim at cross pollinating into the two communities while also, in our own way, explaining to billions of curious minds the concept of Cryptocurrency.”
The event commenced on 3rd April and will culminate on 7th April and will have the games start at 2pm each day. Free Fire will be played on 3rd and 4th April, while Valorant on 5th, 6th and 7th April. The winners will get Such Doge, Much Wow, but 10% of the Prize Pool goes to the highest melee/knife/pan kills. In a quirky twist, there will also be prizes for the Hall of Shame which will feature the most epic fails during the tournament.

An optimal payment scheme for South Korean online casino sites is always something to watch out for. In fact, it really is quite amazing that with so many various kinds of currencies, and actual money (usually Korean Won) being accepted. While there’s no official Korean-based internet casinos at this time, savvy local gamers can still find a good number of sites operating offshore.
Almost all of the hottest casino sites in Korea operate either via Windows or Java. Java works particularly well for the slot games. The live dealers at the casino in Seoul are American, British, and Canadian. Their names are usually displayed right beside their screens.
As with any country, it’s imperative to read up on the many taxes, fees, and “blackmails” that could be required when playing casino Korea online gaming. Occasionally a specific type of charge card is required upon registration. This credit card is used to facilitate payment processing. With regards to the type of casino where you play, this step is probably not necessary.
As with anywhere else on the globe, it’s wise to open a new bank account before starting to play slots. Generally in most casinos in South Korea, deposits are welcome only upon first deposit. That is quite different from most other countries. Almost all countries, THE UNITED STATES included, encourage new players to open a bank account with funds transfer services. Be sure you read up on the casino’s particular procedures, as some may be inconvenient.
Another facet of casino gambling in Korea is its use of the Korean Won. That is known in the gambling world as “the win in one game”. It isn’t uncommon at all for first time gamblers in South Korea to win an individual game before being discouraged by their inability to win consecutive games. A player can win a unitary wager and then continue on with another game without concern with losing.
With more casino Korea players traveling to this part of the world, there have been growing complaints about corruption in the Korean casinos online. Players have complained about system manipulation, hidden winnings bonus offers with ties to extortion, and the exploitation of internet gambling. Unfortunately, many of these problems stem from having less regulation of the web casino industry. The federal government has little power on the online casinos and only has complete control on the country’s land-based casinos.
The Korean Payment Method Act regulates payment methods used at Korean casinos online. One major provision of regulations states that payment methods must be approved by the Korean Payment Method sm 카지노 Association, which includes all major card companies like MasterCard and Visa. Furthermore, all bonuses should be reported to the Kipper, who is the body in charge of monitoring transactions and investigating any suspected cases of gaming fraud.
The areas of regulation of Korean online casinos are the Internet control system, which includes Internet censorship and blocking. The Korean Internet Control Organization is the coordinating body for Korean cyberspace activities. The Internet Service Provider Act regulates all areas of the Internet in Korea including Internet gambling korea online casinos. This act requires all providers to provide an excellent of service and protect the interests of users.
There are no problems with accepting Korean players from the United States following the United States begun to impose financial sanctions on the Korean market. Today, there is no known way to withdraw cash from the Korean casino if one wants to achieve this, unless one lives in the united kingdom.
Having less a legal gambling structure in Korea makes it extremely difficult to conduct successful gaming businesses. Many players choose to gamble in other countries because they do not feel safe gambling in the home. Most casinos offer a variety of forms of bonuses to attract new players, like the popular “bait” which will come in the proper execution of free drinks and merchandise. Players can usually be prepared to see many of the popular casino games on offer at these bonus points, such as for example roulette, craps, blackjack, baccarat, among others. Furthermore, most casinos offer top quality services, including casino meeting rooms and full-service bars, making it easy to enjoy playing to the full while enjoying exactly the same great food and drinks that are offered in the bigger US casinos.A social insurance number allows your employer to pay you a salary.

She was diagnosed in September, just a month after I returned from an unforgettable study abroad experience. It was an earth-shaking even for me. I struggled to finish my semester but felt more deserving than ever when I turned my onyx on that rainy day in May.
During my first year out of school, I did a lot of searching: searching for ‘myself’, searching for a job, searching for a new normalcy outside of the Meredith gates. I found myself volunteering with the North Carolina Lung Cancer Partnership, photographing a few of their events. It was a great outlet for me to positively channel my grief. I noticed that there was a whole demographic that the partnership was missing: young women. I wanted to create an event that did two things: raise awareness amongst lung cancer for young women and celebrate and honor my mom’s life.
Combining my studies in fashion design and theatre and my mom’s love of fashion, White Out Lung Cancer was created. On June 15th at Burning Coal Theatre in Downtown Raleigh, local designers, mostly Meredith students and alumnae, will join our sponsoring boutiques in a fashion show benefiting the North Carolina Lung Cancer Partnership. Irongate Winery will be providing a wine tasting to kick-off the evening, in combination with a silent auction featuring items by many local artist and opening night tickets to see Christie Brinkley star in Chicago at DPAC! My hope is to sell the house out, and I’d love to see my fellow Meredith sisters at the event.

Starting with the Windows Vista release, Microsoft introduced the Windows Display Driver to drive the video cards installed in the computer.
It tended to be different from the previous systems in that better quality graphics could be delivered on a real-time basis.
The display was much more stable, with fewer instances of crashes occurring with the use of the display driver model.
It was possible to run the applications much faster and cleaner with the new display driver. The desktop became more functional than previously thought possible with prior systems.
The desktop window manager became all the more powerful with the release of Windows display driver, and it could be seen in a much better looking as well as a more functional system.
Features enabled by the Windows Display Driver
Better graphics: Using virtualized video memory, it became possible to render some of the most powerful graphics possible. By virtualization, it was possible to mask out the memory requirements of applications working simultaneously, from each other.
This would mean a more individualized approach to the whole model that allowed excessive data to be moved to the RAM or the disk from the video card.
Scheduling: Timely running of applications got the better with the display driver model. The commands were stored in a queue, and the critical phases could bypass the system and seek more immediate action.
Thus it became possible for critical features to be run in proper sequence and speed. This action led to a better and more responsive computer most of the time.
The 3D effect: One of the features with Windows releases after the vista version was the near-perfect 3D imaging possible on the systems. This is one of the primary reasons why the graphics tended to be much more interactive and alive to the inputs. It became possible as the Direct 3D surfaces could be shared across processes.
Fault tolerance: With the Windows Display Driver, it became possible to build a much more fault-tolerant system than ever attempted before. The graphics stack can restart the driver, and any hardware fault can be intercepted, and the graphics card reset.
This feature would be evident from the manner the graphics systems came to be seen as more robust after the release of the version vista with Windows.
Limitations of the Windows Display Driver
It is to be noted that the new driver model needed the support of Shader Model 2.0 or higher. With close to 98% of the Windows operating system supporting the display driver model, it was as though this drawback did not get to be too critical.
The system could function without the over-reliance on the Shader files most of the time. With the release version 1.0, it was not possible to support multiple drivers on the same motherboard.
This lacuna was removed with the release of version 1.1 that was the debugged version of the Windows Display Driver Model.
Most people, when they first started using Windows vista release, were quick to point out that it had very impressive graphics rendering. This was primarily possible with the use of the Windows Display Driver Model.
The release version 1.1 removed the typical bugs encountered with the 1.0 version and meant a much smoother rendering of theVeneto Banka Dd Branches with SWIFT code in Croatia - City List

Chicago Fire focuses on the continued drama between Sylvie Brett and Matt Casey. We also get a glimpse into Severide’s past. Here’s what happened last time on Chicago Fire.
Warning: This article contains spoilers for Chicago Fire Season 9, Episode 8 (“Escape Route”).
Matt Casey and Sylvie Brett continue to play games on ‘Chicago Fire’
Grainger arranges to cover for Herrmann. He’s supposed to be there to work but he’s really there so he can get close to Sylvie Brett. Matt Casey sees him at the firehouse and gets very upset. He still likes Sylvie, but she asked for space, so he backs off. However, it looks like he’s ready to fight for what he wants.
Sylvie and Grainger decide to go out for drinks, but things get a little uncomfortable. When Casey shows up at Molly’s, Stella lets him know that Grainger paid for his drink. He turns around and sees Sylvie and Grainger at a table together. When Sylvie looks over, Grainger says he knows there was something romantic between her and Casey. The situation gets awkward, so Sylvie suggests they leave the bar. They head back to her place for some alone time.
Casey has been mean to Grainger for the entire time he’s been helping at the firehouse. Grainger got to the point where he couldn’t take much more, so he confronted him about it. Casey told him he was out of line and Grainger told him he was being unprofessional.
Later that day, Sylvie talks to Casey and tells him he needs to fix his attitude. She says she thinks he’s acting out because he’s still in love with Dawson. We think Casey is confused and doesn’t know what he wants. By the time he figures it out, Sylvie will probably be married to Grainger and have a house full of kids.
Severide gets a call that takes him back to his childhood
Severide and his team are called to a house fire that hits close to home, literally. He discovers the fire is at the home where he used to live when he was younger. A mother and her son, Dylan, were home when the fire started. The mother is burned after she tries to get to the refrigerator and get her son’s insulin. However, she’s unsuccessful and sustains severe injuries.
Severide tries to help the family by asking Chicago Med nurse April if she could find a patient assistance program for Dylan. April does some research and finds out that there’s a clinical insulin trial that Dylan might be a good fit for.
He decides to go to the hospital to tell Dylan’s father the great news, but he tells him that his son never came back to the hospital. Severide finds Dylan hiding out at his old home. He blames himself for his mother’s injuries and he feels responsible for his parents’ money woes. Most of their money went toward purchasing his medication. Severide tells Dylan that it’s not his fault and convinces him to meet his parents at the hospital.

by Skia
Categories: Technical -
Tags: Reverse Engineering - REVEN - Fuzzing - AFL - Workflow API -! Part of the analysis itself could also be automated for triage, filtering or having a report ready for the analyst. This aspect is not covered in this article (look at this demo if interested).
Requirements
- On the server side:
- A running REVEN Enterprise Project Manager, accessible from the network if client is remote.
- A QEMU VM registered in that Project Manager, fully prepared for the autorecord, and of course able to run the fuzzed binary, whether Windows or Linux.
- On the client side (that can be implemented on the server itself):
The following figure illustrates the setup:
Gluing both worlds, fuzzer and REVEN
As you probably already know if you are into fuzzing, AFL and other fuzzers produce an output folder with all the inputs that generated a crash. It is this output folder that we will use to automatically record a scenario per crash.
The
automatic-post-fuzzer-recorder.py
script
currently does the job of recording multiple scenarios automatically on a REVEN Project Manager.
It will take as input a binary and a corpus of files, that typically is a fuzzer’s output, and will record one scenario per corpus file, feeding the binary with the corpus file name as first argument. Once a record is done, the corresponding replay is launched, and the next record will be performed. Between each record, the VM’s live snapshot will be restored.
Every scenario is named with the prefix given in argument, the binary name, and the corpus file name. If a scenario with the same name already exists, this script will exit, meaning you won’t overwrite your existing scenarios by re-running it a second time. Also, this script will not “listen” to the directory, meaning it is not suitable for running during the fuzzer’s execution, but rather after its termination.
From this version, it should be quite straightforward to adapt the script for some other use cases that better fit your needs.
Let’s dive a bit into its usage.
A typical invocation looks like this:
python3 automatic-post-fuzzer-recorder.py \ --url \ --snapshot 1 \ --live-snp 'autorecord-2048M-net-nokvm' \ --name "fuzzing-mybinary" \ --corpus path/to/mybinary/output/crashes/ \ --local-binary path/to/mybinary/a.exe
--urlis the address of the REVEN project manager
--snapshotis the ID of the VM disk snapshot you want to use
--live-snpis the name of the live snapshot on this disk snapshot used for each record
--nameis a prefix that will be prepended to each scenario’s name
--corpusis the path to a folder containing the input files you want to record
--local-binaryis the path to your local binary that you want to record
Running this with three files in the corpus returns the following output:
binary file "a.exe" uploaded with id 39 QEMU session started input file "id:000002,sig:11,src:000000,time:33720,op:havoc,rep:32" uploaded with id 40 Scenario "fuzzing-mybinary - a.exe - id:000002,sig:11,src:000000,time:33720,op:havoc,rep:32" created with id 18 Snapshot "autorecord-2048M-net-nokvm" loaded Record started Recorder status: Record completed Record saved in scenario fuzzing-mybinary - a.exe - id:000002,sig:11,src:000000,time:33720,op:havoc,rep:32 Replay started for scenario 18 input file "id:000000,sig:11,src:000002,time:30099,op:havoc,rep:4" uploaded with id 41 Scenario "fuzzing-mybinary - a.exe - id:000000,sig:11,src:000002,time:30099,op:havoc,rep:4" created with id 19 Snapshot "autorecord-2048M-net-nokvm" loaded Record started Recorder status: Record completed Record saved in scenario fuzzing-mybinary - a.exe - id:000000,sig:11,src:000002,time:30099,op:havoc,rep:4 Replay started for scenario 19 input file "id:000001,sig:11,src:000002,time:30561,op:havoc,rep:32" uploaded with id 42 Scenario "fuzzing-mybinary - a.exe - id:000001,sig:11,src:000002,time:30561,op:havoc,rep:32" created with id 20 Snapshot "autorecord-2048M-net-nokvm" loaded Record started Recorder status: Record completed Record saved in scenario fuzzing-mybinary - a.exe - id:000001,sig:11,src:000002,time:30561,op:havoc,rep:32 Replay started for scenario 20 All files from the corpus were recorded, exiting. Session has been stopped Created scenarios have been dumped to 'created_scenarios.json'
As you can see at the end of the output, a
created_scenarios.json file provides a complete
summary of the scenarios that were recorded.
It can be used to launch analysis scripts on those scenarios, such as specific reports (crash detection for example) or vulnerability detection.
Some thoughts on performance
My machine has an Intel i5-8500 CPU, 16 GB of RAM, and all the REVEN-related data for this are stored on a SATA-connected Samsung 860 EVO SSD.
This run took about one minute to complete, and each replay took about 30 seconds each. The used binary does little more than opening the input file and sometimes failing depending on the content, which gives us a good estimation of the speed of the whole process without too much overhead from the scenario itself.
Most of the time here was spent in the reloading of the VM snapshot and getting the autorecorder ready.
Going further
This simple setup can work great for simple cases as the one presented above, but of course there is room for improvements. Here are a few ideas:
- Plugging some analysis scripts afterwards, so that reports could be generated automatically on the recorded scenarios to help triage the fuzzer output more efficiently.
- Integrating more deeply in a real fuzzing pipeline, to avoid manually running the script for each fuzzing campaign. One can imagine many different directions here, depending on the setup it integrates with.
- Using multiple machines to record and replay separately, leveraging for example the import/export feature, would probably be a good idea if the load generated by the replay was to impact too much the recording performances.
As this setup mainly relies on Python, a lot can be imagined and done, even in the most complicated setup!
This article demonstrated how REVEN can be integrated inside a fuzzing toolchain to automatically generate timeless analysis scenarios for the chain’s outputs. This scenarios can then be further analyzed, still automatically with the Python API or manually using Axion or even Windbg for Windows scenarios.

However, the market growth was hindered in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, the future seems promising for the market owing to factors such as globalization of clinical trials, rapid technological evolution, and augmenting demand for CROs to conduct research activities. The increasing prevalence of chronic disease and the growing demand for clinical trials in developing countries are also fueling this market’s growth. The market is also driven by a rising number of biologics, the need for personalized medicines and orphan drugs, and demand for advanced technologies.
The rapidly evolving threat due to the outbreak of COVID-19 is impacting lives, communities, businesses, and industries around the globe. The pandemic also negatively impacted the ecosystem of clinical trials during the first half of 2020. It affected many ongoing clinical trials for various therapeutic areas. However, to overcome this, researchers developed innovative therapeutics and vaccines against COVID-19, which has supported the market recovery and growth. Growing demand for CROs for conducting clinical trials in the pharmaceutical sector due to the diversified expertise of CROs and adoption of advanced technologies in clinical trials is supporting market growth. Digitization in biomedical research is also paving the way for market growth. Incorporating advanced technologies such as Electronic Data Capture (EDC) aid market participants in managing patient data that ultimately reduce monitoring costs. Digitization also helps in meeting stringent regulations by maintaining patient data records that reduce trial process errors through the adoption of software such as e-COA (Electronic Clinical Outcome Assessment).
The current pandemic is changing the way of conducting ongoing or upcoming clinical trials. Regulatory agencies such as the U.S. FDA, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and China’s National Medical Products Administration, have issued guidelines related to the conduct of clinical trials during the outbreak of coronavirus, which is in complete support of incorporating virtual services.
The current scenario across the globe and the need to come up with treatment options has also led to the fast-track of clinical trials. The favorable government support is boosting the growth of the market for clinical trials. The WHO launched “Solidarity”, an international clinical trial launched, to find effective treatment against COVID-19. It includes comparing four treatment options against the standard of care to evaluate their effectiveness against Coronavirus. The WHO also announced in May, an international alliance for simultaneously developing numerous candidate vaccines to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease, calling this effort the Solidarity trial for vaccines.
The phase III segment dominated the market for clinical trials and accounted for the largest revenue share of 53.2% in 2020. This growth is attributed to the fact that phase III clinical trials are the most expensive ones and involves huge subjects. The median cost for a single-phase III clinical trial is around USD 19.0 million with 59 new therapeutic agents approved by the FDA from 2015 to 2016. Also, Phase III requires a higher number of patients and often a longer treatment period.
The phase II segment accounted for a revenue share phase III clinical trial. Besides, there are various therapeutic and vaccines currently in phase II for the treatment of coronavirus, thereby, boosting the growth of the market for clinical trials.; AB Science SA; and others. interventional design segment led the market for clinical trials and accounted for the largest revenue share with 82.1% in 2020. It is one of the most prominent methods used in a clinical trial. The interventional studies comprise 79.0% of total registered studies as of May 2020, out of which the majority of studies are for drug or biologics, followed by behavioral, clinical procedure, and device intervention studies. Intervention studies contribute to 94.0% of total studies with posted results out of which drug or biologics contribute the most, followed by behavioral, devices, and clinical procedure intervention studies.
Expanded access trials, also referred to as compassionate use trials are anticipated to register a CAGR of 4 as a part of expanded access trials.. and subsidiary Nash Pharmaceuticals, and Ansun Biopharma Inc.
The report further provides a deep dive into the various indications and mostly adopted study designs. The interventional trials for autoimmune/inflammation accounted for the largest revenue share of 82.1% in 2020. The high share can be attributed to a large number of interventional studies being conducted on autoimmune/inflammation across the globe. There are over 7,000 interventional studies listed on clinicaltrials.gov related to autoimmune/inflammation. For instance, an interventional study titled Immunoadsorption or Plasma Exchange - What is the Best Treatment Option of Steroid Refractory Neurological Autoimmune Diseases was completed on December 1, 2019. Furthermore, the largest share is also attributable to advantages of interventional studies such as effective minimization of the effect of confounding, avoidance of bias in allocation to exposure groups, and efficient detection of small to moderate clinically important effects.
The observational trials for autoimmune/inflammation accounted for the second-largest revenue share in 2020. Out of the total autoimmune/inflammation studies listed on clinicaltrials.gov, more than 2,000 are observational. For instance, an observational study titled “Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging to Aid Clinical Decision Making in Autoimmune Hepatitis was completed on December 31, 2019.
The expanded access accounted for the lowest share for autoimmune/inflammation in 2020. There are less than 40 expanded access studies as of 2020 for autoimmune/inflammation. For instance, there an ongoing expanded access study titled Expanded Access Protocol Thymus Transplantation for Immunodeficiency, Hematologic Malignancies, and Autoimmune Disease Related to Poor Thymic Function as of March 7, 2021. A similar analysis for the rest of the indications shall be provided in our report study.
The oncology segment dominated the clinical trials market and accounted for the largest revenue share of 36.3% in 2020. The segment is also anticipated to witness the fastest CAGR of 5.9% over the forecast period. As per the U.S. FDA and various other sources, more than USD 38.0 billion is currently spent by the pharmaceutical industry towards the preclinical and clinical development of oncology therapy products.
The cardiovascular condition segment is also anticipated to witness a lucrative CAGR of 5.7% over the forecast period. the market for clinical trials.% of the global average decrease in the enrollment of new patients year-over-year. 84.0% reduction in India and a 43.0% decrease in Japan were also observed. The U.S. is down with an average of 67.0%.
North America dominated the market for clinical trials and accounted for the largest revenue share of 51.0% market growth.
Moreover, the favorable government support in the U.S. market regarding clinical trials is anticipated to boost the demand. For instance, in March 2020, the FDA has launched a Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program (CTAP) for possible therapies to speed up the development of treatment for the global disease caused by the coronavirus. The program employs every available way to provide novel treatment to patients as rapidly as possible, simultaneously finding out whether they are harmful or helpful.
In Asia Pacific, the market for clinical trials is anticipated to witness the fastest CAGR of 6.7% over the forecast period owing to the increasing availability of a large patient pool facilitating easy recruitment of candidates. The global pandemic is also the main contributing factor for.
The market for clinical trials is highly competitive in nature. Significant factors affecting competitive nature are quick adoption of advanced technology for improved healthcare. Also, to retain share and expand the product portfolio, major players are often involved in mergers and acquisitions along with new product launches.
For instance, in January 2020, Wuxi AppTec announced offering a fully integrated adeno-associated virus Vector Suspension Platform to speed up the cell and gene therapy development, manufacturing, and launch, thus, expanding its service capabilities. Another instance occurred in June 2018, where Acurian and Synexus, a part of PPD, launched SynexusPlus. SynexusPlus is a site solution for patient enrollment in clinical studies. This initiative is anticipated to improve clinical trial productivity. Besides, the solution is also helpful in the current pandemic of COVID-19 as it helps in the reduction of the site footprints.

Kgosientso Ramokgopa has stepped down from Gauteng Cabinet
Gauteng Premier David Makhura has had to reshuffle his cabinet and drop one male as per the ANC NEC resolutions.
The ANC NEC decided that in provinces where there are male premiers, 60% of the executive had to be female.
In a statement the economic development department released, Ramakgopa expressed his “most sincere gratitude” to the ANC for his deployment to the provincial legislature. He also thanked Makhura.
“It has been a great pleasure to serve the people of Gauteng and I have no doubt that the 6th administration will take the province forward by remaining focused on the task at hand of growing an inclusive and transformed economy that creates jobs for the unemployed,” his statement read.
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
Makhura, in a message on Twitter, announced that he would be replaced by Morakane Mosupyoe.
In keeping with the ANC’s commitment to ensure that women are well represented in executive structures I have appointed Ms. Morakane Mosupyoe as the new MEC for @GautengDED. She will continue with our vision of growing the economy our province. #GrowingGautengTogether pic.twitter.com/QIG9F2M04a
— David Makhura (@David_Makhura) October 11,Silverpoint (more broadly, “metal point”) drawing is an archaic medium which reached its peak in the Renaissance period.
Very early in the history of writing, scribes would use metal stylii to make marks in and on a variety of permanent and temporary media, including wax and clay tablets. Wealthy and royal persons who needed to keep records (business inventories and so forth) employed these scribes, and the stylus material served as notice to all of the status of the employer – gold and silver for the upper classes, lead for somewhat lesser beings. (An interesting essay on writing technology development.)
As writing developed further, animal skins were used (vellum and parchment). These skins (called the “support,” stretched and scraped thin and then dried), had to be prepared to accept the marks made with the stylus. So a “ground” was applied to and worked into the support material; the ground consisted of a pigment, usually white, in a binding vehicle, and becomes the “surface” upon which the marks are made.
The binding vehicle could be any number of preparations, including spittle and urine. Early on, the pigments included pumice (probably from Mount Vesuvius), chalk, bone ash, ground roasted bone (from chickens), and so forth. The use of prepared animal skins as supports for important documents written in silverpoint would continue for centuries. In archives and collections throughout Europe one can find historical documents written in silverpoint on animal skins by ancient scribes. I stumbled across one in a cathedral in northeastern England, displayed in a case with various artifacts documenting and illuminating the cathedral’s history. In spite of the relative lack of care, this example on vellum was in excellent condition and quite readable.
During the late medieval period (11th through 14th C.), paper technology gradually spread through Europe from the Far East. Paper at this time was literally worth its weight in gold. Scribes continued to use the metal stylus to make their marks on papers prepared in the same way as animal skins.
Soon artists got into the act. The Dictionary of Art (1996: MacMillan, Ltd., v. 21, pp. 339-340) states, “although a metal stylus had been used to inscribe surfaces since Classical times, metalpoint was employed for drawing only from the medieval period. It was in frequent use from the late 14th Century up to the early 17th and was particularly favoured in the Renaissance period in Italy, the Netherlands, and in Germany…” Cennino Cennini, writing in the 14th century, describes, in his Il Libro dell’Arte, the preparation of the surface to make it ready for silverpoint (he specifies dried chicken bones, burned until very white, mixed with color, then moistened with spittle). Leonardo da Vinci’s preparation of the paper probably included the spittle and bone ash, or perhaps the pumice mentioned earlier.
One of Leonardo’s drawings has received much attention as an example of silverpoint drawing of the period. What many people do not know is that this excellent, meticulous drawing of a soldier in a helmet was executed as a student’s demonstration of his ability as a draughtsman, since all apprentices were expected to do just that before moving on. There was no intent beyond that demonstration, and it is unlikely that the surface was prepared in any way to ensure its permanence; still, it exists, and is presently resting comfortably in England. (For more information on the history of silverpoints, see Drawing in Early Renaissance Italy by Francis Ames-Lewis.)
Many other “Old Masters” made effective use of the medium. Raphael used silverpoint in his studies, as did Dürer, Holbein, Rembrandt and Rubens. In fact, Durer had a “sketchbook” of prepared papers which he carried with him during his travels, and made sketches therein. A quick sketch I made appears on the left. Please note: it doesn’t smudge.
Metalpoint was not the only drawing and writing medium employed by artists and scribes during medieval and Renaissance times; chalks and ink were also employed. But metalpoint was superior in some very specific ways – it was fine enough to capture exquisite detail and would not smudge (unlike chalk) and was completely permanent, inert and fade-proof (unlike ink). It could be used on any prepared surface/support; thus, it made an excellent underdrawing for paintings and frescoes. Unlike charcoal or ink, it would not stain or otherwise impart any of itself to painting that followed, an important characteristic for egg tempera use, the dominant method employed during the medieval and early Renaissance periods. It was self-contained, portable, and easy to use. And it could double as ornament (some artists had very ornate precious metal stylii made which they would hang around their neck). The “inert” quality is important – some excellent examples of drawing from this period are silverpoint, and survived through seven hundred years quite well due to their inertness.
The “grounds” gradually underwent change; artists continued to seek better, smoother, more durable surfaces. Over a period of three or four hundred years a series of formulas emerged which resulted in extremely smooth, hard surfaces that not only allowed the marks to be made but amplified them; this is the area where I concentrating my research. The best examples of what I consider to be the ultimate surface come from the Netherlands, and were made with lead-based white pigment (flake white). Now I must caution you that some descriptions of the process state that there is a “chemical reaction” between the ground and the silver left upon it. I’m almost certain that this is not true, that it may just be a function of a physical state, that the extremely tiny particles of the silver left behind on the microabrasive surface just tarnish much more rapidly than coarser particles on a sandpaper-like surface.
Sadly, the metal points were gradually losing favor; preparation of the surface/support was very time consuming, and each generation of artists is always looking for faster methods. Painting was shifting away from tempera and toward oil, and becoming more expressive and direct, but less precise. And some enterprising soul discovered graphite and invented the pencil! (Actually, this took a fairly long time; graphite was discovered in England around 1560 CE, but commercial development of the graphite-and-clay rod sheathed in wood took until the 1800s or so.)
A little aside here: we call the material inside our pencils “lead” – in fact, it is NOT lead, but a compound of graphite and clay. The term “lead” is a holdover from the days when a lead point was actually used to make marks on paper. Lead, being softer than silver and gold, allowed much greater leeway in surface preparation, and could actually leave faint marks on UNprepared papers! The first recorded use of lead as a marking device is mentioned in the writings of the Greek poet Thessalonika.
There was a revival of silverpoint drawing in the 18th C., and again in the late 19th (Leighton, Strang – England), then again in the early 20th (Picasso, Joseph Stella, Francis Wilmer Dewing), and now. Currently, there are a few hundred artists working in the medium; most rely on descriptions in “standard” artists’ materials books, or individual explorations. Unfortunately, most descriptions are not completely correct, in that they consistently describe the medium as being “faint,” “delicate” and so forth.
It often is, but it doesn’t HAVE to be! The problem is that most descriptions are based on examples using Gum Arabic as the vehicle/binder and zinc oxide as the pigment, and the fact that an awful lot of people are prepared to accept the results of using house paint, acrylic gesso, and other less-than-perfect but quick-and-easy ground materials. (But to give them credit, even with a mediocre ground, it’s pretty astounding that silver will leave a mark on paper!)
There’s nothing wrong with the zinc oxide – it became commercially available quite recently (late 18th C.), and is an excellent substitute for lead white (it’s not nearly so poisonous!). But Gum Arabic is problematic; it’s almost impossible to build up a thick, smooth surface with it, as in thicker applications it tends to crack as it dries (see an unfortunate example of this on the right). So there’s little pigment on the surface of grounds which depend on it. And that’s why those drawings are faint. (Whoever wrote those books didn’t look at the drawings from the Old Masters, as I did when I conducted my initial research in Her Majesty’s Collection at Windsor Castle and in the Prints and Drawings Department of the British Musem, London). The beauty of the gum arabic / zinc oxide formula is that it’s readily available – Zinc White gouache and/or Chinese White watercolor is nothing more than very fine zinc oxide powder in Gum Arabic!
For example, let’s take a look at the extremely brief discussion in Ralph Mayer’s famous book, The Artists Handbook of Materials and techniques :
“Silverpoint drawings…are characterized by a certain
delicacy of line… [The] paper can be made by coating
pure, smooth watercolor or drawing paper with a
thin layer of Chinese white…”
Mayer’s Handbook is quite valuable for many processes, but in this one instance the subject is not as thoroughly researched or explained. Ray Smith’s The Artist’s Handbook is another well-regarded and fairly complete reference which should be in every artist’s studio, and in the case of silverpoint it does a somewhat better job than Mayer’s:
“Making your own surface by coating paper with white
gouache is…satisfactory… Other coatings may be
used, including bone dust, gypsum, and chalk, usually
mixed with glue size…” (4)
In spite of this introductory passage, the procedures Smith describes and illustrates specifies Zinc White gouache or Chinese White watercolor. Perhaps it is only intended to allow a beginner to witness and participate in the process. I propose to show you the promise.
After viewing some of the magnificent drawings held by the British museum, I knew that the kind of response one gets when using Gum Arabic as the binder falls far short of what is truly possible. So I made it my mission to develop a ground formula which allows a greater buildup of the silver and a more “contemporary” response – Bold! Direct! Expressive! – similar to what can be achieved in pencil, conte crayon, etc. I have gone back to the descriptions in the ancients’ writings, and have developed a formula with tremendous response. The result of this research and development was the Old Master Formula Silverpoint Ground™; one can find the formula for it in these pages still, even though I also have succumbed to the lure of “faster and easier” and switched to the Golden product. Why, even the ready-to-use Silverpoint Sketch Papers have found a place in my arsenal!
I sincerely hope this “brief” history answers some of your questions about silverpoint!900-1100

It’s been said by several people already: I jinxed myself blogging about my last blockage that I had in December (Part 1 and Part 2). Yesterday was a day and night of utter misery with yet another blockage. Yay, right?
Why the photo of the pregnant woman? I’ve had a family friend who experiences occasional IBS tell me that she’d rather give birth again than have another round of IBS and she is sure that the pain I go through with my blockages is worse than her IBS. Nothing against women; that came from a woman with 3 kids. That’s the kind of day I have when I have a blockage. So, I should have something like 20 kids by now…
It wasn’t my fault again
At about 7am, I noticed I still wasn’t quite feeling well from the late night before. I felt like I’d eaten greasy hamburgers, but I’d had a very healthy meal. Something just didn’t feel right. I checked my travel enzyme bottle and confirmed I’d taken my Zenpep. I had a normal breakfast and lunch and was sure to take enzymes with my cheese and crackers.The VanNew Movie

7 Minute Read
Long before Texas holdem became the player-vs-player card game of choice, gin rummy was highly popular. It was the feature game of many underground and casino tournaments decades ago.
The famed professional gambler Stu Ungar was originally a gin rummy master who won many tourneys. As you’ll notice, though, there are no high-profile gin rummy tournaments nor legends like Ungar playing today.
What happened to make this 2-player game nearly obsolete on the casino scene? I’ll answer this question throughout the following post.
First, though, I’d like to cover the basics of gin rummy in case you don’t know the rules well. Of course, you can skip this section if you’re already adept at playing it.
How Do You Play Gin Rummy?
This game features a standard 52-card joker. However, gin rummy differs notably from many other casino card games in how it ranks each card.
The ranks in order of highest to lowest include: king, queen, jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and ace.
The glaring difference here is the ace. Normally the highest-ranking card, it’s the lowest-ranking card in gin rummy.
The goal is to reach a predetermined number of points before your opponent. In most cases, the winning score will be worth more than 100 points.
Gin rummy is a game that’s meant for two people. Therefore, you only need to beat a single opponent to win.
To score points, you must form “melds,” which can fall into one of two categories:
- Three or four cards of the same rank (e.g. 7-7-7).
- Three or four consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g. 6s-7s-8s).
Aces can only form melds with other aces or the lowest run. For example, Ad-2d-3d would work, but Kd-Qd-Ad would not.
Deadwood cards are those that cannot form melds. These cards contribute to the “deadwood count,” meaning a combined point value that goes against you. Face cards are worth 10, numbered cards are worth their respective values, and an ace is worth 1.
Playing a Gin Rummy Hand
Each round begins with the dealer distributing 10 cards to their opponent. Once both players receive their cards, the next card is placed face-up and represents the “discard pile.” The face-down pile, meanwhile, is referred to as the “stock pile.”
When the round begins, the non-dealing player can either take the upcard on the discard pile or pass. If they grab the upcard, they’ll need to place one card in the discard pile.
Assuming nobody takes the upcard, then the non-dealer must take one card from the stock pile. From then on, both players will be able to take a card from either the stock pile or discard pile.
They continue in this fashion until one of them finishes the round by either “going Gin,” “knocking,” or just two cards are left in the stock pile. In the latter case, the round ends in a tie and nobody receives any points.
What Is Knocking?
A player with less than 10 points can announce knocking. At this point, they separate their melds from the deadwood.
The other player, meanwhile, shows their melds and can “lay off” deadwood cards that fit into the opponent’s melds. The only exception is when their opponent has a Gin hand (covered next).
Here’s an example of knocking:
- The knocking player holds a meld of three jacks.
- The other player has a jack and can lay off the jack, thus reducing their deadwood count by 10.
- If the knocking player has a Gin hand, then the defending player won’t be able to lay off any deadwood cards.
The knocking player subtracts their deadwood count from the opponent’s deadwood count. They then receive the difference in points.
What Is Going Gin?
If a player’s 10 cards all go into melds, then they can “go Gin.” The round abruptly ends, and the player who’s going Gin will receive a bonus of 25 points, plus any deadwood count in the defending player’s hand. As explained before, the defending player can’t lay off any deadwood cards in this situation.
Where Can You Normally Find Gin Rummy Games?
The main two ways that you can enjoy gin rummy include:
- Starting a game with a friend.
- Playing at an app/website that offers free gin rummy.
Given that this is a two-player game, you can get the action started relatively easily. You just need a buddy or acquaintance who understands the rules.
You can also seek out opponents who are willing to play for real money. Assuming you run in local gambling circles, then you shouldn’t have too much trouble finding an opponent.
Of course, you don’t need to play for real money or find a live opponent. Many free gaming sites offer gin rummy.
In this case, you can just download an app or visit a website. The app/site in question will then match you up with an opponent.
What About Gin Rummy in Casinos?
Gin isn’t entirely extinct from casinos. In fact, some casinos offer gin rummy tournaments as a promotion of sorts.
The Gin Rummy Association, for example, holds a World Series event at Bally’s Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. You can currently buy into this annual tourney for $1,500.
These types of events can be found in other casinos as well. They’re also available at card clubs and in underground gambling settings.
Why Is Gin Rummy Rarely Found in Casinos?
You’re not going to find a thriving gin rummy scene in gambling establishments. Casinos are into making money, and this game just doesn’t provide worthwhile profits.
The main problems with rummy from the casino’s standpoint include:
- It doesn’t offer a house edge.
- Games don’t move fast enough.
- Casinos would need to charge extreme rake.
- Players wouldn’t like these conditions.
Regarding the first point, casinos offer luck-based games because they make guaranteed profits over time. An American roulette wheel, for instance, gives the house a 5.26% advantage over players.
Sure, the casino will lose to some people even with this edge. They’ll still win $5.26 out of every $100 wagered, though, on average.
Of course, not every casino game provides the house with a solid advantage. Blackjack, for instance, can feature a 0.5% house edge or lower.
However, blackjack also moves at a quick rate. Depending upon the dealer and how many players are seated, tables can see over 100 hands per hour. This quick play rate allows casinos to capitalize even with a smaller edge.
With gin rummy, casinos need to charge rake, where they take a certain percentage out of each pot. If two players bet $100 against each other for a game, then the house would collect a percentage of the $200.
However, gin rummy games don’t always move so fast—especially with one or two players who take their time. The casino needs to make up for this slow play rate by charging more rake.
All of this leads to the fourth and final point: gamblers won’t play in casinos if they need to pay extreme rake. They can simply start a home game and avoid paying any rake at all.
Why Casinos Still Offer Gin Rummy Tournaments
Some gaming venues do offer tournaments for gin rummy. They may make a little money off these events by charging rake on buy-ins. With a $1,500 buy-in, for example, they might take $150 (10%).
When the setup and staff costs are taken into account, though, casinos don’t earn serious money off such events. They merely hold gin rummy tournaments as a promotion.
The idea is to get more players in the door. Before or after the event, the players might gamble on other games and generate profits for the casino. Furthermore, some of them will stay at the resort and spend money on dining, entertainment, and shopping.
Why Is Poker Available in Casinos, but Not Gin Rummy?
Poker variations like Texas Hold’em and Omaha don’t differ much from gin rummy. They’re player-to-player games where the casino must collect rake to earn profits.
Therefore, it seems strange that hold’em is acceptable whereas gin rummy isn’t. The key difference, though, is poker’s immense popularity.
Ever since the mid-2000s, Texas hold’em has been huge. Many people visit local casinos to test their skills against opponents and hopefully make money.
Casinos still don’t make much, if any, profit from providing poker tables. They offer hold’em and Omaha tables, though, to get people in the door.
Much like with gin rummy tournaments, players are apt to try casino games when they’re not at the poker tables. Texas hold’em tourneys are also big draws that can bring in additional resort and entertainment revenue.
Can You Play Real Money Gin Rummy Online?
Real-money online gin rummy exists to a small extent. After some research, I’ve found that online casinos based out of India and Malta both offer real-money gin play.
More gaming sites like these might exist, but these are the only two that I found after searching. The selection of online gin rummy sites where you can play for money are limited.
Again, this game doesn’t have quite the same appeal as Texas Hold’em and Omaha. As a result, it’s not as big in real-money online circles.
Conclusion
Gin rummy is still a relevant card game that’s played by gamblers across the world. It’s just not what casinos look for in a game.
The first major problem from the casino’s standpoint is that gin rummy doesn’t provide a house edge. Instead, the house must take rake out of pots to make any money.
Casinos would actually need to collect considerable rake to make this game worth the effort. Players, meanwhile, can just start home games and avoid paying the high rake.
Some gaming establishments hold reasonably priced gin rummy tournaments as promotional events. However, they’re never going to provide this game on a regular basis?So after following this guide, I finished installing ISPConfig 3 and rebooted my system..

A closed loop, where today’s products are tomorrow’s raw materials, is no longer a dream. Very often the technology is available. What is needed is new thinking and action, bringing the Circular Economy to life. We need to demonstrate success cases and models showing that it is possible.
Mastering circular initiatives is about bringing the Circular Economy to life in an organisation. It is about finding the right entry point, building the momentum and finding the community to collaborate on the challenges that we are facing.
What is key when starting and leading a circular initiative?
How to do it? What is essential when starting and leading a Circular Economy initiative? How to identify and present the most impactful circular action that inspires? How to engage management and employees from the start up to the successful completion?
These are some of the questions that people ask when they are getting in charge of an initiative that aims for the introduction or acceleration of a circular way of working in an organisation.
Inspiration from a pioneering leader
We can find inspiration in the words of a pioneer. We can hear from someone who is a global leader in the circular economy and whose company has made an inspiring circular business model a reality: Renting out light as a service.
Frans van Houten, CEO of Philips: “(…) start with a clear vision, offer leadership, and foster the right culture and skills to unite all stakeholders in a common goal. You not only need to act, you also need to measure, (…).”
This quote almost reads like a blueprint. However, it is easier said than done. And acting accordinlgy is probably easier to do when one is at the top of a major corporate.

In this new article series we want to share what these words mean in practice, what works and what are the concrete steps that one can take when leading a circular initiative.

Points of Interest
- A special event will occur if you have all four of the following Pokemon in your party: Keldeo, Cobalion, Virizion and Terrakion. This will cause the event-only Pokemon Keldeo to learn Secret Sword .
Guide
Start by heading left, where you’ll come across a clearing. If you bring the legendary Pokemon Cobalion, Virizion, Terrakion and Keldeo here, Keldeo will learn Secret Sword and transform into its Resolute Forme . The former three can be caught in this game, but Keldeo can only be obtained via a special event.
To the east of the clearing is a boulder that you can push with Strength. Past here is a deep pool, some items and a Parasol Lady standing in a very awkward position. If it’s Winter, you can’t even stop in front of her to begin a battle!
Nope, there is no way to slide to the Parasol Lady… How’d she even get there?!
Trainer Battle: Parasol Lady
With this little corner fully explored, return to the clearing and slowly make your way clockwise around the moor. Towards the north you can exchange fistcuffs with a male Pokemon Ranger.
Trainer Battle: Pokemon Ranger
Then when you’re ready, leap down the ledge to his south and check out the remaining part of the moor. Around here, you can face two trainers.
Trainer Battle: Fisherman
Trainer Battle: Pokemon Ranger
…And that’s about it for this area. Kind of underwhelming really, but still a lot of fun, especially if it’s slippery Winter. Now have your avian friend use Fly to return to Icirrus City or whichever town you want to go to.Which colleges require SAT or ACT essay?

You just don’t understand what innovation is!
Michel began her presentation recognizing that while the patent system is not perfect, there is “no doubt that innovation is critical to promoting consumer welfare, and no doubt that the patent system plays an important role.” She explained that “patents play a critical role in innovation in many industries.” But it was not long before she moved into what is wrong, in Google’s view, explaining that there are flaws in the patent system and citing patent assertion entities (i.e., patent trolls) and the need companies have to spend money to obtain large defensive patent portfolios.
Michel then explained that a big part of the problem within the industry is that there is not a common understanding of what the word “innovation” means. She defined innovation as taking a new idea, turning it into an invention and putting it into the hands of consumers. “Until a product is put in the hands of consumer it is still an invention, not an innovation.”
Frankly, I agree with Michel. Many within the industry simply do not know what “innovation” means. Of course, her definition of innovation is completely wrong.
Merriam-Webster’s dictionary defines innovation in this way: “1: the introduction of something new; 2: a new idea, method, or device: novelty.” Thus, it is rather clear that Michel and those from big-tech who rail against patent trolls are the ones who are misrepresenting and misleading with respect to the true definition of “innovation.”
Innovation is NOT about products in the hands of consumers. Innovation is about advance. Under her definition of the term innovation no university researchers innovate, those scientists in Federal Laboratories do not innovate, research and development companies do not innovate, and independent inventors do not innovate. For crying out loud, Thomas Edison would not have been an innovator either based on this definition of innovation. How ridiculous is that? How ridiculous is it to pretend that Edison didn’t innovate, but the companies that licensed his patent rights and took products to market did? This offered definition of innovation strikes me as utter nonsense.
Big tech prefers to define innovation as products, and that is how they can erroneously conclude that patents harm innovation. Patents do not harm innovation. Patents promote innovation because they require disclosure of the invention and explanation of the “something new” so that those who come thereafter can stand on the shoulders of those who have come earlier. Patents provide incentive and we simply would not have as much disclosure without them. Just look at the explosion of patents after the creation of the Federal Circuit. Up until then patents were rarely, if ever, found valid. Once they have a chance in court they are worth pursuing and we get disclosure over closely held trade secrets.
Obviousness standard and its application at the USPTO
Michel explained that obviousness is a problem with the patent system: “The system is supposed to grant patents only on those inventions that are not obvious.”
Because of the limitations of language you are likely to either grant patents that don’t deserve to be issued, leading to what she referred to as false positives. Similarly the limitations of language can cause leading toward false negatives, where those that deserve to be issued are denied.
Hard to argue with this so far, but that is typically the way the argument starts. Put forth something that is unassailably correct and then tweak it a bit more than logically correct. The playbook then typically is to so moral indignation that there is disbelief of what is unassailably true, when in fact the disbelief is associated with what is objectively incorrect. In any event, it is true that when seeking a patent something needs to be unique. As a result sometimes language does betray the underlying innovative reality. This is particularly true with pioneering innovations.
Michel then went on to say that the system tends toward the false positives with respect to software and business methods. She explained that a lot of things would happen regardless of whether a patent could be obtained. She claimed that this view of the universe is supported by Graham v. John Deere, or at least the interpretation of that case by Professor Duffy, who she cites..
You may recall that there was great interest in covered business method post grant review, which was a part of the America Invents Act (AIA). This gives those charged with infringing business method patents an avenue to utilize post grant review proceedings at the USPTO. Since it became available on September 16, 2012, only 15 such proceedings have been initiated according to the USPTO during the first six months. That is a telling statistic! These patents are such an overwhelming problem that the industry simply ignores the vehicle they demanded to challenge them at the USPTO? Must not be such a big problem after all!
Those who represent innovators in this space know that over the past 8 to 10 years things have considerably tightened at the USPTO, particularly during the majority of the Bush Administration. Bad software and business method patents were issued during the Clinton Administration, then during the Bush Administration little was issued, which was a problem in and of itself because innovation was being buried for fear of a single bad patent issuing. That did tremendous damage to our high-tech economy that became most apparent after the financial crash in 2008. Now during the Obama Administration we are somewhere in between, with good patents issuing, bad applications being denied.
Still, not all is a tale of roses and golden eggs at the USPTO. Take for example Art Unit 3689, which has an abysmal allowance rate of just over 6% according to statistics accessible through the PatentAdvisor system. See also Allowance Rates for Art Units Examining Business Methods. Those who are saying that today patents are being handed out on bad patent applications and non-inventions in the business method and software space are either grossly misinformed or they are lying.
Of course, whether something would have happened eventually even without a patent is not a part of the patent inquiry. Frankly, it cannot be a part of the patent inquiry because this slippery slope would render everything unpatentable. Anything and everything can be said to be eventually inevitable. The question the system asks is whether the invention is new, non-obvious and adequately described. Patents are about incentive, and the fact that eventually innovations would be made is anathama to the system. The Constitutional foundation for the patent system is to benefit society as early as possible through the dissemination of information and the advance of science and innovation as quickly as possible. That is why in the words of Thomas Jefferson we tolerate the embarrassment of a monopoly for a limited time.
Why the patent system leans toward false positives
Michel explained that the patent system leans toward false positives because there is a belief that there is little harm in doing so, citing Judge Rich’s language explaining that the marketplace will justify and check because no one will want to pay for bogus patents.
This was described as a theory, and only a theory. Indeed, a theory that is not true. In fact, I couldn’t disagree more. Patent detractors love to pretend that they are victims of the patent system and patents need to be curtailed. The trouble is that Google and other big tech companies have their own patents and simply want to prevent others from obtaining patents.
Google and other big tech companies know how they achieved their dominance and it was thanks to innovation that became protected by patents. The ire of Google and the rest of those who are being plagued by bad lawsuits – nuisance value lawsuits – should be directed to the district courts. The district courts have the tools at their disposal to ferret out shakedown, extortion-style, nuisance value lawsuits that are a very real problem for the industry. These tools, such as Rule 11 sanctions are not used primarily because the legal system is not predisposed to believe that litigants (i.e., patent plaintiffs) are engaging in nefarious, nearly criminal activity by seeking to shake down defendants.
Rather than seeking to solve the problem Google and others would prefer that USPTO to stop issuing software and business method patents. Unfortunately, the law is written so that patentees are presumed to be entitled to receive a patent. There is great divergence of allowance rates at the USPTO, and to pretend otherwise is ridiculous. Some patent examiners openly tell patent attorneys that they don’t issue patents because their supervisors won’t allow them to issue patents.
Patent litigation is the root of the problem
Michel stated that increased patent litigation does not promote innovation, but rather distracts from innovation.
That sounds good, but my problem with it is that like so much else she said it is provably false. History is replete with so-called patent wars and so-called patent thickets. In each case these patent thickets and patent wars were the precursor to stunning, sudden and stark leaps in the advancement of technology. So if we are going to concern ourselves with factual reality then we should rely on facts, not sound-bytes that play well on Capitol Hill or in the media.
This often proffered and seemingly logical position that litigation is the problem simply does not hold water. Indeed, the patent system is practically designed from the top down in order to promote patent thickets as market participants race to dominate the marketplace and win as the sole standing company that has the ability to exclude all others. That never happens though and the thicket ultimately forces industry collaboration, which leads to explosive, paradigm shifting technological innovation.
Google’s problem is they are forced to sell patents to Patent Trolls!?!?
During the question and answer segment I asked several questions, specifically dealing with the industry causing their own problems because they settle for nuisance value, thereby making the trolling business model extremely profitable and without any risk. Michel stated that Google doesn’t settle these cases.
She also indicated that a problem Google and others have is that they “have to” get so many patents and can’t afford to keep them so they are practically forced to sell them to NPEs and then they wind up getting sued on those patents.
I can’t speak to whether Google settles patent litigation for nuisance value, but everyone knows that big-tech, small-tech and really, really small tech, settle with patent trolls who are bad actors engaging in extortion-like behavior. Very few companies fight to win. The overwhelming majority fight until a small demand (maybe $25,000 to $50,000) is made. Then those who would fight to the death to prove a point simply ask “who do I write the check out to?”
Settling nuisance value perpetuates the cycle, as the automobile industry discovered in the 1980s and early 1990s. Show a willingness to pay extortion-like demands and you will see more lawsuits filed. It is an endless cycle, at least until it gets broken. The solution is an easy one — fight at least occasionally, or at least one! Because the easy solution isn’t pursued and instead the industry pursues a strategy akin to a Buck during deer hunting season I have to assume that they really don’t want a solution. What other conclusion can you reach when intelligent people ignore the obvious?
It is almost surreal, but defendants settle nuisance cases without any merit and then drag legitimate lawsuits out as long as possible, challenge rights in as many forums as possible and litigate, re-litigate and re-re-litigate the same issues over and over in every possible forum. How utterly and completely ridiculous. In what universe does it make sense to reward bad actors with riches and deny innovators a reasonable royalty? Welcome to the wonderful world of big-tech logic!
In terms of being forced to sell to those who then sue, all I can say is: WOW! If this isn’t a problem that Google and other big-tech companies can’t figure out I don’t know what to say. I am nearly speechless. Obviously one solution is to simply not sell. Another obvious solution is to sell but keep a license for yourself. Still another solution is to sell but prior to selling grant a consortium a license. If the best and brightest legal minds in big-tech can’t figure that problem out then they need different legal representation. Feel free to give me a call. I can tell you how to solve this and other problems you face. I’ve made that offer numerous times and it is never taken. It never will be taken either because they aren’t interested in solutions. They are interested in perpetuating the problem to achieve their ultimate long term goal, which is a radical redefining of the patent system.
Finally I agree with something!
Michel said: “It is ridiculous to think the AIA solved the problems we are talking about.”
AMEN! The AIA just changes the law, but solves no problems. In fact, it actually encourages more patent lawsuits to be filed because of the anti-joinder provisions. So if you don’t like the steep increase in patent filings you really need to lay the blame squarely at the feet of Congress. See The AIA Explains the Recent Rise in Patent Litigation. This is the system they designed and it is working exactly as designed, albeit it not as intended. But this type of unintended consequence really is the hallmark of Congressional involvement, which is a sad commentary in and of itself.

Excellent job, Gene! I agree with you on virtually every point. The anti-patent trollers are simply disingenuous. They remind me of a rich man’s club being forced to allow poor women to join. There shall be no cross-licensing here anymore;)
Great article. Truth is always better than fiction.
Now how can we get it read and taped to the foreheads of everyone in Congress, the Senate, and the President?
Whether they like it or not.
Gene,
This is a case where you & I will have to agree to disagree. 🙂
I’m talking about the definition of “innovation”.
It is not the same as that of “invention”.
That is why two different words are used for the two separate concepts.
There is no “invent” inside of “innovation”.
The fact that something has been done before does not take the “new” out of In-new-vation.
In each case the question is: “new” from the point of view of whom?
Innovation is the case where it is “new” from the point of view of the buyer (caveat emptor not).
Invention is the case where it is “new” (and nonobvious, and useful) from the point of view of the person having ordinary skill in the art.
Gene –
Not all of big tech struggles with the issue of being “forced to sell” to those who sue. I suspect strongly that Google retains a license to the patents it sells. Suzanne is probably just unaware of this.
What is clear however is that Google doesn’t like the fact that it has to buy patents – but that was the inevitable by-product of following Apple and MS into the mobile OS space without doing the development and getting the patents themselves…..as I noted in my recent post on your site
Some readers are likely to now say – sure competition is good for innovation but why should the company pursuing the all open business model (Google for example) need to acquire patents to defend itself against its proprietary rivals? It’s a fair question, but consider the fact that Google entered the market after Microsoft and Apple who had invested heavily in mobile computing R&D for years before Google set its sights on that market. Consider also that Google was nonetheless able to enter the market and secure a leadership position in just five years. Google did not have to make the investments in R&D that Microsoft or Apple made building their proprietary OS. Instead, they purchased an open source OS and got third party hardware companies to make compatible handsets, and shortly thereafter they were competitive. The flip side of this rapid market entry is that Google did not have patents in the mobile computing area because they did not do R&D in the area. It is only rational that the incumbents would seek to defend their market position against a highly competitive newcomer that lacks patents by leveraging their patents . Their patents are the by-products of their R&D investment that was their cost of entry to the market. If firms like Apple and Microsoft did not react this way anyone could enter a market by simply copying the innovations of the incumbents, and since they would have no need to cover the cost of that R&D, it would be trivial to sell at lower prices and drive the incumbents from the market. Except there wouldn’t be any incumbents. Aware of this inevitable outcome, rational companies would not make the investment in R&D needed to create an innovative platform, only to be undercut and eliminated by copyists. So the system as it now stands enables competition between the original first moving innovator and the agile fast follower and patents help balance the equation.
Lots of thoughts arise; let me share a couple.
Fighting over the definition of innovation seems like sophistry; the question is, does the patent system overall help new things get to folks? It does when it works right. Abe Lincoln said something like “patents add the fuel of interest to the fire of genius.” What he was getting at over 150 years ago was that patent incent not only inventors but also their financial backers. The problems arise when the financial backers, instead of opting to ally themselves with the inventors to take advantage of the situation that Lincoln praised, choose to deny the inventors their share. That is what those like Google are doing.
Google certainly innovates, by either of your definitions. But instead of rely on patents, they opt for trade secret, copyright, contract rights and sheer market dominance to maintain their competitive edge. Shunning the patent-protected inventors, they become enemies.
The claim that Google has to pay patent trolls that they sold patents to is incredible! Frankly, Gene, it is so goofy that I have to assume you heard her wrong. First the claim that the megarich Google can’t afford to maintain it issued patents is stupefying. Second, the notion that they don’t have the good sense to dedicate them to the public by not paying maintenance fees (or even earlier in the process lettingthe application get published and then abanddoning) is equally stupefying. If that situation accurately exemplifies the state of their understanding of the patent system then everyone should know to ignore them as idiots.
Gene had inquired as to my writing an article for this blog and while still immensely busy (even after the AIA critical date), I have to laugh, as this article could very well have been lifted from my mind, thought for thought, and would be an article that I would have been proud to write.
Well done, Gene.
According to Google’s own search engine, “Google” is listed as assignee on over 9,000 patent documents. Can this be?
Well, USPTO says: “Results of Search in US Patent Collection db for:
AN/Google: 2655 patents.
Hits 1 through 50 out of 2655”
AND
“Results of Search in PGPUB Full-Text Database for:
AN/Google: 1859 applications.
Hits 1 through 50 out of 1859”
Tom,
You should be aware that the data sets between the patent search and publication search often have overlap.
Anon,
You should also be aware that the Google search results include patents and applications both inside the US and in other countries with a lot of overlap. Still hard to count nearly 10,000 patent documents listing Google as assignee.
.”
Gene I very much agree with your frustration. The people who state that the Patent Office makes it easy to get a software patent today never: (1) have ever tried to obtain a software patent and/or (2) provide no significant evidence supporting their arguments that obtaining a software patent is easy.
Tom,
No need for sarcasm from you – your post at 9 incidates the search forum was the USPTO, and I was attempting to be helpful. There is nothinig in my post to indicate that any statement of mine needed clarification – as I had made no such statement regarding searching on Google.
Anon,
I was referring to post #8.
Tom,
I was not.
Clearly.
@American Cowboy at comment #6
Fighting over the definition of “innovation” is not sophistry.
The definition is the reason why those who say patents “stifle” innovation are correct.
It is why they can keep saying it with a straight face.
And the fact that Gene does not appreciate the fine point difference between invention and “innovation” is the reason that he gets so bent out of shape each time one of those people correctly say that, in general, patents stifle “innovation”.
Let’s go one step further on my comment #16:
Say a lone wolf inventor in his garage comes up with a new (nonobvious and useful) software concept.
However he does not have the finances, manpower, etc. to advertise it, implement it on a mass scale basis and move it into the hands of the general public as quickly and efficiently as, say Microsoft (with no intention here to give MS a bad name).
“Innovation” is about the final act of moving it en mass into the hands of the general public.
So if the lone wolf inventor gets a patent that blocks MS from copying and quickly moving the general-public-usable version of the concept into the hands of the general public then the patent “does” stifle “innovation”.
Not sophistry.
Truth.
And accuracy of definition; which is very important to proper communication when two people use a word but not in the same way.
So “innovation” means taking (stealing?) someone else’s “invention” and making a lot of money with it in the market?
“So if the lone wolf inventor gets a patent that blocks MS from copying and quickly moving the general-public-usable version of the concept into the hands of the general public then the patent “does” stifle “innovation”.”
I don’t see any trolls seeking injunctions, just a reasonable royalty. That is not blocking MS, just asking MS to pay for what it took.
Step back, there is a very significant fact that you omitted in the statement of facts in your hypothetical: The lone wolf contacted MS to offer to to license the invention. And, like many other big companies, MS asked the inventor to sign as so-called Non-disclosure agreement that in fact allows MS to use the invention without paying the inventor or alternatively go pound sand. Then when they use the invention they scream bloody murder because their victim objected.
@Tom at comment #18
No.
“Innovation” means that the general public which receives something “they” perceive as being “new”, improved and not like your father’s Chevrolet doesn’t care where it came from, or how it came into being or whether it is truly novel in a patent sense.
All that counts is that they (the consuming public) receive and they consume (generally in mass quantities).
“Pet rocks” was an innovation even though it was just a rock in a box.
Your new new, all improved model 2013 automobile is an “innovation” although it is 4 wheels, a motor and some other frills.
Innovation and invention are not the same thing.
One (not small) problem step back is that you too misuse the word “innovation.”
In its pure form, innovation has strictly and absolutely ZERO to do with anything in the consumer’s hands.
Quite alarmingly the very antithesis of your “all that counts.”
OK Anon. Now we seem to be progressing to some place.
1) What definition do you ascribe to “innovation”?
2) What definition do you ascribe to “invention”?
Marc-
Excellent points.
My first thought is that Google is being penny wise and pound foolish about their seemingly anti-patent position.
Like you, I can’t imagine that the smart folks at Google don’t take licenses back. We know that is standard operating procedures and either they are doing that or they should be doing that. More problematic is that a senior attorney who is in Google’s policy shop in DC is out and around town explaining that Google is forced to sell patents and then have them enforced against them later. This sways public opinion, but more importantly sways decision-makers on Capitol Hill. Perhaps she doesn’t know what is going on, but it strikes me as just as harmful, which is why I wanted to expose that for all to see.
Perhaps Google is upset about needing so many patents. I must confess that I hadn’t considered that. It seems that they really got quite a bargain, so I couldn’t imagine anyone being upset. If you want to buy your way into a field where you did no innovation buying patents and having a massive patent portfolio is what you need. Did they really expect Apple to roll over? Did they miscalculate?
Cheers.
-Gene
Tom-
You ask: “So “innovation” means taking (stealing?) someone else’s “invention” and making a lot of money with it in the market?”
Apparently so. That seems to be the view of much of big-tech and many academics.
Of course… not all big-tech companies would agree. I double Apple, Qualcomm, IBM and others that are true innovators agree with this definition of innovation.
-Gene
step back,
Let’s use a standard dictionary. You can even chose one if you like.
Anon,
Not fair. YOU were supposed to bring the definitions to this party.
But as Doc said in the movie, Tombstone; OK, I’ll be your huckleberry.
Here is a citation to a paper that defines one version of the so-called Innovation Pyramid.
It includes the following:
Aesthetic Innovation:
“Is the product easily recognizable?”
Meaning Innovation:
“Can the product be defined as a status-symbol?”
Now it’s your turn Mr. Gunslinger. Shoot away.
Good article, Gene.
Your explanation of the purpose of patents as promoting disclosure is incomplete: most importantly, patents promote investments in R&D pre and post grant, and even after disclosure, to develop and exploit the invention and bring it to market. This leads me to Step Back’s comment that “patents ‘stifle’ innovation.” This statement is meaningless. Regardless of how one defines “innovation,” the question is what innovations and who’s innovations are stifled. Fighting about the exact meaning of the term is a red herring and the term “true innovation” is unhelpful here.
Technically, Step Back may be correct for certain innovations – those by unlicensed infringers. But that is precisely the purpose of the patent right to exclude – to stifle innovation by free-loader infringers. Had the Framers been merely interested in disclosure and uncoordinated exploitation of inventions and thought that the exclusive right “stifles” the progress of the useful arts, they may well have been satisfied writing in the Constitution that “Congress shall have the power … to provide just and fair remuneration to inventors for their discoveries” – resulting in compulsory licensing statutes. But they did not; they provided the right to exclude for good reason, knowing human nature and commercial realities. The right to exclude reduces the risk for investors in disruptive inventions that may threaten powerful market incumbents. The exclusive right affords “unfair” profits on investments that might not have been made but for such exclusivity. The exclusive right certainly coordinates innovation – encourages innovation by the inventor and its licensees, discourages infringing innovation by non licensees, and encourages design-around innovation.
So yes, Step Back, patents do ‘stifle’ innovation, but not the kind that our Framers had in mind – not the kind that promote the progress of the useful arts.
“… innovation, but not the kind that our Framers had in mind …”
Ron,
You seem to have been caught up by the mind meld.
Our Framers did not know about this new fangled word, in-no-va-tion.
Had you been paying attention –and this is something that I had been warning Dale Halling about for years– there has been a concerted effort (and dare I say a successful effort) to remove the word “invention” from the public discourse and to replace it with “innovation”.
This effort has been so successful that even pro-inventor people like you Ron and like Gene have fallen prey to the gimmick.
It’s time to say NO to inNOvation and to insist that our public leaders return to the words that our framing fathers used, inventors and discoverers.
Inventors and dis-coverers (those who take the cover off, who un-cover) help to promote the progress of science and the useful arts because they reveal to the public (dis-cover) how to make and use new and useful things.
Flim flam artists try to get everyone to speak in terms of inNOvation.
These are tricksters who want to make sure the word “invent” (and the concept of the “inventor”) drop out of the public discourse.
As far as they are concerned, the individual inventor no longer exists. He or she has been replaced by a nebulous concept, by innovation, by that which flows smoothly over the mouths of public officials as they proceed to dismantle the American patent system and to replace it with a harm-onized apparatus that robs inventors and dis-coverers of that which our Framing Fathers thought was their just and rightful compensation. That compensation includes public adulation; recognizing the inventors by name and by deed: Fulton, Edison, Bell, Wright and so on; elevating their status in society.
In our “modern” society it is the corporation (you know, the invisible thing that has a right to vote, that replaces individual human beings) which is the thing that “innovates” –even if it keeps as trade secrets that which our Founding Fathers thought it prudent to place out there in the public arena, which is why they instituted the patent system in the first place —to secure “for limited Times to [people called] Authors and [to people called] Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Dis-coveries;”
See
step back,
I think you missed the point of my comments: a standard dictionary.
When you start playing cute and going to some Pyramid, well, then, the point about sophistry is made in spades.
You have lost the argument by your own doing.
Gene, just one small quibble re your conclusions drawn from:
“..covered business method post grant review .. Since it became available on September 16, 2012, only 15 such proceedings have been initiated according to the USPTO during the first six months.”
Yes, that is a lot smaller number than the number of patent lawsuits on business method claims. But I think it’s ultimate usage may be too soon to predict accurately. Historically there was also a long slow build-up over several years in the usage of reexaminations. This is a very conservative profession, and many clients are also afraid of trying anything new, Some D.C. litigators are not anxious to give up litigation billings to enter into a new PTO trial system that only interference practitioners will readily understand, Nor are the advantages of this new procedure, as compared to regular PGR, or an PR, widely understood.
I think Step Back makes some important point about inNOvation. I think this nonsense was started by Joseph Schumpter and it was done to build up the importance of non-inventors in business (Finance, accounting, management, marketing). For more see my post
Somewhere around 2008 the word “innovation” took off (upward use in the news) while “inventor” and “invention” dwindled
(You can play around with the parameters, e.g. what kind of news, what country, regional interest over time for each tabbed term, etc.)
Step back that is amazing. Is there anyway to go back farther in time?
I have often thought that the “crazy inventor” image was purposely created for a political purpose. Think of any movie and the inventor is always crazy and always creating Rube Goldberg devices with no practical use. The campaign has been successful in getting inventors not to call themselves inventors. Instead they generally want to refer to their technical expertise. I think that this probably started somewhere between 1900 and the 1930s. Clearly, during Edison’s day inventors were not considered crazy or impractical, they were celebrated. I think the “crazy inventor” image was an attack on the individual and was picked up by the anti-trust crowd and big business. For instance, Edwin Armstrong I bet was portrayed as a crazy inventor by RCA.
Dale,
I’m not skilled in working the Google Trends tool.
I tried but was not able to go back to earlier than the date range they provide.
Also it was interesting to play with their geographic predominance tool and their ‘type of news” (i.e. government/law) options.
You may think I’m a “crazy” conspiracy theory nut in seeing the build up of the campaign to replace inventor and invention with “innovation”. But now you see it too through your own lying eyes (–a take from comedian Richard Pryor’s line, who ya gonna believe, your lying eyes or me?)
Think of any movie?
OK:
The Nutty Professor and his “invention” of Flubber
Doc Brown in Back to the Future parts 1, 2, 3
Fulton’s Folly (before the movies were invented)
First they laugh at you, then they attack you, then they steal your ideas and say they did it first.
Step back,
I don’t think you are a conspiracy nut -the people who start these trends know what they are doing. For example, the phrase “Give Back.” It sounds so nice and no one thinks about the implications. But the logical implication of Give Back is that you TOOK FROM – it’s no longer charity. You are thief and just giving back what you took that was not yours in the first place. The people who started that phrase knew exactly what they were doing, but the sheeple think it is innocent and subconsciously cannot escape the logical implications.
“The people who started that phrase knew exactly what they were doing”
Which leads full circle back to the idea that “innovation” is a sophists trick.
There is a war going on – and one (very active) front in that war is exactly how the issues are being framed.
Annon,
Well said.
Too many people pooh pooh the power of words.
They fail to comprehend that there are armies of sophisticated think tankers out there playing with different combinations of noises (i.e. words, music, snorts, chortles and grunts) looking for the right combination to move the masses (or sheeple as Dale calls them) one way or the other.
“Innovation” is merely one example.
(And by the way, it is not a ‘sophist trick’. It is neuroscience. It is the stuff that modern elections are made of. Here’s hope, change and ‘Yankee ingenuity’ looking at you kid. Play it again Sam. You know, that old Goebell’s mind your mind tune. Thanks.)
The Power of Love (no, wrong song, … of words:)
step back,
With all due respect, the word “sophist” (and thus “sophist trick”) is particularly apt.
I am not sure why you seem bent on not using the word.
A couple more terms that might show interesting results:
Mindshare
Court of public opinion, and of course,
Troll
Anon,
Good idea.
Here is “patent troll” versus “innovation” but limited to news in the category of law and government:
The End of “American” Innovation?

source=In May of 2021, the CDC significantly relaxed the guidelines and guidance for individuals who have been fully vaccinated. However, given the increase in number of cases and spreading of the Delta variant, the CDC has revised its guidance. This guidance will impact workplaces and provide more streamlined protocols for promoting a safe working environment. As a note, CDC guidance is not mandatory and consists of recommendations for the health and safety of individuals. However, employer compliance with these recommendations helps the business meet its obligations under OSHA’s general duty clause, which requires businesses provide a safe workplace for employees. The revised guidance reiterates guidelines from the previous iterations, stating that fully vaccinated individuals (two weeks after the final dose of the vaccine) may: Engage in activities done prior to the pandemic; If traveling in the United States, have no requirement to get tested before or after travel or to self-quarantine after travel; Wear a mask when traveling on buses, planes, trains, and other forms of public transportation; If traveling internationally, should get tested 3 days before return to the United States and 3-5 days after a trip; Continue to be vigilant and watch out for symptoms of COVID-19, especially if you have been around someone who is sick. New guidance for fully-vaccinated individuals includes: Wear a mask in public indoor settings if they are in an area of substantial or high transmission. This includes much of the country, as indicated on this CDC map. The CDC does not specifically define “public indoor settings”; however, it can be interpreted to mean internal common areas or anywhere the public has access. Choose to mask regardless of the level of transmission, especially if they or someone in their household is immunocompromised or at risk for severe disease, or if someone in their household is unvaccinated. Get tested 3-5 days after a known exposure to someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and wear a mask in public indoor settings for 14 days after exposure or until a negative test result is obtained. The latest CDC guidance does not make reference to workplace mandates. However, it is important to check what state/local mandates are in your area. The following are suggestions, consistent with latest CDC guidance, that employers can follow to keep workplaces safe and employees healthy: Since most workplaces have a mix of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, CDC recommends that all employees, as well as vendors, clients or other visitors, be masked regardless of vaccination status in areas of high or substantial transmission. In low or moderate transmission or non-public workspaces, vaccinated employees need not wear masks but unvaccinated employees should continue to maintain all COVID-19 protocols. If fully vaccinated employees wish to eat together, they can be permitted to do so. Unvaccinated colleagues could join them, but it is recommended that those individuals continue to observe social distancing and wear a mask. Employers may allow fully-vaccinated employees to resume business travel, both domestic and international. Employers should continue to try and minimize any required travel for unvaccinated employees. Because the vaccine does not provide 100% protection, some vaccinated employees will still get COVID-19. If this happens, the employee should isolate in accordance with CDC’s guidelines, seek a medical evaluation, and be tested. Those who test positive should isolate, and employees with symptoms who have tested positive may be able to work remotely or may need leave. Reasonable accommodations should still be explored for employees who communicate a religious or disability-related need to not be vaccinated. The updated guidance also notes that the FDA has granted full approval for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, and the CDC will release additional guidance given this approval after August 30, 2021. Please contact your employment counsel for any questions regarding the updated CDC guidance and workplace safety standards during the time of COVID-19.The most amazing museum of mosaics in the world can be found in Tunis, in the former Bey palace, the Bardo, comprehensively renovated and extended in 2012. This museum houses a unique collection of Roman antiques. Take the time to marvel at the countless masterpieces of Tunisia’s mosaic artists, who were the most renowned in the Roman world.
Still in Tunis, visit the Sidi Qacem Jellizi ceramics museum, dedicated to a 15th century master ceramicist, and the Museum of Popular Art and Traditions, housed in the Palace of Dar Ben Abdallah. In Carthage, the archaeological museum boasts some really exceptional exhibits, including a sculpted sarcophagus and a small statue of the god, Baal. Depending on your particular area of interest, you can choose between Carthage’s Oceanographic Museum and the museum of musical instruments in Ennejma Ezzahra, in Sidi Bou Said.
In the North West of the country, the modern Chemtou Museum offers lots of information about Numidia, an ancient indigenous civilisation that flourished alongside Carthage (and is actually home to the remains of a temple dedicated to the Numidian King, Massinissa). The Museum of Popular Art and Traditions in Kef is housed in a stunning 18th century religious building. It is a mine of information about the equestrian tradition, clothing and jewellery from the North West and life in Bedouin tents.
In Kairouan, the Raqqada Museum presents some incredibly valuable medieval pieces, including lustre-glazed ceramics and manuscripts such as the famous Blue Qur’an.
Sousse boasts a first-rate archaeological museum with some exceptional Roman mosaics. Also worth visiting are the reconstruction of a Roman villa in El Djem and the museums of Popular Art and Traditions in Sousse, Monastir and Mahdia.
In Sfax, the former Kasbah is now a museum dedicated to historic architecture; the Dar Jallouli Palace is an understated, majestic 17th century house, where you’ll find beautiful objects that once graced the homes of well-to-do families. In Djerba, the Traditional Heritage Museum is dedicated to different aspects of life on the island (clothes, pottery, agriculture, fishing), while the Guellala Museum focuses on scenes from traditional life.Hayley Pettit

Cat flu or upper respiratory tract infection (URI) may be a quite common disease that will vary considerably in severity, and on occasions can even be life-threatening.
In the overwhelming majority of cases, disease results from infection with feline calicivirus (FCV) or feline herpes (FHV, or FHV-1). Clinical signs include sneezing, nasal discharge, conjunctivitis (inflammation of the liner of the eyes), ocular discharge, loss of appetite, fever, and depression. Mouth ulcers, coughing, excessive drooling of saliva, and eye ulcers can also be seen. Very young, very old, and immunosuppressed cats are more likely to develop severe disease and possibly die as a result of their URI, usually thanks to secondary infections (such as pneumonia), lack of nutrition, and dehydration.
What cats are in danger of URIs?
URIs are common because the causative viruses are widespread in cat populations. Typical risk factors include:
Cats kept in large groups or colonies like breeding catteries, rescue centers, and feral cat colonies – in these situations the viruses are ready to spread easily
Elderly and immunosuppressed cats (e.g., cats with FeLV or FIV infection, or cats receiving immunosuppressive therapy) are more susceptible to developing severe disease
Causes of URIs in cats
Most cat URIs are caused by infection with one or both of the cat flu viruses:
Feline herpes (FHV or FHV-1, formerly referred to as feline rhinotracheitis virus)
Feline calicivirus (FCV)
These two viruses are thought to be liable for quite 90% of URIs in cats. Other important organisms which will be involved in some cases include:
Bordetella (may be an explanation for sneezing, nasal discharge and sometimes coughing – important in some colony situations)
Chlamydophila felis (this is especially an explanation for ocular disease – conjunctivitis)
Clinical signs of URI
The period following infection with FCV or FHV is typically just a couple of days (2-10 days). After this, typical clinical signs develop which include:
- Sneezing
- Nasal discharge
- Ocular discharge
- Lethargy
- Inappetence
- Fever
The severity of those signs varies considerably – in some cats, the signs are very mild and transient, in others, they’ll be very marked and severe. There are some differences in clinical presentation between the 2 viruses, but these aren’t sufficient to be ready to distinguish them simply from clinical signs:
FHV infection tends to be more severe, often causing more marked conjunctivitis (eye infection and ocular discharge), and a few ulceration of the cornea (the clear part at the front of the eye). FHV can also cause severe pharyngitis resulting in anorexia; inflammation within the trachea; and coughing.
FCV infection is usually milder, with inapparent or less severe ocular signs, but FCV often causes ulceration of the tongue (and sometimes the palate or the lips). FCV may cause transient arthritis (‘limping syndrome’), usually seen in young kittens, and very young kittens can cause a severe viral infection.
Although FCV and FHV are viral infections, secondary infection with bacteria is common and may contribute to rhinitis (infection within the nose) conjunctivitis, and even lung infections. While most cats will get over URIs, on occasions they will be life-threatening, and with severe infections, the recovery may take several weeks. Some cats can also be left with permanent damage within the nose and should have persistent or recurrent nasal discharge (so-called ‘chronic rhinitis’).
In rare cases, a way more severe and sometimes fatal sort of FCV infection may occur. this is often related to particular strains of the virus that are highly virulent and termed ‘virulent systemic FCV’ (vsFCV) infection. Fortunately, such infections are very rare (see: Feline calicivirus (FCV) infection).
Diagnosis
Diagnosis by your vet is typically supported by the standard signs related to URIs, and exclusion of other causes. it’s possible to verify a diagnosis and to research which virus(es) are involved, but this is often not necessary.
Testing for FCV or FHV involves collecting a mouth or eye swab which is then sent to a specialized veterinary laboratory. Here the virus is often identified through culturing or by a PCR test (a molecular test to point out the presence of the viral genes).
Treatment
Treatment of URIs is essentially symptomatic and supportive. Your vet might want to try some additional tests if they’re concerned about the extent of disease (e.g., the likelihood of pneumonia) or if they’re worried about complications (such as infection with FIV or FeLV).
Antibiotics are indicated to treat secondary bacterial infections and to undertake to scale back the damage the infection causes. If nasal congestion is severe and breathing is difficult your vet can also suggest steam inhalation or nebulization make discharges more liquid and more easily relieved by sneezing.
Interferons are proteins that are produced within the body, partially to assist fight viral infections. Injectable interferons could also be used as a supportive treatment (either high doses of recombinant human interferons or recombinant feline interferon) – there’s some evidence that this might be of benefit, but it probably must tend early within the course of disease for best effect.
There are a variety of topical antiviral agents that will help to manage FHV-associated ocular disease (such as trifluridine, idoxuridine, and cidofovir). More recently a drug wont to treat human herpes infections – famciclovir – is safe and effective in cats when given orally. this is often a serious breakthrough in managing severe FHV infection in cats.
General nursing is additionally essential – discharges from the eyes and nose should be gently wiped away using damp cotton, and therefore the cat should be kept warm and cozy.
Carriers
Most cats that get over infection with URI viruses will become ‘carriers’. Carrier cats usually show no sign of illness but, may shed virus in saliva, tears and nasal secretions, and maybe a source of infection to other cats.
Although most cats infected with FHV will remain long-term carriers, many of those will never shed significant amounts of virus. Others may shed virus intermittently, especially during times of stress. Some cats may show mild signs of URI again once they shed the virus, but most don’t. Carrier cats during a breeding colony are a source of risk to their kittens, because the stress of kittening may induce shedding of FHV.
Most cats infected with FCV remain carriers of the virus, and still shed the virus for weeks or months after infection, but the bulk (although not all) will eventually eliminate the virus within a couple of months.
Spread of infection
cat viruses
The viruses related to URIs are spread in three ways:
Direct contact with an infected cat showing signs of URI
Direct contact with a carrier cat shedding virus
Contact with a virus carried on clothing, food bowls, and other objects. Large amounts of viruses are present within the saliva, tears, and nasal discharges, and therefore the viruses could also be ready to survive within the environment and on objects for up to 2 (FHV) to 10 (FCV) days.
Prevention
Vaccination: the danger of URIs are often dramatically reduced by vaccination against FHV and FCV. These vaccines are important for all cats, regardless of how they’re kept (even if kept indoors) because the diseases are so ubiquitous. Although vaccination usually prevents severe disease development, it cannot always prevent infection occurring then mild disease should develop in some cats. FCV has many various strains, and this will cause further problems with vaccination as vaccines won’t necessarily work against these strains. Newer FCV vaccines contain quite one strain within the vaccine to assist overcome this problem. this is often not a problem with FHV as just one virus strain exists.
Barrier nursing and disinfection: If there’s quite one cat during a household, it’s important to undertake to minimize the danger of infection being spread to the opposite cats. this is often not always possible, but additionally to make sure that each one cat is vaccinated, where possible a cat showing clinical signs should be kept isolated from the opposite cats (e.g., confined to at least one room). Separate food bowls and litter trays should be used, and ideally, the cat should be kept during a room that has very easy to disinfect surfaces (i.e., not soft furnishing and carpet). These viruses are vulnerable to most disinfectants but confirm you ask your vet – some disinfectants (such as phenolic-based products) aren’t safe to use around cats. Hypochlorite (bleach-based) disinfectants (eg, 5% bleach diluted 1:32) are effective against these viruses, but lookout to use any disinfectant carefully – most are irritant to cats if they are available into direct contact with the disinfectant cat litter.

This is one of the iconic places on the outskirts of the pink city, Jaipur Rajasthan India. If you are going to this place on a cycle, you better be fit and healthy. The incline is steep and even in the low gears to conquer this incline, you will have to sweat a lot.
In case you need more understanding of gear shifting on cycle, read my post under the category cycling.
I hate waking up early in the morning, especially in winters. It’s less than 10 degrees in Jaipur these days. Winter is in full swing, with temperatures going down as less as 5 degrees in the morning at some places in Jaipur.
“I have been to Chulgiri Digamber Jain Temple before and it was fun then, well what has changed now?”
The rules have become strict now, than ever before. We were advised to keep our cameras inside and not to click any pictures because few young guns fell while taking a selfie some weeks back. You cant even click pictures with our cellphones on the way to the temple.
“I mean really? This is exactly what happened”
I got up at 5:30 AM as we had to assemble at our meeting point. Three riders joined me at an iconic place of Jaipur, Birla Temple. My friends Saurabh, Nimit & Shreyansh, were all excited to be on top of Chulgiri hill. Primarily because Saurabh and Shreyansh were cycling Chulgiri Digamber Jain Temple for the first time, whereas I and Nimit have done Chulgiri hill ride a few times before.
Route To Chulgiri Digamber Jain Temple
We took JLN road and took a right turn from Trimurti circle and went riding via raja park and transport Nagar. Most of the way till “Ghat Ki Gunni” tunnel is inclined, which is a good workout flat road. From the tunnel, it’s quick decline, and all you have to do is sit on your bikes and enjoy. This leaves you right at the foothills of Chulgiri Digamber Jain Temple mountain.
The Way Up
The way up is unforgiving, I mean cyclists with little or no experience have no chance of riding to the top of this hill. Even average cyclists have to stop and then catch their breath and then move further. This is because the incline of Chulgiri Digamber Jain Temple hill is very steep. This is by far the steepest ride trail I have seen in and around Jaipur city. You would be surprised to know that the length of this stretch is only 2 KM from the Jaipur Agra highway.
STRAVA Details
Now there are two segments on this hill. The Chulgiri climb and the Chulgiri downhill.
I am also including specific details for these two segments, so the professional riders are aware of more specific terrain details.
Chulgiri Climb
Chulgiri Downhill
Inside Chulgiri Digamber Jain Temple
Now let me tell you the temple is beautiful.
Surrounded by Aravali hills, this place is literally door to heaven during the morning. In the year 1953 is entitled as the start of the Jain sanctuary on the slopes of Aravalli. Jain Acharya Shri Desh Bhoosan Ji Maharaj picked the Aravalli slopes for building the Jain sanctuary and named the slopes as ‘Chulgiri’ Building the Jain sanctuary in the Aravalli slopes was the best test before Jain Acharya Ji, yet as is commonly said, nothing can be fixed if the soul is valid.
“Note: In case you are wondering how did I manage to get the images for this place clicked, these images are from my previous trips when the picture clicking culture was still there”

Chulgiri Digamber Jain Temple On My Youtube Channel
I made a lot of videos before, some raw some edited. These days it is very difficult to make videos or click pictures as the security is too tough, for some not very logical reasons. However not commenting anything on it though. However, I made a video of my past Chulgiri trip which was uploaded to my YouTube Channel. Watch here and share if you like.

He is known for his leadership roles at Volkswagen Group China, Omnicom, and Wunderman, to name a few. He is also the founder of MTM, the global marketing, and communications holdings firm. Like other leaders, Alexei Orlov was among those who confronted the difficult task of adapting their businesses to the disruptive pandemic that hit the USA by way of Europe in early March 2020.
Alexei Orlov and the Great Pandemic
After the coronavirus swept through the USA, many were stripped from their daily routines, and businesses closed down to prevent the further spread of the novel virus. However, while some companies were unfortunately swept under due to their inability to open and create revenue during 2020. Most of these companies never got back, while others have held strong, pulling various strands to remain in business. The new market has also opened opportunities for brands to adapt, pivot, and through a series of major changes, see exponential growth in a year where it was not thought possible.
Alexei Orlov and his team at MTM took the challenge the pandemic offered and met it with excitement and grace. Orlov’s success through some of the darkest months in world history is precisely the reason we should all explore Alexei Orlov’s unique recipe for economic and brand-activated and overall success through the pandemic.
Leadership
At the beginning of the pandemic, where many businesses were shuddering immediately, Alexei Orlov saw the change in the world as a growth opportunity for MTM. Thankfully, Orlov could rely on his professional leadership experience and took the initiative to inspire his clients and his team to be leaders in this scary time. Alexei urged his colleagues to act more deliberately and make solid, specific choices, encouraging them to find new ways to progress and expand despite the state of the world. He called on his team to be leaders in exploring avenues and thoughtful connections that could boost brand authenticity for each client, but also for MTM.
Leadership has always been integral to the success of any company, but the pandemic meant it was even more critical for survival. Many employees were left without a routine and ended up doing more work with less impact. To combat this, Alexei urged everyone to assess their tasks and log everything they did. He then asked them to review the activities and find those that can wait, and reinvest the time in pursuing other important connections. The self-reflection proved useful as employees grew more aware of their extraneous involvements, and were able to refocus their energy and time into more meaningful moments.
Strategy
Alexei Orlov is a master strategist and has proven this during his leadership roles across 50 companies. Over the years, he has watched countless strategies play out with various objectives and believes having a strategy is most crucial for surviving the abrupt challenges brought by the pandemic. As a decorated creative strategist, Alexei could sense the opportunity to grow MTM in the face of uncertainty and was clear in his vision. Since everyone was battered, he needed a well-thought strategy that’s simple to implement and follow through on.
Alexei was all about eliminating the hard work and creating time to connect and reconnect with colleagues, employees, brand executives, and other stakeholders. According to him, the pandemic left us with nothing but time to strategize for the next move as everything happened suddenly. He urged MTM and other companies within the “under 2.5 years old” bracket to prioritize authentic connections, including person to person, brands to their customers, and B2B. Alexei Orlov’s strategy was to maintain the connections and use the extra time to adapt to the new world.
Objectivity
Objectivity is another vital ingredient in Alexei Orlov’s professional success and is seamlessly intertwined with leadership. Orlov has enjoyed success when he is objective about all steps. Objectivity was in high demand amid the pandemic, where resources drastically dropped. There was no room for waste, which is why Alexei petitioned everyone to root out extraneous habits. The goal was clear; to survive and thrive, but it is easier said than done. With no proven success formula for surviving COVID-19, Orlov and other leaders had to be objective about all decisions.
The first step was to analyze the situation and come up with a strategy. Next, members needed to evolve into leaders who can act deliberately and make vital decisions. More importantly, the team needed to adhere to professional standards to create brand authenticity in the wake of collapsing routines and interactions. This objectivity helped MTM, and its brands excel and gain more clients when others were crumbling.
Refinement
The long pandemic night called for refinement in every sense of the word. Business processes were interrupted, and previously efficient frameworks were no longer feasible. Managers and leaders had to ensure all processes are refined to eliminate redundancy, resource waste, and inconsistencies. Once the goals are clear, strategies need fine-tuning and constant evaluation to move in the right direction. Orlov led the way and called on his counterparts and employees to do the same by establishing a connection that maintained professionalism outside the usual workplace.
Refining the routines and business processes also made it easier for employees to perform their job and eliminated extraneous activities. The model was efficient, enabling everyone to do much less yet achieve more and better results. This refinement also made it easier to evolve the business process to accommodate new requirements. For Alexei and his team, the goal was to excel under the circumstances rather than waiting for things to get better. After all, the pandemic left no assurance for the future, so surviving the storm was the fundamental objective.
Alexei Orlov Creates Magic with the Right Ingredients
For Alexei Orlov, these are a few of the ingredients used to ensure that he, his teammates, and his MTM clients weathered the critical moments of 2020 with a sense of focused, forward progress.
Alexei Orlov is constantly looking for ways to improve with creative strategies born out of necessity. When the pandemic hit the world, he went to his home in Connecticut and assessed the situation based on his experience. He strategized and led his team, learning and adapting through the process. He has helped more than 160 clients sustain their brands through uncertain times and ensured 2020 was the most profitable year for MTM. 2021 is set to be even better, and he continues to explore new connections to expand his business and help other companies do the same.

Prix de la SSC pour l'impact du travail appliqué et collaboratif
2011
At its Annual Meeting held in Wolfville, NS, June 12-15, the Statistical Society of Canada announced that Francis Zwiers is the 2011.
This year the award is presented to Francis Zwiers
“in recognition of his pioneering research at the intersection of climate science and statistics; for his fundamental contributions to the development of statistical methods for climate studies; for his national and international achievements in climate science; and for his outstanding record of public service.”
Born on April 21, 1951 in Steenwijk in the Dutch province of Overijssel, The Netherlands, Francis emigrated to Canada with his parents in 1956. He obtained a B.Math. in statistics and computer science from University of Waterloo in 1974. He then moved east for graduate studies, earning a M.Sc. in sampling theory from Acadia University in 1976 and a Ph.D. in time series analysis from Dalhousie University in 1980.
Environment Canada, the main home for his professional life, provided great opportunities for research, administrative and mentoring work. From 1984 to 2006 he worked as a research scientist in its Climate Research Division, climbing the ranks from level RES-02 to RES-05. Francis was Acting Chief (2000-01) and Chief (2001-06) of the Canadian Centre for Climate Modeling and Analysis of the Climate Research Division. He also served as Director (2006-10) of the Climate Research Division. His academic posts include Assistant Professor at University of Saskatchewan (1981-84), and Adjunct Professor at University of Victoria (1995-2008, 2010-present), University of Toronto (2010-present) and Simon Fraser University (2010-present). Since 2010, Zwiers is Professor and Director of the Pacific Climate Impacts Conssortium at University of Victoria.
Zwiers has authored or co-authored over 100 research papers and book-chapters covering a wide range of topics in climate science and statistics. His work is highly cited, averaging over 33 citations per item. Francis is co-author (with Hans von Storch) of the monograph Statistical Analysis in Climate Research (Cambridge University Press, 1999). The monograph has become the standard reference on statistical methodologies in the field of climate science. Keenly interested in mentoring, Francis has supervised or participated in supervisory committees of over 30 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.
Francis Zwiers is acknowledged internationally as a world leader in the use of innovative statistical techniques for investigating a variety of challenging problems in climate change: the detection and attribution of change in the climate system, the analysis of temperature and precipitation extremes in present and future climates, climate predictability and variability, seasonal prediction, and the quantification of uncertainties associated with global climate models’ predictions. Fundamental understanding has emerged from his investigations. For instance, his recent work on detection and attribution has established a clear human influence in the observed changes in a variety of climate-related variables on global and regional scales: temperature and precipitation, and their extremes, atmospheric storminess and northern ocean wave heights, Canadian forest fires, high-latitude precipitation and most recently, precipitation extremes. Perhaps the most enduring impact of Francis’ work is that statistical science approaches have become an integral part of many facets of climate science.
An important element of his professional career is his effectiveness as a communicator of climate science and its application to societal changes. He is able to convey the important role that statistical science plays in establishing the validity of new research findings. The scientific areas in which he works are complex and difficult for non-specialists to understand. He is able to convey the essence of new research findings and their complexity in an understandable manner to both scientific colleagues and a broad range of audiences, including students, government officials and policy makers, and other non-specialists. One of his many accomplishments has been to raise the profile and credibility of Canadian climate science at home and abroad as a result of his ability to communicate his science. His publications that combine climate science and statistics, in prestigious journals such as the Journal of Climate, Climate Dynamics, Nature and Science, are frequently cited to have altered the way climate science is approached.
Zwiers typically works in a collaborative mode with colleagues in climate science as well as across disciplines. He is an unflagging advocate for the application of credible statistical approaches in climate science and, in turn, encourages colleagues in mathematics and statistics to tackle difficult climate problems with innovative approaches to data analysis and the detection of attribution of climate change. He has been a key player in multiple collaborative scientific activities in Canada, for example, the Canadian Climate Variability Network, supported by the Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council.
His approaches have been adopted in the scientific activities and organizations such as the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and the World Climate Research Program (WCRP). In the WCRP Francis has been a strong advocate for the establishment and application of sound statistical approaches in climate model intercomparisons for the evaluation of models and results. In the IPCC he was co-leader on the Chapter of the Fourth Assessment Report that presented the evidence supporting the key IPCC assessment that most of the warming during the past 50 years is very likely due to human influences on the climate system. As co-chair of the Joint WMO CCI/CLIVAR/JCOMM Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI), Francis brought to the committee statistical approaches for developing climate indices that were based on Canadian research in statistical climatology. The technology developed by ETCCDI has been transferred to users in hydro-meteorological services throughout the world.
Zwiers has been an effective and motivating mentor to students, postdoctoral fellows and young researchers, both in government laboratories and in his role as an Adjunct Professor at Universities of Victoria and Toronto, and Simon Fraser University.
Francis’ work has received numerous awards, including thePresident Prize from the Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society, The Patterson Distinguished Service Medal from the Meteorological Service of Canada, the International Meetings on Statistical Climatology Achievement Award, and the WMO Award for Exceptionally Long Term Service to the Commission for Climatology. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and the American Meteorological Society.
Francis lives in Victoria with his wife Donna. He has three adult children who have earned undergraduate and graduate degrees in computer science and applied mathematics. In his spare time, he does photography of birds and other subjects. When asked about how he got interested in statistics, he swiftly responded: “It was Jack Robinson’s introductory 2nd year level stats course at Waterloo that did the trick.”

Should we search for a new job? Are we ready for marriage and children? Is getting a second credit card a good idea? Okay, maybe that last one isn’t in the same category, but it is an issue that requires some thought.
A second credit card means another monthly payment. Applying for one will have an effect on your credit score. There’s also the possibility that your spending could become unmanageable, and you’ll start to hear terms like “debt snowball” and “debt avalanche method,” which can sound scary if you don’t know what they are. (They’re ways to pay off your debt, BTW.)
None of this means that getting a second credit card is a bad idea. There are benefits to doing it and good reasons why you’d want to apply for one. In this article, we’ll go over some important points you should consider before taking this step.
4 good reasons to get a second credit card
Let’s focus on the positive. There are some clear benefits to getting a second credit card. Consider each of these carefully. The four most common reasons for putting in a credit card application for a second card are all related to your financial circumstances.
- Balance transfer: Transferring the balance on your existing credit card to one with a lower interest rate is a great reason to apply for a second card. This will automatically lower monthly payments and give you a chance to pay off your balance faster because most balance transfer cards come with introductory 0{a09df0a7172ddbd410cbc83e52d18ea8893b7d066ec9e694b3e49f37d306c3bb} APR offers.
- Emergency fund: Some folks get a second credit card to use for emergency situations only. It’s a good way to have extra purchase power without having to put money in the bank. Of course, if you use it, you’ll have another monthly payment to make.
- Improve your credit score: There are a number of variables used when calculating a FICO credit score. One of them is the number of credit cards you hold. Adding a second card could also increase your credit score by a few points because your total credit limit would be higher, which should in turn lower your credit utilization ratio. (As long as you’re not spending more!) Speaking of…
- Lower credit utilization ratio: Another variable in the credit score calculation is the amount of credit you use. This is calculated as a cumulative number, so getting a second card with a zero balance could offset high balances on your other card.
When should you apply for a second credit card?
It’s generally recommended that you wait until you’ve held your first credit card for a year before applying for a second card. Once you get it, use it frequently and pay off the full balance each month, if possible. You should make sure you’re able to do that before applying.
After using your first card for a year and making your payments on time, you may be eligible for a better credit card the second time around. Look for available discounts, lower APRs, rewards programs, and cash-back rewards. Take your time and shop around. It’s all about earning those #points.
In many cases, people find the second credit card becomes their primary card. If that happens, don’t close out the other card. Credit bureaus also look at the length of your credit history when assessing your credit score. Closing out the old card could lower your score, and nobody wants that.

- Title: Machine Learning Based Forward Solver: An Automatic Framework in gprMaxComments: 6 pages, 6 figuresSubjects: Signal Processing (eess.SP); Geophysics (physics.geo-ph); Machine Learning (stat.ML)
General full-wave electromagnetic solvers, such as those utilizing the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method, are computationally demanding for simulating practical GPR problems. We explore the performance of a near-real-time, forward modeling approach for GPR that is based on a machine learning (ML) architecture. To ease the process, we have developed a framework that is capable of generating these ML-based forward solvers automatically. The framework uses an innovative training method that combines a predictive dimensionality reduction technique and a large data set of modeled GPR responses from our FDTD simulation software, gprMax. The forward solver is parameterized for a specific GPR application, but the framework can be extended in a straightforward manner to different electromagnetic problems.

- Title: Multifrequency 3D Elasticity Reconstruction withStructured Sparsity and ADMMAuthors: Shahed Mohammed, Mohammad Honarvar, Qi Zeng, Hoda Hashemi, Robert Rohling, Piotr Kozlowski, Septimiu SalcudeanSubjects: Signal Processing (eess.SP)
We introduce a model-based iterative method to obtain shear modulus images of tissue using magnetic resonance elastography. The method jointly finds the displacement field that best fits multifrequency tissue displacement data and the corresponding shear modulus. The displacement satisfies a viscoelastic wave equation constraint, discretized using the finite element method. Sparsifying regularization terms in both shear modulus and the displacement are used in the cost function minimized for the best fit. The formulated problem is bi-convex. Its solution can be obtained iteratively by using the alternating direction method of multipliers. Sparsifying regularizations and the wave equation constraint filter out sensor noise and compressional waves. Our method does not require bandpass filtering as a preprocessing step and converges fast irrespective of the initialization. We evaluate our new method in multiple in silico and phantom experiments, with comparisons with existing methods, and we show improvements in contrast to noise and signal to noise ratios. Results from an in vivo liver imaging study show elastograms with mean elasticity comparable to other values reported in the literature.

- Title: Energy Efficient Video Decoding for VVC Using a Greedy Strategy Based Design Space ExplorationAuthors: Matthias Kränzler, Christian Herglotz, André KaupComments: Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology (TCSVT)Subjects: Image and Video Processing (eess.IV)
IP traffic has increased significantly in recent years, and it is expected that this progress will continue. Recent studies report that the viewing of online video content accounts for a share of 1% of the global greenhouse gas emissions. To reduce the data traffic of video streaming, the new standard Versatile Video Coding (VVC) has been finalized in 2020. In this paper, the energy efficiency of two different VVC decoders is analyzed in detail. Furthermore, we propose a design space exploration that uses an algorithm based on a greedy strategy to derive coding tool profiles that optimize the energy demand of the decoder. We show that the algorithm derives optimal coding tool profiles for a subset of coding tools. Additionally, we propose profiles that reduce the energy demand of VVC decoders and provide energy savings of more than 50% for sequences with 4K resolution. Thereby, we will also show that the proposed profiles can have a lower decoding energy demand than comparable HEVC-encoded bit streams while also having a significantly lower bit rate.

- Title: KUIELab-MDX-Net: A Two-Stream Neural Network for Music DemixingAuthors: Minseok Kim, Woosung Choi, Jaehwa Chung, Daewon Lee, Soonyoung JungComments: MDX Workshop @ ISMIR 2021, 7 pages, 3 figuresSubjects: Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS); Sound (cs.SD)
Recently, many methods based on deep learning have been proposed for music source separation. Some state-of-the-art methods have shown that stacking many layers with many skip connections improve the SDR performance. Although such a deep and complex architecture shows outstanding performance, it usually requires numerous computing resources and time for training and evaluation. This paper proposes a two-stream neural network for music demixing, called KUIELab-MDX-Net, which shows a good balance of performance and required resources. The proposed model has a time-frequency branch and a time-domain branch, where each branch separates stems, respectively. It blends results from two streams to generate the final estimation. KUIELab-MDX-Net took second place on leaderboard A and third place on leaderboard B in the Music Demixing Challenge at ISMIR 2021. This paper also summarizes experimental results on another benchmark, MUSDB18. Our source code is available online.

- Title: Federated Dynamic Neural Network for Deep MIMO DetectionAuthors: Yuwen Yang, Feifei Gao, Jiang Xue, Ting Zhou, Zongben XuSubjects: Signal Processing (eess.SP)
In this paper, we develop a dynamic detection network (DDNet) based detector for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. By constructing an improved DetNet (IDetNet) detector and the OAMPNet detector as two independent network branches, the DDNet detector performs sample-wise dynamic routing to adaptively select a better one between the IDetNet and the OAMPNet detectors for every samples under different system conditions. To avoid the prohibitive transmission overhead of dataset collection in centralized learning (CL), we propose the federated averaging (FedAve)-DDNet detector, where all raw data are kept at local clients and only locally trained model parameters are transmitted to the central server for aggregation. To further reduce the transmission overhead, we develop the federated gradient sparsification (FedGS)-DDNet detector by randomly sampling gradients with elaborately calculated probability when uploading gradients to the central server. Based on simulation results, the proposed DDNet detector consistently outperforms other detectors under all system conditions thanks to the sample-wise dynamic routing. Moreover, the federated DDNet detectors, especially the FedGS-DDNet detector, can reduce the transmission overhead by at least 25.7\% while maintaining satisfactory detection accuracy.

- Title: Stochastic optimal scheduling of demand response-enabled microgrids with renewable generations: An analytical-heuristic approachComments: Accepted by Journal of Cleaner ProductionSubjects: Systems and Control (eess.SY); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
In the context of transition towards cleaner and sustainable energy production, microgrids have become an effective way for tackling environmental pollution and energy crisis issues. With the increasing penetration of renewables, how to coordinate demand response and renewable generations is a critical and challenging issue in the field of microgrid scheduling. To this end, a bi-level scheduling model is put forward for isolated microgrids with consideration of multi-stakeholders in this paper, where the lower- and upper-level models respectively aim to the minimization of user cost and microgrid operational cost under real-time electricity pricing environments. In order to solve this model, this research combines Jaya algorithm and interior point method (IPM) to develop a hybrid analysis-heuristic solution method called Jaya-IPM, where the lower- and upper- levels are respectively addressed by the IPM and the Jaya, and the scheduling scheme is obtained via iterations between the two levels. After that, the real-time prices updated by the upper-level model and the electricity plans determined by the lower-level model will be alternately iterated between the upper- and lower- levels through the real-time pricing mechanism to obtain an optimal scheduling plan. The test results show that the proposed method can coordinate the uncertainty of renewable generations with demand response strategies, thereby achieving a balance between the interests of microgrid and users; and that by leveraging demand response, the flexibility of the load side can be fully exploited to achieve peak load shaving while maintaining the balance of supply and demand. In addition, the Jaya-IPM algorithm is proven to be superior to the traditional hybrid intelligent algorithm (HIA) and the CPLEX solver in terms of optimization results and calculation efficiency.

- Title: Dual Domain Waveform Design for Joint Communication and Sensing SystemsAuthors: Luca Rinaldi, Dario Tagliaferri, Francesco Linsalata, Marouan Mizmizi, Maurizio Magarini, Umberto SpagnoliniComments: 6 pagesSubjects: Signal Processing (eess.SP)
The evolution of wireless communication systems towards millimeter-wave ($30-100$ GHz) and sub-THz ($>100$ GHz) frequency bands highlighted the need for accurate and fast beam management and a proactive link-blockage prediction in high-mobility scenarios. Joint Communication and Sensing (JC\&S) systems aim at equipping communication terminals with sensing capabilities using the same time/frequency/space communication resources to solve, or alleviate, the aforementioned issues. For an efficient implementation, a suitable waveform design that combines communication and sensing capabilities is of utmost importance. This paper proposes a novel dual-domain waveform design approach that superimposes onto the Frequency-Time (FT) domain both the legacy orthogonal frequency division multiplexing modulation scheme and a sensing signal, purposely designed in the Delay-Doppler (DD) domain. The power of the two signals is properly allocated in FT and DD domains, respectively, to reduce their mutual interference and optimize both communication and sensing tasks. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed JC\&S waveform design approach, yielding target communication and sensing performance with a full time-frequency resource sharing.

- Title: LightSAFT: Lightweight Latent Source Aware Frequency Transform for Source SeparationAuthors: Yeong-Seok Jeong, Jinsung Kim, Woosung Choi, Jaehwa Chung, Soonyoung JungComments: MDX Workshop @ ISMIR 2021, 7 pages, 1 figureSubjects: Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Sound (cs.SD)
Conditioned source separations have attracted significant attention because of their flexibility, applicability and extensionality. Their performance was usually inferior to the existing approaches, such as the single source separation model. However, a recently proposed method called LaSAFT-Net has shown that conditioned models can show comparable performance against existing single-source separation models. This paper presents LightSAFT-Net, a lightweight version of LaSAFT-Net. As a baseline, it provided a sufficient SDR performance for comparison during the Music Demixing Challenge at ISMIR 2021. This paper also enhances the existing LightSAFT-Net by replacing the LightSAFT blocks in the encoder with TFC-TDF blocks. Our enhanced LightSAFT-Net outperforms the previous one with fewer parameters.

- Title: Information-Theoretic Approach for Model Reduction Over Finite Time HorizonAuthors: Punit Tulpule, Umesh VaidyaSubjects: Systems and Control (eess.SY)
This paper presents an information-theoretic approach for model reduction for finite time simulation. Although system models are typically used for simulation over a finite time, most of the metrics (and pseudo-metrics) used for model accuracy assessment consider asymptotic behavior e.g., Hankel singular values and Kullback-Leibler(KL) rate metric. These metrics could further be used for model order reduction. Hence, in this paper, we propose a generalization of KL divergence-based metric called n-step KL rate metric, which could be used to compare models over a finite time horizon. We then demonstrate that the asymptotic metrics for comparing dynamical systems may not accurately assess the model prediction uncertainties over a finite time horizon. Motivated by this finite time analysis, we propose a new pragmatic approach to compute the influence of a subset of states on a combination of states called information transfer (IT). Model reduction typically involves the removal or truncation of states. IT combines the concepts from the n-step KL rate metric and model reduction. Finally, we demonstrate the application of information transfer for model reduction. Although the analysis and definitions presented in this paper assume linear systems, they can be extended for nonlinear systems.

- Title: Optimal Robust Exact Differentiation via Linear Adaptive TechniquesAuthors: Richard Seeber, Hernan HaimovichSubjects: Systems and Control (eess.SY)
The problem of differentiating a function with bounded second derivative in the presence of bounded measurement noise is considered. Performance limitations in terms of the smallest achievable worst-case differentiation error of causal and exact differentiators are shown. A robust exact differentiator is then constructed via the adaptation of a single parameter of a linear differentiator. It is demonstrated that the resulting differentiator is robust with respect to noise, that it instantaneously converges to the exact derivative in the absence of noise, and that it attains the smallest possible -- hence optimal -- upper bound on its differentiation error under noisy measurements. For practical realization in the presence of sampled measurements, a discrete-time realization is shown that achieves optimal asymptotic accuracy with respect to the noise and the sampling period.

- Title: Output Regulation by Postprocessing Internal Models for a Class of Multivariable Nonlinear SystemsAuthors: Michelangelo Bin, Lorenzo MarconiComments: The published version contains a few small rendering issues in some formulae. Here, these are correctedJournal-ref: International Journal of Robust and Nonlinear Control, vol. 30, pp. 1115-1140, 2020Subjects: Systems and Control (eess.SY)
In this paper we propose a new design paradigm, which employing a postprocessing internal model unit, to approach the problem of output regulation for a class of multivariable minimum-phase nonlinear systems possessing a partial normal form. Contrary to previous approaches, the proposed regulator handles control inputs of dimension larger than the number of regulated variables, provided that a controllability assumption holds, and can employ additional measurements that need not to vanish at the ideal error-zeroing steady state, but that can be useful for stabilization purposes or to fulfil the minimum-phase requirement. Conditions for practical and asymptotic output regulation are given, underlying how in postprocessing schemes the design of internal models is necessarily intertwined with that of the stabilizer.

- Title: Towards Learning Universal Audio RepresentationsAuthors: Luyu Wang, Pauline Luc, Yan Wu, Adria Recasens, Lucas Smaira, Andrew Brock, Andrew Jaegle, Jean-Baptiste Alayrac, Sander Dieleman, Joao Carreira, Aaron van den OordSubjects: Sound (cs.SD); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)
The ability to learn universal audio representations that can solve diverse speech, music, and environment tasks can spur many applications that require general sound content understanding. In this work, we introduce a holistic audio representation evaluation suite (HARES) spanning 12 downstream tasks across audio domains and provide a thorough empirical study of recent sound representation learning systems on that benchmark. We discover that previous sound event classification or speech models do not generalize outside of their domains. We observe that more robust audio representations can be learned with the SimCLR objective; however, the model's transferability depends heavily on the model architecture. We find the Slowfast architecture is good at learning rich representations required by different domains, but its performance is affected by the normalization scheme. Based on these findings, we propose a novel normalizer-free Slowfast NFNet and achieve state-of-the-art performance across all domains.

- Title: Three-Way Deep Neural Network for Radio Frequency Map Generation and Source LocalizationAuthors: Kuldeep S. Gill, Son Nguyen, Myo M. Thein, Alexander M. WyglinskiComments: 5 pages, 5 figuresSubjects: Machine Learning (cs.LG); Signal Processing (eess.SP)
In this paper, we present a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) machine learning model to interpolate irregularly distributed measurements across the spatial domain to construct a smooth radio frequency map (RFMap) and then perform localization using a deep neural network. Monitoring wireless spectrum over spatial, temporal, and frequency domains will become a critical feature in facilitating dynamic spectrum access (DSA) in beyond-5G and 6G communication technologies. Localization, wireless signal detection, and spectrum policy-making are several of the applications where distributed spectrum sensing will play a significant role. Detection and positioning of wireless emitters is a very challenging task in a large spectral and spatial area. In order to construct a smooth RFMap database, a large number of measurements are required which can be very expensive and time consuming. One approach to help realize these systems is to collect finite localized measurements across a given area and then interpolate the measurement values to construct the database. Current methods in the literature employ channel modeling to construct the radio frequency map, which lacks the granularity for accurate localization whereas our proposed approach reconstructs a new generalized RFMap. Localization results are presented and compared with conventional channel models.

In this research work, a hardware and software system is developed that uses wireless sensors to monitor environmental variables such as temperature, gas concentration and luminosity, in order to detect the existence of forest fires. Lora technology was used for wireless sensor networks with communication range that can reach on average up to 5km in urban areas and 10km in rural areas. The developed system also has an integrated web application (dashboard) and that in real time, collects data from wireless sensors, which together form the sensor module, also called device. Then, this data is presented on a map associ- ated with the positioning of each sensor module. The developed system was tested using practical experiments that used flames, gases and lighting, simulating the occurrence of fires. With the tests performed, it was observed the feasibility of the system, hardware/software developed, in detecting the fires in the simulated scenarios. Therefore, it was found that the research is promising, and may advance in the future for the detection of real fires.

- Title: Animal Behavior Classification via Deep Learning on Embedded SystemsSubjects: Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Signal Processing (eess.SP); Machine Learning (stat.ML)
We develop an end-to-end deep-neural-network-based algorithm for classifying animal behavior using accelerometry data on the embedded system of an artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) device installed in a wearable collar tag. The proposed algorithm jointly performs feature extraction and classification utilizing a set of infinite-impulse-response (IIR) and finite-impulse-response (FIR) filters together with a multilayer perceptron. The utilized IIR and FIR filters can be viewed as specific types of recurrent and convolutional neural network layers, respectively. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm via two real-world datasets collected from grazing cattle. The results show that the proposed algorithm offers good intra- and inter-dataset classification accuracy and outperforms its closest contenders including two state-of-the-art convolutional-neural-network-based time-series classification algorithms, which are significantly more complex. We implement the proposed algorithm on the embedded system of the collar tag's AIoT device to perform in-situ classification of animal behavior. We achieve real-time in-situ behavior inference from accelerometry data without imposing any strain on the available computational, memory, or energy resources of the embedded system.

- Title: A comment on stabilizing reinforcement learningAuthors: Pavel Osinenko, Georgiy Malaniya, Grigory Yaremenko, Ilya OsokinSubjects: Dynamical Systems (math.DS); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Systems and Control (eess.SY)
This is a short comment on the paper "Asymptotically Stable Adaptive-Optimal Control Algorithm With Saturating Actuators and Relaxed Persistence of Excitation" by Vamvoudakis et al. The question of stability of reinforcement learning (RL) agents remains hard and the said work suggested an on-policy approach with a suitable stability property using a technique from adaptive control - a robustifying term to be added to the action. However, there is an issue with this approach to stabilizing RL, which we will explain in this note. Furthermore, Vamvoudakis et al. seems to have made a fallacious assumption on the Hamiltonian under a generic policy. To provide a positive result, we will not only indicate this mistake, but show critic neural network weight convergence under a stochastic, continuous-time environment, provided certain conditions on the behavior policy hold.

- Title: How Speech is Recognized to Be Emotional - A Study Based on Information DecompositionAuthors: Haoran Sun, Lantian Li, Thomas Fang Zheng, Dong WangSubjects: Sound (cs.SD); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)
The way that humans encode their emotion into speech signals is complex. For instance, an angry man may increase his pitch and speaking rate, and use impolite words. In this paper, we present a preliminary study on various emotional factors and investigate how each of them impacts modern emotion recognition systems. The key tool of our study is the SpeechFlow model presented recently, by which we are able to decompose speech signals into separate information factors (content, pitch, rhythm). Based on this decomposition, we carefully studied the performance of each information component and their combinations. We conducted the study on three different speech emotion corpora and chose an attention-based convolutional RNN as the emotion classifier. Our results show that rhythm is the most important component for emotional expression. Moreover, the cross-corpus results are very bad (even worse than guess), demonstrating that the present speech emotion recognition model is rather weak. Interestingly, by removing one or several unimportant components, the cross-corpus results can be improved. This demonstrates the potential of the decomposition approach towards a generalizable emotion recognition.

- Title: A Study on Decoupled Probabilistic Linear Discriminant AnalysisAuthors: Di Wang, Lantian Li, Hongzhi Yu, Dong WangSubjects: Sound (cs.SD); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)
Probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) has broad application in open-set verification tasks, such as speaker verification. A key concern for PLDA is that the model is too simple (linear Gaussian) to deal with complicated data; however, the simplicity by itself is a major advantage of PLDA, as it leads to desirable generalization. An interesting research therefore is how to improve modeling capacity of PLDA while retaining the simplicity. This paper presents a decoupling approach, which involves a global model that is simple and generalizable, and a local model that is complex and expressive. While the global model holds a bird view on the entire data, the local model represents the details of individual classes. We conduct a preliminary study towards this direction and investigate a simple decoupling model including both the global and local models. The new model, which we call decoupled PLDA, is tested on a speaker verification task. Experimental results show that it consistently outperforms the vanilla PLDA when the model is based on raw speaker vectors. However, when the speaker vectors are processed by length normalization, the advantage of decoupled PLDA will be largely lost, suggesting future research on non-linear local models.

- Title: An MAP Estimation for Between-Class VarianceAuthors: Jiao Han, Yunqi Cai, Lantian Li, Guanyu Li, Dong WangSubjects: Sound (cs.SD); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)
Probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) has been widely used in open-set verification tasks, such as speaker verification. A potential issue of this model is that the training set often contains limited number of classes, which makes the estimation for the between-class variance unreliable. This unreliable estimation often leads to degraded generalization. In this paper, we present an MAP estimation for the between-class variance, by employing an Inverse-Wishart prior. A key problem is that with hierarchical models such as PLDA, the prior is placed on the variance of class means while the likelihood is based on class members, which makes the posterior inference intractable. We derive a simple MAP estimation for such a model, and test it in both PLDA scoring and length normalization. In both cases, the MAP-based estimation delivers interesting performance improvement.

- Title: tsflex: flexible time series processing & feature extractionComments: The first two authors contributed equally. Submitted to SoftwareXSubjects: Machine Learning (cs.LG); Signal Processing (eess.SP); Machine Learning (stat.ML)
Time series processing and feature extraction are crucial and time-intensive steps in conventional machine learning pipelines. Existing packages are limited in their real-world applicability, as they cannot cope with irregularly-sampled and asynchronous data. We therefore present $\texttt{tsflex}$, a domain-independent, flexible, and sequence first Python toolkit for processing & feature extraction, that is capable of handling irregularly-sampled sequences with unaligned measurements. This toolkit is sequence first as (1) sequence based arguments are leveraged for strided-window feature extraction, and (2) the sequence-index is maintained through all supported operations. $\texttt{tsflex}$ is flexible as it natively supports (1) multivariate time series, (2) multiple window-stride configurations, and (3) integrates with processing and feature functions from other packages, while (4) making no assumptions about the data sampling rate regularity and synchronization. Other functionalities from this package are multiprocessing, in-depth execution time logging, support for categorical & time based data, chunking sequences, and embedded serialization. $\texttt{tsflex}$ is developed to enable fast and memory-efficient time series processing & feature extraction. Results indicate that $\texttt{tsflex}$ is more flexible than similar packages while outperforming these toolkits in both runtime and memory usage.

- Title: Probabilistic Behavioral Distance and Tuning - Reducing and aggregating complex systemsSubjects: Optimization and Control (math.OC); Systems and Control (eess.SY); Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems (nlin.AO)
Given a complex system with a given interface to the rest of the world, what does it mean for a the system to behave close to a simpler specification describing the behavior at the interface? We give several definitions for useful notions of distances between a complex system and a specification by combining a behavioral and probabilistic perspective. These distances can be used to tune a complex system to a specification. We show that our approach can successfully tune non-linear networked systems to behave like much smaller networks, allowing us to aggregate large sub-networks into one or two effective nodes. Finally, we discuss similarities and differences between our approach and $H_\infty$ model reduction.

- Title: Non-Intrusive Binaural Speech Intelligibility Prediction from Discrete Latent RepresentationsAuthors: Alex F. McKinney, Benjamin CauchiComments: 4 pages + 1 refs; 1 figure; submitted to IEEE SPL (pending review)Subjects: Sound (cs.SD); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)
Non-intrusive speech intelligibility (SI) prediction from binaural signals is useful in many applications. However, most existing signal-based measures are designed to be applied to single-channel signals. Measures specifically designed to take into account the binaural properties of the signal are often intrusive - characterised by requiring access to a clean speech signal - and typically rely on combining both channels into a single-channel signal before making predictions. This paper proposes a non-intrusive SI measure that computes features from a binaural input signal using a combination of vector quantization (VQ) and contrastive predictive coding (CPC) methods. VQ-CPC feature extraction does not rely on any model of the auditory system and is instead trained to maximise the mutual information between the input signal and output features. The computed VQ-CPC features are input to a predicting function parameterized by a neural network. Two predicting functions are considered in this paper. Both feature extractor and predicting functions are trained on simulated binaural signals with isotropic noise. They are tested on simulated signals with isotropic and real noise. For all signals, the ground truth scores are the (intrusive) deterministic binaural STOI. Results are presented in terms of correlations and MSE and demonstrate that VQ-CPC features are able to capture information relevant to modelling SI and outperform all the considered benchmarks - even when evaluating on data comprising of different noise field types.

- Title: Optimization-free Ground Contact Force Constraint Satisfaction in Quadrupedal LocomotionAuthors: Eric Sihite, Pravin Dangol, Alireza RamezaniSubjects: Robotics (cs.RO); Systems and Control (eess.SY)
We are seeking control design paradigms for legged systems that allow bypassing costly algorithms that depend on heavy on-board computers widely used in these systems and yet being able to match what they can do by using less expensive optimization-free frameworks. In this work, we present our preliminary results in modeling and control design of a quadrupedal robot called \textit{Husky Carbon}, which under development at Northeastern University (NU) in Boston. In our approach, we utilized a supervisory controller and an Explicit Reference Governor (ERG) to enforce ground reaction force constraints. These constraints are usually enforced using costly optimizations. However, in this work, the ERG manipulates the state references applied to the supervisory controller to enforce the ground contact constraints through an updated law based on Lyapunov stability arguments. As a result, the approach is much faster to compute than the widely used optimization-based methods.

- Title: Acoustical Analysis of Speech Under Physical Stress in Relation to Physical Activities and Physical LiteracyAuthors: Si-Ioi Ng, Rui-Si Ma, Tan Lee, Raymond Kim-Wai SumComments: Submitted to Speech Prosody 2022Subjects: Quantitative Methods (q-bio.QM); Sound (cs.SD); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)
Human speech production encompasses physiological processes that naturally react to physic stress. Stress caused by physical activity (PA), e.g., running, may lead to significant changes in a person's speech. The major changes are related to the aspects of pitch level, speaking rate, pause pattern, and breathiness. The extent of change depends presumably on physical fitness and well-being of the person, as well as intensity of PA. The general wellness of a person is further related to his/her physical literacy (PL), which refers to a holistic description of engagement in PA. This paper presents the development of a Cantonese speech database that contains audio recordings of speech before and after physical exercises of different intensity levels. The corpus design and data collection process are described. Preliminary results of acoustical analysis are presented to illustrate the impact of PA on pitch level, pitch range, speaking and articulation rate, and time duration of pauses. It is also noted that the effect of PA is correlated to some of the PA and PL measures.

- Title: Towards Cross-Cultural Analysis using Music Information DynamicsAuthors: Shlomo Dubnov, Kevin Huang, Cheng-i WangSubjects: Sound (cs.SD); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)
A music piece is both comprehended hierarchically, from sonic events to melodies, and sequentially, in the form of repetition and variation. Music from different cultures establish different aesthetics by having different style conventions on these two aspects. We propose a framework that could be used to quantitatively compare music from different cultures by looking at these two aspects.
The framework is based on an Music Information Dynamics model, a Variable Markov Oracle (VMO), and is extended with a variational representation learning of audio. A variational autoencoder (VAE) is trained to map audio fragments into a latent representation. The latent representation is fed into a VMO. The VMO then learns a clustering of the latent representation via a threshold that maximizes the information rate of the quantized latent representation sequence. This threshold effectively controls the sensibility of the predictive step to acoustic changes, which determines the framework's ability to track repetitions on longer time scales. This approach allows characterization of the overall information contents of a musical signal at each level of acoustic sensibility.
Our findings under this framework show that sensibility to subtle acoustic changes is higher for East-Asian musical traditions, while the Western works exhibit longer motivic structures at higher thresholds of differences in the latent space. This suggests that a profile of information contents, analyzed as a function of the level of acoustic detail can serve as a possible cultural characteristic.

This thesis is mainly concerned with state-space approaches for solving deep (temporal) Gaussian process (DGP) regression problems. More specifically, we represent DGPs as hierarchically composed systems of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), and we consequently solve the DGP regression problem by using state-space filtering and smoothing methods. The resulting state-space DGP (SS-DGP) models generate a rich class of priors compatible with modelling a number of irregular signals/functions. Moreover, due to their Markovian structure, SS-DGPs regression problems can be solved efficiently by using Bayesian filtering and smoothing methods. The second contribution of this thesis is that we solve continuous-discrete Gaussian filtering and smoothing problems by using the Taylor moment expansion (TME) method. This induces a class of filters and smoothers that can be asymptotically exact in predicting the mean and covariance of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) solutions. Moreover, the TME method and TME filters and smoothers are compatible with simulating SS-DGPs and solving their regression problems. Lastly, this thesis features a number of applications of state-space (deep) GPs. These applications mainly include, (i) estimation of unknown drift functions of SDEs from partially observed trajectories and (ii) estimation of spectro-temporal features of signals.

- Title: Global Output Feedback Stabilization of Semilinear Reaction-Diffusion PDEsAuthors: Hugo Lhachemi, Christophe PrieurSubjects: Optimization and Control (math.OC); Systems and Control (eess.SY)
This paper addresses the topic of global output feedback stabilization of semilinear reaction-diffusion PDEs. The semilinearity is assumed to be confined into a sector condition. We consider two different types of actuation configurations, namely: bounded control operator and right Robin boundary control. The measurement is selected as a left Dirichlet trace. The control strategy is finite dimensional and is designed based on a linear version of the plant. We derive a set of sufficient conditions ensuring the global exponential stabilization of the semilinear reaction-diffusion PDE. These conditions are shown to be feasible provided the order of the controller is large enough and the size of the sector condition in which the semilinearity is confined into is small enough.

In recent years, the time between summer and winter has produced a new — now wildly popular — beer style: The pumpkin beer. That’s right, pumpkin! When you look at the beer that’s being brewed in a Buffalo trace barrel, you’d never even think it’s flavoured with pumpkin!
Pumpkin ales appeared on the scene in maybe the last five to ten years, but are now a force to be reckoned with, as nearly every craft brewery on the western side of the country concocts some sort of pumpkin ale. Whether it be light, dark, rich, spicy; you name it, it’s being brewed.
As these beers began appearing in grocery stores and bottle shops all over the Pacific Northwest in the last month, I began getting questions from beer consumers asking, “Which one is right for me?” Some people are afraid a pumpkin beer will be too sickeningly sweet, like drinking a pumpkin pie, and for some that’s precisely what they’re after.
So, I rounded up six local pumpkin ales that you can find in the greater Seattle area. Yes, there are more than merely six pumpkin beers being crafted here in the Pacific Northwest, but I went with a few that are made here in the greater Seattle area by breweries that are close to my home and my heart. These are beers that are easily available to you, the consumer, at your nearest bottle shop. After the beer descriptions, keep reading if you’d like to know more about baking with pumpkin beers.
Six local (Seattle area) pumpkin beers:
Elysian Brewing Night Owl: 5.9% by volume, sold in both 22 oz and 12 oz bottles and on tap around the Seattle area. Night Owl Pumpkin Ale is the most popular pumpkin beer that Elysian makes and is brewed with over seven pounds of pumpkin per barrel and spiced in conditioning with nutmeg, clove, cinnamon, ginger and allspice. Made with Pale, Munich and Crystal malts green and roasted pumpkin seeds, pumpkin in the mash, boil and fermenter. Bittered with Horizon hops.
Pours a medium orange/amber, slightly cloudy. Lots of pumpkin flavor and spice, nice light body, very drinkable. This is Elysian’s most popular, widely sold pumpkin ale. Usually on my “recommends” list for someone who’s never had a pumpkin beer before as an introduction to the basic style.
Not sure which beer to try, or afraid, it will be too sweet? We’ve got the perfect pumpkin beer for you!
The Great Pumpkin Imperial Pumpkin Ale: 8% by volume. Sold in 22 oz bottles and on tap around the Seattle area. The Great Pumpkin was the 2007 Silver Medalist at the Great American Beer Festival in the Fruit and Vegetable category and was also the world’s first imperial pumpkin ale ever made. Many other breweries now emulate this style, such as Southern Teir (Pumking) and Howe Sound (Pumpkin Eater).
Pours dark orange/brown. The imperial style has a heavier malt and alcohol character, rich pumpkin taste and lots of body — bursting with flavor. Definitely a “step-up” from the Night Owl.
Dark ‘O the Moon Pumpkin Stout: 6.5% by volume, sold in 22 oz bottles and on tap around Seattle. A classic stout style with pumpkin added to the mash, boil and fermentation, along with pumpkin spices. Smooth and chocolatey with a touch of cinnamon. Won the silver medal at GABF in 2010 in the Field Beer category.
Pours dark black. With the rich molasses and chocolate flavor mingled with the cinnamon, nutmeg, clove ginger and allspice, this beer tastes much like a liquid gingerbread cookie.
Note: Hansel & Gretel Ginger Pumpkin Pilsner will be bottled and released in the upcoming weeks and the ninth beer in Elysian’s “12 Beers of the Apocalypse” series is the Blight Pumpkin Ale which was released on September 21.
All of these plus 8 others made by Elysian and 60 in total from all over the country will be available for sampling at the Great Pumpkin Beer Festival held on October 19 & 20 at Elysian’s Georgetown campus. The highlight of the event is a tapping of the Great Pumpkin! Read more about the event and ticket sales on the Elysian Brewing website.
Pike Brewing Harlot’s Harvest: 8.5% by volume, sold in 22 oz bottles and on tap at the Pike Brewpub. Made with. The beer is then “seasoned” with cassia bark, allspice, vanilla bean, nutmeg, ginger and clove.
Pours a cloudy tan/brown in color. On the palate, this beer is round and rich with a burst of caramel and molasses with a smooth sweetness reminiscent of pumpkin pie, and the boldness of a Belgian, monastic-style, strong dark ale. One of the only (if not the only) Belgian-style pumpkin ales being bottled this year; a truly unique style. This beer is best served at just a smidge cooler than room temp to really allow the spices and malt shine through.
Two Beer’s Pumpkin Spice Ale: 5.2% by volume, available in 22 oz bottles (first time ever!) and on tap at The Woods, Two Beer’s taproom. Pours bright orange and very clear, LOADS of spice notes on the nose and a very strong clove flavor on the tongue. Two Beer’s Pumpkin Spice Ale is brewed with pumpkin, nutmeg, clove, allspice and cinnamon. This is their third year brewing this particular small-batch seasonal and the first year bottling it. A very light, spicy beer, which is great for sipping but even better for cooking/baking with due to the high amount of spice that comes through.
I would categorize this as the perfect pumpkin beer for people who don’t like heavy beers and don’t want something overly hoppy or malty.
Puyallup River Brewing Jack O’Lahar Pumpkin Ale: 5.8% by volume, available in limited release 22 oz bottles around the greater Seattle area. Saved the best for last: This pumpkin ale was by far my favorite out of the six. As a malty beer lover that enjoys a dry, not overly sweet taste or finish to my beer, this hit all the right notes. The beer pours a cloudy dark orange/brown and has loads of pumpkin and caramel smell to it.
Tastes like a gingerbread cookie without the heavy, molassesy taste that the Dark O’ the Moon beer tends to offer, thus a bit lighter on the tongue. Very drinkable at 5.8% and really smooth, balanced and tasty. A great beer for just about anyone that is looking for the pumpkin beer essence within a rich, full-bodied beer.
Using pumpkin beer in baking:
It’s quite easy to make any pumpkin baking recipe into a pumpkin beer baking recipe. If a recipe calls for milk, this is the best place to substitute in your pumpkin beer. If a recipe is not a pumpkin recipe at all, substitute butter, margarine or shortening for pumpkin puree, and voila! You have a pumpkin bread, cookie, cake, and so on.
Here’s one of the easiest and most delicious recipes that I borrowed from the lovely Ladies of Craft Beer which uses pumpkin puree and Night Owl to make a delicious, moist pumpkin beer bread. Since many pumpkin ales come in 22 oz bottles, you can double this recipe and make two loaves. Alternatively, Night Owl (which now comes in 12 oz bottles as well as 22 oz bottles), Shipyard Pumpkin Ale, Uinta’s Punk’n and Dogfish Head’s Punkin Ale all come in 12 oz bottles as well and can be found at most of your local bottle shops.
Pumpkin Spice Beer Cake
Ingredients (one loaf)
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tsp. baking powder
- ½ tsp. salt
- ½ cup sugar
- ½ tsp. ground cinnamon
- ¼ tsp. ground ginger
- ? tsp. ground cloves
- 3 tbsp. vegetable oil
- ½ cup pumpkin puree [from scratch, if ambitious; from a can, if you’re lazy like me]
- 11-12 oz. pumpkin ale of your choice
Optional Ingredients
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
1 cup toasted almonds, sliced or finely chopped
Optional Almond Topping
½ cup sugar
1 tsp. cinnamon
½ cup toasted almonds, finely chopped
Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly grease a 9×5 inch glass pan.
Toast almond slices for 10 minutes on an ungreased baking sheet, and finely chop. For almond topping, mix ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.
In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, salt, sugar, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves.
In another bowl, combine oil, pumpkin puree, and ale.
Quickly combine wet and dry ingredients. Add optional ingredients at this point as well. Stir only until you are not able to see any white flacks from the flour.
Pour batter into loaf pan. If desired, add almond topping.
Bake for at least one hour. The loaf should be slightly golden and will spring back when pressed, if fully baked. Insert a toothpick into the center of the loaf to see if it comes out clean. The first loaf I made came out a bit doughy, so keep an eye on your bread until you find the right temperature and timing for your oven.
Allow loaf to cool on a rack before slicing. Store in an airtight container.CW’s Arrow/Green Arrow is only a cog in DC’s money-making TV show machine, but it does make for good watching. There are, of course, conflicting views […]

Because this seriously sounds too good to be true. That's exactly what happened to me when I read an email that included a note about sauvignon blanc Jell-O—that's WINE with JELL-O.
"The idea came to me when I was helping out my girlfriend Molly Sims with a family get-together. We were having a blast finding new recipes, and I thought a twist on a Jell-O shot would be a fun way to greet the adults arriving," pro party planner (and inventor of the wine Jell-O concoction) Stefanie Cove explained, suggesting they be served cut into cubes as a passed treat. heat and stir in wine.

Dean Traylor is a freelance writer and teacher who writes about various subjects, including education and creative writing.
"He had her favorite dress and make-up on. He topped it off with golden locks of hair very similar to hers."
“Everything you do makes me want to scream!” Jules exclaimed from behind the closed door of his bedroom.
Julie struggled for a response, but her confinement made it impossible.
Jules was always a delightful jokester, but this was too much for her. What he was doing in there, she thought.
She could only ponder while she put the pieces of the last six month together. He was her roommate. She had been apprehensive to take on a male roommate. But he was sweet, despite being odd. Still, he appeared harmless and was so until a few weeks ago.
“Have I not ever told you,” he said. “You’re so right as rain?”
A million times, she thought. All the cards, flowers, candle-lit dinners prepared for her when she came home were testaments to that. His infatuation was so apparent that it was freaking her out. She was about to tell him she wanted him to move out, before the current event happened.
“Everything you do makes me want to scream!” Jules exclaimed from behind the closed door of his bedroom.
Finally, the door swung open, and out stepped Jules looking awfully like Julie. He had her favorite dress and make-up on. He topped it off with golden locks of hair very similar to hers.
He sighed and asked: “You like my style of fashion?"
Even if Julie could speak through the gag in her mouth, she didn’t know what to say.
“Everything you do is irresistible,” he continued. “It’s simply kissable.”
He came and knelt before her: “I kept asking myself: What can’t I be you?”
He stood and twirled like a little child showing off a new dress.
“And now look! I am you!”
Julie struggled more than ever. She tried as hard as she could to pull her hands out of the sheets bounding her to the chair. But, it was to no avail.
Then the unthinkable happened. Jules brandished a knife.
“You’re so wonderful and too good to be true,” he said. “I’ll just hug you to death.”
And, within a few moments, Jules became Julie.
Extra: We Wish We Could by the Cure
How Jules becomes Julie owes much of its existence to one of most enduring alternative hits from the mid-eighties. It's also one of the most cheerfully creepy songs to come from that era (and if you're in doubt about that, check out the video).
Still, one can't ignore the band behind the music. The Cure have been around since the late 70s, and during that time have threatened to break up numerous times. It seems that Robert Smith and company had shunned super stardom; however, they never followed through on this when they finally became popular. All they did was create more bizarre art-house songs that managed to reach a very wide audience.
The band is, arguably, one of the most influential of the last 30 years. And, there's no doubt that many bands and fans have emulated their appearance, as well as their music. In some cases, they have an almost cult-like following.
The song is about obsession, which is something the band and their fans may know very well. And, as mentioned the story above was inspired by the imagery, words, and theme expressed "Why I Can't I Be You."
Still, this story takes a more dark and twisted turn than the song does. Despite the dark imagery and goth-like theme that the band seems to portray, their music is actually very light-hearted and whimsical.

Kicking off "wartime mode"
According to Global Times, in light of the alarming water levels exceeding that of 1998 in China's largest fresh water lake located alongside the Yangtze River, and with the upcoming rains expected to fall in the middle and lower reaches of the river, China raised its national flood response level on Sunday to its second highest, with the public keeping a close watch on whether the Three Gorges Project can withhold the floods and if the country will suffer the same fate it did 22 years ago.
Disaster-relief experts pointed out that economic growth has made the country more vulnerable to floods and prone to bigger losses, but the Three Gorges Project has made the river basin "much safer." Experts were also optimistic about the progress made in logistics, resources coordination and technology that can help the country overcome a major disaster with minimal impact.
At midnight Saturday, the water surface level at a hydrometric station at Poyang Lake in East China's Jiangxi Province, exceeded the 22.52 meter red mark of the 1998 floods. The 1998 disaster claimed some 4,150 lives and caused 160 billion yuan ($22.9 billion) in economic damages, Reuters reported.
Jiangxi has entered "wartime mode" and raised its emergency response for flood control and disaster relief to the highest level.
Jiangxi province in southern China issued its highest flood warning on Saturday, predicting a big overflow from a lake on the Yangtze River as torrential rain continues to batter much of the country, Hindustan Times also reported.
The Jiangxi government raised its flood-control response level to I from II, the People’s Daily said, the top level on China’s four-tier scale, signalling disasters such as dam collapses or extraordinary floods simultaneously in several rivers.
Provincial authorities expect severe regional flooding in Poyang, China’s largest freshwater lake which connects to the Yangtze, state television said.
The water level in the lake, rising at an unprecedented pace, was 2.3 metres (8 feet), exceeding the alert level, CCTV said in a report around noon (0200 GMT).
The government of the province’s Jiangzhou county, an isolated island on Asia’s longest river, issued a call on social media for everyone from the town aged 18 to 60 to return and help fight the flood, citing a severe lack of hands to reinforce dams.
With downpours continuing to wreak havoc across vast swaths of China, several other cities along the Yangtze have declared highest-level flood warnings, as incessant rain triggers landslides and inundates roads and farmland, with parts of the river threatening to burst its banks.
China’s national observatory on Saturday renewed its yellow alert for rainstorms, warning of heavy of weekend rain in places including Sichuan and Chongqing in the southwest, the central province of Hubei and Hunan province in the south.
Test for Three Gorges Project
For the Yangtze River, the highest amount of rainfall and flood peaks usually occur in late July and early August, and the already alarming situation has prompted people to ask, will the floods of 1998 repeat again?
Analysts reassured the public that with the Three Gorges Project, which went into operation in 2003 and plays a critical role in mediating the water, a disaster on the scale of 1998 is unlikely to take place along the mainstream.
Zhang Boting, a senior analyst at the China Society for Hydropower Engineering, told the Global Times on Sunday that with the Three Gorges Project, the mainstream water level could remain low by holding the water in the upper reaches of the Three Gorges Reservoir, with Poyang Lake and other tributaries being able to discharge water into the Yangtze's mainstream.
The Yangtze's reaches are much safer than they were in 1998, Zhang said.
Amid the flood pressure in the middle and lower reaches, the Changjiang (Yangtze River) Water Resources Commission on Saturday reduced outflow from the Three Gorges Reservoir to 19,000 cubic meters per second. The amount will be adjusted in line with the upcoming rainfall.
The Three Gorges Reservoir reduced its water level in early June to 145 meters, 30 meters below its high water level to hold the upcoming floodwater.
Gao Jianguo, a member of the National Disaster Reduction Committee under the Ministry of Emergency Management, warned that despite the key role the Three Gorges Project could play in reducing mainstream flood control pressure, the lower reaches still face major challenges from regional rainfall that could bring about a smaller scale of floods and inundation.
Another concern is the typhoon season, which usually arrives in August and may potentially overlap with the Yangtze's flood season, threatening the lower reaches and the delta region.
In comparison to 1998, the high scale of development along the river means floods, water logging and inundation on the same scale will cause perhaps 10 times more economic losses. But technologies and innovative progress regarding the emergency response system also enhanced capabilities in handling floods and minimizing such impacts, analysts said.
Gao told the Global Times on Sunday that the country is now better prepared for floods, with more accurate monitoring and prediction of hydrologic and meteorological data. Progress in logistics and resources coordination also increased the capability of getting ready for a trans-regional emergency.
China now also has more professional machines to conduct bank consolidation, evacuation and reconstruction work after floods, Gao said.
The Global Times learned from the frontline of the flood battle in Jiangxi that drones are now deployed to monitor floods and other geological occurrences in affected areas and broadcast live images to better conduct targeted rescue and relief work.
A resident from Nanlin village in Poyang told the Global Times on Sunday that in 1998, most people lived in bungalows which were easily inundated. But now most families have built two- to three-story houses and can wait for rescue if trapped by a sudden flood.
The development in communication infrastructure also saves time and costs in information sharing, giving more time for people to evacuate and get prepared, said the resident.
The extraordinary rainfall across the Yangtze basin this year is not only a test for the Three Gorges Project, but also a test for the country's disaster response mechanisms as a whole, analysts said.
The No.1 Yangtze flood peak formed on July 2 and the Three Gorges Reservoir withheld it smoothly. As the river usually has seven to eight numbered flood peaks (flood of a certain scale) each year between late July and early August, nature's biggest challenge has not arrived yet, Gao<<Gig Economy

What is a Gig Economy?
A Gig Economy is a free market system in the form of a labour market that is characterized by the prevalence of short-term contracts or freelance work, as opposed to permanent jobs.
How to stand-out in the Gig Economy?
BRANDING – In the labour market, successful branding involves promoting your unique skills and attributes that will motivate a potential employer to hire you over anyone else. Your professional Brand is EVERYTHING!
PROFILE – “Obscurity is your enemy!” Sites such as LinkedIn are the “go to” professional sites for over 500 million people across the globe. Employers and candidates rely on these social network sites to connect with top talent in various disciplines. If you want to get noticed, LinkedIn is a great start!
DESIGNATIONS/CERTIFICATIONS (e.g. CPA, CCIM, PMP) – Some industry professionals have suggested that the Covid-19 pandemic may result in a shift away from degrees, and towards professional designations, accelerated diplomas, or certifications. Whether their hypothesis is correct or not, let’s face it, degrees are expensive and for many professional (i.e. Trading, Real Estate, IT) only a designation or certificate is required.
ASSEMBLE A PORTFOLIO – A “Gigster” is only as good as their last “Gig.” Therefore, keeping detailed notes, awards, recommendations and pictures of past and current projects will be a huge value add. As Napoleon Bonaparte once said “A picture is worth a thousand words”.
ASSOCIATIONS & NETWORKING – This goes without saying!
SEEK ASSISTANCE FROM A DESIGNATED, PROFESSIONAL RECRUITER – This is just my “plug-in.”
CONSIDER INSURANCE (e.g. errors & omissions, WCB) – Anything can happen at the workplace, therefore it is important for you Gigster’s to consider the appropriate coverage should anything occur. Additionally, Workers Compensation coverage (WCB) is another valuable option should an incident render you unable to work.
HAVE AN OPEN MIND – “It’s not what you are getting that’s important, it’s what you’re becoming.” Jim Rohn. Consider all options when searching for your next Gig. Place more emphasis on the skills to be acquired rather than the renumeration. This is not to suggest that the compensation is not important. We all need to eat! However, this concept highlights the fact that knowledge is indeed power.
We will be having a more detailed discussion on the Gig Economy in future posts. Stay tuned…Heirloom Quality Amish Built Living Room Furniture

This is a good principle to live by and can keep you from making impulsive decisions, like emailing your bank account number to a mysterious businessman who urgently needs you to help him transfer $100 million to another country. However, for every financial pearl of wisdom, there are exceptions. There are times when you may be able to save significant taxes from the sale of a qualified small business (QSB) by understanding Sections 1202 and 1045 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). It might sound too good to be true, but truth can be stranger than fiction.
To C Or Not To C
When creating a startup, many entrepreneurs lean toward forming LLCs or other structures with pass-through tax treatment. A C corporation can be overlooked because of double taxation. Double taxation can occur when a corporation pays taxes on its profits at the entity level, and then a second layer of tax is paid at the personal level when dividends are distributed to shareholders. However, there are strategic reasons for using a C corporation that can allow you to come out far ahead.
What Are QSBS And IRC Section 1202?
Qualified small-business stock (QSBS) refers to shares of a QSB that is a domestic C corporation with gross assets (valued at their original price) of no more than $50 million at the time of stock issuance or immediately after it. In 1993, Congress enacted IRC Section 1202 to create an incentive for investing in small upstart businesses. Section 1202, also called the small-business stock gains exclusion, allows capital gains from select small-business stock to be excluded from federal tax. To exclude Section 1202 gain, however, eligible shareholders, qualified stock and the issuing corporation all must satisfy certain requirements. These include, but are not limited to, that the investor must have had the stock for a minimum of five years, cannot be a corporation and cannot have acquired the stock via the secondary market.
Only permissible businesses are eligible. Those businesses involving personal services, such as banking, insurance, finance, engineering, architecture, leasing and investing, as well as others such as farming, mining or operating a hotel, motel or restaurant, do not qualify.
If these qualifications are met, there is a tiered structure for the taxes that you may exclude. According to Tarik Awad, of Cohen & Co., the eligible gain is limited to the greater of $10 million ($5 million for married filing separately) or 10 times your tax basis in the QSBS. He also notes that certain states such as California, for example, does not follow the rules of Section 1202, so gains could be taxable in your state.
A Big Ending Can Mean Big Savings
To understand how these strategies can work, let’s consider an illustrative example of a startup owner, Ms. Smith, who established her business in 2013 and sold it in 2019 for $100 million. Let us assume Ms. Smith was the sole owner and started the company as a C corporation with a $10 million cost basis in her stock. Since the company was sold five or more years later, the entire gain would be free from federal tax — evading the alternative minimum tax and the 3.8% net investment income tax (NIIT). This could have resulted in over $21 million in federal tax savings (based on multiplying the $90 million gain by the top long-term capital gain tax rate of 23.8%).
IRC Section 1202 Meets Section 1045
Not only can Section 1202 potentially help you, but so can Section 1045. It is like a 1031 exchange for real estate, except it applies to QSBs. Essentially, it states that if you sell QSBS that has been held more than six months, you can roll over your gain within 60 days by buying shares of another QSB. Section 1045 allows founders and investors to move money from one business venture to the next under certain circumstances — and avoid tax on the appreciation from the first venture.
To illustrate this using the example above, let us assume Ms. Smith exercised a 1045 rollover with $20 million of her profits from the sale of her startup and invested that into a new technology company. If she held the stock of the new venture for five or more years and then sold that business interest, the cost basis rule would apply, and she could mitigate tax on the sale of up to 10 times her QSBS cost basis, or $200 million ($20 million multiplied by 10). Had the company later sold for $200 million, she would have saved over $42 million in federal and NIIT taxes (based on multiplying the $180 million gain by the top long-term capital gain tax rate of 23.8%).
Dynamic tax savings are possible once you know how to leverage these lesser-known sections of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Remember, though: QSBS planning only applies to C corporations and with several key qualifiers. So, if you’re thinking of setting up a new business venture, you must not only consider how you’re going to start the business, but also how you’ll exit. Yes, you must spend money to make money, but it’s not always what you make that matters. It’s ultimately what you keep that counts.

Nothing made sense. These are the questions in my head –
- How can you make a random person king? And why are all the 6 kingdoms okay with a Stark becoming a king, while Winterfell (to which Stark belongs to) wants to be an independent kingdom?
- Both Sansa and Bran have never held even an wooden sword in their hand and they are supposed to rule kingdoms now as King and Queen?!
- What is the point of Jon being Aegon Targaryen? He is the rightful heir to the throne and that wasn’t even revealed to the lords of the other 6 kingdoms? Why?
- How did Dany suddenly turn into a psycho? She was sane for 7 seasons and suddenly became a crazy person? No, watching her selfish brother who sold her burn did not make up for it. Nor did killing slavers who were evil people count. When did she kill innocent people? Why would she kill the very same people that she dreamt of ruling one day?
- Why was Jon acting like a mute in this season? He hardly opened his mouth. He could have counseled Dany and brought her to the right path.
- I hated Sansa right from the beginning. She was responsible for Ned Stark’s death because she wanted to be a queen.
- Winterfell will not bend knee to King who is a Stark but will bend knee to a Queen who is a Stark? What was the logic in that? Bran is a Stark too, just like Sansa so that statement made by Sansa was meaningless.
- Why the hell do they even have a night watch? What are they watching now? Trees?
- Where is the broken section of the wall? They still have gates for Castle Black? What for?
- Why didn’t Drogon try to burn Jon when it knew that Jon killed its mother? What if he is Targaryen? He is still a killer.
- Who makes a corrupt guy like Bronn, a Master of Coin? Nobody in their right mind would allow that corrupt person near the council.
- Why did Bran not counsel them or give them advise on anything? If he knew Dany was going to burn King’s Landing, why didn’t he tell? Is he the villain then? He knew he would be King so stayed quiet all along?
- In what way did Bran becoming three eyed raven help in any of the battles? Did he help them defeat White walkers? Did he help them defeat Cersei? What was the point of him being able to see past and future?
- The worst story arc was that of Jaime. His character growth happened for 7 seasons, only to be thrown under a rubble of rocks in the last season. Why would he go back to Cersei when he knew she was an evil person and had left her for the very same reason?
- Even Arya defeating Night King was pretty unrealistic. How did she cross so many white walkers and reach Night King? Was there an invisible trampoline that she jumped?
- What was Bran doing sending ravens when the Night King attacked? He did not say what he saw there. So what was the point of his warging into Ravens?
- Arya was a faceless person who could change into anyone she wanted. And that ability suddenly vanished now when we were really in need of it. She could have taken the face of a white walker to kill Night King or face of Jaime to kill Cersei or taken anyone’s face. Why didn’t she?
- Arya went to kill Cersei and turned back because Hound asked her to. Hound is another character that I despised. Arya was then drifting aimlessly in King’s Landing and did not die (because she is a main character).
- If you notice, none of the main characters died except for some irrelevant characters.
- The battle with white walkers should have happened after the battle with Cersei. It would have made more sense.
- Why didn’t Greyworm kill Jon as soon as Dany was dead? Why did he wait for 3 weeks to get justice?
- Just inches from where Jaime and Cersei died there was no rubble. Couldn’t they just have run and escaped?
Now that the TV series is over, I hope GRRM ends up finishing the book series. I am waiting for the books desperately to see how he planned the ending. Hoping that it’s not as bad as the ending in the show.
Did you watch the finale? What did you feel?
Some of the best memes I saw online –
I agree with so much of this lol. Bran as king seemed a stretch. Especially on the show- I can MAYBE (emphasis on maybe) see Martin sorta going there, but he’d sell it a lot better and I don’t think he will. How the show did it though is ridiculous! And Jon’s status never being revealed is baffling to me too. All Tyrion had to do was blurt it out. Also- yes, why did Jon like almost never talk??
I think a lot of the problem is they did things backwards. In the books I think Dany is going to wrestle with her “mad queen” urges BEFORE the showdown with the Others, and very possibly redeem herself in the Battle for the Dawn, whereas here they dispensed with the walkers and THEN had Dany go all mad queen on King’s Landing. It’s just a$$ backwards I think and doesn’t give any chance for her to be redeemed (which I think Martin will partially do). Her and Jon going north to face the Others with their dragons…
Back to the show though- yeah Bronn as lord of Highgarden was so laughable. They lost me there. 🙂 And could Bran be any creepier? Even when they made him king- at least humanize him a LITTLE? Good grief- awful. Jaime’s story arc- couldn’t agree more.
I was wondering about the Night’s Watch too since the threat of the walkers seems to have been eliminated, not just “contained”
for another thousand yrs or whatever. I guess Jon is going north to hang with the wildlings??
You summarized the problems pretty well! I think it’s tougher for book readers too, in some ways- for example the whole Unsullied thing. There aren’t THAT many Unsullied where Grey Worm should have been able to dictate (which was asinine) how they deal with Jon or Tyrion or anyone else. I think Dany bought 6,000 Unsullied, or maybe 8,000- don’t remember exactly- but after the battle at Winterfell and at KL she doesn’t have nearly that many left. They wouldn’t be dictating much, I wouldn’t think, after her death! So dumb lol.

They didn’t build up anything. Bran could have helped them win the war or something. They should made him worthy of being a king in the earlier seasons maybe. Out of the blue, he became a king. Very anticlimatic it was. Why was Jon so silent in this season? Are they saying that his love for Dany made him like that? Love empowers most people and doesn’t make them stupid.
Even I thought so. The fight with white walkers should have been after the fight in King’s Landing.
The council at the end was like a joke. Smugglers and cutthroats on the council? Really? Lol
Even in the ending, Bran was like I can track the dragon. Haha. Why didn’t he warg into the dragon earlier and stop Dany from burning the city?
Yeah looks like Jon is just going to chill in the north and become a king of the wildlings maybe? I didn’t understand why wildlings couldn’t stay in the south though.
Exactly, where did so many Unsullied and Dothraki come from? Dothraki died right at the beginning of the fight with whitewalkers. The army from seven kingdoms would anyday outrank any army that Dany has. Nothing made any sense. Hope the books do a better job.
I actually think they all knew Jon’s status. I believe that was what Varys was writing before he was captured. He sent notes to all the lords revealing about Jon being Aegon. That said, it would have been odd for him to become king after assassinating Daenerys. It just wouldn’t suit his character, Also, they had to show some sort of trial and justice, and hence sending him to the wall.
And he doesn’t actually remain there at the end. He kind of moves north of the wall, right? Maybe becoming another Mance Rayder type of character?
I agree that the season compressed things so much that some things were really hard to swallow. I mean the other lords being okay with Bran becoming king? It seemed very unlikely. But I guess after so much war and destruction, nobody really wants the job of rebuilding anyway. And who better suited for it, then the great nephew of Bran the builder. I believe GRRM has a similar type of ending planned, but I think he would build up to it way better than the series.
Since Dany had already gone crazy, I didn’t understand why they had to punish the “true heir” to the throne for assassinating a crazy woman. I guess they just wanted to make the ending surprising and making Jon king would have been too predictable. They should built it up at least I guess by making Bran prove himself worthy of being a king. Yeah I guess he becomes more like Mance Ryder at the end.
I am waiting for the books to come out. GRRM would definitely not leave us hanging with so many questions I guess. These guys were in a hurry to wrap up the series,
Awwww 😦 It wasn’t that bad! I know it had a lot of problems but I still liked it 😀 (I am really good at ignoring bad writing and just enjoying things and not thinking about them haha)
I do agree tho that the 6 kingdoms wouldn’t be okay with a Stark becoming a king, while Winterfell is an independent kingdom. Yara at least would have wanted the Iron Islands to be their own kingdom too.
As for your point about none of the main characters dying, I completely agree. Part of what makes the books so spectacular was that GRRM wasn’t afraid to kill EVERYONE. So why is everyone still alive?!?! I think Jon should have died. I am ok with Drogon not killing him, but GreyWorm would have. He wouldn’t just let him go.
As for the whole in the wall, wasn’t it at the end by the sea? That is where the hound (who I actually really liked his and aryas interactions) saw it coming down in the flame. So it wouldn’t be anywhere near Castle Black?
Great post! I hope the books get written and are much better ❤
The ending was a bit unrealistic considering what happened in the earlier seasons. Yeah GRRM wouldn’t have thought twice about killing Jon. For all we know, Jon might still be dead in the books as that was what happened at the end of book 5.
Hmm what you said makes sense about the wall. It was by the end of the sea like you said. Thanks for reminding me as I had forgotten that detail.
I hope the books are better. Can’t wait to read them. 🙂The Indian government had earlier announced the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for the telecom sector worth Rs 12,200 crore. Now, as per a report from the CNBC-Awaaz, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) is going to issue the final guidelines for the scheme in 1 to 2 days.
The telecom department will soon start inviting the interested companies for submitting applications for the scheme. The application window will be open for the companies for a 1-year period until June 15, 2021. However, Chinese companies have been excluded from the scheme.
Minimum Investment of Rs 100 Crore
The PLI scheme outlays that the companies will need to invest Rs 100 crore at least to be a part of the scheme against which they will receive a 4% or 6% incentive. The scheme will include the production of 4G/5G core equipment, wireless equipment, and radio access network (RAN), Internet-of-Things (IoT), and more.
The department was expected to start inviting applications for the scheme in January this year; however, it got delayed due to unknown reasons.
The PLI scheme for the telecom sector would allow the telecom service providers (TSPs), including Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea (Vi), and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) purchase their equipment directly from the local manufacturers. There would be no import costs involved, which might make it cheaper for the operators to roll out new networks.
Indian operators currently rely on outside companies such as Nokia, Ericsson, Samsung, Huawei, and ZTE. However, the Chinese vendors Huawei and ZTE won’t be able to participate in the government’s PLI scheme for the telecom sector since they are considered a national threat at the moment.
India is soon going to push for the live 5G networks, and the PLI scheme for telecom will help the operators build their 5G core and infrastructure on the foundation of locally manufactured equipment.
It is worth noting that India has also excluded Huawei and ZTE from the 5G trials that the telecom department announced a few days back. The operators will be leveraging the technologies from the European vendors including Nokia and Ericsson for testing their 5G networks in the urban and rural parts of the country.Local Mobile Mechanic Service in Minneapolis MN

The for-in and for-each loops are convenient and likely to be the loops you use most. For this reason alone you should make sure you know what you can and can’t do with them. Here’s one thing I just found can save me some typing and some bloat.
Situations like this come up all the time:
// Loop over some relative URLs for each (var url:String in urls) { var temp:String = url; // Make relative URL absolute temp = "" + url + "?"; // Add query string parameters for each (var query:Object in queries) { temp += query.key + "=" + query.val + "&"; } // Hack off the last "&" temp = temp.substr(0, temp.length-1); }
But do you need the temp variable or can you use url? Is it safe to change the iterator variable? The answer is a comforting and clean “yes”! Changing the iterator will not alter the iteration of the loop in any way.
With that in mind, why not start your week off by rewriting a for-in or for-each loop where you needlessly made a temporary variable? Then repent of temporary variables and write cleaner, less bloated loops from now on. :)

Old Blood Noise Endeavors launch Sunlight – Dynamic Freeze Reverb
Sunlight
Dynamic Freeze Reverb
Dynamics. It’s the shifting ebb and flow of the tide. It’s the ups and downs of life. It’s witnessing night turn into day, as the sun attacks and sustains through the nightly veil, making the darkness release its gloomy grasp and decay. It’s where you’ll find the Old Blood Noise Endeavors Sunlight Dynamic Freeze Reverb. An envelope triggered multi-mode reverb with the ability to dynamically freeze and sustain your notes forever, seeing you create truly mesmerizing sunlit soundscapes.
- Reverb Pedal with 3 modes of Modulation and dynamic Freeze function
-
(centre -, 2,1 mm, ~80 mA current draw)
Building on what made OBNE’s top-selling Dark Star such a stellar early-chain pad reverb, Sunlight twists it into the other dimension as a reverb pedal centered around the idea of a dynamic hold. When you play, your new notes are let through and old notes are allowed to fade away, but when you stop playing, old notes have the chance to repeat forever.
A dead simple to use interface of just two knobs controls the nature of this relationship. In addition, there are three sonic modes that highlight modulation, comb filtering and resonant bandpass filtering, each of which takes their own spin on the reverb signal. The Mix, Input and Decay controls work exactly the same across each mode, as they help control the dynamics.
Mix sets the loudness of the reverb, which goes from all dry to all wet and anywhere in between, allowing you to create everything from subtle reverberations to deep ambient textures. Now, the interplay between Input and Decay is where the real Sunlight magic starts to happen. Decay determines how long the reverb trails will sustain, which will go from quick ephemeral evaporations to infinite reverb pads. On the other hand, Input controls how much of your signal is allowed into and fed back within the reverb. At zero, no new input will be added to your reverb, but as you increase it, more signal is let through, letting you create gently evolving ambient textures or drastically changing synth-like pads.
Rate and Depth are mode-dependent controls. TAPE Mode is a modulated reverb inspired by the unexpected shifts of a tape machine wobbling. Here, Rate and Depth set the speed and intensity of the lopsided vibrato applied to the reverb signal. COMB Mode is a combination of reverb and delay. Four delay lines are placed after the reverb, and the emphasis on stacked short delays creates comb filters like a fixed flanger. Rate sets the time of all four delays, and Depth sets the feedback (or resonance) of the delay section. PASS Mode is a bandpass filter applied between two reverb paths, where a random sample-hold function sets the cutoff frequency of the bandpass. Rate sets the timing of the sample-hold and Depth sets the range of possible cutoff frequencies. If Rate is set to 0, Depth sets a fixed cutoff frequency.
But the sound shaping adventure doesn’t end here. Sunlight also contains a bunch of expressive capabilities performed through the on-board ALT switch, which can be set to change control settings either momentarily or latching. It can be assigned to the Rate, Depth, Decay or Input controls or any combination of the four. You can also control them externally via an external expression pedal, the OBNE Expression Slider or even the OBNE Expression Ramper, which will open up even more creative possibilities.

Signal Blender
Creative Mix Engine
Adding multiple pedals to your pedalboard can often lead to imaginative thoughts such as “which pedal should go into which?” or “what if my clean sound could be mixed with my drive after my reverb, yet before my tremolo?”.
Well the Old Blood Noise Endeavors Signal Blender is here to help with your signal flow and find new sounds, letting you be more original with your own tone. Signal Blender can be used in a variety of creative ways, including as a parallel effect blender, an active ABY in both directions, 3-to-1 mixer, 1-to-3 splitter, volume level setter and so much more.
Through its pair of send/returns connections, the pedal offers an array of parallel routing options, primarily an input and output, volume control and switching. This versatile stompbox, as part of OBNE’s utility line, also offers phase correction switches for both sends, plus clever switching allows for latching or momentary on/off action with trails. In addition, a 9v power thru connection is ideal for not taking up any more precious outlets on your PSU, perfect for that extra pedal you absolutely need to fit onto your board.
Signal Blender can be used as a:
- Parallel effect blender
- 3-to-1 mixer
- 1-to-3 splitter
- Active ABY in either direction
- Volume level setter…and more!

Ok I have been on the forums searching for probably over 8+ hours on info of a flying crank ghost motor for the past week or so (and have been through the forums the past few months but just never signed up). This is my first prop I am really building and starting early so I can fix any problems. But I am still confused on what type of motor to get for the flying crank ghost. All I really know is that it should be a 12VDC gear motor with 4-7 rpm's. I have seen the several tutorials on it and the hundreds of topics. But a big majority of the topics say to get the Dayton motor, which is discontinued, or have links to supplementary motors but the topics are so old that you get an error when going to a link. Now I have heard the whole rotisserie motor, but because I am 17 I don't want to be screwed not getting it to work right. Also being that I am 17 are their any cheaper alternatives to motors because I don't have the money to shell out 50 bucks on a motor for a prop right now. So thanks for any help and sorry for starting another topic on the same stuff over and over again.Read

04.13.2017 • College & Community • College General • Special Events
SANFORD - North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper visited Central Carolina Community College on Wednesday, April 12, to discuss his NC GROW scholarship for free community college that he proposed in his budget and how to prepare North Carolinians for high-paying jobs. The governor's visit is the latest in a series of visits to community colleges across the state that began earlier this year.
His stop at CCCC's Lee Main Campus began at a roundtable discussion with college officials, faculty, and students before continuing with a tour of several career-based academic programs.
Cooper has long been an education advocate and has promoted a proposal that would provide free community college tuition for students meeting certain academic criteria. While his NC GROW scholarship proposal came up in Sanford, other topics were also discussed.
The 20-minute roundtable, which included CCCC President Dr. T. Eston Marchant, touched on a wide range of topics -- beginning with job training.
"The first question I get when I meet with corporate leaders is not, 'What is your corporate tax rate?'" Cooper told the college officials. "The question I get is, 'Do you have a skilled workforce?' You are the key to that.
"Now, I want to hear from you."
Topics included the need to enhance faculty recruitment and compensation to make community colleges more attractive to the best teachers. Bianka Stumpf, CCCC's social sciences lead instructor, said that is a particular concern when much of the policy debates center on K-12 education and state universities.
"We've got to get the business community telling the legislators that we already have the tax cuts," Cooper said. "Now we've got to invest in education."
The governor also heard from two students -- Carson Rosser in nursing and Nickolas Jorgenson in laser and photonics -- about their college experiences.
Jorgenson said he was living in Arizona when he quit his job and sold his car to cross the country and study at CCCC, which offers the only laser and photonics program among North Carolina community colleges. Though he also holds undergraduate and graduate degrees in business, Jorgenson went in a new direction to take advantage of job prospects he described as "out of this world."
After the 20-minute roundtable concluded, Cooper left for a brief campus tour, including college leaders and media. Along the way, he stopped for a robotic welding demonstration and a brief look at the college's computer-integrated machining facility.
But it wasn't all business.
While crossing campus, Cooper visited with some veterinary medical technology students outside with dogs. Cooper, who created an animal welfare hotline during his tenure as attorney general and maintains First Pets of North Carolina, a Facebook page for his own family's pets, didn't miss the opportunity.
After shaking hands with the VMT students and faculty/staff, he made a second pass down the line, holding each of the animals and pausing for photos.
That fact didn't escape Marchant. "For those of you who were not on the tour, he shook hands with people in welding," Marchant told a public gathering later. "He shook hands with the people in machining. But he hugged the puppy dogs."
Though it was a quick visit, about an hour from start to finish, Cooper said he was impressed with what he saw in Sanford and that community colleges like CCCC were essential to how he wants to shape the state.
Cooper said that what he wants out of being governor is to make sure that North Carolina's people are better educated, that they are healthier and that they have more money in their pockets.ALSTER Patio Lovrseat Sofa Cover Deep Seated Heavy Duty and Waterproof Outdoor Lawn Furniture Covers，40" D33 H63 W

We did an episode of this show trying to figure out how oil prices fell to negative $40 per barrel.
Times have changed. Oil is up over $100/barrel. But far more acute is what’s happening with natural gas, particularly in Europe and Asia. In the US, natural gas prices have doubled in the last year. But in parts of Europe, the price has risen more than 5 times.
The disruptions are clear. We’re seeing stories of power shortages in China, fertilizer plants being shut down in the UK, and fears about home heating costs in the Northeast US as winter approaches.
So what the heck is going on? How long might it last? And what does it tell us about the future?
To answer those questions Shayle turns to Leslie Palti-Guzman. the President of Gas Vista and a non-resident fellow at the Columbia Center on Global Energy Policy.
Shayle and Leslie cover the many demand-side and supply-side issues. Then they talk about what comes next: What does this crisis reveal about the vulnerability of the energy system? And will countries double down on renewables, gas, or both to shore up their resiliency?
The Interchange is brought to you by Schneider Electric. Are you building a microgrid? With a microgrid you can store electricity and sell it back during peak times. Keep your power on during an outage. Integrate with renewables. Control energy on your own terms. Having built more microgrids in than anyone else, Schneider Electric has the expertise to help.

Location: India
Project Type: In-progress
Packaging Contents: Seed balls
Packaging Substrate / Materials: Bamboo & Recycled Paper
Printing Process: Foil stamping & digital printing
Terra Seed Balls is an idea, a concept dedicated to serving the environment as well as the people. An approach that brings nature to our store shelves. We aim to do this by selling seed bombs of plants such as vegetables, flowers, etc.
Imagine, you walk into your regular store but this time instead of picking vegetables/fruits for your dinner or flowers for a loved one you pick up seed balls for the same purpose. P.S: Obviously, not for the same days’ dinner though.
The idea is to motivate consumers to grow their very own organic gardens, in the comfort of their homes. The benefits of this are numerous including: Gardening is proven to boost your mental health. Also, it proves to be a good exercise. Your own organically grown food means you consume lesser harmful chemicals. You also benefit financially.
Just imagine, next time when you need tomatoes for that pasta, they’ll be waiting to be plucked right outside your kitchen window.
Also, the packaging is such that it can be repurposed as a generic container by the consumer. The pack of 6 is for regular plants such as tomatoes, roses, ferns, etc. The pack of 12 is designed to market exotic plants such as orchids & also it’s designed to be presentable as a gift hence encouraging people to use it for gifting purposes & promote the movement.
Coming to the primary objective, unfortunately, it hurts to see that majority of the people even today do not understand the threat to our planet caused by our rapidly disappearing flora. They fail to understand the long term benefits of planting a tree hence, we are trying to market the idea of planting with immediate personal as well as environmental benefits.
So, PLANT! This time not just for the forthcoming generations or the planet but for yourself too.
What’s Unique?
I believe the approach to the problem is what makes this project unique. Most of the environmental movements promoting to save our flora speak about the planet & our future generations. But unfortunately, many people yet fail to see the bigger image & support the cause. I am of the hopes that when they’re given an immediate benefit & the experience of trying something new (gardening/kitchen garden) they’ll be more inclined to the idea. Even though this cannot replace a forest it does help to spread some greenery across urban communities.
Also using bamboo as a material means it can be sustainably sourced & composed easily hence not generating any waste.
Had rarity been the key to luxury, there would be nothing as luxurious as nature.LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Michigan Democrats disheartened by Republicans’ dominance of state-level elections have taken comfort in winning big federal races.
But President-elect Donald Trump’s narrow lead over Hillary Clinton in Michigan — which awaits certification by Nov. 28 — has left Democrats to ruminate over what went wrong and to try to rebuild for 2018.
Democrats generally agree the message was lacking — specifically not enough attention on pocketbook issues in a state still recovering from the Great Recession.
When Barack Obama isn’t on the ballot, Democrats have struggled with turnout.
Republicans’ control of the White House and Congress could be a bonus for Democrats in 2018, when a new governor will be elected.
The last time a gubernatorial candidate won Michigan and was from the same party as the president was 1990.Alec Baldwin ignored 'golden rule' of gun safety by pointing pistol at cinematographer, expert says: Star tweets article that he was told gun was safe and attends memorial for woman he shot dead
- Experts say that Alec Baldwin and the Rust crew ignored several critical gun safety rules that could have avoided the tragic death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the movie set Thursday
- Zak Knight, a pyrotechnic and special effects engineer, said there's no reason a gun should pointed at another person and that live ammunition should never be on a movie set
- Baldwin tweeted a Variety article on Friday that he 'was told prop gun was safe before fatal shooting'
- Hutchins' husband shared a touching tribute to his wife following her tragic death on Thursday
- Matthew Hutchins posted sweet a photo of his wife with their 9-year-old son Andros on Twitter captioned: 'Halyna inspired us all with her passion and vision, and her legacy is too meaningful to encapsulate in words'
- Armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed and assistant director Dave Halls were named in a search warrant on Friday
- 'Cold gun!' shouted Halls, a veteran assistant director who worked on Fargo and The Matrix Reloaded
- When Baldwin pulled the trigger, a bullet was fired, killing the cinematographer and injuring the director
- In an interview, Gutierrez-Reed said she wasn't sure if she was ready to be a head armorer
- Meanwhile, troubling reports highlight safety concerns on the set of Baldwin's Western film, Rust
- Production crew on the set of Rust walked out on Thursday morning in a row over safety and long hours
- On Thursday, when they arrived to pack up, they found a team of non-union workers waiting to replace them
- Hutchins decided to stay on the set and film with Alec Baldwin and the film director Joel Souza
Alec Baldwin ignored the golden rule of gun safety by pointing the prop at someone but the gun never should have been loaded with live ammunition to begin with, experts say.
Zak Knight, a pyrotechnic and special effects engineer who is a member of Local 44, told DailyMail.com on Friday: .' Lee was killed in a similar incident when another actor shot him with a prop gun that was loaded with live ammunition while filming The Crow in 1993.
Knight.
Knight said that he'd heard from others involved in the production that there was a walk-out. 'It's very possible that the union members said 'we – on Thursday. Friday and over the weekend but have now been postponed indefinitely.
Reported by: Ruth Styles for DailyMail.com
'There's a direct correlation between maintaining a safe set and the hours that we work. At a certain time there's no such thing as a safe set if we're all exhausted,' Knight, a special effects artist, said.
One Santa Fe prop master told DailyMail.com.'
Baldwin first addressed the tragedy then tweeted a Variety article titled Alec Baldwin Was Told Prop Gun Was Safe Before Fatal Shooting, Affidavit Says.
He was pictured doubled over in grief on Thursday after speaking to the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Department immediately following the shooting.
Hutchins' husband shared a touching tribute to his wife on Twitter on Friday. Matthew Hutchins tweeted a photo of his wife and their 9-year-old son Andros on Friday captioned: .'
His Facebook profile picture is a photo of the couple who had been married for 16 years. His bio now reads: 'We miss you, Halyna.'
A private memorial was held in Santa Fe last night with Matthew, Andros, and Baldwin in attendance, according to ShowBiz411. It was reported that grief counselors were present at the service.
The grieving husband told DailyMail.com on Friday morning that he had spoken with the actor. 'I have spoken with Alec Baldwin and he is being very supportive,' he said..
'I 'the.

'Cold 'total.
'There should have been blanks in the gun, the on-set armorer's job is to check that before handing the weapon over,' Tristan told Dailymail.com.
'They then make sure that the actor stands on a mark and never points the gun at the crew or cast, you give them an aim to point at and the editing makes it seem like they were pointing at their co-actor.
'That 'two misfires' of a prop weapon.
Deadline.
Baldwin's stunt double also accidentally fired two rounds after being told the firearm was 'cold'.. 'long' career.. 'two misfires' of a prop weapon.
A yet-unnamed prop master who oversaw the gun used in the fatal shooting was a non-union worker who was 'just., NM,.
A Santa.'
Last month, actor Jensen Ackles told a conference in Denver how he'd been able to 'choose' his own gun from the female armorer in a haphazard training session. It was not clear whether he was referring to Gutierrez-Reed, the armorer named in the search warrant.
. Halls worked on the sequel The Crow: Salvation..
Lee's family tweeted condolences to Hutchins' and Souza's families: 'Our hearts go out to the family of Halyna Hutchins and to Joel Souza and all involved in the incident on “Rust”. No one should ever be killed by a gun on a film set. Period.'.

By BBN Staff: The Pan Di Riva Restaurant and Bar will hold its grand opening on October 20, 2017, at 6:30 PM at #2 Dawson Lane in Burrell Boom Village in Belize.
Chef Belinda Bishop, the author of “Flavour of Grenada” will be on hand to serve guests with traditional Creole dishes, locally sourced tropical fruits, and special drinks. Owner Douglas Thompson will host the grand opening in memory of his wife, Karen.
Thompson, who is also the owner of the Black Orchid Resort in Burrell Boom Village, will use the occasion of the grand opening to begin the resort’s partnership with The Campaign for Black Male Achievement (CBMA), an American organization that works with young adult black men to ensure the growth, sustainability, and impact of local leaders who are dedicated to improving the lives of black men and youth.
The Black Orchid Resort’s new partnership with CBMA that will officially begin on October 20, 2017, is part of a broader initiative to prepare for the CBMA international summit in July of 2018. The resort will be working with almost 100 young men coming from the U.S. and Belize to encourage them to become leaders and role models.
“The CBMA values three principles: love, learning, and leading, all of which are key to uplifting a network of black leaders across the United States,” said Douglas Thompson. “This is why I am so excited to announce that Black Orchid Resort will be partnering with the CBMA in order to improve the lives of young black men in Belize. By joining this community of over 5,200 members, young black men in Belize will be empowered to share knowledge, resources, and best practices with black male leaders.”
The price to attend the grand opening of the Pan Di Riva Restaurant and Bar is $75 BZD, and attendees are strongly urged to make reservations as space is limited. Guests will have their choice of chicken, fish/seafood, or vegetarian entrees prepared by Chef Belinda Bishop. Reservations can be made by emailing info@blackorchidresort.com or calling (501) 225-9158.
Chef Belinda Bishop is a native of New York City, born to Aruban and Grenadian parents. After working as a line cook in Miami, Chef Bishop rose to become the head Sous Chef for Marriott Hotels, overseeing five different restaurants and 72 chefs.
Chef Bishop has worked with renowned Chef Kerry Simon in New York and is the author of “Flavour of Grenada”, a cookbook featuring traditional Grenadian.This quest begins once you have pledged to Cent from the alliance map in your longhouse at Ravensthorpe. When you leave the room where you spoke with Randvi over the alliance map a brief cutscene will play, during which Dag states his intention to remain in Ravensthorpe. You can insist that he joins or tell him to do as he pleases, but either will result in the same outcome of him refusing and walking away.
Speak with Basim at Saint Hadrian’s Priory
When you’re ready, travel to Cent and speak with Basim at Saint Hadrian’s Priory, in the northern lands of Cent. If you’ve never been to Cent before, one of the quickest ways to get there from Ravensthorpe is by fast travelling to the Lunden docks, and then making your way southeast from there. If you want a more scenic route, you can sail your longship the entire way instead.
The location of Saint Hadrian’s Priory, where you’ll find Basim.
As you arrive at the priory, you’ll find Basim speaking with a monk outside. Approach them to initiate a cutscene. At the end of the scene, you’ll have a few dialogue options with Basim. It doesn’t matter which one you choose, as the same dialogue will play out. Follow Basim after the scene to meet Cynebert. A few more dialogue options will present themselves, but all lead to the same outcome.
Reach the Tonbridge Inn
Once you’re done with Cynebert, travel south to the Tonbridge Inn, just southwest of the Tonbridge Monastery. When you arrive, be sure to use Odin’s Sight to highlight the houses that you’ll need to explore for information. The house on your left as you approach from the north contains a man who won’t be willing to provide information at first, but you can obtain it by bribing him with 165 silver, threatening him with violence, or charming him if you have at least level 3 charisma. Alternatively, you can enter the locked room in the house to your right (south) by shooting through the window at the lock. You can speak to the men inside without needing to persuade them.
However you get the information, once you have it you’ll need to speak with a drunken bard nearby. You’ll find him under the bridge to the northwest. If you need help identifying the precise location, use your raven to scout the highlighted area. You’ll find that the bard isn’t sober enough to provide you with any useful information, so you’ll need to sober him up. You can do this by carrying him to the river nearby, and throwing him into it. Once he’s out of the water, speak with him. He’ll attempt to bribe you for the information you require, but don’t bother paying it. Just pursue the other dialogue options until you get the information you need.
Find the Emissary at Dover Fortress
When you’ve extracted the information regarding the location of the emissary from the bard, you’ll need to travel to Dover Fortress on the southeast coast of Cent. Since you’re by the water at the bridge, you can summon your longship to sail around the coast, or you can choose to travel through the heart of Cent if you’d prefer to explore a bit first. Either way, once you arrive at Dover Fortress, use your raven to scout the general area where you’ll find the emissary. This should be the western part of the fortress, near the entrance. You’ll need to enter the fortress and use Odin’s Sight as you wander through it, to highlight the exact location of the emissary.
Once you have identified the emissary, you can try to steal the message by approaching them from behind, but this can be difficult with all the guards nearby. It will depend on your luck in terms of where the emissary is located within the western part of the fortress, as this will be random. You can just as easily assassinate the emissary and loot them, then run from the alerted guards. Or you can stay and kill all the guards if you really want to. When you have the letter, the quest will complete.

I blame the covid quarantine. In case you're in the same boat, I've got the perfect dish for you: savory pear gratin with prosciutto gruyere breadcrumbs. Heck, even if you're not planning for the holidays just yet, this dish will make a great addition to the dinner table. It's definitely different but hits the sweet and savory notes perfectly. Oh, and did I mention? It's easy to make!
Savory Pear Gratin with Prosciutto Gruyere Breadcrumbs
Ingredients
Pear gratin
- ½ cup butter
- 5 pears
- 1 red onion thinly sliced
- 1 teaspoon fresh thyme
- 1 teaspoon fresh rosemary chopped
- salt and pepper
Prosciutto gruyere breadcrumbs
- 3 ounces prosciutto chopped
- 1 cup homemade breadcrumbs or panko
- ½ cup gruyere grated
- ½ teaspoon black pepper
Instructions
- Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
- Melt ½ cup butter in a saute pan over medium heat and continue to gently simmer until browned, about 4-5 minutes. The butter should smell nutty when ready. Remove from heat and set aside.
- Core and cut the pears in half. Slice each half into 6 slices. Gently toss the pears with the sliced red onion, fresh thyme, rosemary, and half of the browned butter. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer the pears to a 9x13 inch baking dish and lay in one even layer. Cover the pan with foil and bake for 30 minutes.
- Meanwhile, make the prosciutto gruyere breadcrumbs. Toss together the prosciutto, 1 cup breadcrumbs, ½ cup grated gruyere, ½ teaspoon black pepper, and the remaining browned butter together until well combined.
- Remove the pears from the oven and sprinkle the breadcrumbs in an even layer on top. Bake uncovered for 20 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from the oven and let sit for 10 minutes before serving.
**Helpful tips and common mistakes
Ready to make this savory pear gratin with prosciutto gruyere breadcrumbs? Let's jump right in.
Before we can begin, we need to pick the right pears. I chose Anjou pears because they can withstand high temperatures and are incredibly juicy, making them the perfect candidate. However, you can also use Bosc pears which hold their shapes a little better when baked. Bartlett pears are also ideal but make sure they're not too ripe or they will become too mushy when cooked.
Make the pear filling by cooking butter until browned and nutty. I love brown butter and it just works so well with this dish.
Slice the pears into 12 slices per pear. You may need to adjust the slices if the pears are on the smaller side. You don't want them too thin or they will melt away and disappear when baked. Toss the sliced pears with the browned butter, red onion, and herbs. The red onion will add another touch of sweetness to the gratin while the herbs add a hint of savoriness.
Pop the pears into the oven, covering the pan, and bake for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, get the breadcrumbs ready.
I could eat these prosciutto gruyere breadcrumbs just by themselves it's so good. If possible, use fresh breadcrumbs for the best results. I like to make my own breadcrumbs and keep some of the crumbs a bit on the larger side to add more texture to the gratin. If that just seems like a hassle, panko breadcrumbs are a fine alternative.
Finish the gratin by sprinkling the breadcrumbs on top and baking until golden browned. Let it sit for 10 minutes before diving right in to let the gratin settle.
I love making new dishes for Thanksgiving and I already know this savory pear gratin is going to be a winner. In fact, I think I need to add this to the weekly dinner menus, it's so scrumptious.

Ain't a bit of squid here! Instead we fall back on the squid's digitally impaired cousin, the octopus... The author of the original article, Meryl Constance, cautions buyers to make sure that the octopi one buys are pre-tenderized. She notes that traditional Australian methods for tenderizing octopi include using rocks, bricks, cement mixers and even washing machines. (No kiddin'!) Raw Materials first encountered this salad in Argentina, where it could be bought from top-flight delicatessen counters for an instant picnic. The pink of the octopus pieces with the green of the herbs makes this a very pretty salad. Prepare a 2 to 3 kg octopus and precook it. [See note below. S.C.] While it is cooking, whisk together in a glass bowl 300 mL good olive oil, the juice of 1 or 2 lemons (taste and stop when the balance is right), salt, pepper and generous amounts of finely chopped garlic, shallots, chives and parsley. The dressing should be thick with the herbs. When the octopus is tender, drain it, cut it up into generous chunks and, while it is still warm, fold it into the dressing. Serve the salad at room temperature, with plenty of crusty bread.
NOTE: Chances are if you buy your cephalopod in a supermar-ket in the US it will already be cooked. If not, follow these steps from earlier in the article...
"Cut through the head/body above and below the eyes. Discard this section. Slit the back of the head and turn it inside out, discarding all the contents (unless you want to keep the ink sac for a particular recipe). Push the beak (in the center of the star of tentacles) through and out...Skinning is quite unnecessary and very fiddly. If you prefer to do so, it is much easier after cooking than before.
A large octopus needs precooking for many dishes. Put it in a saucepan and just cover with lightly salted water. Simmer gently until the point of a knife slides easily into the meat++maybe one hour, maybe longer.
The deep mauve stock which results need not be discarded when you drain the octopus. It is very rich (in fact, it will often set to a jelly in the fridge) and makes a wonderful soup..." Makes 6 to 8 servings.

There Are Still Advantages to a Hub
The evolution of digital assistants and smart speakers has really changed the smart home game. While there are certainly still advantages to having a dedicated hub, the lines are being blurred. You can do a lot with nothing more than your phone.
That being said, there are still some reasons that you might want a dedicated hub for your smart home. (But some people disagree and argue that you don’t need a hub!)

The smoke alarm going off. I’d rather the house burns down than hear your incessant wailing you beepy bastard.
The kitchen drawer won’t open because of the big pasta spoon – or the potato masher. They’re in it together.
When you have to create a new password that asks for a capital letter, a lower case letter, three symbols, two numbers and the moon on a f**king stick. Like hackers are all standing by ready to break into my Tesco grocery account.
Then when you immediately forget that password and have to go through the entire process again.
When you only discover there’s no milk after pouring the cereal into your bowl or tea into the mug.
The dishwasher beeping to tell you it’s ready to unload. Then it keeps on beeping and beeping and beeping until you reluctantly go and open it, shouting ‘YOU ARE NOT THE BOSS OF ME!’ But you know it is.
When toast pops up before you are quite ready to deal with the effort of spreading butter on it. I literally just sat down, you bready little arsehole.
When the landline rings, any time ever.
Pizza menus. They’re not fooling anyone – they’re from cheapo takeaways that do every type of fast food, and the pizzas will be crap. Through the door and into the recycling seamlessly.
When you go to open a bottle of wine and discover it has an actual cork like the olden days. You lost your corkscrew in 2008.
Since the beginning of time humans have become enraged by being unable to find the end of the sticky tape. We can put a man on the moon but you’re telling me there’s no way of inventing sticky tape where you find the end first time?

Listing information last updated on November 26th, 2021 at 7:01pm MST.Fashion companies around the world have been adapting to the pandemic, as many of us have. And some companies are promoting new technology on their fabrics or textiles that prevent bacteria and viruses.
But CNN reports that the claims may be more for marketing than virus prevention.
Burberry introduced masks that they claim protect from microbes and germs. Under Armor’s new sport mask claims it has antimicrobial properties. And an Italian denim maker “Diesel” claims its jeans are “virus fighting.”
CNN reports that most of these claims have not been tested and have not been approved by U.S. regulators.
Amy Price, a senior research scientist and Stanford university -- who also helped advise the World Health Organization on its face mask guidelines -- told CNN that bacteria and viruses have different ways of reproducing, making it hard to fight all of them.
Price also said that you need to be careful what treatments are on clothing items, especially masks which are worn on your face. She says that it is important to make sure that whatever you use is FDA approved.
In some cases, the technology -- like the one used in the jeans -- claims that it can kill the coronavirus in two hours. But, price says that is a lengthy disinfection time because a person can breathe in the virus in fractions of a second.
Price told CNN that there may be a future in antimicrobial technology, but right now there is just too incomplete a picture.
Ultimately, everyone should just stick to what the national and global organizations recommend. Wash your hands often, wear a multi-layered mask that fits close to your face and continue to stay six feet from one another.Editorial: Honored for political coverage
"News consultants" are those crafty people hired by second and third-place television stations. "News consultants" tell TV news operations to do this or don’t do that, because some second-place station in Philadelphia or Indianapolis gained a rating point by trying the same scheme.
We here at KSBW and Hearst are fortunate to not use news consultants. One thing those consultants say is: "political news coverage is boring; avoid it at all costs."
Thank goodness we ignore advice like that! Or else I wouldn’t be able to tell you that KSBW and our Hearst station-group were honored last week with the coveted Walter Cronkite Award from University of Southern California’s Annenberg School of Communications for our "Commitment 2014" political coverage.
This was the eighth consecutive election-cycle where our company has won this award and ours was the only TV station group to receive it.
We think local political coverage is an essential part of what we’re here to do; in addition, our Hearst Washington Bureau provides daily political coverage from our nation’s capital, with a focus on our Central Coast and local Congressman, when needed; and our Hearst sister-station in Sacramento provides KSBW with customized reports from our state capital.
We’re already at work on "Commitment 2016"!
Now we don’t do what we do to win awards. We work hard every day because so many of you count on us: on KSBW, Central Coast ABC, and on KSBW.com and our mobile app. Our greatest honor is that you continue to make us the No. 1 source for Central Coast news, weather, and local information. Thank you.
Auspicious journalism awards like this Cronkite are gratifying; but your continued enthusiastic support each day is even better.Access Guide

In face-to-face situations, the use of facial expressions, body language, and proxemics all serve to show empathy and engagement. Unfortunately, when these cues are taken away, managing the customer complaint becomes an even bigger challenge and introduces more opportunities for miscommunication or escalation.
For this reason, it's essential that the customer service agent uses top-notch telephone skills to resolve the complaint satisfactorily.
So how do we overcome these challenges when dealing with customer complaints via telephone? Below, we've listed ten simple tips to get you on the right path:
Actively Listen
Complaints aren't always a negative. They can also be an opportunity to gain your company a great review by going above and beyond with your resolution. For example, if a replacement product was sent, then consider calling the customer to check they received it and that they are happy with it. If the resolution involved escalation, then call your customer to update them on what's happening. In fact, research by Harvard Business Review shows the value of complaints in driving repeat business.
Manage complaints effectively by taking part in one of our high-impact training courses. Our courses are tailored to ensure they hit the right spot for our clients. They are then delivered on-site via a member of our fully qualified training team.
Whether you're in Dorset, Devon, Cornwall, or Somerset, we have a fantastic team of trainers on your doorstep and ready to help!The Online Student Directory is now available!

A straight line shooting upwards, or a curvy line that represents the ebbs and flows of career changes or on-ramping? Now, there’s a new way to consider the trajectory of your career, and it’s called being a “portfolioist.”
In the Quartz article, “The Career of the Future Looks More Like a Portfolio Than a Path,” the idea of what your career could like is up for debate. With the leaps and bounds that work flexibility has played in how, when, and where people work, the traditional 9-to-5 job is rapidly becoming obsolete. In turn, more workers can tackle multiple projects that reflect their skills, experience, education, and yes, passion in an entirely new way.
Portfolioist or Freelancer
But wait, you think. Isn’t that just freelancing with a fancy bow and a new name? Not really. A portfolioist seeks out work that is a true reflection of who they are and where their interests lie. These types of workers align their many passions—as well as past jobs and/or careers—and join all of their collective talents to jobs and create a career that is at once professional and personal, diversified and flexible.
While portfolioists, much like freelancers, may be self-employed, many aren’t. They use their talents to create multiple revenue streams that bring varying levels of income and experience to their portfolio. They are adept at assessing what employers need, and then use the sum total of their work experience and talents to help them attain their goals.
Unlike freelancers, portfolioists might not have just one recurring theme in their portfolio, but a wealth of work that spans several industries and former careers. They are less concerned with a label, (i.e., “I’m a writer”) and focused instead on matching their qualifications to a job, regardless of title.
What It Takes to be a Portfolioist
If becoming a portfolioist makes sense at this point in your career to you, consider what it would truly take to become one. First, you’ll need to determine how you’d like to work—do you want to work remotely, report to an office (even sometimes), or would you rather work from wherever the wind takes you?
You’ll also need to be able to handle the risk factor intrinsic in being a portfolioist. Similar to freelancers, you might be paid in a salary, in trade, in retainers, equity, or even pro bono, if you’re in an apprenticeship role as you learn new tools of the trade. Be sure to factor in your finances as well and decide what type of job(s) you’re interested in, whether it’s a full-time, remote job, for example, or a series of short-term, freelance gigs—and most importantly, how many of them you’ll be able to juggle at one time.
Types of Portfolios by Age
The answers to these aforementioned questions will most likely be determined by your age. If you’re new to the job market, your focus would be to build a skills portfolio, where you’ll attain the necessary skills and education to make yourself marketable. If you’re in the middle of your career, you should consider striving for a results portfolio. This portfolio will focus less on what you know and more on your accomplishments, ability to be a flexible worker, and your specific areas of expertise. And finally, if you’re an older worker who’s considering portfolioism, then your portfolio would be a master one. This showcases your expertise and the wealth of experience and knowledge you would bring to any role.
While the branding of being a portfoliost is a new concept, the idea behind it really isn’t. At the end of the day, workplace flexibility has paved the way for people to work how, when, and where it makes the most sense for them. So whether you call yourself a remote worker, a telecommuter, a freelancer, or even a portfolioist, it all comes down to having the flexible work options to pursue a career that is meaningful to you on every level.

Adorned in old jeans and muddy sneakers, the volunteers were tasked with transforming the garden and helping to create an outdoor amphitheater/classroom for students and teachers to use year-round.
During the project, volunteers assisted with a number of tasks, including weeding and tilling the garden; leveling, debarking, sanding and sealing 30 donated tree stumps; and creating rock pathways throughout the garden to make it easier for children to explore. Despite sweating through a hot afternoon while lugging 165 bags of rocks, and chipping away at stump-after-stump, there was no shortage of fun.
Brightspot Employees Working Hard at Buzz Aldrin Elementary
Brightspot employee Crystel Harmon said she enjoyed bonding with her coworkers and listening to the staff from Aldrin explain why the outdoor classroom is such a wonderful addition to the elementary school. Justin Stegura’s favorite part of the day was looking at the garden after they’d put the finishing touches on it.
This outing at Aldrin Elementary follows Brightspot’s back-to-school supply drive with the school. Employees from Brightspot sponsored 55 students, providing them with school supplies in preparation for the first day of classes.

“At Brightspot, one of the pillars of our mission is youth,” remarked Parker Ramsdell, who leads the company’s mission-related projects. “Our aim is to form a long-lasting partnership with Aldrin that allows our employees the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of their students. Our first two projects—improving the outdoor learning space and the back-to-school supply drive—were a huge success. We are very excited to do more with Aldrin throughout the year and grow this partnership into something truly special.”

The top coat is rubbed back to reveal a little of the base colour, which creates the impression it’s worn over time. For a more authentic look, ensure you rub back the top coat in the places where it would naturally receive the most wear and tear, which is predominately the edges.
You can use regular acrylic paint for this project but we’ve chosen to use chalk paint as its matte, chalky finish is conducive to creating an aged appearance. It also sticks to almost anything, so requires little-to-no prep — and the drying time is incredibly fast so you don’t have to wait long between coats. The only downside is the matte finish will mark easily, so you must seal with a wax or acrylic sealer. We used beeswax.
What you will need:
- Warm damp cloth
- Sandpaper (if needed)
- Chalk paint in your chosen base colour
- Chalk paint in your chosen top colour
- Beeswax and a soft cloth
What to do:
1. Thoroughly clean your furniture.
2. If there are any obvious bumps or flakes, lightly sand and wipe clean — otherwise you can skip this step.
3. Apply one or two coats of your base colour and allow to dry.
4. Apply one coat of your top colour and allow to dry.
5. Lightly sand back the top coat in selected spots to reveal the base colour.
6. Apply a small amount of beeswax with a soft, clean cloth (an old t-shirt is perfect), wiping off any excess as you go.

The Big Island has more coral in the waters near its shores than any other major Hawaiian island.
New maps from a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration coral reef studyshow that live coral covers 57 percent of the waters surrounding the Big Island. That’s more than 29 square miles of living reef.
The NOAA findings support previous studies that geologically young islands generally have more live coral cover than older islands. The Big Island — with land added to its acreage every day thanks to the continuing eruption at Kilauea volcano — is the youngest in the entire Hawaiian chain.
Another interesting fact from NOAA’s study?
Hawaii’s coral reefs contribute an estimated $360 million annually to the state’s economy by supporting tourism and recreational industries, protecting shorelines from storm damage and creating habitat for fish and invertebrate species with commercial value.
Take care of our reefs, folks. Even better, e-mail us a photo of your extra careful visit to one of our reefs.Khyber Medical University is inviting an application form for the BS Nursing 4 year program for the fall semester KMU Nursing Admission 2021 how to apply.
