How to setup ODIS Engineering 6.7.5:
I believe with odis-e 6.7.5 you have to use the projects found in odis-s 3.1.3.
That is one way of doing it. Admin—>diagnostic data—>ODX update index file 1
I am using the other method Admin- Save Locations – Diagnostic data – engineering odx projects (…) Target directory. Just select the project directory of odis-s 3.1.3.
In case you have o-e 6.6.1 do the same with odis-s 3.0.3
I am not sure if it will create problems if one tries to use newer project versions than the ones I have paired with above. Not tested. I try to be consistent, to have compatible pdu-api with hardware in hand.
In case you want to install a newer odis-s first install the odis you need for the odis-e version you have, copy the projects to project engineering project folder and then uninstall that odis-s in order to install the newer version you wish. Use new folder directory were you copied the projects to.
SORTED!!!
The Q7 4M platform requires the use of the project file “AU73X” and NOT MLBEvo, and my bro’s Q5 8R requires Au48x. Was able to successfully flash the gearbox!

We provide..This is a birth story. It's long, because my labor was long, and it's got some gross details. Consider yourself warned!
Working as a team, we were managing the contractions as they came. In between contractions, Dave would be tidying up, or putting together last minute snacks for the birth center. He would drop whatever he was doing and come push on my back when I started to moan. Timing contractions with an iPhone app is a joke. I mean, really? You have to press a button when they start, and then again when they stop, and that's fine if your phone doesn't sleep in between, let alone having the presence of mind to remember to hit start or stop! At one point I decided I wanted to try a contraction on all fours, leaning over my headboard to see if that was more manageable. I got into bed on my hands and knees, and as a contraction hit, I felt a crazy feeling, then a warm gush. I jumped up yelled "aaahhh" and ran to the bathroom. The contraction must have moved the baby to allow a gush of water and other stuff to come out. I felt like things were progressing, so I had the hubby page the midwife. It was around 1:30p at this time. When she called back, she listened to me go through a contraction, and I told her they were about 3 minutes apart, but only lasting 30 seconds. She suggested I call my Doula over, and labor with her until contractions reached a full minute, with similar spacing.
Hubby called our Doula, and she arrived at the house at 2:30p. It was a beautiful sunny fall day. We had our back doors open, and I was just sitting on the end of the couch, facing the outside with the fresh air and sunshine blowing in. Maria, our Doula is amazing. She brought a TENS unit with her, and immediately put it on my back to help me get through the contractions, and to give Dave a little break. The TENS unit immediately relaxed/distracted me perfectly through contractions. For the next 3 hours, I worked through contractions with the hubby, and guidance from Maria. She was timing contractions, and when they got to be about 45 seconds long, 3 minutes apart, we paged the midwife to see if we could head to the birth center. The only thing I wanted to do was jump into the giant tub and soak.
The three of us (Maria, hubby, and myself) arrived at the birth center before my midwife. Since the birth center is unstaffed, we had no way of getting inside. I couldn't stand sitting in the car, contractions were sucking big time at this point- they were all consuming. I was slowly slipping into my own world just to cope and keep a rhythym. After about 20 minutes in the parking lot (seemed MUCH longer) I had to use the restroom so bad. By some crazy miracle, an intern for the birth center showed up to get some stuff done, and was able to let us in. My only focus was on restroom. She asked me what birthing suite I wanted, and I somehow coherently (but probably not nicely) told her to ask the hubby to pick. Once I emerged from the bathroom, I was greeted to the site of my midwife and the hubby leading us to what would be our birth suite for the next 13 hours.
The room was the size of a large bedroom. It was decorated somewhat modern, with beige walls, a king size platform bed, low couches, and lots of great light. I saw the tub, and asked "can I get in?" "Let's get you checked out first, while we fill the tub" my midwife said. I laid on the bed and she was happy to find that I was 6cm and proclaimed that my cervix was amazing. I guess that meant it was doing whatever it was supposed to be doing. Once she was done, I practically ripped off the rest of my clothes (all modesty was gone at this point, and if you know me, that says A LOT) and dove head first into the tub. OMG- it was amazing. Exactly what I hoped it would be. I got comfortable, and let the contractions come as they pleased. I didn't fight anything and slipped into my head. I knew I was making crazy moaning noises, these served a few purposes for me- allowed me to announce when I was having a contraction, distracted me with the sounds, kept a rhythym going, and because I didn't know what else to do. Maria and the hubby sat by my side at the edge of the tub for hours while I went through transition. Transition was nothing at all what I thought it would be like. I expected to get sick like many women do. I expected to have vocalizations of not being able to do it. Instead, I was entirely inside myself. Unaware of time, or anything outside of my body. I do remember after about 3 hours of me being in the tub, my midwife wanting to check to see if I was fully dialated yet. She was able to check me in the tub, and found that I was 9.5cm. This surprised her because she hadn't seen me make any pushing moves/sounds. She said I was too relaxed, and that I would need to try a new position to dialate the rest of the way and start pushing. I believe it was around 10pm at this point.
Here is where things got nuts. I got out of the tub and onto a birth stool. I did not like the birth stool like I thought I would. It was not relaxing for me, and I felt like it would hinder the baby from coming out. While on the birth stool, they did a baby heart rate check with the doppler and found that the heart rate was a little low for what they liked. They asked me to move to the bed and lay on my side. I got up and layed on the bed. The midwife checked me again and found that my cervix had vanished, it was time to push. Except, I wasn't feeling pushy. At all. She suggested on the next contraction, I direct my push towards where she was putting pressure inside me. I did that, and was met with a lot of praise. "Excellent, you just moved your baby down a bunch. We need to keep this up." The assisting midwife held my right leg and bent it at the hip as much as it would go, and my Doula had the left side. The hubby was laying on the bed next to me feeding me water between pushes, and keeping a wet wash cloth on my forehead. I was sweating like crazy. I hated the pushing. Once again, something that surprised me about this experience. I thought I would love pushing, as I could feel the progress and something different than contractions. This was not the case. Mostly because I was under the impression that at some point my body would just take over, and do its thing. Rather, I had to initiate every push, and even though they were incredibly effective, I was laying down and did not have the aid of gravity to secure my progress. Every baby heart rate check was good, so they really wanted me to stay on my side. My legs were restless, this was not how I wanted to be pushing! One of my main reasons for choosing midwife care is because I wanted to be mobile in labor. I wanted to stand, squat, be on all fours, whatever felt best. I finally worked up the energy to leave my head and ask if I could move positions. They suggested I get on all fours and hang onto the headboard. I had a few pushes in that position, and again, I was met with a dropping heart rate, and pushes that weren't as effective, defying gravity. I heard mumblings of "maybe short cord?" and "contractions are not long enough". I caught a glimpse of the clock and realize Saturday had come and gone, it was now Sunday 9/22.
I just focused on the sweating, and the annoyance from every 15 minute BP checks, and every 10 min baby heart rate checks. I was exhausted and just wanted my body to take over. This went on for 6 hours. The hubby was in and out of sleep while I was struggling in my head to remember why I thought this would be a good idea. It wasn't painful, it was just mentally exhausting. I kept hearing they could see the baby's head and that I was so close. There finally reached a time when the baby's head was very low and visible at all times, the midwife said to me "you've been pushing for 6 hours. You need to get this baby out, or we need to transfer to a hospital." I could feel a baby coming out of my vagina. There was no way I was moving anywhere. The midwife suggested we move back to the birth stool to use gravity to get the baby to crown, and ultimately, out. The midwife informed me that once the head was out, I might have problems with the shoulders, and if that was the case, they would move me to all fours again to get the shoulders out (Gaskin manuever). That nearly destroyed my spirit. Since the baby took/was taking so long to descend, I had plenty of time to stretch out and get used to each new phase of pain. The body is an amazing thing. My midwife commented that she would be very surprised if I tore at all. That made me feel good. I moved to the birth stool again, and Dave was behind me supporting me so I could lean back and hold onto his legs. Things moved very quickly once on the birth stool.
I kept feeling more and more burning/stretching to the point where I kept thinking "how is this baby not crowning yet?!" Finally I heard my midwife announce his crown, and then not very much later, his head was out. I thought there would be massive relief after the head, but it was only slightly better. The next thing I knew, the entire birth team was instructing me to push like mad, don't stop, keep with it...and then I felt the biggest relief/rush of my life. I knew exactly what had just happened, and I looked down to see a mix of blue baby, red blood, A LOT of blood, and big testicles hanging out. "Its a booooyyyy" I exclaimed. I felt the hubby relax and begin to cry with raw emotion over the whole experience. I'm sure some of the tears were pure joy for a baby boy. He really wanted a boy (what guy doesn't?). I was on cloud nine. I immediately stood up and made my way to the bed where I laid down and baby boy was handed to me. He had the biggest cone head I'd ever seen, but his eyes were wide open looking at me. He was warm and the softest thing I'd ever felt. He smelled incredible- better than puppy paws, and was seriously amazing, all encompassing, distracting, and I couldn't stop staring at him. I did it! I thought. I really did it. I can't believe I just did it. With the hubby laying next to me, we spent the next 20 minutes fawning over our new baby, trying to decide what to name him, counting his fingers and toes, and just in total bliss. The midwives commented on what a big baby he was. I had no concept of that, I just knew I loved him. They were guessing at least 9 lbs. I couldn't stop thinking about how lucky I was. How much I love my husband, and this new little thing that I just met. I mean, everyone says their babies are perfect immediately upon birth, but really, how can that be true? It is. Some evolutionary shit or something, but it's true.
I still had some work to do, I needed to deliver the placenta, and get baby boy to latch on. I was a little nervous about the placenta, because I could already feel things swelling up, and all my pushing muscles were so exhausted. I was also informed that I would need a few stitches because of the quickness he came out once I was on the birth stool. My midwife instructed me that when I felt a cramp, to give just a slight push. She said "you'll love it, don't worry." I felt a twinge in my uterus and every so slightly pushed. Next came the second best feeling of relief I'd felt that day. Out came a giant slimy placenta and tons more fluid. It felt really similar to when I was home and had that random gush during a contraction. My midwife was right. Next, Maria worked with me to get baby boy to latch on. The hubby and I were still working on names.
With baby boy latched on and sucking away, we went over the list of names on the hubby's iPod. Jacob? The hubby said, "he looks like a Jacob?" I liked the name, but wasn't totally sold on it. Then he listed off Cyprus. "Oh, I like that, can you look up the meaning real quick?" The hubby did, but I already knew that was his name. I had also told the hubby that if we had a boy, I wanted his middle name to be a tribute to my dad's brother, Theodore. So there we had it. Cyprus Theodore. The hubby was busy making the text announcements to friends and family while the worst part of labor began for me- the stitch up. Yowww. Getting lidocaine shots in your hooha after just delivering a large baby is not the best thing. Further more, getting stitched up for what seems like an eternity is not cool either. Eventually the lidocaine kicked in and things were better, but man, that was enough for me to decide I'll only be doing this once! The only thing I could think about next was getting cleaned up. My midwife suggested I get back into the bath, and take Cyprus with me. Yes! Best idea ever. Taking our first bath together and getting cleaned up was yet another experience I will never forget. Cyprus loved the bath, and I loved getting all the birth goo washed away. I couldn't believe how great I felt. Except starving. I was sooooo hungry. I just wanted to get home with my family, eat something, and go to sleep.
Cyprus still needed to go through his newborn evaluation, get his vitamin K shot, get weighed, measured, etc. He weighed in at 9lbs, 9oz (holy crap! My first birth was a 9.5lb baby?!?! Guess they were right all along) and measured an impressive 22 inches. The hubby was beaming and so proud the whole time. He got Cyprus dressed up in going home clothes, we finished everything up with the midwife, and set to head out. We struggled a little getting him into the carseat, we should have brought the manual. Ha, dad figured it out like a champ after a few minutes. Away we went, 4 hours after Cyprus hit the floor we were on our way home. I got everything I wanted out of my birth. Every. Single. Thing.E thesis penn state

Civil society organisations were jointly hosting a land workshop to review the current status of Namibia's land reform process, which they have criticised as slow and riddled with inconsistencies and allegations of corruption and favouritism. The workshop, to be attended by 80 people, will focus on critical aspects emerging from the two main land reform programmes resettlement and the acquisition of commercial land through the Affirmative Action Loan Scheme (AALS) of Agribank. The organisations question the criteria and management of the two programmes, criticising the process as not pro-poor anymore, and not having the desired impact of poverty alleviation. "Whereas the willing-buyer/willing-seller concept remains problematic, we are also worried about reports that the government is not buying most of the land that is being offered. Therefore there is a need to drastically increase the budget for land reform," the organisers said.
Critical concerns were raised that the resettlement programme initially intended for poor individuals and communities now seems to benefit high-income earners and high-ranking public officials. They said concerns have also been raised that people from distant regions are being favoured at the expense of landless communities living near resettlement farms. Other concerns are a lack of post-settlement support, illegal fencing in communal areas, tenure security in communal areas, water and other infrastructural deficiencies, and allegations of favouritism and nepotism in the allocation of resettlement land. Another aspect that will come under the spotlight is current land disputes including growing disputes in the former 'Rehoboth Gebiet' - and the consideration of recommendations to resolve these disputes.
Amongst those critical is the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Namibia. Speaking at a media conference to announce the programme of the workshop, Uhuru Dempers from the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Namibia's desk for social development, blamed the country's escalating inequalities on the slow progress in implementing land reform. Dempers also blasted that the resettlement programme, in its current format, was putting more emphasis on the quantity of people resettled as opposed to improving the quality of lives of the resettled. He said: "It is a matter of historical record that colonial dispossession of land has robbed black Namibians of the only livelihood they had resulting in massive poverty. Despite many attempts by government and other stakeholders, twenty one years after independence, the situation has not improved much. Inequality is on the increase and the country has failed to make a dent on poverty levels and unemployment because of massive job losses in the agricultural sector. The high income inequalities existing in different Namibian communities are partly rooted in the fact that the majority of Namibia's black population does not have access to land as a resource to earn a living."
He also raised concern that while the resettlement programme was intended for poor and low income individuals and communities, recent beneficiaries had however included high income earners and high ranking public officials. Dempers added that there was need to clarify the criteria for resettlement.

It is a pity, that I can not participate in discussion now. I do not own the necessary information. But with pleasure I will watch this theme.I don’t know if you’ve watched any of Freddie Wong’s videos on Youtube. They’ve got amazing visual effects.
In this latest video, Freddie speculates on the future of interactive gaming. He runs around, shoots at Chimera monsters from Resistance (Insomniac actually animated them for this video) and even takes a few hits himself. Freddie doesn’t take himself too seriously in this video and it’s pretty entertaining.
Check it out:
The Highlights:
Freddie takes a massive extension cord outside. It’s ugly, utterly unsophisticated and plugged into the Playstation in his backpack. Interestingly I own the same backpack. The silly camera on his head scans the alleyway and it renders a bunch of baddies for him to shoot. Not surprisingly Freddie takes out the first wave but is shot close to 7 times by a second group. No damage, although as an aside I do wonder how damage would be recorded in an interactive gaming setting like this. Anyway, Freddie activates a grenade from his Playstation Move controller and chucks it, figuratively.
According to Freddie, the technology required to set up a 3D shindig like this is already available. It still needs a lot of work but the video we just saw closely resembles what we might get in the near future.
I really like the video! ! I will send it to all my.Digital transformation projects need leadership. So what is the difference between top-down and bottom-up leadership? As a concept, bottom-up leadership emerged from the egalitarian ideals that swept the Western world in the 20th century. These emphasise participation as a means of drawing on all the skills and knowledge an organisation’s employees have to offer. But while bottom-up leadership is often framed as the path toward innovation, top-down approaches have always remained important in practice and may even be seeing an ideological resurgence.
Top-down leaders set a clear direction – one that does not always value everyone’s input equally – but crucially, they do listen when it helps with innovation. Steve Jobs, for instance, famously directed the consumer tech market through singular products and design choices that were Apple’s own, rarely ever listening to focus groups or chasing existing trends. This led to Apple becoming one of the world’s most successful companies and the most widely recognised brand in the world. When he launched the iPhone back in 2007, the manner in which he presented his thinking about how the iPhone came about was a very top-down approach. He recited, with laser sharp precision, details of why and how he wanted to create his first smartphones to be far more than just a phone married to some email capability. His crystal clear vision was to give the customer a communications device that integrated all three of Apple’s successes (computers, software, iTouch/iPod) into a single product – in addition to the phone element. So, he/they set about pulling together all of Apple’s innovations (the widescreen iPod with touch controls, software and a computer) into a revolutionary product that we know today as the iPhone.
If he had taken the bottom-up approach, they’d have viewed it differently: a bit like Blackberry did, in a way. It seems that the company took its very successful phone and push-email services and chased fickle consumer market trends that ate away into its established success when it decided to tactically add elements to the product.
The same applies to digital transformation – you can not just add elements as you go along to feed the needs of your employees or the business whilst trying to answer market trends. The board-level roles are extremely important in establishing a visionary view of how you want your business to be in this Fast IT environment of immediate communications, transactions, deliveries, and payments etc. As I mentioned in my last post, it is fine to have one person leading the digital transformation, and many great digital deployments have a single figurehead, but I believe it is better to have a group of people, all of whom are invested in the project, driving the whole outcome. This group is ideally composed of people from different functional groups across the business, not just technologists. And that’s because each member of the group needs to keep their eye on how their function can contribute to the overall objective. If you don’t take a holistic approach, then all you will do is undertake discrete digital projects that will probably not end up reaping the full benefits of digital transformation. In fact, you are probably more likely to fail with a lot of these digital transformations because the style of an individual department within the organisation changes year-on-year, which has an effect on other parts of the organisation.
The circle is vicious if you take this ‘treatment’ approach to business processes that juxtapose other processes in your company. Therefore, you cannot look at it from a bottom-up perspective that stems from individual functions or inputs. It really should be based on an enterprise-wide view of your company’s strategic outcomes, and this is where Fujitsu’s co-creation approach comes in, as well as the digital consultant – which I will be talking about more in my next blog post. Having someone on your board that can answer your ‘Steve Jobs-like’ questions and provide a roadmap to success will empower you to become a visionary leader who understands market trends, and addresses employee needs whilst building digital momentum. So, in essence, the bottom-up approach will not work for your digital transformation projects, because business processes cannot be dealt with tactically in today’s multi-faceted business technology environment. Not if you truly want to succeed.

They say ‘Work experience’ but as a fresh graduate,where do they expect me to get that from?
Getting home after the interview,i couldn’t help but cry. Lord this is not the agreement we had years ago. All I had to show for after school were the several bridesmaid and asoebi dresses in my wardrobe plus the empty wallet i carried about.I felt so depressed for weeks about my status ,i wallowed in self pity,cried severally ,but that wasnt going to solve my problem .i needed to do something fast and quick . I finally decided to pick up my old journals and flip through all the employment trainings i attended back in school to see what i was missing .For days,i would read and read my jottings to fish out inspiring words and paam ,i stumbled got the exact words i needed ….
“it’s only a mumu that will keep doing things the same way and expect to get a different result”
This was so true about me.I was only browsing for jobs and sending my CV. I hadnt anything more save my 2’1 certificate .
My only work experience was selling ”Amala ‘at Mom’s ”bukha joint” . Is that what I want to present before the interviewer ? What more can i do than just selling at the Bukha…Yesssss,I could help re- brand the Joint and apply my accounting skills to promote the business,at least that is something
I got more involved in running mom’s business,i assumed the duties of a manager.I started book keeping our daily food sales ,amount spent on buying food items and balancing of accounts…….
I encouraged Mom to add other delicacies to her menu list and soon enough we started making more profit.Office workers started sending to buy food from our joint,we got more customers,our business expanded ,we hired more staffs, i was excited …..so all along,I had this ”brandng thing ” lying fallow within me…. great discovery.
My brain worked day and night for several months,thinking ,planning,stategizing with Mom on how to move her business forward.I was no longer the Job seeker submitting CV up and down with no work experience,i had work,real work to do. I got busy .
I got so busy running mom’s business that i contemplated whether or not to still apply for “white collar jobs ” again. But on a second thought,i remembered it was always my dream to work in corporate organizations,wearing suit and tie,high heeled shoes, sitting in big offices,pressing computer……….
So I applied for a job .When asked what my work experience was to fit into the position i applied for ,i gladly told them all the “brand managing skills” I deployed at mom’s Bukha and the outstanding results i achieved .When i finished using all the big big grammers, packaging the pivotal role i played in achieveing this,my interviewer was wowwed. I got the Job with Jaw opening benefits alongside
I learned from my experienece,instead of sitting in my house sending CV up and down,i must first ask myself do i have the right skills needed for the Job?”AM I EMPLOYABLE”

Really nice.. Thank you mama wunmiThis is Deb, in her usual research position, surrounded by color swatches. Since she has the better feel for color, she gets to decide what colors to paint our rehab house. The boys have been scraping old paint for the last four weeks and are nearly done. They even spent time on it today, in 90+ degree heat. It's kind of a miserable job, but it has to be done.
David told me he would rather stand on a scaffold and scrape than paint. Now that the scraping is nearly done ... it's time to paint.

Civic Responsibility
I wonder if there's a greater need than we acknowledge for civic responsibility to be inculcated in our children. I remember my grand aunt in her late eighties or early nineties saying after taking a fall, she was left sitting on the kerb in the middle of O'Connell St. This poem brushes up against the same issue.
On The Street.
He has her against the railings.
Holding his mouth up to her face
like a gun-barrel
he bawls;
words that burst clean into my sitting-room.
His fist, swinging in a small arc,
makes a soft sound of her cheek.
Inside,
with my marmalade coals curled up like a cat,
I ask myself what I should do,
taking till they've gone to reach no decision.

Rag Trees and Holy Wells
St Kieran's Holy Well, Kilcar, Co Donegal
Holy wells and rag trees, the exotic places of the Irish countryside, have long ago joined the list of endangered species. Disappearing yearly under bulldozers or through abandonment, one day they will be irretrievably gone and yet another colour will have been lost from the rainbow of Irish culture.

The Moon and Me
I can completely understand why the moon is associated with madness. Watching it sail through the countryside of clouds, it becomes mesmeric and then it crashes out onto open desert to drift with its non-plussed face through nothingness with no apparent destination all through the night. And then there’s its strange enamel light, a weird brightness, the negative of day.
The whole effect is to bring you into yourself, to travel with it, through your own bleak wastelands. It always makes me introspective and catches me somewhere between it’s otherworldly beauty and a feeling of loneliness and loss. (The fact that cloudy conditions in Ireland makes the moon’s light scarcer and therefore more precious adds to the feelings)
Trapped between want and need;
desire brushing my face
like some woman’s hair.
Looking for comfort;
finding only a drizzle of muscles
and outside
the moon
filling the world with longing
and hopeless space.

Scarecrows.
We are two scarecrows: rags and string;
what the rain softens the wind picks clean.
We are two scarecrows: sticks and straw;
crows fly out from underneath our jackets.
We are two scarecrows: nails and wire;
each day drowning as the corn grows higher.
We are two scarecrows: sacks and hay;
nodding toward eternity, we tip toward clay.

Poetic Imagery in Art
The photographs pinned up in Francis Bacon’s studio re-emerged in some form in his paintings, The grotesque mouth in the still from the Battleship Potemkin (above) appeared more than once.
It helps in poetry to have images all around, to know the artists and images that will inspire. For me it’s Bacon, Hopper,Goya, Bosch among others. Among Irish artists, Le Brocquy, and Martin Gail’s work in particular inspires me. In this way, I believe that the process of writing poetry, in my case at least, is very similar to that of painting.
In Klimt’s “The Kiss”, the splendour of the enwrapping mantle expresses all that needs to be expressed about their love, it is so marvellously poetic. Andrew Wyeth, an artist I enjoy very much : his knowledge of countryside in his rendering of colour and textures is special. I find his eye for the poetic in rural settings moves me. In Snow Hill, he has his past subjects dance in a space
cleared by the snow’s whiteness that leaves plenty of room for poetic musings.

Can't Sing
Can’t sing but good with languages and accents: I don’t believe it, I think it comes down to teaching methods. And there is a singing style to suit everyone, even if it is Professor Higgin’s “Why can’t a woman be more like a man.” I think children deserve the search for that style; being able to join in a sing-song and sing your own piece is a great confidence builder and for that reason gives even more pleasure..

September 11, 2011 – 6:00am
Chronic pain is an infrequent but growing aspect of workers compensation claims, but employers need concrete programs with measurable outcomes to respond to and reduce those types of injuries.
Dr. Gary Franklin, medical director for the Department of Labor and Industries in Washington state, which administers the state-run workers compensation insurance fund, said experiencing chronic pain is equivalent to becoming disabled.
From his experience, “everyone who remains in the system (after five months) is disabled,” he said. “If you are not putting most of your effort” into preventing an injury from developing into chronic pain and therefore long-term disability, “you’ve lost the ballgame.”
In March, Washington state’s governor signed legislation into law to further establish medical homes to treat injured workers according to the state’s best practices, and support monitoring patients for their entire recovery period.
Chronic pain is not defined precisely.
Dr. David Deitz, vp-national medical director for Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. in Boston, defines the situation as “any injury in which pain is as important as the disease and (the duration) is beyond the normal course of the injury.”
According to the Institute of Medicine, chronic pain affects more than 116 million U.S. residents—more than heart disease, cancer and diabetes combined—and costs up to $635 billion a year in medical treatment and lost productivity.
Some people view pain as something “to work through,” while others find it “difficult to maintain a positive attitude,” Dr. Deitz said. Treatment depends on the individual patient’s needs, but may include orthopedic, neurological, rehabilitative and psychological professionals.
A rise in claims involving chronic pain “coincides with an increase in the aging workforce,” who are more likely to have other conditions or diseases, said Steven Iler, president of domestic primary claims at Chartis Claims Inc. in New York.
To prevent an injury from becoming a chronic pain claim, early intervention is required, said Maureen McCarthy, senior vp of workers compensation claims and managed care at Liberty Mutual.
Ms. McCarthy said the predictive modeling that Liberty Mutual launched in June “helps identify soft-tissue small kinds of claims that have the likelihood of escalating into high-cost claims. There’s a disproportionate percentage of very simple soft-tissue claims that can become very serious,” she said.
The model uses factors such as smoking, early treatment with narcotics and doctor shopping to flag claims that have the potential to escalate.
A predictive model also has been undertaken by grocery retailer Ahold USA Inc. in collaboration with its actuary, said Libby Christman, Ahold’s Carlisle, Pa.-based senior director of risk management. The unnamed actuary is building a model based on 10 years of the company’s workers comp data, Ms. Christman said. The grocery retailer expects the model, using factors about the claims and the incident, to create awareness of a claim’s potential severity within 30 days of the injury.
Red flags, said Chartis’ Mr. Iler, include patients with unrealistic expectations or those who are unwilling to cooperate, the absence of clear treatment goals, extended use of injected drugs or a doctor’s opinion that the patient is prolonging treatment for their symptoms.
The insurer’s peer-to-peer intervention with doctors has had a 40% success rate in getting them to stop prescribing narcotics outside of appropriate treatment guidelines, said Don Hurter, senior vp of medical management for Chartis in Orlando, Fla.
Messrs. Iler and Hurter said the proactive approach, which the company calls Pre Injury Management, encompasses educating employers to identify injured workers’ pain and to understand treatment goals to enable an early return to work. Other steps, including preparing job descriptions to facilitate a stepped approach to modified-duty jobs have resulted in yearly increases in the number of employees who return to work after 21 days and 60 days, Mr. Iler said.
Preinjury management at Ahold starts with physical evaluations for associates offered warehousing jobs to ensure they can handle the physical demands, Ms. Christman said. The risk management department also conducts ergonomic evaluations on new equipment, certain work-area designs and work processes. Other efforts include having safety specialists meet with employees who have minor pain to change how the worker does their job.
Washington state’s Dr. Franklin said there are several early steps to take when an injury occurs: Screen for disability risk, emphasize graduated exercise, get the patient back to work, track the doctor’s activity and coach the employee.
Employers must have a plan and communicate it to supervisors, said Tom Lynch, chief executive of consultant Lynch Ryan in Wellesley, Mass. Supervisors also must be trained to “treat the employee as if he or she is still valued,” he said.
A list of modified-duty jobs can be drafted by asking supervisors to list projects they would like to have done but don’t have time to complete, Mr. Lynch said. Tailor the list to accommodate different injuries. Have health care providers review it. Then monitor how well-suited the job is to the injury and the employee’s performance, he said.
Doctors must specify to employers an injured worker’s capability for light-duty or modified-duty work, said Kim Haugaard, vp medical units at Texas Mutual Insurance Co. in Austin. “Don’t let the employee sit home and focus on what’s causing them pain,” Mr. Haugaard said. “Show an interest in the employee. That really goes a long way.”
“An employer should be very clear about their return-to-work program with their insurer or third-party administrator and also with the health care providers,” said Ms. Christman. Her team often meets with health care providers to explain job modifications and build trust so doctors are not afraid to allow an employee to return to a modified-duty job.
Long-term usage
The most alarming problem that employers face is the long-term use of narcotics to treat an employee’s chronic pain.
Insurers are monitoring opiate prescriptions, watching for those that exceed 60 days and using peer-to-peer medical review to combat this problem.
“Sometimes when a doctor sees a patient’s drugs listed line item by line item, it’s a little shocking,” said Texas Mutual’s Mr. Haugaard. “The doctor may not realize that the patient has been on a drug for 11/2 years.” The insurer will encourage a step-down program to gradually reduce and eliminate an injured worker’s opiate prescriptions or pay for a detoxification program, if warranted.
Employers are doing the same. Oklahoma City-based Hobby Lobby Inc. has intensified a front-end monitoring program in conjunction with its TPA to be alert to instances where treatment of a minor soft-tissue injury has escalated to stronger medication at higher doses, said Fay Collier, assistant risk manager. They will discuss treatment approaches with the physician, sometimes bringing a nurse case manager on the team to communicate with the physician and injured worker and oversee treatment.
The craft and hobby retailer also recently began pharmacological reviews of longer-term claims for excessive narcotic use and other signs of ineffective or harmful treatment.
Employers also should, with their insurer’s help, establish a benchmark against which to measure performance of their post-injury plans. Mr. Lynch recommends charting loss costs per $100 of payroll for a specific job classification.By Ayo Fadimu
As the 2019 presidential election draws nearer, there is a subtle war over who controls the affairs of the presidency between the acting president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo and the kitchen cabinet of President Muhammadu Buhari, often referred to as Aso-Rock cabals led by the Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari but remotely backed the President’s cousin, Maman Daura.
Nigerian NewsDirect learnt that Kyari, a very powerful official in the Aso-Rock and blood relation of Buhari was the author of the letter which Buhari transmitted to the Senate while leaving for medical check up in the United Kingdom where Osinbajo was asked to Coordinate activities of the government in Buhari’s absence instead of becoming Acting President during the period as enshrined in the constitution.
Osinbajo had since taken over control of the presidency but there is growing fear that Buhari, who has been on sick bed for most part of the year may not be healthy enough to contest for presidency in 2019 and Osinbajo may take over. The Cabals have started vigorous campaign against Osinbajo portraying him as ethnic jingoist who put only his ethnic people from Yoruba land around him .
When Buhari went for medical check up earlier in the year, there was rumour that he was poisoned by some Christians close to him in Aso-Rock
“The rumour then was targeted at the Vice-President a source told Nigerian NewsDirect.
At present, Osinbajo and Kyari are not on speaking terms. Nigerian NewsDirect learnt Kyari accused Osinbajo of travelling to Lagos, his home base three times a week with over 40 aides and each of their trips at tax payers’ expense and using the Presidential Air Fleet and claiming bogus estacode.
However, Osinbajo through his Special Adviser on media, Laolu Akande has denied the charge, claiming that it was far from the truth.
“Osinbajo always use his money whenever he is not on official trip to Lagos or Redemtion camp, the headquarters of his Church in Ogun State” Akande said.
However, Nigerian NewsDirect learnt that the issue was more than just travelling with a retinue of staff to Lagos or anywhere but power tussle on who controls the appointments and affairs of the presidency as well as who gets the party’s ticket in 2019.
“Has the Chief of Staff ever questioned the president over how he travels to anywhere in the country and now that the president has been sick in the United Kingdom, has he complained over the bill the country has been paying on the president’s sickness?”
“It’s simply power tussle?” he added.
Last week, an unknown man, who claimed to be Dr. Ismaila Farouk from Zamfara State accused Osinbajo of being a nepolistic, greedy and unreliable person who is only scheming his way into power come 2019.
Farouk described Osinbajo as one who had smuggled his Yoruba and Redeemed Christian Church of God [RCCG] brothers into the corridors of power.
He claimed the Acting/Vice President has ambushed key and juicy positions courtesy of the magnanimity of President Buhari’s implicit confidence in him.
However, the Senior Special Assistant to the Vice President on Legal Matters, Dr Bilkisu Saidu dismissed the comments credited to Farouk about appointments made by Osinbajo, into some Federal agencies and the ones done in the office of the Vice President.

Books: Jesus Comes to China --- And the World May Never Be the Same
BY PAUL MOONEY IN BEIJING
There's a revolutionary movement sweeping across China that could change the face of global politics forever. It's called Christianity.
Or at least this is David Aikman's thesis in "Jesus in Beijing: How Christianity is Transforming China and Changing the Global Balance of Power." (Regnery, $27.95, 344 pages) Mr. Aikman's thesis is bold, but strange. According to him, China is moving toward becoming a Christian country, and this will turn the world's bad boy into a good global neighbor. Along the way, Chinese will convert the Muslim world to Christianity, thereby becoming America's best ally against radical Islam.
The author, a former Beijing bureau chief for Time magazine, has spent years interviewing experts from China, Europe and the United States, and he has made extensive secret visits to house churches (unofficial Christian meeting places) and underground Catholic churches. He recounts tales of the early Jesuit missionaries in the 16th century, the arrival of the first Protestants in the late 1800s, the communist purge in 1949 and the revival that followed the 1979 reforms. In the process, he portrays the amazing struggle of brave Chinese Christians who have risked imprisonment, beatings and death to practice their faith.
Mr. Aikman says that Christianity has been growing at a staggering speed since China relaxed its controls in 1979. There are close to 80 million Protestants and 12 million Catholics, about four times official figures. Ironically, there were only about four million Christians when the communists came to power in 1949, and set out to wipe out religion.
Despite outside images of Christianity weighed down by communist chains, "Jesus in Beijing" portrays a church that is alive and kicking, albeit under pressure from the government. While Christianity has until recently been strongest in the countryside, the book says it is stretching its tentacles into urban areas and the middle class. There may be Christians embedded in the ranks of the People's Liberation Army and the Chinese Communist Party.
Even former President Jiang Zemin might have Christian leanings. A reliable source tells Mr. Aikman of a dinner at the home of a senior party official just before Mr. Jiang began to formally relinquish the reins of power in November 2002. When a guest asks Mr. Jiang what he would do if he could make one final decree before leaving office, he replies with a broad smile, "I would make Christianity the official religion of China."
Unfortunately, Mr. Aikman, an evangelical Christian, makes no attempt to be impartial, either theologically or politically. The result is a mixture of colorful observations and anecdotes alongside some hard-to-believe stories and arguments.
For one, "Jesus in Beijing" smacks of both American and Christian self-righteousness. With no trace of modesty, the author predicts that "China's moment of its greatest achievement -- and the most beneficial to the rest of the world -- may just lie ahead. That moment may occur when the Chinese dragon is tamed by the power of the Christian lamb." He explains that Christianity is growing at a time when there is a massive ideological vacuum left by the collapse of Marxism-Leninism. He sees Christianity, "a powerful ingredient in the global pre-eminence of Western civilization," as filling that vacuum, and possibly guiding China's pathway into the 21st century.
At the current rate of growth, Mr. Aikman predicts that Christians could account for 20-30% of the Chinese population within three decades. If that happens, he is almost certain that a Christian view of the world will be dominant within the political and cultural establishment, and also possibly within senior military circles. This Augustinian worldview includes a "profound sense of restraint, justice, and order in the wielding of state power."
The book argues that Chinese Christians are strongly pro-American, and so a Christianized China will be more likely to see eye-to-eye with the U.S. on many international issues. A Christianized China therefore "may spend less time thinking of ways to outmaneuver and neutralize the U.S. than the military strategists of the current regime." It might also make a better effort to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
Mr. Aikman's most amazing revelation is that a Chinese Christian army is poised to convert the entire Muslim world. Chinese Christians shoulder a "burden" not just for China, but also to evangelize the Muslim world. He argues that the government of this Christian China, which is also pro-Israel, will make the world safe for Chinese missionary endeavors, "especially within the Islamic domains." Thus, "A Christianized China will change the face not just of Christendom worldwide, but potentially of the world of Islam."
To be fair, this is not just wild talk by a few zealots. Various house church leaders around the country communicate this Chinese burden to Mr. Aikman. As one believer tells the author, Chinese believers will "play a major role in the circumnavigation of the teachings of Jesus back to the Middle East, and onward to the West."
Mr. Aikman is told that the Muslim religion "is the biggest obstacle on the road back to Jerusalem." Church leaders talk of sending 100,000 proselytizers to Muslim countries. There may already be several hundred Chinese house church Christians -- engineers, professionals and laborers -- already embedded in the Middle East. Seminaries are training missionaries to work in the Muslim world.
While Mr. Aikman claims that foreign missionaries are playing a supportive role in China's Christian movement, his anecdotes give foreigners a profound importance. Of the estimated 2,400 foreigners who attend services at the popular Beijing International Christian Fellowship each week, Mr. Aikman guesses that 40-50% are in China "to advance the cause of Christianity among the Chinese." He says that almost every young urban Christian he has met came to the faith via a foreign English teacher, and some were baptized in foreigners' bathtubs.
The book introduces Dennis Balcombe -- well-known for his undercover work with the house church movement -- as one of the "most gifted" Christians working in China. Mr. Balcombe may be a hero to some house church Christians, but Mr. Aikman fails to mention that many fellow missionaries view him as a grandstander who thumbs his nose at the government in ways that have had bad consequences for Chinese believers. Some say Mr. Balcombe endangers Chinese, who often end up in jail for worshipping with him, while he makes a daring escape. In one instance, Mr. Balcombe is spirited away on the back of a bicycle disguised as a peasant woman. The next day police arrest 150 Chinese Christians who have nowhere to run.
But Mr. Aikman's depiction of foreigners in China is not the only place where the author's analysis strays away from objective judgment. Mr. Aikman reports miracles as matter of fact, without even a trace of skepticism. For example, there is the handcuffed Christian who is paraded to the parapet of a bridge, where he expects to be thrown into the water. The man prays furiously and a storm suddenly whips up. The police, apparently afraid to get wet, call things off. In other anecdotes, medicine sales decline drastically after large numbers of villagers experience miraculous cures through prayer.
When God personally told Christian leader Mark Ma -- in a lengthy conversation that's printed verbatim in the book -- that he should "preach the Gospel all the way back to Jerusalem," Mr. Ma "got into an argument with the Almighty," complaining "the Mohammedans are the hardest of all peoples to reach with the Gospel." God replied that the Chinese are stubborn too, but have been "conquered by the Gospel." Mr. Aikman says the phenomenon of Christians claiming to hear an audible voice is actually not all that rare. To prove this, he recounts a tale of two Christians -- one American and one British -- who tell him that they too hear God talking. Case settled.
Mr. Aikman clearly has extensive experience and knowledge on the subject, but this is a disappointing effort. A book about the amazing changes being effected by Christians in China would have benefited from a dose of objectivity.
© 2013 Paul J. MooneyThis is one of those scriptures in the Bible that I believe is miss used at times. In other words, I don't believe you'll get everything you want just by asking for it. God is not a Santa Claus handing out presents. But I do believe that if we honestly seek wisdom through prayer and study of the Word then God will open the door, but it might not be the door you thought it would be and the timing might not be what you expected.
This year as we make our resolutions, set goals, and decide what is most important to us in the year 2011, I encourage you to seek wisdom. Every morning before my feet hit the floor (when I remember) I pray for wisdom. Wisdom to make good decisisons through the day, wisdom to use my time well, wisdom to counsel my students and my children, wisdom to write the words for my current work in progess with an open heart and an ear for God's leading.
I don't make New Year's Resolutions anymore. I set measurable goals and I do it throughout the month of January. January is special for me because it's my birthday month and with a new birthday in mind I plot my course for the year knowing full well that it may not go as expected; I don't think it ever has gone as expected. :) But whatever happens this year I will diligently ask, seek, and knock.
Dictionary.com says:
Wisdom –noun
1. the quality or state of being wise; knowledge of what is true or right coupled with just judgment as to action; sagacity, discernment, or insight.
—Antonyms
1. stupidity. 2. ignorance.
I pick a meaningful scripture every year that extends through the entire year that I contemplate and try to remember in my daily comings and goings. This year it will be:
There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.-Provebs 20:15.
After choosing this scripture I then choose another scripture for each month before it begins. I may choose a quote that I love to go along with it. I'm behind on this one because I came down with a rotten cold so while I'm on the mend I will think this one through. Off the top of my head I'm sure it will have something to do with time managment. In fact I think there is a scripture that says something like making the best use of our time even in these difficult days. Anway, I have to ponder this one a bit longer.
So what scripture would you pick for yourself this year that extends through the entire year and then what scripture or quote for this month of January?
Dear Jillian:
I came to your blog via Inkwell. I love the look of it. Having lived in England for 6 months, it reminds me alot of that special time of our lives.
In regards to your verse for the year, this year the Lord gave me a word for the year -- Holy Courage. Holy Courage to grow more in Him and Holy Courage to bring forth His truth and hope to those who are hurting everywhere.
May the Lord encourage you and strengthen you as you serve Him!
Seeking wisdom is a wonderful goal. I came into January planning to query my agent of choice, only to find she isn't accepting submissions for the foreseeable future. So now I'm trying hard to discern what God has in mind -- do I query elsewhere (it's not what I want), or wait patiently and continue writing on my current w.i.p.?
While I'm seeking guidance and wondering what He has in mind, Proverbs 3:6 is the verse I cling to: "In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths." It seems like a good choice for the whole year, don't you think?Lost and Found, Part Four is the ninth issue of the Angel & Faith Season Ten comic book series. Joss Whedon is the executive producer.

It's never been very good. Oh it looks great as I got it new when I had my bathroom completely redone a few years ago. But the plumbing in this house was done during the war (The Crimean War) and the pipework in the loft makes the map of the London Underground look simple. The water pressure is so bad that I have to run around under the shower head just to get wet.
But I've put up with it as I'm rarely in a rush when I shower and it gives me the chance to not just sing along to a few singles from an album on my shower cd player but to get in the whole album !
But in April, when I got home from wintering in Florida and turned the water supply back on, it went from being a pathetic dribble to a trickle. I put my extensive plumbing skills to good use by going up into the loft, looking at all the pipes and giving them a good glare and the occasional shake and deciding it was all too much for me to deal with right then. That was almost 3 months ago and last week even I had had enough.
I asked a kind friend, Ken, for help and between us we came up with a plan, not a cunning plan, just a plan. My shower needed a pump installed to give the water pressure a much needed boost. An electric shower wouldn't have been any good as that just heats the water and doesn't increase the pressure so a pump was ordered. Not just any old pump mind you. Oh no. When I do eventually get things done, I get them done.
So yesterday the big day arrived, as did my friend and the pump. We had a coffee, talked about stuff and then the work began. By that I mean he installed the pump and I kept the coffee coming !! But what a nightmare it was up there and at times I didn't so much think he was installing a pump as playing a sort of individual version of Twister. One leg would be over a pipe, the other one under a pipe and the rest of his body forming a human pretzel around the wooden loft beams. Getting into these positions was bad enough, but once there, he then had to cut pipes and install electrical wiring and, as his brilliant idea for stopping water coming out of the cold water tank was to use a big blob of blu-tac to bung up the outlet hole, we were constantly waiting for a flood of water to burst from the cut pipework at any time.
Oh the pressure, the pressure. For once I didn't want any pressure !
After 3 hours it was done. The blu-tac was removed, valves opened and we heard the water getting to the pump and with no leaks. Stage 1 complete. Then the pump was started and........silence. I was moving back and forth from the shower to the top of the ladder to try and be useful while Ken puzzled over this development. We knew it needed a flow of water around the pump to activate it as it's designed never to run 'empty' but it WAS getting a flow so why wasn't it running ? I did all I could do which was to twist the various shower controls one way and then the other as that's my thing. My only thing.
Then like a dam bursting, water came forth - and fifth and even sixth - and the pump started up. Hurrah !!!
The flow wasn't great but it was a start. I moved the water temperature dial and the flow increased. See, twiddling things can work ! I still wasn't impressed and then the pump started making noises like a 40 a day smoker and the water was coming in matching spurts. Time for drastic action and with nothing to lose I opened the hot water tap on the bathrom sink.
The pump stopped coughing, the water stopped spurting and to my amazement, the flow increased 10 fold and enamel was peeling off the back of the bath ! I had pressure !!!!!
In our semi professional plumbing way, we decided it was all down to a combination of the pump needing a while to 'bed in' and some air being in the pipework. Whatever, I finally had a shower that would drench me in 0.2 seconds, remove dirt and some body hair in 2.4 seconds and reduce me to a skeleton in about 5.6 seconds. I couldn't wait to try it out. Thank you, Ken.
Last night I barely slept. I also slept barely but that's another story. I was like a kid on Christmas morning and at 9am (Very early for me) I'd had enough and jumped out of bed and straight into the shower.
My bed is very close to the bathroom !
In the past I'd been able to get into the bath tub, turn on the shower and when it was at operating temperature, move in under it to try and get wet. Today I had to remain outside the bath, reach across to turn on the shower and within a few seconds, step in and across the flow which almost pushed me to the back of the bath.
OMG I felt like I was back on the deck of The Maid Of The Mist and all that was missing was my yellow poncho. The sponge was blown out of my hands and when I bent over to pick it up, I felt violated ! I wasn't so much showered as sand blasted. My internal organs have never been so clean. My blood is more pink than red. Homer Simpson has more hair than I do.
You get the picture. I have a shower, people ! A shower to be proud of. A shower that takes your skin, sends it off to be steam cleaned and puts it back with the top 2 layers missing. If you look upwards, this shower will give you a better face lift than a Hollywood plastic surgeon.
When I turned it off I stood there dripping with an insane smile on my face. Actually it wasn't a smile so much as the state my face was left in after the shower had acted like a wind tunnel. You know those shots you see when someone is in a rocket sledge or a parachutist has just jumped out of an aeroplane and is freefalling for the first 5 minutes. That was me and I loved it.
Gathering up the folds of loose skin I exited the bath and dabbed myself dry as I felt that using the towel the normal way really would remove the rest of my skin.
I'm sure the novelty will wear off but for now it's great and my plan is to get down and dirty and have another shower this evening. Having a power shower is all well and good but I can see I'm going to have to guard against going OCD.
Anyway for now I'm off to eBay to look for a yellow poncho. Wooohoooooo !!!

A good hosing down never hurt anybody....good to see you survived Hurricane Ian.
Ahahahahahahahaha!!! I was going to quote slabs of that but I'm laughing too much! Very nicely written!
ROFLMAO as the MerryCans say.
We have a pumped shower too. It's probably why I don't have any wrinkles. Good, innit? ;)
We used to have an electric shower in the cloakroom downstairs. It produced about two drops of lukewarm water a minute. My parents thought that was what all showers were like and were always very happy with it. When they had their new house built at the bottom of the garden they had an identical one installed. They were always baffled by my hatred of it and used to say things like "Oh, Daphne likes showers to be like a monsoon, isn't she strange?" Hmmm.
Awesome....but are the pliers still in the shower? I will never forget the first time I visited you and climbed into the tub to find a pair of pliers. I was afraid to ask what you used them for!
Haven't you seen my toe nails ?Tungsten heavy alloys which can also be called high gravity alloys are refractory metals. Basically there are two series, W-Ni-Fe and W-Ni-Cu, sometimes even W-Ni-Cu-Fe.
It contains mainly tungsten ranging from 80wt% to 98wt%, and its density can reach 15.8~ 18.5g/cm3. Nickel, iron, copper serve as binder between tungsten grains and make the material ductile and more machinable. Compared to W-Ni-Cu, W-Ni-Fe possesses a better mechanical property, being widely used in national defense industry.
Our processing route for tungsten heavy alloys is show in Figure 1. Firstly, mix the calculated amount of elemental powders according to certain ratio, ball milling to even all powders and refine powder grains. Then, employ cold pressing and liquid phase sintering to almost full density. The matrix alloy melts and some tungsten dissolves into solution during liquid phase processing, resulting in a microstructure through which large tungsten grains (20–60µm) are dispersed in the matrix alloy. The as-sintered material often is subjected to certain aging treatments, finally leading to improved strength and hardness in the heavy alloys.
Specifications:
1. AMS Specifications
2. Our General Sizes (Customization accepted)
Applications:
As tungsten heavy alloy shares high density, high strength and high hardness together with excellent anti-abrasion, anti-fatigue properties, it is widely used in counterweight and military defense applications.
Advantages of tungsten heavy alloy:
Tungsten heavy alloy acquires a density from 15.8~18.5g/cm3, which is far higher than nickel, titanium and lead alloys. It is employed to be a substitute for those alloys, not only because of its superior physical properties mentioned above, but a low expansion coefficient and high modulus of elasticity.Early morning, great light, bikes and a fun couple.

He got the shirt free from his previous place of employment, and wears it only for doing chores.)
Mopping the floor after the fridge is defrosted is usually my job.
Fair's fair.
I'd rather mop than defrost.
Deciding to clean up and re-arrange the magnets was not so much a job as an exercise in fun for me.
Numeric and alphabetic order, if you don't mind.
I like a fridge full of magnets and photos. Especially those alphabet and number magnets, I couldn't wait to have children so we could get some.
Well, all right.
That's a slight exaggeration.
I'm a big fan of Judy Horacek's work. I also have some tea-towels and an apron by her.
We already owned these very cool penguin magnets and I quite enjoy finding them in different positions on the fridge following Cherub's sporadic magnet-play sessions.
The cat magnets were some retail-therapy in the wake of Bertie Wooster's continued disappearance.
They are no longer sitting in a neat line, though. They were dispersed around the fridge-face the instant Cherub discovered them.
I decided to put this photo of Cherub and my cousin into one of the magnetic frames during the course of the clean-up. No point to having a magnetic frame if you don't put a photo in it, hey?
By the time I got round to photographing my handiwork the Cherub had vetoed this decision. In his opinion it was no good, because you couldn't see all of the photo.
I do like that he took matters into his own hands though, rather than just whining to the management.
I also think his love of magnet re-arranging may have come directly from me. Can you spot the kitties now?
Meanwhile, the Fixit genes are strong with this one.
Your fridge magnets are awesome! I must be more artistic with mine. Though we have slightly more sparkly pink ones than you do :)
Tell Fixit I love Harleys too!!
Ok, ok, I am just yanking his chain, I don't really care either way about them.
I love fridge magnets. You have a LOT!
I want the kitty ones.
I want Bertie to come home. I am still worrying about him, and think of him every day. (I kind of think I might have some issues, being obsessive about other people's cats.)
You need those magnets where you make up stupid sentences. Or do you have those ones already and I didn't spy them in your vast array of fridge magnets?
Ooo I luvs me some fridge magnets, I have almost eleventymillion of them :)
I'm into the fridge magnets too. I find them deposited all over the house though as at least one of mine likes to grab them and carry them around.
My fridge lives in the cupboard and STILL gets covered in pics and magnets and old school letters no-one remembers to read in time.
At last I know what refrigerators are really for - the food storage is a mere flummery.
I still have one missing kitty magnet. Perhaps it is underneath the fridge, but I suspect a grandchild wandered off with it and lost it.
My fridge is covered with magnets from tradesmen, which settle in our letter box like autumn leaves. They are mostly from plumbers and electricians - which probably says a lot about the declining infrastructure around here.
Fabulous magnet arranging. And the letter/number/maths magnets take me straight back to childhood. Loved those. Wonder what ever happened to our set?
I bought alphabet magnets for the kid, but he doesn't want to put them on the fridge.
I think you need the ones from the museum shop that are animals in two halves, which gives the effect of the creature coming out or going into the fridge door.
So with those museum magnets, it'd be like the arse half of the tiger is in your freezer, waiting to be defrosted for stirfry?
I love that cartoon with the woman calming the dishes!
Fixit is, as ever, gorgeous!
Those cat magnets are awesome! (Although sorry to hear that BW has not returned-have felt the pain of a missing cat.)
I love seeing how the kids rearrange the magnets on our fridge. Sadly, these days the fridge seems to overrun with school notices and the magnets have been neglected.
I like the Princess Fiona magnets. Might have to get those for a co worker who's a Fi, and is known as Princess Fiona.
We have the magnets that you can write sentences with but they're the generic boring ones. My parents on the other hand, have the set from Stratford Upon Avon which feature Shakespearian insults. Much more interesting!
I LOVE your magnets! I rearrange ours on the fridge. Me. Not the kids. Me. I let Rob do the freezer AND the fridge. It gets gross and I don't wanna, so I ignore it until he can't stand it anymore. Which doesn't take an organized person like Rob very long.
What a lovely little slice of your lives. I love blogs.
Yep, love a good fridge magnet.
But I get SO sick of picking them up off the floor.
We have the sentence ones... the boring ones Suse has I suspect.
Our last fridge wasn't magnetic.
I know! What's a fridge for if tigs don't stick to it?
There was one built into our new house...so we inherited a bona fide magnetic fridge. Yay.
(Sorry to hear Bertie's still MIA.)
That was, of course, supposed to be "if THINGS don't stick to it"...my keyboard is on a go slow...keeps missing out letters.
I'm sure tigs didn't stick to our old fridge either though.
Great magnets!
My boys love to play with our fridge magnets; I even have a pot of them they can fuss with when the mood strikes.
Mr Fixit does his plumbing work very thoughtfully in long shirt and high enough pants!
I love watching a man work with his son. Pip has learnt so much about how to be a man by joining his dad in pursuing manly tasks.
I was not going to have magnets, the old ones sent our old fridge door rusty! However it is hard not to have them when you have grandchildren who love them.Mr. Chalmers smoked huge, thick chuck roasts he rubbed with his special combination of salt, salt, salt, cayenne, dried oregano, and sliced garlic. I think he cooked them with hickory for about three and a half hours, and they were nice and tender, juicy, spicy, meaty. Chuck really is an excellent cut of meat for smoking, and I'm surprised more people don't use it instead of the more expensive brisket. The only trick is slicing it across the grain, which tends to go every which way. We've even smoked thinner chuck "steaks" with great results.
In the oven, in a (cowboy?) bain marie, we baked a simple corn pudding with roasted poblano peppers: corn, peppers, milk, heavy cream, melted butter, fresh eggs from the lady down the road, et cetera.
The night before, I soaked two pounds of Great Northern beans in water. Early the next morning, I simmered the beans in fresh water for about an hour, drained them, and added new water, some molasses, dry mustard, a little ketchup, a lot of bacon, and one and a half chopped onions. I dug a hole and started a big fire in it, and let it burn down to embers. It was cold outside, and had just begun to get light. With the Mister's help I set the Dutch oven full of beans, along with a few potatoes brushed with butter, seasoned with fresh herbs, and wrapped in foil, down in the coals and we shoveled some of the coals on top, then covered the whole thing with dirt until we couldn't see any smoke rising from the ground. I think the fire probably died when we covered it with dirt, because when we dug the pot up five hours later it was barely warm. So I put the pot on the stovetop and finished up the beans the regular way. These were New England–style beans, not Southern or Texas beans, but they were pretty rustic anyway. We put the potatoes and sweet potatoes in the coals in the smoker while the meat was cooking.
More successful was the cobbler, which we made in an eight-quart Dutch oven ("Made in China for Texsport, Houston") with a flat, rimmed lid and three legs. Apples, pears, lemon juice, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and tapioca. I precooked the fruit a bit because I wasn't sure how it would work on an open fire, but as it turns out I didn't need to do that: the hardwood fire Mr. Chalmers and our friend built in the old goat-cooking pit was extremely hot, and the fruit juices were boiling in no time. As soon as it was all bubbly, Mr. Chalmers mixed up a biscuit-y topping (flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, half butter and half nonhydrogenated shortening, then milk) and dolloped it on, trying not to singe his arm. We put the lid on and piled coals on top. We let it cook like that for about twenty minutes, then I said it was time, and we pushed the coals off the pot and lifted the lid and it was perfect. A little blackened on the side closest to the center of the fire, but otherwise just right. It may well be the best cobbler I've ever had a hand in making. The apples and pears were all dark and caramelized, and somehow the topping was both fluffy and crisp, and tasted as if it had been baked, then fried, then drizzled with caramel. And there was just a touch of smoke flavor, or maybe that was burnt flavor—in any case, I liked it. A lot.
Add Miller Lite and Bailey's Irish Cream (brought by our friends from town) and it was a fine way to celebrate our Irish cowboy heritage.New Delhi | Uttar Pradesh will get to nominate maximum number of cities to be developed as ‘Smart Cities’, followed by Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra.

Vinaigrette Ingredients:
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1/3 cup red wine vinegar
- 1 shallot, quartered
- 1 tablespoon sugar
Make Vinaigrette:
In a food processor combine all ingredients until smooth. Set aside.
Crab Stack Ingredients:
- 1 cup pea shoots
- 1 avocado, cubed
- 1/2 can of cooked crab meat
- 1 mango, cubed
- 1 tomato chopped
- 1/4 cup chopped parsley
Make'em!
assemble directly on your serving dish: pack each layer tightly using a mold (I used a 2 inch mold I found at a bake shop). See photos for the order I chose. When finished packing your mold use one hand to press down on the stack. Lift the mold straight up with your other hand. Top with chopped parsley and drizzle with the vinaigrette. Serve immediately or chill in the fridge until you are ready to serve.
feeling inspired to try this out with all veggies - like a stacked salad...hmmm ideas are blooming.
you could sub the crab with hummus, beans or rice or all three...endless possibilities!This is a special post for me. It marks an entire year ~plus a day, that I have been shooting fine art photography.

Over the past few years, I have seen an increasing number of messages and even cards that celebrate single moms on Father’s Day. Although I understand why single moms feel this way, I also think that we need to respect the integrity of Father’s Day. Before you get upset with me, let me tell you that I understand where you are coming from. I am a single mom of twins, and I am the only parent because the other parent walked out. Therefore, I know what it is like to feel like the mom and the dad. Side note, later this week I’m going to be sharing a post that talks about why I had to change my mindset. However, now I want to address Father’s Day.
When I was pregnant, I started to buy into the hype that I needed to celebrate Mother’s Day and Father’s Day. I was upset and hurt at their dad for leaving, and I started to resent Father’s Day because it made me confront the hurt and fear that I had around the prospect of being a single mom. I wanted to claim Father’s Day as my own. However, once I thought about it, I realized that I was being selfish. I realized that instead of becoming bitter, angry, and resentful on this day, I should celebrate this day and be grateful. For example, I should celebrate my own dad who is an amazing man and an awesome grandfather.
We should also celebrate Father’s Day because although there are so many men who do not step up to be fathers, there are still those who are good fathers. These fathers deserve their day of celebration and recognition. Also, don’t limit the definition of father to the person who shares half of your children’s DNA. One of the Webster’s definitions of father is “a man who gives care and protection to someone or something.” This can be a grandfather, coach, teacher, uncle, cousin, or family friend who loves, protects, and cares for your children. Also, think about the people who are father figures in your child’s life and celebrate them.
You have the ability to write your own narrative for this day. You can be angry and bitter or you can find joy. You can celebrate the people in your life who support, help, and uplift you or you can harbor resentment towards the person who left. It’s up to you. Let the men have Father’s Day and you can celebrate and live it up on Mother’s Day and all of the other days of the year, because as a phenomenal mom, you deserve.Wrinkle Free Sheet Sets
Wrinkle free sheets remain smooth after washing and drying. This type of sheet doesn't require any ironing to achieve that nice crisp and smooth look. The sheets are available in several types of fibers, some with natural properties that prevent wrinkles.
The Look of Crisp, Smooth Sheets
If you've ever marveled at the sharp bed sheets in a hotel, you may have been tempted to explore the manufacturer so you could enjoy the same soft, wrinkle free look at home. Hotel sheets are typically 100% cotton and untreated (chemically) for wrinkles, although some hotels do iron them out. A bed made with these crisp, smooth sheets is far more inviting psychologically and physically than sheets that are wrinkled.
Sheet Fibers and Wrinkles
The fibers in a wrinkled sheet are no longer straight and smooth. A bed made with wrinkled sheets will be very uncomfortable when compared to the softness and smoothness of a hotel bed. Instead of being soft, the fibers of a wrinkled sheet have become kinked, bent and crooked from the wash and then the dryer. That wrinkling creates a rougher feel and is less conducive to a restful sleep.
The Joy of Wrinkle Free Sheets
Chances are you don't iron sheets the way your great-grandmother might have or use a laundry service that irons and folds sheets like your favorite hotel. Yet, sleeping on crisp sheets is one of the small pleasures in life that most people enjoy and want. The advent of wrinkle free or, more recently, wrinkle-resistant sheets combines that desire with modern manufacturing processes to give you several options.
Wrinkle Free Fabric Choices
According to C&EN (Chemical & Engineering News) the first formula for wrinkle-free cotton was created in the early 1900s, but it wasn't until the 1970s that wrinkle free sheets first appeared on the market. However, those formulas were too strong and weakened the cotton fibers. Over the next decades technology advanced and the different methods and formulas improved.
Cotton Sheets and Wrinkle Free Chemicals
If you purchase wrinkle free cotton sheets, the fabric has been treated so the cotton fibers are locked and won't bend or misshapen during washing and drying cycles. A low urea-formaldehyde formulation is one method used to bond the cotton fibers so they return to their pre-washed smoothness. In response to consumer concerns about sleeping on chemically treated sheets, the textile industry has reduced the amount of formaldehyde and other chemicals used in these sheets.
A few newer methods are under patent review that could potentially produce chemical free or less harmful chemically treated sheets. There are several processes that are free of chemicals but still offer wrinkle resistant sheets. There are also some wrinkle resistant sheet sets that are certified not to contain any harmful chemicals, such as the certified sheet sets offered by Cuddledown. Check labels and website descriptions and disclaimers prior to deciding on a set of sheets.
Polyester and Other Options
The introduction of polyester that has non-wrinkle properties was embraced by the textile industry since many consumers didn't wish to have formaldehyde against their skin. Many shoppers simply choose a different fabric or blended fabric for their sheets instead of opting for the treated cotton. A sateen finish to a cotton fabric can be manufactured with a wrinkle resistant finish that doesn't contain harmful chemicals. There are several fiber blends used for sheet fabrics that offer you a wide range of choices.
Maintaining Sheets for Optimum Use
There are a few things you can do to ensure your sheets serve you the way they were intended.
- Launder sheets every one to two weeks. This will keep your sheets fresh and free of dust mites and skin cells.
- The more often you wash sheets, the more relaxed the fibers become. This will soften sheets and reduce wrinkling.
- Purchase more than one set of sheets so you can change them out more often and reduce the wear of a single set of sheets.
- Avoid high heat settings on washer and dryer.
- Remove sheets immediately from dryer to reduce wrinkles.
Shopping for Wrinkle Free Sheets
Determine what type of fabric you want for your set of sheets. When shopping, be sure to check the package so you fully understand what each set contains and the fabric content.

Life Without Wrinkled Sheets
It's truly the small things in life that can affect you the most. Wrinkled sheets no only look unkempt, they are harsher against the skin. Choosing the right wrinkle free sheets for your bed can mean the difference of an uncomfortable fitful night or a restive sleep.The berth on the train was quite comfortable. The only distraction being my room mates exiting and returning to the compartment throughout the night. It's also a nice treat to use the time spent sleeping to complete a long journey. I went to bed speaking French, using francs as currency, and woke up in a new country, one that speaks Spanish and spends pesetas.
The Madrid subway system is pretty straight forward, much less confusing than the Paris metro. Not far from the subway is the pensione where I will stay tonight. The woman who answers the door is kind enough, but not overly friendly. This is a type of bed and breakfast accommodation, without the breakfast, and only costs $11 for the room.
With my knapsack safely tucked away, I explore Madrid with the help of the map from tourist information at the train station. Madrid is a beautiful city to wander in, with its lovely fountains. I take my time figuring out where to go next in a gorgeous park, full of lakes, trees and a crystal house.
Around the city are vendors with little carts, much like the hot dog carts back in Toronto. Here you can buy a drink, which is anything from coke-a-cola to a martini. There is a little seating area that is available for an extra 100 pesetas.
Spanish coffee is strong, like the coffee in Paris, but with a slightly different taste. The man at the bistro suggests I add lots of milk, stir and then sprinkle the sugar on top. The result is very tasty. While I enjoy my coffee, I discuss some of Spain's more popular festivals, like Tomatina, and the Running of the Bulls with another traveler.
Madrid turns out to be more of a culinary experience, with so many interesting flavours of food and drink to discover. A small restaurant prepares perfectly spiced ravioli, served with delicious wine for my post city sight seeing dinner.
Back at the pensione, and exhausted from a day of walking and eating, I flop into my bed. The mattress consumes me, folding up on either side like a fluffy, thick hammock. I have been transformed into a human hot dog, wrapped up a snug bun, covered with a blanket the exact same shade as French's mustard.

~G.K. ChestertonToday I started a Cumulative Update 3 installation, which is the most recent one on ConfigMgr 2012 R2. As always (?) a reboot is needed before installation is started. This will be mentioned in the prerequisites wizard. After reboot however, installation hung on the first step. Stopping services.. This on the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) service. Let's have a look how to stop this service manually.
First have a look in the Services console for the service name. In this case the service is called WinMgmt. Then open a Command Prompt and type in the following command:
-sc queryex [servicename]
Replace [servicename] with the services registry name.
After running the query the PID is showed, which is 836 in my case. Type in the following command to stop it definitely:
-taskkill /f /pid [PID]
Replace [PID] with the number showed before.
This will forcefully kill the hung service! After that installation can be continued as expected.. Finally genre shows, like films of the past few years, are making waves and for good reason. Diverse characters plus compelling story – really ‘nuff said but, as per usual, I will say more. Ollie Queen, the future Vigilante, Hood then said Mr. Arrow, returned to Starling City after being presumed dead for five years in a boating accident along with his father and girlfriend’s sister (oh yeah – did I mention he was a billionaire playboy?) The former playboy is back and has taken up a cause; to right the wrongs of the greedy and criminal flavor of his city. He is joined in his cause by trusted bodyguard and chauffeur John Diggle (David Ramsey) and computer whiz the awesomely geeky, smart and stunning Felicity Smoak (Emily Bett Rickards.) Besides his crime fighting duties, Queen is usually confounded by family along with once and future friends. He has to deal with his conniving mother (Susanna Thompson) and party animal and club owner (and maybe future heroine) little sis, Thea (Willa Holland.) All the while he deals with ex-girlfriend and lawyer Laurel Lance (Katie Cassidy) and her father, Detective Lance (the always impressive Paul Blackthorne.) Other superheroes and villains come and go as the extensive D.C. universe cannon are explored and expanded. Oliver and his avenger persona ultimately soften opinions of his extended family and eventually his city. Arrow has a skillful blend of suspenseful action in the present coupled with just enough flashback story (not excessive – take note Saving Mr. Banks) make for a seamless transition. The acting is good, the stories have mystery and intrigue and the show is filmed in a very stylish and dark manner. Almost two seasons in fanboys and fangirls of all ages should really love this show. The only persons who have actually watched it and don’t are the nouveau wannabe perpetual attention seekers who have nothing better to do than hate. Oh wait, that may be me… but not in this case.

LISA MCKENNA, PLAINTIFF,v.HEALTHEASE, INC., ET AL.,DEFENDANTS.
The opinion of the court was delivered by: Schiller, J.
MEMORANDUM
Lisa McKenna worked as a fitness instructor for Healthease, Inc. ("Healthease"), a company owned by Armand Tecco. Lockheed Martin and Healthease had an agreement under which Healthease sent a fitness instructor to Lockheed Martin's King of Prussia facility. McKenna was that fitness instructor for approximately four months before she was let go, allegedly due to her age and gender. She sued Lockheed Martin, Healthease, Tecco, and Eric Mamon, a Healthease employee. Lockheed Martin, Healthease, and Tecco filed summary judgment motions. Lockheed Martin argues that the case against it cannot proceed because Lockheed Martin did not employ McKenna. Healthease and Tecco, along with Lockheed Martin contend that McKenna has failed to create a genuine issue of material fact on her discrimination claims. Finally, problems with McKenna's standing came to the attention of this Court based on her Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing. McKenna now seeks additional time to complete discovery. For the reasons that follow, the Court denies the request for additional time to complete discovery, and holds that Lockheed Martin was not McKenna's employer and that McKenna has not created a triable issue of fact on her discrimination claims. Accordingly, Defendants' motions for summary judgment are granted.
I. BACKGROUND
Healthease and Lockheed Martin had a contract in which Healthease agreed to provide an onsite fitness manager for forty hours per week at Lockheed Martin's King of Prussia campus. (Lockheed Martin's Statement of Undisputed Facts [Lockheed Martin SOF] ¶¶ 1-2.) The Healthease staff member assigned to manage the fitness center was responsible for recruiting and retaining members, marketing fitness center programs, fitness programming, performing fitness assessments, supervising and monitoring exercise participants, promoting and organizing group exercise programs, developing and implementing educational programs, designing and implementing incentive programs, creating educational bulletin boards and flyers, generating monthly reports, budgeting, managing supplies, and cleaning and maintaining exercise equipment. (Id. ¶ 4.) Jack Eisele, Lockheed Martin's manager of special services, managed Lockheed Martin's relationship with Healthease. (Id. ¶ 5.) He acted as a liaison who ensured that Lockheed Martin employees benefitted from Healthease's services while Healthease upheld its end of the bargain. (Id.)
McKenna is a fifty-two year old female. (Am. Compl. ¶ 25.) McKenna applied for a job opening with Healthease by submitting her resume on Craigslist. (Lockheed Martin SOF ¶ 15.) Tecco and Mamon interviewed McKenna at Healthease's office. (Id. ¶¶ 17, 20, 23.) She did not interview with a Lockheed Martin employee. (Id. ¶ 27.) Mamon told McKenna that she would be running Lockheed Martin's fitness facility in King of Prussia, teaching fitness classes, and providing personal training. (Id. ¶¶ 21-22.) Either Tecco or Mamon offered McKenna the job and told her to meet with Patrick Rufo, a Healthease employee who worked at the King of Prussia facility, for training. (Id. ¶¶ 28-31.) Tecco provided McKenna with Healthease's compensation and benefits package and Mamon informed her of her salary and that she would work forty hours a week. (Id. ¶¶ 34-35, 37.)
McKenna started work at Lockheed Martin on September 29, 2008. (Id. ¶ 40.) She trained with Rufo and received Healthease's "Standards of Superior Service," which "described Healthease's expectations for its fitness manager with regard to certifications, fitness training, supervision, fitness assessments, exercising programming, communication, professional etiquette, dress code, appearance, working environment, and personal health standards." (Id. ¶¶ 43-44.) Healthease also set the fees for personal training. (Id. ¶ 48.) When Plaintiff missed a half day of work, she contacted Mamon; she did not contact anybody at Lockheed Martin. (Id. ¶¶ 50-51.) McKenna provided Mamon and Tecco monthly reports about her activities in the fitness center. (Id. ¶ 54.) Healthease paid McKenna's salary, issued her paycheck earning statements, issued her a W-2 form, enrolled her in direct deposit, and provided her with a 401(k) plan, medical and dental benefits, as well as long-term disability and life insurance, and paid her unemployment compensation insurance and payroll taxes. (Id. ¶¶ 55-61, 65-66.)
McKenna was terminated on January 29, 2009. (Id. ¶ 68.) Prior to McKenna's termination, Healthease saw a number of its clients cut back on the use of Healthease's services. (Lockheed Martin's Mot. for Summ. J. Ex. C [Tecco Decl.] ¶¶ 11-13.) In December 2008, Lockheed Martin and Healthease reached an agreement in which Lockheed Martin reduced its payment to Healthease. (Id. ¶ 13.) Healthease claims that it was forced to reduce its staff by one when it lost substantial income and business. (Id. ¶14.) Scott Dyck, who had worked with Healthease for three years, was assigned to Lockheed Martin's King of Prussia facility. (Lockheed Martin SOF ¶ 71.)
Before addressing the merits of Plaintiff's discrimination claims, the Court must discuss Plaintiff's response to Defendants' summary judgment motions, as well as McKenna's ability to bring this lawsuit in her own name.
A. Rule 56(d) and Standing
1. Background
This Court previously considered McKenna's standing to bring this cause of action. On November 9, 2012, Lockheed Martin filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiff's case arguing that she lacked standing because the real party in interest was the bankruptcy trustee of McKenna's Chapter 7 bankruptcy. On November 15, 2012, Healthease and Tecco filed a similar motion. On December 5, 2012, counsel for McKenna wrote to the Court about a "new and important development that the Court should be apprised of." (Letter to Court, McKenna v. Healthease, Civ. A. No. 10-3940 (E.D. Pa. Dec. 5, 2012), ECF No. 53.) According to the letter, the bankruptcy trustee was going to seek permission from the bankruptcy court to pursue McKenna's discrimination claims. The Court was also told that "[a] letter from the trustee directly to Your Honor will be forthcoming shortly." (Id.) The letter never arrived. Tired of this case languishing, the Court issued an opinion in which it concluded that McKenna lacked standing to bring her claims for monetary damages because her discrimination claims properly belonged to her bankruptcy estate, even though they existed pre-petition. McKenna v. Healthease, Inc., Civ. A. No. 10-3940, 2013 WL 159379 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 15, 2013). When she filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection, McKenna failed to list her interest in her discrimination charge as a claim or contend that the charge was exempt. Furthermore, when the bankruptcy trustee asked McKenna if she had listed all of her assets and debts, she responded affirmatively. (Req. of Former Bankr. Trustee for Order Not Dismissing Pending Litig. Ex. 1 [Mot. for Order Reopening Bankr.] at 2-3, McKenna v. Healthease, Civ. A. No. 10-3940 (E.D. Pa. Feb. 25, 2013), ECF No. 59.) This Court held that McKenna lacked standing to bring her discrimination claims because a legal claim that is not scheduled or otherwise administered by the time the bankruptcy is closed "forever remains property of the estate, and the trustee remains the real party in interest." Matthews v. Potter, 316 F. App'x 518, 521 (7th Cir. 2009); see also Schafer v. Decision One Mortg. Corp., Civ. A. No. 08-5653, 2009 WL 1532048, at *4 (E.D. Pa. May 29, 2009) ("If a debtor fails to exempt or schedule a claim, and the trustee does not abandon the claim, the claim remains the property of the estate."). However, even though McKenna lacked standing, the Court elected not to dismiss herkahrs flooring orange county solid surface kitchen flooring

Of course as laminate flooring manufacturers we could customize different specifications per the customers' requests. Floors are of engineered wood in Mahogany, and for the backsplash, light beige ceramic tiles were used.

Suspended precast home legends wood flooring panels can make clear spans over difficult terrain, with acoustic and thermal benefits over a timber floor, and allow speedy installation on site. They are the best choice of flooring with allergy sufferers and improve air quality. The old way to do a sub floor would be to build the frame and then lay down panels...this stuff is just like laying regular flooring. We had skylights in our bedroom so the cork floor quickly faded where furniture pieces were. Ranging from simple rubber flooring rolls, starting at about $1 per square foot to our fashionable, carpet-topped interlocking entrance tiles that go for around $20 per square foot, we've got you covered.

Naked Tchopstix is a Pan-Asian restaurant and sushi bar located in the heart of Broad Ripple. They use.
The first roll my wife Jenni and I tried isn’t even on the menu. It came as a recommendation from our waitress, so if you go you should definitely ask for it by name. It’s called the King Kong Roll, and it is incredible.
The King Kong Roll is chock full of shrimp tempura, crab, spicy tuna, avocado, cream cheese and unagi, all tempura fried and served up on spicy mayo and sweet wasabi. Again, it’s not on the menu so ask for it by name!
To wash this incredible sushi down, I got a cup of green tea with lemon. Very refreshing.
Next up we got the Fire Roll. It has masago, cream cheese, crab, unagi, and avocado. The entire roll is tempura-fried, too, and anything fried is extra delicious!
For our last dish, we decided on the Corona Roll, which was featured in Indianapolis Monthly Magazine: ‘Things We Crave’. Inside it has spicy tuna, avocado and tempura chips. Outside it has white tuna, lime and wasabi mayo.
Naked Tchopstix is a family business open since the Fall of 2003. Through a fusion of fine and casual dining, the restaurant elaborates on the traditional definitions of asian cuisine to surprise, excite, and satisfy the senses. So, blogstalkers, if you love sushi, hop on over there as soon as you can! And if you don’t like sushi? Well, perhaps it is time you give it another try.
-AdamCommunity on Yoga, Meditation, Ayurveda and Spirituality you, no one can tell you what you should and shouldn’t eat, and how much… only you can know, its a very personal decision.
Our mind is very interested in extremes. Right now, detoxing is so popular around the world. In reality, it’s a large problem. One cannot over eat for a long period of time, then all of a sudden fast, or juice for a week. The digestion, the body is not ready for it. Especially when we go right back to overeating direct right after detoxing. We have a natural detox system in our body and we constantly destroy this mechanism, instead of assisting it. If we are balanced in our eating, and what we eat, then there is no need to detox.
Intestinal cleaning is a big fad right now. Many people are doing these detox programs to remove junk in their digestive tracks. The problem, is when everything is removed, we are left weak, and all the good bacteria is evacuated as well. Again, very difficult for our natural system to get back to working order, when we immediately go back to our normal diet after doing this cleansing. Another example, is taking an over amount of vitamins, nutrients, supplements etc. Again, many times we go to the extreme and it is too much for our digestion. What is needed is Yukta, or moderation.
We have a natural state in our being, and too often we go on one extreme or the other. In yogic processes instead of detoxing, we assist our natural body. In shatkarmas, or cleansing practices, we use the minimalist amount of material to assist our bodies. In Sutra Neti we use a single thread. In Vaman we use just salt and water.
Another natural way to assist our digestion is breathing. If done correctly, with a straight back and open chest, the diaphragm when moving out and in, should massage our internal organs (Perastaltic movement.) Instead, when we hunch over, do not stand and sit properly, we are congesting the body and destroying this natural detox system, which we then turn to other detox methods.
If we eat too much food, then our diaphragm can’t move freely, this natural state doesn’t occur and we end up getting tired and falling asleep. Cleaning our body is very similar to living in a house. If we overload and dont clean a bit each day, then we have to hire someone to do it, and we have to take a long time to do deep cleans at the end of the season or months. If we do a bit each day, then this detox is not needed.
Fasting can be a beautiful thing, if done in the right manner. If you care for your internal system, and want to provide some rest to this during a fasting, this can be very powerful. Instead, we see some people starve themselves to the point where their insides start eating itself, then at some point eat a ton of food, and possibly vomit it back up. This is the opposite of what fasting should be.
There are other ways to naturally detox our body. Our eyes take in so much during the day. Our eyes are constantly taking pictures during the day, which are being unconsciously thrown into the visual cortex. Sometimes these images surface at night during our dreams. Trataka is a beautiful way to clean the eyes by staring at a candle flame and allowing all emotions to surface and exit the body. Another is Brahmari Pranayam for the ears, which brings awareness from external sounds to our internal body.
In order for us to get the most out of yogic practices, we must practice a more moderate life. Yukta can become a core part of our lives, and allow us to rest our minds and bodies more. Also, allowing us to gain more from yogic practices.

Hi! Henry the Stephenson House mouse is back again. Let
me tell you, Ben's Birthday Party was great! There were lots of people
here enjoying ice cream and cake as they wished Col. Ben a happy birthday.
Mary, her committee and a lot of the FBSH Board members had "my"
house in tip-top shape. They had the windows sparkling clean and yes,
you are right, it was George who mopped the floors. The living room was
a step back to the 1820's with the antique furniture and antique accessories
on the mantel and tables. The breeze wafting through the open windows
completed a beautiful picture of Col. Ben and Lucy entertaining in the
1820's.
Henry saw lots of you folks at the party, including Bob, Henry and Shirley;
Esther, David and Mary Deane; Corrine, Betty Jean and Jean. Hey, we had
two Colonels' at the party: Col. Ben and Eleanor and Colonel Charles were
here! I watched as you all were enjoying the ice cream and that super
delicious cake of Dottie's. I watched and listened as you talked with
the folks dressed in 1820's clothing! I counted seventeen of Col. Ben's
visiting friends and relatives in their beautiful, authentic clothing
and they were enjoying the day! Wasn't Elle cute as Elvira the Stephenson's
young daughter?
You can see that the FBSH Board loves to give parties! This one was rather
special in that contributions could be made to a fund for Col. Ben's new
staircase. Well, once again you all were very generous and contributed
over $1600. The people of Edwardsville have a wonderful sense of history
and a tremendous community spirit. Col. Ben loves it and so does Henry!
The researchers received another nice surprise. It was a letter written
by Col. Ben to Daniel P.Cook on April 22, 1815. It was written as Ben
was on his way back to Kaskaskia from his first session in Congress. Ben
wrote from Summerset: " I arrived here this evening with my family,
the road is extremely bad, in four days more I expect to reach Pittsburgh,
when I intend to take water to Furguson's ferry." In the letter Col.
Ben asked Cook to rent him a home at Kaskaskia, writing "Get any
house that you think will answer, we won't be particular for the present."
He also told Cook that he needed a place for a hatter's shop. A young
man was with Ben and he wanted him to "go to business immediately."
Ben also had the equipment with him that would be needed for the hatter's
So, it appears that Lucy and family did make the trip to Washington with
Col. Ben. The researchers have never been too sure if she went with Col.
Ben or not. Then just the other day good old Cousin Jake came up with
some recollections! Jake recollects that Great-great-great grandfather
Samuel used to tell how excited Lucy got when she found out she could
visit her relatives and enjoy seeing her children meeting their aunts,
uncles and cousins. The Swearingen and Stephenson relatives lived in Martinsburg
and Shepherdstown, Virginia, and both towns were almost right on the way
to Washington. It seems just logical that she did not go to Washington
but took this opportunity to visit her family.
It is doubtful, though, that Lucy would have stayed in Washington with
Col. Ben in 1815. The stories Ol' Henry heard about the streets, the living
conditions and the social life in Washington plus the condition of the
roads just to get to Washington at that time were scary! Most members
of congress did not bring their wives and families until around 1850.
Sure sounds to Henry that Col. Ben brought his family home to Kaskaskia
after they visited relatives in Virginia. Congress had recessed for almost
a month before they headed back to Kaskaskia. It seems like the Stephenson's
spent some time in Virginia before they began their trip home to Illinois.
I have an idea that the researchers will tie all this together and they
will also find out where Summerset and Ferguson's Ferry were located.
As I said the birthday party was sure great and Henry even got some cake
crumbs! Then I really got lucky when I jumped in the car to go home with
Cassie. As I told Cousin Jake, I ate like a king for a couple days and
no one knew I was there! I got back home when Cassie's mother stopped
by Col. Ben's house and I just jumped out of the car! Col. Ben and Henry
both had a great couple days!
Right now I am waiting for the columns for the porch to arrive - they
will be awesome! Folks, Henry is sincerely glad you took time for another
look at Col. Ben's house. I keep telling you, do not miss this restoration
as it progresses!! When the upstairs area is ready for a group, you must
come see the upstairs rooms and see how the beams and wood were used for
the roof. You know, in the near future all this wonderful old brick and
the interior roofing will be hidden from view forever with plaster.
The big weekend and my secret visit to Cassie's have worn me out and I
am going to go enjoy a long, long nap.
See ya' later,

Raymond Zalas, 5, went to the hospital in critical condition and later passed away.
Rush hour traffic was brought to a slow trickle on Highway 89. Police taped off the area where Raymond was hit by an oncoming car.
"It hurts, I just can't imagine what the parents are feeling right now," witness Anise Pribbanow said.
Pribbanow just happened to drive by seconds after the collision. She rushed to Raymond's side.
"I looked over and there was a lifeless little body on the ground, everyone was just standing around him, everyone was on the phone," Pribbanow said.

North Salt Lake police said it appears Raymond was alone, trying to cross the busy road just before 5 p.m.
"He's in very critical condition, he was taken by medical helicopter to Primary Children's Hospital," Chief Craig Black said.
As for the driver of the car, police are still investigating whether speed, impairment or distraction may have had anything to do with the accident. No charges have been filed.
"All we know right now is the driver has stopped and he has been completely cooperative with this investigation so far," Black said.
People who live in the area say it's a tragedy but it's not a surprise.
"People run across the street all the time and it's so dangerous there is a crosswalk right down the street and I don't understand why people can't just walk down that way," Pribbanow said.Landmine Monitor 2004 Published in October 2004, this report was presented to the First Review Conference of States Parties in Nairobi, Kenya from 29 November to 3 December 2004.

Papa's Got To Write His Song | Song A Day #2079 [youtube/therockcookiebottom]
Here is a song 'Song A Day' guy Jonathan Mann made last week in collaboration with his son Jupiter. [jonathanmann.net]I love mechas a lot.
But I rarely play any games with them, usually due to my percived lack of good rules to play with. So when I did a search recently Mech Attack popped up more than a few times, and almost always with nothing but good things being mentioned, so I thought it was high time to play more with some big stompy robots!
The red team.
And the blue team.
I've been thinking that they might become houses of their own, maybe house Cerulean and house Scarlet or something like that. I like the Battletech fluff and such, so I might end up borrowing from it quite a lot.
Wierd angle shot, I'll try not to make any more of these!
The giants slowly move to engage..
The Blue medium (I really need to come up with some names for these guys!) gets the first hits in, knocking of some armor from red medium, and destroying some heatsinks. Ouch
The blue mech takes 2 critical hits, the damage overloading the system and the mech is out of the fight!
They both took quite a savage beating, none of them had more than a handful of armor blocks left on the grid by the time the red mech managed a lucky hit that blew the power core of his opponent.
It was lots of fun, but I realize that I'll probably re-design the mechs a bit for the next fight and see if I can't manage to paint up four more units, so I'll have a full lance per side!
I should have another game of Laserstorm and Clarkes 3rd adventure up in a few days, along with the buildings that I started making for these guys.
Til next time!
How long did the game take? Looks like it flew faster than an equivalent Battletech match, which would have my interests for sure.
The game took me about 30-45 minutes, I was much to busy with blowing up robots to keep exact track! ;)
It feels not too dissimilar from battletech, and some folks over on TMP even posted some Battletech conversions for Mech Attack, so there's that going for it as well. Most players I've talked to have had a lot of good things to say about it, so I'd recommend you try it, I don't think you'll regret it!
What fun! I keep thinking of doing a battle like that with my old Mechwarrior miniatures I cut from their clicky bases. The CAV mechs do look awfully sweet, though!
Good battle report. Thanks for sharing it.
It really was fun! Funny you should say that, since it seems that other than me, Clicky mechwarriors seems to be what people play this game with!
The Cav mechs appeal to me more than a lot of the battletech ones, even if there are some nice Battlemechs and Mechwarrior models!
Thanks, I'd really recommend these rules to anyone who wants a quick and fun mecha game, rather than the exercice in arithmetic that battletech often becomes!
Great stuff Alexander, always interesting to read about an area of gaming I know nothing about, ta for the introduction :-)
Thank you, and you're welcome! ;)
Mecha and spaceships have a special place in my heart, and lately I've been trying to get some more of my hobby time devoted to it!
Cool AAR. I like the CAV mechs. I don't have any of them (yet), but I will probably pick some up in the future. For my Mech Attack games, I use the Battleforce scale BT minis from Iron Wind Metals.
Thanks! I'd love to see yours too if you have any pics!
I believe you may have already seen them. In any case, a few pictures are located here:
I need to get back on the painting bandwagon. The backlog keeps growing.
Oh, so those bad boys are yours, very nice!
Nice mechs, though I prefer mine a bit smaller ;-)
Do you think this game could do something like VOTOMs or Heavy Gear style combat?
I do love heavy gear/VOTOMS/anime mecha as well, GZGs 6mm mechs are some of the best in the scale if you like that aesthetic!
I think you might, but most of your mechs would have to be designed with higher movement and lower amount of armor boxes than standard mechs in Mech attack if you want to stay true to the relative frailty of Gears/ATs.
I think I might try a game with some VOTOMS now, thanks for the idea!
Yeah, the GZG VOTOMS rock, I have a bunch of them converted with some National Cheese Emporium weapons.
I look forward to reading the AAR.Two good, in 12 weeks she had already gained 16 pounds. "he" really heard.

Forefront UAG SP1 can be installed as follows:
- As a service pack update that can be installed on the following releases:
- Forefront UAG RTM
- Forefront UAG Update 1
- Forefront UAG Update 2
- Forefront UAG SP1 (RC)
- As a complete clean installation that includes Forefront UAG with SP1.
The Forefront UAG SP1 update can be obtained from the Microsoft Download Center ().
Forefront UAG with SP1 as a clean installation can be obtained from the Volume Licensing Service Cetner (). For instructions on setting up Forefront UAG with SP1 as a clean installation, see Installing Forefront UAG 2010.
Installing SP1 as an update
Use the following topics to install SP1 as an update:
Installation recommendations
Before you install SP1, we recommend that you create a system restore point. You do not need to make a backup of your existing Forefront UAG configuration because a backup is automatically created during the installation of SP1; however, we also recommend that you back up your configuration before installing SP1.
Installation known issues
If during the installation of SP1 you click Cancel, Setup tries to roll back your installation. If the rollback is unsuccessful, you may be prompted to restart your computer. However, after restarting your computer, your pre-SP1 installation will not work. To resolve this, do the following:
- Go to the ...\Microsoft Forefront Unified Access Gateway\Common\Bin\ folder and rename ConfigMgrCom.exe.bak to ConfigMgrCom.exe
- Change the Microsoft Forefront UAG Configuration Manager service from Disabled to Automatic.
- Restart the computer.
- Activate the configuration.
You can now try again to install SP1.
Import limitations
You cannot import the configuration from a previous release of Forefront UAG; therefore, if you deploy SP1 in a lab, or test environment before you deploy SP1.The End (of the Year) Is Nigh
Brad Setzer's writing style is a bit dry, but his charts are eye-popping and he makes his point like a silver bullet to the brain: "private capital inflows to the US and private capital outflows from the US have fallen sharply." As in, fallen-off-a-cliff sharply.
So then, what is propping up U.S. Treasuries and the U.S. Dollar? America's livin' large lifestyle is largely supported by China and Japan (because they want to sell us stuff). The other big lender is Saudi Arabia, which also has an advantageous financial arrangement with the U.S.
If and when China, Japan and Saudi Arabia are no longer able to support the continued growth of US deficit financing, the dollar and the bonds will decrease in value. And that fall could come with avalanche-like suddenness.
So why do they continue to prop us up? Self-interest (we are their best customer) and a healthy dose of fear ... fear of what will happen when they no longer continue to provide us with unlimited credit.
This is why the world has not developed a sound replacement for the mighty greenback ... yet. It is because if they do, it will trigger a collapse of their dollar reserves and throw a wrench in their export driven economies,. And the scale of that derailment will likely be much worse than anything we can imagine.
I'm not going to say much more, other than check out Brad's nifty charts and analysis.
After you read that, start preparing for the coming storm: Potentially, we could see hyperinflation, if the U.S. dollar is revealed to be a Ponzi scheme worse than anything Bernard Madoff could have come up with. And remember, the shift from deflation (which we are in now) to hyperinflation (a collapse of the dollar) could be stunningly swift. Going back to my avalanche analogy, you never know what will set off an avalanche, but it's usually something very small in proportion to the outcome.
Can we avoid this fate? Sure we can. Nothing is written in stone. Strong political leadership -- combined with a great deal of luck -- could make a difference. Do you feel lucky?
Here is some other news worth reading ...

When a story is too crowded emotional attachments from audiences become scarce, however Room makes it much simpler, through and through all elements of the film including cinematography, dialogues and set designs are directing us to focus on Ma and Jack only, therefore narrowing our span of vision.
There is a distinct contrast between reality and innocence, as we could see from Tremblay’s intimate performance as Jack the disturbing truth that gradually unveils before us, when shown in a child’s perspective renders the scenes both more emotional and more effective in drawing us into the story. This twisted intimacy has also been achieved by the astonishing set design, where not a lot has been revealed in the room, yet we are aware of how minuscule their living space is.
The premise in a film such as Room is always a highlight and a definitive factor in its attraction. Particularly as the foundation of the setting manages to keep the plot vague yet at the same time maintaining a solid engagement, meanwhile also creating future opportunities for dramatic expansions.
The writing present a convincingly touching story with subtle, realistic depictions of emotions, which is in many ways a great achievement as the retrospective plot does have some plausibility issues. Throughout the first half of the film, any kind of stakes presented can put you at the edge of your seat, mostly due to the excellent developments which paved a firm path of progression.
In the second half the intensity and the thrill is slowed down tremendously and explores more intricately the ethical, moral dilemmas and the fascinating transitioning Jack and Ma now faces towards the outside world. What really shines here is the masterful performances by both Brie Larson as the traumatised mother and Jack the curious, yet caring and thoughtful child.
Overall Room is a worthy adaptation to a truly astounding novel, however the succinct delivery – which is a perfectly apt choice in the cinematic medium does not necessarily convey the sentimental impacts as well as the words of Emma Donoghue. Regarding it as a standalone though, it would make a very worthwhile trip to the theatre, not only is there wonderful acting involved the film also absorbs and captures the audiences completely.

Run Time: 118 minCold War politics makes an appearance in major league baseball in 1954. From 1954 through 1959, the Cincinnati Reds weren't known as the Reds, but the Redlegs. The name change was due to the Red scare, but I am not sure how going from the Reds to the Redlegs prevents any confusion. Maybe that is why they changed back to the reds after 1959. The previous four seasons, the Reds finished in 6th place in the National League, but with a name change they moved up to 5th place in 1954. The Reds/Redlegs would finish in the middle of the pack in the National League until they finally made a World Series appearance in 1961. Then of course, shortly after, the Big Red Machine started coming together.
Big Klu
The '54 Redlegs were in the upper half of the league in hitting, but didn't have a solid pitching staff. The offense was led by Ted Kluszewski, who had a monster year with 49 home runs, 141 RBIs (both categories he led the league) and a .326 batting average. This is one of the few players big time players that Topps had in their set, but wasn't in the Bowman set. Looking at Ted Kluszewski, he looks like he would have fit right in during the steroid era, as he would often wear his uniform with cut0off sleeves. He had several big season in the mid-1950s, but injured himself during a clubhouse fight in 1956. He was never the same, and was a part time player from 1957-1961, bouncing around from the Reds to the Pirates to the White Sox, and finally appearing with the Angels during their first season in 1961. It seems funny now, as scouting seems that no player is unfound, but in the mid-1940s, Klu was discovered when the Reds were in spring training in Indiana and he was on the grounds crew.

Exclusive players to a set are in italics

Topps All-Stars & Hall-of-Famers (1): Ted Kluszewski
Bowman All-Stars & Hall-of-Famers (1): Gus Bell
This is the first team we come across in 1954 that produces no hall-of-famers. The two all-star game representatives for the Reds in 1954 are each in two of the different sets. Neither set has the top two starting pitchers, Art Fowler or Corky Valentine. Johnny Temple is also missing, but his rookie card wouldn't appear until the 1955 Bowman set. Topps scores by having the best pitcher on this team on a card, in Frank Smith, and by having the only card of longtime Reds catcher Ed Bailey, although he didn't play enough to be considered a regular in 1954. I would say this is a very evenly matched team as far as what set to collect, as Topps has more of the bench players.

Managera classic and therefore enjoy without a second thought. However, a closer look into these rock hits reveals the hidden meaning behind why the lyrics were written and what hidden messages the artists are trying to communicate.
Here are five influential pieces that take a little digging to fully understand the hidden messages in the songs:
“Total Eclipse of the Heart” – Bonnie Tyler
Upon first listen, “Total Eclipse of the Heart” comes off as an emotionally charged love song. What most listeners don’t know is that it was originally written as a vampire love song and was featured in Jim Steinman’s Broadway musical, Dance of the Vampires.
When you listen closely, lyrics like “Once upon a time there was light in my life, but now there’s only love in the dark” lend themselves to a more cryptic theme. Although the song never outright mentions vampires or coffins, the tones of the song make sense for use in the musical. Despite its roots, this rock music meaning is widely known as a love song (for mortals).
“London Calling” – The Clash
Often interpreted as a politically charged anthem about the British government, “London Calling” was actually inspired by Joe Strummer’s fear of drowning. At the time of the song’s creation, headlines warning Londoners about the flooding of the Thames river sparked fear – and inspiration – in the band.
Lyrics like “The ice age is coming, the sun is zooming in. Meltdown expected, the wheat is growin’ thin. Engines stop running, but I have no fear ’cause London is drowning, and I, I live by the river” portray the warning as the start of the end of the world. Mick Jones explains that while the song was inspired by Strummer’s fear of drowning, it unfolded into a general warning of doom.
“Hey Jude” – The Beatles
This Beatles hit was written by Paul McCartney shortly after John Lennon’s divorce from his wife, Cynthia. Lennon’s son, Julian, who was five at the time, was having a rough time accepting his parent’s divorce. McCartney was close to the family and developed a special relationship with Julian, who he empathized with. He began singing “Hey Jules…” to himself and wrote the original draft of “Hey Jude” as a gesture of comfort for Julian.
He later expanded the lyrics and changed the name in the song to “Jude” to fit his style. Lines like “And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain, don’t carry the world upon your shoulders” depict the comforting tone that McCartney was trying to communicate. It wasn’t until 20 years later that Julian discovered the song was originally created for him.
“American Pie” – Don McLean
While the upbeat pace and catchy lines of this song sound like a cheerful anthem of American youth, it was actually written as a goodbye to an era. In 1959, Buddy Holly, along with several other musical superstars, boarded a plane that tragically crashed, killing everyone aboard. This rocked the music world and inspired Don McLean to write “American Pie” in 1972.
Lyrics like “The day the music died” are in reference to that fatal plane crash, which symbolizes the loss of the romance and idyll that characterized the fifties and sixties. In short, the song illustrates the departure of the American dream in a way that is simultaneously light and comforting.
“Hotel California” – The Eagles
This mellow, catchy hit seems like a west-coast-vacation-inspired ballad, but upon closer inspection, the lyrics are actually calling out excess in America. The song depicts the high life in LA as interpreted by Glenn Frey, Don Henley, and Don Felder. Lyrics like “They stab it with their steely knives, but they just can’t kill the beast” and “You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave!” expose the darker side of an extravagant LA lifestyle. In the 2013 History of the Eagles documentary, Don Henley explained, “It’s a song about a journey from innocence to experience.”
Whether it’s a political statement decorated with a cheerful chorus or a personal message of comfort embedded in a chart-topping classic, hidden messages in songs add depth to the artist’s work. Often times, song inspiration sparks from societal events, personal struggles and triumphs, cultural nostalgia, or opinions of the artist. Taking the time to pick apart the lyrics and identify the significance behind them can cultivate a deeper connection to the song and, as a result, the artist.Predicting sport superstars: How well are we doing?
In 2004, the DC United soccer club made United States history by signing the youngest athlete ever to a professional sports contract. At just 14-years-old, Freddy Adu--born in Ghana and moved to Rockland, Maryland when he was 8--was dubbed the next Pelé and the future of U.S. soccer.
Three months later Freddy again made history by being the youngest player to ever score a goal in the MLS. That season he would go on to play in 30 games, scoring 5 goals and 3 assists--a solid start for someone who should have been completing the 8th grade at the time.
However his development as a soccer player wasn't panning out as expected. After two more seasons with DC and a brief stint with Real Salt Lake, he boarded a plane to Europe where he spent the next five seasons being loaned between teams in Portugal, Greece, and Turkey--but never finding success he was looking for.
In 2011, Freddy returned to the MLS for a few seasons with the Philadelphia Union before again trying his luck abroad in South America. Same result.
Four years later, the former can't-miss-kid signed a deal with the Finnish club Kuopion Palloseura. After his signing, Marko Rajamaki the team's head coach was quoted as saying,
I can't say what went wrong in his career. He told me he has been ill-advised in the past. Maybe the problem is that everybody told him he was the saviour who would revolutionise football.
My intention is not to pick on Freddy. I'm sure he's a great dude and despite his lack of success is still one hell of an athlete. But what I find unique about Freddy's story--unlike other prospect busts--are two things:
First, there is no logical explanation for why his career didn't unfold as it was predicted. There was no injury. No drug abuse. No scandal. Nothing to point to where you could say "Ah. That makes sense...bad luck."
The superstardom just didn't come.
Second, Freddy wasn't just supposed to be good. He was supposed to be one of the all-time greats. He was such a rare young talent that it seemed impossible for him not to develop into a soccer icon. Yet while he has continued to play professionally for over 10 years, his career so far could best be described as average.
Was Freddy a casualty of the American sports-hype machine? Or are we just that bad at predicting talent?
How good are we and predicting athletic success?
The natural argument to the Freddy Adu story is Sidney Crosby or Andre Agassi--athletes that were tapped for greatness at a young age and succeeded in reaching the pinnacle of their sports. But looking to case studies of success or failure doesn't really examine the issue or answer the question of how good we are at foreseeing athletes' futures.
In sport, it’s easy to get focused on the athletes at the top. However these athletes are exceptional not only in their talent, but in their rarity. They represent such a small piece of the pie that looking to them for insight leads us astray. They are the outliers. The statistical freaks.
It's easy to spot the Freddy Adus and Lebron James' of the world. And you know something? With a couple of exceptions, we're fairly good and predicting them to rise to the top of their class. But that breed of athlete is so exceptional that we learn little about how well we're identifying and developing the other 99% of the athletes out there. To do that we must zoom out to see what's really going on.
A little research
A 2013 study on young soccer players tracked the turnover rate of the German national junior programs and found that only one-third of those who represented Germany at the junior level reappeared on the senior national team. They also found that the earlier an athlete made their debut in the national program, the less likely they were to advance to the most elite German soccer leagues. (1)
Most young players selected at a particularly early age were replaced within a short time by others who had developed more prosperously outside the youth academies and national U-teams. - Arne Güllich
Another German study on cyclists looked at the careers of 8004 athletes between 1980 and 2004 and found that only 34% of cyclists that participated in junior World Championship events went on to compete in elite competitions. (2)
In 2014, a longitudinal study tracked the careers of 395 Portuguese male and female athletes born between 1974 and 1981 who competed internationally in soccer, judo, swimming and volleyball. Again, they found that about one third of international pre junior athletes reappeared to compete as seniors. (3)
Another longitudinal study in 2011 tracked 242 elite swimmers through the ages of 12 to 18 looking at performance times, when they showed the greatest improvement, and if they could use their data to predict future performance. They found that the younger the swimmers were, the more variance they showed in their performance times and that age 16 was when performance began to steady and they could begin to accurately predict their performance as adults. (4)
To explain some of this Roel Vaeyens and his colleagues published a paper in 2008 entitled Talent Identification and Development Programmes in Sport, emphasizing that adolescents aren't guaranteed to retain the their athletic qualities as they transition into adulthood. And many of the distinguishing characteristics of elite athletes aren't apparent until late adolescence, making early identification totally unreliable.
They go on to discuss that physical development is highly unstable and multidimensional. The muscular system, bone growth, tendon and ligament elasticity, cardiovascular development, and motor coordination don't all develop in unison. Despite what we would like to believe, talent, athleticism, potential--whatever you want to call it--is not a singular or measurable quality. It is the output of multiple systems and abilities that are constantly evolving and interacting throughout the athlete's development. (5)
But elite performance can be influenced by social, psychological, economical, and geographical factors as much as physical ones. The Swiss owe their success in skiing to their geographical proximity to mountains as much as their leg strength. New Zealand produces the best rugby talent in the world not because Kiwis are born with thicker necks or bigger hands, but because of their cultural obsession with the sport.
To make a future prediction based on a snapshot in time is not only short-sighted, but it fails to consider what went in to produce that performance in the first place. It's like saying a 12 second 100m dash isn't very impressive without realizing that the 15-year-old kid who ran it didn't have any shoes on.
Performance is obvious, but foreseeing performance needs context.
So what are we good at?
Just because there are some flaws in our ability to spot future top performers doesn't mean we are at a total loss. Recent research into what successful athletes have in common has exposed some interesting things.
Claude Bouchard, a genetic researcher from Baton Rouge, Louisiana is at the forefront of research on trainability: the idea that certain individuals respond better and faster to training than others. The idea of trainability is not new. Anyone involved with training athletes can testify to the phenomenon that if you apply the same training plan to a large group of athletes, some will just respond better than others. But we’re starting to see real data for this phenomenon. Recent research has emerged out of Bouchard’s lab showing that an athlete’s trainability may be genetically predicted (6, 7).
Beyond physical talent
Although we usually look for physical indicators of talent and ability, another area that can not be ignored is the mind.
For example, self-regulation is the process of internally setting performance objectives and then continually monitoring and adapting practice to move closer to those goals. It’s a coach's way of saying "paying the hell attention and taking ownership."
There is a significant body of research showing elite athletes score higher on self-regulation abilities, indicating they take ownership over their own success and failure, engage in more reflection, and have higher levels of effort. As a result they are able to make progress faster and more consistently than others. (8-10)
Athletic potential spans far beyond just an athlete's biological abilities. Several recent studies have shown that the size of the town where an athlete grew up can have an impact on their success. (11-13) According to this research, athletes from small to moderate-sized communities are at an advantage because they provides more training and talent development opportunities than larger cities. In looking at where pro athletes originate from, we in fact see an overrepresentation of athletes from smaller communities playing in the NHL, NBA, PGA, and MLB.
The consequence of an assumption
Think about how we've organized our athlete development system. Starting from the beginning of a young athlete's career, we cluster the top performers together with the expectation that they will remain the top performers as they develop.
But the idea that the best young athletes are most likely to become the best adolescent or adult athletes is nothing more than an assumption. While this certainly can happen, it isn't the rule. And we definitely aren’t seeing it in the data.
But I understand the logic of the system. I get that we want the best athletes together to foster an environment that grows and nurtures talent. I’m not arguing for the banishment of all travel programs or all-star teams.
My issue is in the timing.
A performance-based system of talent development that is by definition elitist and exclusionary should, I think, not be instituted until later in the youth sports tract.
I just have a problem calling any human being younger than 10-years-old elite in anything. I think it sends the wrong message both to the kid that makes the team, and the kid that doesn't.
And just to be clear, this isn't coming from some Nanny-state notion of participation trophies where no-one's feelings get hurt. Adversity, struggle, and learning to deal with defeat should be part of the youth sport experience. I think it's critical that we force our kids to deal with difficult times. But we need to be careful when it comes with messing with kids' identities.
And that is the real problem.
By structuring youth sports in this way, we fail to capture late developers and athletes who may have extremely high potential, but for whatever reason can't realize it at 9-years-old. For every kid that gets selected to the team, two get cut--relegated to "B" status, sent home and told to simply work harder. One of those kids might have the desire to keep persisting, the other might walk away with the idea that "I'm just not good, and that's that."
I know this because I've lived it, I've seen it, and I've coached kids that are walking around with labels of their ability stamped in their consciousness.
Summary
If we've learned anything here--it's that although we seem to be good at recognizing top performance, we're not all that good at predicting it. And this ability to predict gets worse and worse the younger the athlete gets.
As much as we love to stand behind the glass and comment on how good this kid or that kid is--the reality is that our view from the stands isn't a peek into their futures.
Accurate prediction just isn't reliable at young ages, so let's just give it a rest, focus on the things that matter, be great teachers, and keep kids in the game. It's probably the single best thing that can be done for their future.

Arsenal are working with Roma in order to extend the Goalkeepers loan. Szczesny claimed last month that Arsenal and Roma were in talks to discuss his future.
The 26-year-old was very impressive with Roma last season and was able to revive his form which made him No. 1 at Arsenal. He appeared in 43 games for Roma, with MOTM performances in two. He has enjoyed his time in Italy and revealed that he has learned more at Roma in a season than he did at Arsenal in 10 years.
Arsenal won’t be keen on having Szczesny back at the Emirates Stadium, because Petr Cech had a great season. The ex-Chelsea man hasn’t found it difficult to settle at the new club and has been reliable with his shot-stopping skills.
Also, earlier it appeared that Szczseny would return to London because Roma signed Brazilian keeper Allison for £5.7 million. But according to sources, they will loan him to Serie A rivals Fiorentina, which might enable Szczesny to spend another year or two in Italy on a permanent deal.Wee Blessing is a curated service that specializes in stylish, brand-name clothing. In its infancy, Wee Blessing focused solely on apparel for kids age newborn-14.
But now Wee Blessing is offering the precious gift of time to the whole family, including collections for men, women, teens, expectant moms and plus-size women.
In the beginning, I had doubts about the curated clothing business model. You expect consumers to embrace a service that puts together outfits based on your profile? Won’t they miss shopping? Will they actually be delighted to open a box and see garments they might not have chosen for themselves?
Not to worry. If you don’t like the items, you send them back. If you buy them all, you receive a bonus discount off the already marked-down prices.
The success of pioneer Stitch Fix and other curated services shows that stylish, time-crunched consumers are open to letting someone else do the shopping. I’ve interviewed a number of fashionable women who say they appreciate the opportunity to work with a remote stylist who approaches their wardrobe with fresh eyes. So when the nice folks at Wee Blessing asked if I would like to try their service, I said yes.
I also think their model is on the leading edge regarding the kids’ market. Imagine how thrilled a child is opening a box of really cool clothes!
Based on my questionnaire, Wee Blessing promptly delivered five articles of clothing; two sets of pants and tops, and a cute dress. All were desirable brand names, in impeccable condition with tags attached.
My fave is the Adrianna Papell cranberry keyhole knit top with fashion-forward bell sleeves (MSRP: $78, $32 through Wee Blessing). I wore it to a Christmas party, where I got lots of compliments, a true litmus test of fashion.
The box also included: a pretty pink print Lucky Brand top; Calvin Klein dark moon-washed jeans; Michael Kors classic black dress pants; and a Philosophy Malibu orange sleeveless frock that is cute but more appropriate for spring.
Four out of five is a mighty fine batting average. Wee Blessing also is offering an attractive incentive, a $50 credit when you refer a friend.Food for Preventing Wrinkles

Porno For Pyros
12/02/95 Seattle, WA, Center Arena (Deck the Hall Ball)
When I first heard Porno For Pyros were playing a Christmas show in Seattle, I was so excited! It would be the first time I got to see a man who I admired as a pure genius, Perry Farrell, in concert. I arrived at the Mercer Arena in only a t-shirt, and standing in line it was about 8,000 degrees below zero and I was shaking and shivering uncontrollably. Well anyways, it was one of those modern rock fests, and a bunch of bands like Everlclear, the Rentals, and Oasis played first. Then Sonic Youth played an amazing set. Then Porno for Pyros finally took that stage, setting the mood with Porpoise Head. This was the first string of shows they had ever tried their new and improved songs at, and Good God's Urge wasn't due on store shelves for a couple more months, so this new music was a surprise to everybody! The slow, swaying motion of Porpoise Head set the gigantic sea of bodies into crushing, pushing, swirling mayhem, and I could barely breath. But this also, to me, indicated the excitement in the air; everybody was there to see Porno, and everyone wanted to be up front. The songs were all new, so I don't really recall the setlist. They played Pete's Dad, GG:U, Meija, Bad Shit.. in the middle of the show Perry blazed up a j, passed it to all the members, and then Watt just stuck it in his mouth and puffed on it for a song or two. There was an encore of Mountain Song, and I forget what else because I was too busy fending for my life! I just remember I left that night REALLY happy, and excited that I had seen a great show. ryan

HUALIEN Is The Wallflower Of Taiwanese Towns

Yesterday’s long walk in Taipei took a toll on me. Thankfully, I had time to take a long nap to recharge my batteries. Next stop: East Taiwan.
What To See And Do In TAIPEI, Taiwan
DAY 1
Woah, travelling, is really a waste of time. When you’re moving between miles, trying to get from one place to another, there’s not much you can do to be productive but sleep and make a futile attempt to read. We left Kuala Lumpur’s LCCT airport at 10am, boarded a four hour flight, and only checked in at a hotel in Taipei at 6pm.
6 Tips And A Great Itinerary You Need To Know Before Travelling To TAIWAN
OmniMount OMH TV Mount for 32-Inch to 60-Inch TVs – Silver
My daughter saved up her allowance, did some odd jobs, and with her birthday money was able to get a TV for her room. She has always had a little 19″ CRT, but her room tends to be where all the neighborhood kids hang out to watch movies. So she went big! Only problem was: where to put it?
The wall was the only place it could go. The OmniMount OMH made wall mounting her TV super easy.
Step 1: Unpack. The box has all the hardware you need to install the mount. No extra run to the hardware store!
Step 2: Mount the hanger. Easy. The unit went flush to the wall. I love the cords to latch and unlatch the TV.
Step 3: Mount TV on the “handle bars”. You slide some clips around. They provide every size of screw imaginable. BAM! TV attached.
Step 4: TV on wall. Seriously, that easy.
The only complaint I have is that the plastic face plate for the metal wall mount was extremely difficult to take off. I didn’t want to take a screwdriver to it and scratch it, but I almost lost a finger nail getting to the mounting holes.
Overall: 4 stars. Super easy mounting system. Just don’t make me hurt myself to do what should have been a simple step.Description:
Don’t just mount your TV, hang it on a sleek mount that complements your TVs form and function. The simple, sleek design looks great and installs in under 10 minutes.
– Designed to install in under 10 minutes
– Sleek look complements modern TVs
– Low profile for floating effect
– Foam wedge holds TV away from wall for one-person wiring
– Locking mechanism prevents accidental TV removal and only requires only two mounting holes

There are a myriad of public speaking tips out there to help you build and maintain your speaking business, but after a decade of working with professional speakers, in a variety of markets, there are a few things that I recommend more regularly than others. These five strategies have been instrumental to the success of my speaker colleagues and they can help you too!
1. Look bigger than you are
I’ve been blessed to work with a number of speakers as my company and I have evolved and grown. One common issue they all face, as sole proprietors, is how to get everything done that needs to be done, including producing quality content, all by themselves. If this sounds like you, chances are that your callbacks to prospects happen in between everything else you have to do, with very little prep time, and while your mind is considering other business issues.
Even if you can’t bear the thought of letting go of anything else, have someone contact new prospects, on your behalf, to set up that first appointment or phone consultation. You’ll have an appointment on your calendar that you know you have to prepare for. Then, you can spend the time you would have spent playing phone tag, researching and preparing for that first meeting. Also, you’ll find that the prospect will appreciate having the same advantages. It’s basic communication and you have more important ways to spend your time.
Little touches like having someone set up the initial consult for you and helping with logistic confirmations before your programs can take some real pressure off of you. You can then spend more time producing great content while, at the same time, making yourself and your company look “bigger” and more credible. In this business, with all its egos and honorifics, looking bigger than you are is important, and expected.
2. Don’t give quotes before interviewing the prospect
Every prospect-contract-client cycle starts (or should start) with a conversation between you and the prospect. During that conversation, you establish rapport and help the prospect understand why you are the fit for them (or not!). Without this conversation, the cycle breaks, no contract will happen, and the prospect will not become a client.
We all know this, but sometimes we just blurt out our fee range to whoever calls without insisting on this critical step in the process. Just as many job openings are filled by predetermined candidates, the prospect calling you for a quote may simply be gathering prices to justify a pre-determined course of action with another speaker or consultant. When you give a quote to an in-coming cold call, you may just be helping the caller justify hiring someone else.
Ask yourself how many prospects cold-calling you for quotes you can confirm as having converted. Make it your policy to have a conversation with the prospect to discuss their needs before you give them a quote. Then, you’ll have their information in your database and the quote you give will be accurate and based on fact. If they won’t take the time to speak with you, they aren’t really a prospect.
3. Negotiate smartly and charge what you’re worth
The single most universally painful issue that speakers deal with is fees. If you’ve worked in this business more than a week, you’ve dealt with this. You know what your fee ceiling can be, and you know how close to it you should be based on your expertise, experience, and topic. You also know, if you think about it objectively, that the clients who really want you always seem to find the money somewhere.
Know what you’re worth, don’t be afraid to ask for it, and negotiate from a position of informed strength. The strategies for how to do that effectively are widely discussed in every NSA (National Speakers Association) chapter. The point is that, no matter what your market, you deserve to get what you are worth for the services you offer. The money is there if the prospect is serious about the initiatives they are considering you to support.
Think about what happens when you discount, cut corners, and disregard what you know you need in order to accommodate a client. Why do those contracts always seem to be the ones that take the most effort with the worst ROI?
4. Grow your list and stay in front of your subscribers
I can’t even count the number of times I’ve consulted with a speaker who has no real plan in place to build a list, get subscribers, or to stay in front of them. Some say, “Well, they aren’t decision makers. They can’t hire me.” Who do you think the decision makers talk to before they hire you? The number of contracts that close as a result of prior attendee recommendations is huge, in my experience.
There is always a way to collect email addresses. Use your imagination and be creative, but never do a program without planning at least one way for attendees to subscribe to all the great material you have to offer outside of the program. Of course, that means you must have great content (free or paid) to offer outside the program, but that’s a different article.
It’s a numbers game. For example, according to a 2013 Constant Contact report, the average open rate for the Education industry was 17-20% with a click-through rate of 10-13%. My experience is that these numbers are a bit… exaggerated, regardless of your market. Looking at it another way, on a good day, 15 people out of every 100 will open your email and 1-4 of that 15 will actually click through to your website or intended content.
Clicks to your website boost your visibility on keyword searches… and the cycle begins. The more people on your list, and in your field of influence, the more people you get helping that cycle work for you.
Email, social networking, your website… think about what your audience needs and give them the incentives to subscribe, to stay on your list, and keep their eyes on you. The effort is, ultimately, well worth it.
5. Use a program manager
I attended an NSA chapter meeting where the main speaker was the current national president and was amazed by what I saw. Before the event, when people were arriving, getting coffee, and socializing – the time during which every speaker should be establishing a rapport and getting to know their audience – this speaker was busy hunting down the right tool to remove the light bulbs over the projection screen. Why? Because there was no one else there to make sure that everything was the way he needed it to be.
Except for setting up their laptop and doing a sound check, no speaker should have to spend their pre-program time dealing with logistics.
Whether your program requires nothing more than a microphone and an audience or space for small groups doing hands-on activities, the logistics involved in producing a quality program can sometimes take as much effort to sort out as the content you will present.
There should always be someone, who isn’t you, responsible for making sure the venue is set up correctly and that the audiovisual needs are met, so that you can spend your time focused on the content rather than the environment.
In some cases, this could be as simple as requiring the client to assign someone to this role. You should have their name and contact information and provide them with detailed instructions and expectations. They should meet you when you arrive to set up and stay with you until you are packed up to leave.
If your program is more involved and requires extensive or specific set up, tear down, or preparation, consider bringing in someone that you trust to help with these things. When I talk to clients about this, the first objection is always cost. There are ways to deal with that issue, but I can say, from experience, that having a program manager pays for itself in peace of mind and lost hours working the details.
The other objection that I hear about this idea is a fear that it will hinder client rapport. You and the client both want the same thing: a well planned, well presented, inspiring and informative event. Let them help share the responsibility for making sure that happens.
If an on-site program manager will serve your needs, put that stipulation in the contract. If you’d rather have a staff member perform these duties, work those costs into the fee you negotiate.
These ideas apply to every speaker, and every market, that I have ever had the opportunity to work with. Apply them to your business and experience the benefits for yourself.

Charles Locke, 42, was sentenced to 19 and a half years in prison after pleading guilty last month to having a sexual relationship with the teen and videotaping two encounters.
“It was an emotional thing,” Locke told the court Wednesday. “I had no control.”
Locke said he was exhausted from working 90 hours a week when he met the girl at a recreation center, according to Raw Story. He served as a security guard there, in addition to his police duties.
The girl’s family became suspicious when the two began spending a lot of time together at the recreation center and in his police cruiser, according to 19 Action News. Her parents said they heard rumors he had relationships with teens he met at the rec center.
Locke was arrested in July and placed on unpaid administrative leave. He was fired after pleading guilty last month to five counts of pandering sexually oriented matter involving a minor, two counts of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor and one count of possessing criminal tools.
Videos of Locke’s encounters with the teen were too graphic to show in court.
Locke is an “aberration,” Carl Hartman, Internal Affairs investigator, said.
“He is a cancer among the proud, honest and hard-working members of the Cleveland Division of Police,” Hartman said. “Charles Locke is a monster.”
The girl said she is now struggling with depression.
“I trusted him a lot,” the teen wrote in a letter to the court. “My mood now changes too much. I’m depressed. I’m sad, mad, and sometimes happy.”
This case was the first time Locke was disciplined since he began working for the police department in 2007, attorney Deanna Robertson said. He gained notoriety in 2009 as the officer who arrested serial killer Anthony Sowell and testified at his trial.

We were commissioned to create a 30 second animation encouraging children and parents to find and use their local NHS dentist.
The theme we devised was a tooth fairy visiting her local dentist. The approach we felt would both appeal to children and adults was in the form of a fun 3D animation.
The projects started with storyboards and concept creations for our two main characters in the advert. Here is a peak at a few of the early stage concepts for the tooth fairy..
Learn how you can manage your pain, prevent further joint damage and treat your symptoms. The following article will give you some great advice on how you can go about treating arthritis and how to best manage the pain.
Scientific studies have demonstrated that moderate alcohol consumption does not make arthritis worse. On the contrary, studies have shown that moderate alcohol consumption may even lessen some symptoms..
Arthritis is very stress-sensitive, so you can see great results quickly if you learn to relax. Whenever you are feeling stressed, your body releases chemicals that often cause inflammation, worsening your arthritis. Getting a little regular exercise or scheduling more thoroughly (to eliminate the unexpected) can reduce the level of stress you experience and keep your arthritis at bay.
One supplement that many arthritis suffers recommend is fish oil. The Omega 3 acids in the oil are medically proven to lower the inflammation or pain that joints often suffer from. You can find fish oil in supermarkets and vitamin stores.
Psoriatic Arthritis probably keeps you from doing everything you used to. Your energy levels are not the same as they used to be. Your symptoms will get worse if you ignore them. Take stock of what is most important to you, and then focus on that. You don’t have to do too much for everyone at the same time.
Going to a sauna regularly can be beneficial if you suffer from chronic arthritis. The inflammation in the joints will reduce under the action of moisture and heat. You must use the sauna regularly for best results.
Believe it or not, it is helpful to develop solid abs if you want to improve your joint pain. Strong back and abdominal muscles help you carry the weight of your body properly. Be careful that you do not overwork yourself during your workout.
You should make sure that you are sleeping well. People who suffer from arthritis need the energy that a good night’s sleep provides, so be sure you sleep as long and as deeply as you can. Try turning off your cellphone, turn the alarm clock around, and sleep with no lights on. Use relaxation methods to calm down before you fall asleep.
Be sure to get all the water you need. You can enjoy other beverages when you’re thirsty, but clean fresh water is the most beneficial. Avoid liquids that can dehydrate you, like those that contain coffeine..HEMPSTEAD, Texas (AP) — The latest on the investigation into the death of a woman in a Texas jail cell (all times local):

How was your day dear?I guess the question ''What does Illustration mean'' is something I rarely stop to think about or have answered so this is a nice opportunity to get my thoughts down in response to this. Like everything in life I think people can have their own interpretation of what Illustration means to them individually. When I try to explain to people what I am studying, people who are not in the creative industries don't understand what I do, so I either say it's like Graphic Design, even though it's not!, some people at that point get it and some still don't have a clue, so I mention pictures in children's story books and explain how they are created by Illustrators, it's the easiest explanation to give sometimes.
I read the 2012 article in Varoom magazine by Michael Salu, he quotes ''As our visual language evolves, the playing field is levelling. Graphic designs, sculptors, painters, creative developers and even musicians amorphously meander across different parts of our creative industries."
The above quote to me sparks excitement, that the industry is becoming more diverse and versatile, I think traditional illustration was more confined to just being an illustrator and only using drawing, painting, collage as means of communicating a message, this was something that worried me a little in second year when I discovered a love for making, I wasn't sure if there would be a market for me out there as my work isn't about drawings, but more about making and creating a 3D world. However as I have progressed through the course and have looked towards wonderful inspiring illustrators such as Lord Whitney, Vanessa Boer and Polly Becker, and even Hattie Stewart - It has really instilled confidence in me that you can be true to yourself regardless of what medium you use to communicate your work and that there is a market out there regardless.
For example if there was a Theatre Set with a violinist playing music, that in a way to me is illustrating a mood, a meaning and a narrative. That's why I am excited how the boundaries are changing, to me it says there are no limits. I like to think in the future I will be illustrating through various mediums such as drawing, props, objects, costume and use of photography/music. I read an article on Hattie Stewart who has been collaborating with the fashion/beauty world internationally, which really shows that different industries are inter-twining and collaborating, again this is really interesting for people such as myself who will be graduating next year. Technology developments are also altering how Illustrators create and see their work, we are also having to broaden our skill sets, which may not be a bad thing. Another great example of a versatile illustrator is Jan Svankmajer, he uses what ever medium he feels relevant to use such as film, photography, animation, I-stop motion, drawing etc, I love that his work is varied and not confined, he also pushed the boundaries as he was banned for 10 years from making any films, due to a controversial piece he created that had political connections.
The term 'Illustration' dates back to the 15th Century when wood cut illustration became available in books, it also originates from the latin word 'illu'stro' to enlighten or irradiate. Polly Becker's view on what illustration means to her ''is the idea that an illustrator might be trying to elucidate, shed light, or be lucid'', this is a really nice idea, I think aims and themes in illustrators work can alter how they see illustration. That's the beauty of it, it's different in everyones eyes and mind.
When I look back to my work in the foundation Visual Communication course, my work was very ephemeral and a little graphic, in my first year of my degree I was still very sketchbook based and my work was all flat and I didn't really take risks, then I discovered making in 3D, and I have been working this way since, developing into character making and I have recently become fascinated with props and found objects, I feel like I am still evolving though which is a humbling feeling. I still really enjoy collage and using ink pens, I realise that I don't do as much of this anymore and I hope to get back to it soon. In the future I hope to be playing more on the senses by collaboration or bringing my work to life by use lighting, music, props and film, and I also hope that I stay true to myself.
I personally don't think the name 'Illustration' should be changed, as it's clear that it can be interpreted in many ways and can be delivered via any medium.watching my wife suck dick » Money» Soft to hard to cum

“Magnus was gay himself,” says Undiscovered podcast co-host Elah Feder. “He was both a scientist and an activist, and he was really hoping that his science would lead to greater acceptance of gay and lesbian people.”

Hirschfeld founded what’s considered to be the first gay rights organization and established the Institute for Sexual Science in Berlin. He also gained international renown for his radical research on the biology of sexual orientation. “He was, in the 1930s, touring the world lecturing about sexuality in China and India,” says co-host Annie Minoff. “The American press actually called him the ‘Einstein of sex.’”
But as Minoff and Feder explore in a recent episode of Undiscovered, Hirschfeld’s legacy didn’t turn out quite as he’d hoped.
“Magnus was using the science at his disposal, right?” Minoff says. “So now, we might talk about genetics or even epigenetics, but back in his day, scientists could see chromosomes under the microscope, but they still weren't sure if they had anything to do with heredity.”
“So, Magnus was really all about documenting and recording things like physical traits or behavioral traits, trying to see what gays and lesbians might have in common or might be different than the rest of the population.”
Today, some of Hirschfeld’s research comes across as antiquated, even a bit zany. In one excerpt from his book, “The Homosexuality of Men and Women,” Hirschfeld debunks an apparently long-held stereotype that gay men can’t whistle.
“This does not agree with the results of our statistics,” he wrote, explaining that in a sample of 500 gay men, 77 percent could whistle, although “only a few could truly whistle well.”
“But he found that among lesbians, the whistling arts were very strong, which was nice to hear,” Feder adds.
Other aspects of Hirschfeld’s science have better weathered the tests of time. “So, for example, he was interested in whether homosexuality ran in families,” Feder says. “You know — was it a heritable trait?”
“Or, you might remember a few years ago, there were a bunch of studies looking at the correlation between finger length ratios and sexual orientation. They seemed to find a connection in women. And he did stuff like that. He was looking at hip-to-shoulder ratios — pretty pioneering sex research.”
In 1919, Hirschfeld opened his Institute for Sexual Science, a big villa in Berlin’s Tiergarten. “They had medical examination rooms, they had a library, they had a sex museum that was apparently a big tourist attraction,” Feder says.
And, as Yonsei University history professor Robert Beachy explains, the institute also offered sex education to Germans who were queasy about publicly seeking advice.
“They had a little box at the edge of the property, and people could anonymously insert slips of paper with questions about sex or any sort of sexual issue that they had,” he says. “And then people were invited in, and these different slips of paper would be read out loud and then responded to.”
“There were questions about things like, I don’t know, [about] premature ejaculation and how effective it was to use condoms for preventing pregnancy. You know, just lots of relatively mundane questions. But it was supposed to be a public service.”
But if Hirschfeld hoped that greater scientific understanding could change Germany’s discriminatory law, Feder says things didn’t quite turn out that way in his lifetime. (Paragraph 175 wasn’t struck down until 1994.)
“It’s a nice idea,” she says, “but as we end up seeing in Magnus’ story, you can do science, you can hope that it’s going to be used in one way, and it can work out very differently.”
“And his story ultimately is a pretty tragic one.”
This article is based on an interview that aired on PRI's Science Friday with Ira Flatow. You can listen to the full episode about Magnus Hirschfeld on Undiscovered.

Blurb from Goodreads:
A Review:
This is the first book in a long time that I stayed up all night reading once I started it! I loved it! It is the perfect antidote for the end of election season.
Anne is an intern in Senator Stephen McAvoy's office and, from her first day in the office, there is an unmistakable pull between them. Of course, a relationship between them would be taboo and so a friendship begins. However, it isn't too long before their friendship turns romantic. I loved their courtship and growing relationship -- it was very romantic and my heartstrings pulled for them having to keep it secret.
I loved the interplay between the inside workings of Washington versus the real need to have a relationship that was not defined by those trappings. All the characters were well developed and extremely well written.
I hate to give away the ending but my favorite part was definitely the elopement! It was so magical and I loved all the reactions to it.
A Political Affair is a well written, political romance!

Just like every other mother in the Western world in 2014, we do a lot of smoothies around here.
Sometimes it’s because there’s a lot of fruit to use up, sometimes it’s just because it’s easy, sometimes it’s because I can bump up the fussy butts’ nutrition needs with them, and sometimes it’s just because they’re yum.
If we’ve got V8 juice, then sometimes that goes in too for an extra veggie boost – this one is ¼ cup walnuts + 1 tablespoon sunflower seeds + 2 bananas + ½ cup blueberries + 1 cup V8 Breakfast Fusion + ½ avocado + 2 teaspoons coconut oil + ½ cup coconut water. So damn good.
The smalls and I journeyed to Westfield Southland last week to check out one of the V8 Juiceology bars being rolled out. Sprightly young things (called Masterblenders, isn’t that cute?!) talked us through the different flavours of juice available (I stalked the Orange and Mango girl, the kids were partial to “the pink one please, mummy” otherwise known as Apple Berry), and we watched as people stopped to try for themselves. The stands are only for a limited time, so make sure you grab yourself a free sample when you pass one.
Juice fun was interrupted when one kid started crying over a cashew, and the other started when she got stuck in a child ride out of arm’s reach of me comforting the first crying kid. Shoppers were looking around as if to say “where is this child’s mother?”, not seeing me crouched down behind them with the loudest three-year-old on Earth. Suddenly I was that parent – not only did I have a crying kid in a shopping centre echoing off the walls, but I was also neglecting a kid hanging by her elbow out of a bright red spaceship. It was the longest six seconds of my life. Except then I was the mother with two crying kids in the shopping center, outnumbered by tiny red faces and chin dribble.
The promise of a second pink juice and perhaps a trip to the park soon sorted us out and we went back to chatting to the Juiceology folk about the upcoming kiosks. You can expect plenty of Kath and Kim-related jokes if I hit up the one in Fountain Gate.

Is it coming near you? I hope your kids are quieter than mine…
Will have to get my hands on some V8 juice, we have a lot of smoothies too!
such an easy and delicious way of changing up the everyday rotation! I hope you like them.
What a great combo!
It’s pretty delicious! We also pump it up with some flax oil too to ram those omega 3s in 😉
First I have been making a preggers mocktail with the cranberry fusion that is AMAZING! If I do say so myself!
And I have also been making (not with V8) a “cherry ripe” smoothie that involves almonds and dates and coconut and frozen cherries and cacao and some spinach for good measure.
Can you tell it is way too hot up here to cook and so I have been living off of liquids?
Lordy, you’ve GOT to tell me how to make that mocktail! I know how you feel with heat/pregnancy/cooking – I lived on Aldi popsicles pretty much that whole time. Iike frozen Cranberry Fusion mocktails, but not….
We are big V8 fans here – I often pick up the breakfast fusion or the straight veggie juices which are ‘special treat’ drinks in our house. I make an awesome breakfast smoothie with raspberries, banana, baby spinach, coconut water, and flaxseeds {or LSA – what ever I have on hand} that my 18 month old loves.
have you done gazpacho with the Hot & Spicy? SO GOOD. I live on it in summer.
I love them abs I made the chia puddings Stacey they are good xx
Oh nice one, Lisa!
I’ve always made smoothies with milk! I need to change this ASAP I think. And most mums have been that mum with crying kids in a shopping centre. X
Yeah I’m surprised I haven’t suffered it sooner!

Did […]History
Starting in 2008, The Oklahoma Association of Conservation Districts (OACD, okconservation.org) entered into a first of its kind partnership with Western Farmers Electric Cooperative (WFEC) and The Oklahoma Conservation Commission (OCC) to develop and implement a carbon sequestration program that would benefit the farmers and ranchers of Oklahoma while providing an unparalleled level of certainty to our buyers. Because of a law passed more than 7 years before the launch of this project, the OCC had been given the statutory authority to verify "carbon credits" and practices resulting in carbon sequestration. With the possibility of a climate change bill being passed after the election in 2008, no matter the outcome, WFEC was looking to further build their renewable portfolio and the OCC along with OACD approached WFEC with the idea of a pilot project. WFEC would make the initial investment to pay for the credits, OACD would serve as the outreach and aggregation facilitator and OCC would embark on building their verification program.
But in a state where topics like "carbon credits" and "cap and trade" were not only foreign but controversial, it was the group's focus to keep things local. Each of these three groups were locally led to their core. If WFEC was going to have to purchase credits to offset any emissions, they wanted to purchase as many credits as possible from the members of their own local electric cooperatives. And if the OCC was going to verify these practices generating the credits, then they were going to do so with the help and expertise of local conservation district employees and conservation commission employees alongside their federal partners at the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS). And if this little program in Oklahoma was going to make any kind of an impression then we had to offer something that no other market at that time was offering. That's why we decided to make the commitment that every single contract that we signed would be verified every year by local folks that those farmers knew. In addition, WFEC made a large investment with Oklahoma State University's Soil Sciences department to determine actual sequestration rates based not on county-by-county boundaries, but on soil types and management practices to help bolster the program and its legitimacy.
So we embarked on a project that had many of our own members scratching their heads. By the end of the enrollment period, however, we had over 50,000 acres under contract. Not only that, but the one county that has more acres than any other in the project is arguably the most politically conservative county in Oklahoma. To put that statement in perspective, this county with all these acres under contract was the only county in Oklahoma that Franklin D. Roosevelt did not win in 1936. In addition, the verification program that has been so meticulously built by the OCC and the participating conservation districts in Oklahoma has been recognized in international publications alongside some of the most commonly used carbon markets across the globe. That reception led us to build the ECOpass program.
Current Program Vision
While each of the partners continued work on our pilot project, we started the current phase of our program with the question: how do you "brand" the idea of carbon credits in a place like Oklahoma?
In conservation, we often joke that we're too "Green" for the "Ag" groups and too "Ag" for the "Green" groups. But that position brought us to the point where we needed to start building bridges. We wanted to bridge the divide between rural Oklahomans who are engaged in agriculture and those who are a generation or more removed from the farm. We wanted to build a bridge between urban environmentalists and those who were directly impacting the environment on a grand scale every day. And we even went so far as to want to build a bridge between those who work to fight the changing climate and those who deny that humans have any affect on the climate and its changes whatsoever. Unfortunately, these gaps seem to get wider every day.
That's how we came up with the ECOpass program. In Oklahoma, the heart of the Dust Bowl, a state ravaged by the worst man-made ecological disaster of modern times, a disaster that led to the creation of the modern locally led conservation movement, we created a totally voluntary program that rewards producers who are being good stewards of the land and actively sequestering carbon by bringing them additional financial incentives. Those incentives are provided by every day Oklahomans (or those traveling to Oklahoma) who purchase anywhere from one to twenty "acres of conservation" in this great State. We built the bridge of understanding not by using scare tactics but by showing the residents in urban and suburban areas the impact that agriculture producers have on their every day life. How the farming practices used upstream affect their water quality downstream.
Through OACD and the ECOpass program we provide tours for groups or individuals who want to better understand today's agricultural system and farming practices. ECOpass is not just an intangible investment in a metric ton of carbon that you can never see, hold, smell, or touch. It is not a gimmick for those who don't believe that there isn't a carbon problem. It is a way to invest in your neighbor who is working every day to feed and clothe the world and doing it while protecting wildlife habitat, improving air and water quality, and going outside their realm of "the way we've always done it" to rebuild the health of the soil that has been stripped of organic matter through decades of hard farming. ECOpass is a way to invest in Oklahomans who are changing their ways in order to clean up and protect your water and protect the soil that each one of us depends on for our very lives.
At OACD, we see the ECOpass as a program that started with the seed of a "carbon credit" but then grew into a crop of knowledge that ties those "city folks" back to farmers who have committed to better management practices to help protect the environment while increasing soil productivity. When it comes to solving the environmental challenges we face while still trying to feed the world, we all have to put something in to get something out. But for a small investment, the harvest that we are reaping is well worth the little that it took to sow the crop.This morning started with saying bye to my parents at about 8AM. It was sad to say bye, but at least I will see them three weeks from now. I had so much fun with my parents and am so glad they came. After all, they visited Abigail and Andrew on their missions and Study Abroad is my mission, so it’s fitting they came. Once I said bye to them, I climbed back into bed and slept/watched some Gossip Girl until Kacey, Laura, Abby, and Annie came and met me at the hotel. Once they arrived we stored all of our luggage and then headed to the D’Orsay.
Outside the D'Orsay
Notre Dame Gargoyle
On Top of Notre Dame
Soper in the Background
Saint Chapelle
The D’Orsay is hands down one of my favorite museums. I love the size of it and love the art inside. A few of my favorites include pieces by, Van Gogh, Monet, and Degas. We spent a few hours there seeing everything and completing our Humanities assignments and then went and got lunch crepes. My crepe consisted of cheese, feta, and chicken. It was SO good, but then I felt SO full once I was done. After eating we headed to Notre Dame to climb the tower and see the church. While we were outside Notre Dame and about to take a picture, we suddenly heard a man come up right behind us and say “You’re going to think I’m so weird.” It turned out to be Soper sneaking into our picture, but he totally scared Kace and I. We all got a good laugh, and picture out of it and then we headed over to Saint Chapelle. Although I already did both of these with my parents, it was fun to go back.
Rodin Gardens
After the windows it was time to say bye to Lauren who was leaving with BYU and time for us to go to the Rodin. Although I had already been here as well, it was so fun to go back. We started in the gardens and had so much fun mimicking the sculptures, making videos, and laughing. After the Rodin, we tried to go to Napoleon’s Tomb, but were three minutes too late. However, it wasn’t a problem because we just jumped on the Metro and headed to the L’Orangerie. We got there 25 minutes before it closed, so our visit was short, but we managed to see everything.
Monet
Outside the L'Orangerie
From the L’Orangerie we walked all of the way up the Champs Ellysees. We made a stop at the Disney store to find out about Paris Disneyland, picked up some Bonbons, and then picked up our bags before taking them to out new hotel. The Hotel Mac Mohen turned out to be a little sketchy, but the location was great and there happened to be an extra twin bed. After checking in, we headed over to McDonalds to use the Internet. We then went and climbed the arc. It turned out to be rather tiring considering I was hauling my computer in my purse, but well worth it. The view was great and it was fun to hang out on top. After the Arc, we went back to the hotel where we watched some Gossip Girl and fell fast asleep.

Supporters of the Mif Albright 9-hole golf course are expected to fill Alameda City Council chambers this Tuesday night to show support for keeping the course open.
Item 6-E on the Alameda City Council’s agenda is “Recommendation to Accept the Report on Potential Operation of the Mif Albright Course by a Non-Profit and Hear a Presentation by Alameda Junior Golf on Potential Lease and Operation of the Mif Albright Course. (Golf)”
The City Council packet for the item includes a number of letters from Alameda residents expressing disappointment that an agenda item for a non-profit organization to present their plan to take over the Mif Albright was pulled from the March 2nd City Council meeting.
Joe Van Winkle, an Alameda resident and parent of a youth-Mif Albright golfer told Action Alameda News that Mif Albright supporters turned out “en masse” at the January 6th, February 16th and March 2nd meetings only “to be denied again a chance to present their plan for non-profit operation of the Mif.”
Van Winkle told us that the “Keep the Mif” Coalition has met their initial fundraising goal of $40,000 by reaching out to a cross-section of golfers, parents of junior golfers and members of the community. Further, he says, they have a golf industry donor lined up who may make a six-figure donation to the Coalition.
Ed Owens, an Alameda resident, parent and soccer coach told us :
“Personally, I’m not a golfer, but I think that offering youth a wide range of outdoor sports and activities is key to fighting this overweight/obesity epidemic this country faces.
I’ve spoken with a lot of people my age who tell me about what Alameda was like when they were kids. City run sports leagues, plenty of parks and space for kids to play, acres of open space kids could ride bikes on, a couple dirt tracks for motorbikes. Its all been funneled into private sports leagues, like ASC, who fight each other for space to do their sport. All that space that kids used to have has been developed, putting further strain on what’s left.
And guess what is happening to the Mif.”
Mayor Johnson’s agenda is well-known. As we reported previously, her goal is transfer the Mif Albright course into the hands of her long-time supporter and friend, Ron Cowan, in exchange for another parcel on Bay Farm Island. In a May 23rd, 2009 interview with Fred Inglis for KTVU Channel 2 News, Johnson said “We’ll still have junior golf, it just won’t be here. [At the Mif Albright.]”
[…] Junior Golfers, Parents and Golf Community Expected to Fill Council Chambers Again Tuesday Night |.I find this statement sometimes are used by lawyers to get their clients off from cases which can be compounded or the smart one (or know how to bend the rule) use it for even big cases involving lost lives or significant damages. It basically means that if you are the only one who get caught whilst you were in a crowd of people who was doing the same thing, why were you the only one who was brought to court to be tried. How about other people? Don't they deserve to be charged too and if you still have not caught them yet, shouldn't you let me go first then wait for them to be caught so we can be tried together.
It is basically a herd mentality which let us to believe that what we do have merits when there are other people who are doing it. If someone drives in the emergency lane (a daily occurance on ur highways), why did the policeman select those that they could see and allow others to pass by. If I am in a crowd, why didn't the whole crowd caught and then put on trial. I bet the hundreds of certain political parties' members in Malaysia had used this defence one time or another.
Selective prosecution they say. Lemmings mentality I say. Who don't know the trick of one person looking at the sky and muttering to himself or whoever within hearing questioning, hey! what's that? Huh? The next person asked? Can't you see it? The first guy ask. Then you have a crowd looking up at the sky, being made a fool of.
This post don't have nothing to do with any one significant event either locally or internationally. It's just a question to be pondered on how gullible people can sometimes be. In a crowd, you always feel safe. Either on the grandstand of a football match or on the street partying with your friends on new years eve. In short, it can happen to anyone and some of these people who can make educated decisions by themselves. Better to think before you do anything. Peer pressure is one thing but running off when all the people on the street are also running may save your life but shouldn't you be asking why are they running? A clear perspective can sometimes save your life. Or just make a fool out of you....

on one hand, it does make sense: why stop the "normal" cars that illegally use the emergency lanes, but let the fancy plated expensive cars go unhindered? Mana aci!?
At the same time, though, using this argument to not take responsibility for actions is also bogus.
Ideally, enforcement of any law should be such that this argument truly doesn't hold water, i.e. can't get away with pointing to others arguing they are doing it, why prosecute only me?
Me, I try to stay on the good side of the law... prevention is better than cure :D
I agree with Lynne that it is better to stay on the good side of the law as a prevention against"SELECTIVE Mind/ Memory" of those law enforcers in Malaysia.

Fresh off a trip to New Orleans, the original Brennan’s visited pre-renovation in 2010 but not this time around, it was Thanksgiving 2016 at Disneyland that saw a party of three sit down to lunch at Ralph Brennan’s Jazz Kitchen in Downtown Disney, the restaurant getting far more creative than anticipated with the full menu offered along with several innovative Holiday plates.
Undoubtedly a ‘theme’ restaurant, though not particularly out of place considering Disney’s “New Orleans Square” Area, Ralph Brennan’s Jazz Kitchen sits on the edge of a concourse featuring everything from food carts to Urban Outfitters, both stories looking as though they were imported straight off of Bourbon Street complete with beads, but forgivingly without the smell of Beer and Pee.
Offering seating both upstairs and down, al fresco tables obviously popular considering Southern California’s often-perfect weather, it was on the downstairs patio just outside the gates that the group was treated to a big menu and exceptionally friendly service, water refilled with gusto and the kitchen only slightly backed up, though making a reservation proved to be a very good idea.
Opting for bottomless Coffee alongside the water, easily the best deal anywhere near the land of Mickey at just $2.95 with refills arriving quickly, dining began with appetizers including a sampler highlighted by Blackened Chicken inside Puff Pastry as well as fried Boudin that were surprisingly funky without trending too spicy, the Popcorn Calamari and Coconut Shrimp competent, though not particularly memorable or ‘Southern.’
Impressed by both the buttery Cornbread as well as the Poutine, the latter doing a more-than-admirable job of keeping the Fries crispy under a mountain of toppings including tender roast Pork and piquant Gravy smothered in Cheese, daily specials included both a traditional Turducken that found all three meats nicely roasted and in sharable portions while the Duck Confit Pot Pie took Donald on an unexpected journey with a whole lot of meat inside the flaky all-butter Shell filled with tender Root Vegetables and Bechamel.
Tempted by the famous Bananas Foster, a tableside show seen at more than a couple tables during the 95-minute stay, three other desserts eventually proved far more compelling as a pile of pillowy Donuts proved better than any sampled in the Crescent City while the Thanksgiving special Praline Pumpkin Pie was smooth and tasty sandwiched between two Creams, the ‘signature’ Double Chocolate Soufflé Bread Pudding nonetheless stealing the spotlight and making a strong case for ‘best-ever’ status given its levity amidst such rich flavors as two sidecars of sauce allowed for customization beyond the a la mode addition of Vanilla Ice Cream.Involvement of alumni and friends of the College of Letters & Science strengthens its ability to extend a tradition of excellence in education, research, and outreach that achieves the Wisconsin Idea.

Chancellor Emeritus, UW-MadisonIn right now’s busy world you can not always modify your schedule to pursue a full time education. In most fields the system of doctoral degrees is 2-tier, the diploma of Licentiate is an unbiased academic diploma however completing the degree of Doctor does not require completion of a Licentiate degree. Prior to 1980, there have been round 50 totally different levels and corresponding education schemes within the Norwegian larger education system. Degrees reminiscent of Master of Philosophy (MPhil) or Master of Letters/Literature (MLitt) are likely to be awarded for postgraduate degrees involving original analysis. Because graduate education is a typical way to achieve advanced professional training in a very particular topic, the world of graduate degrees is even more complex than the world of undergraduate levels. Exact labels for skilled affiliate’s degrees will differ between establishments.
Degree holders in Pakistan usually are not considered as Engineers as per Pakistan Engineering Council criteria for engineers they’re thought of as technologist in Pakistan. Degrees had titles that included the gender primarily based Latin term candidatus/candidata. Therefore, in the UK it may only take seven years to progress from undergraduate to doctoral level – in some cases six, since having a Master’s is not always a precondition for embarking on a doctoral diploma.
In nations by which only one doctoral degree exists, the diploma of Doktor Nauk must be thought of for recognition at the level of this degree. Depending on tradition and the degree earned, levels could also be indicated by a pre-nominal title , publish-nominal letters , a alternative of either, or not indicated in any respect. In basic, students who’re admitted to bachelor research at a university have the best to continue to studies at master level. Bachelor’s levels are offered in any respect four-12 months schools and universities, from giant public establishments to small non-public schools. Most affiliate’s diploma programs are supplied at vocational faculties and group colleges, although some nationwide universities have also began conferring 2-12 months degrees. Universities award bachelor’s degrees (kandidaatti / kandidat), Master’s levels (maisteri / magister) and doctoral degrees (lisensiaatin tutkinto / licentiat examen and tohtorin tutkinto / doktorexamen).
The most common type of doctoral degree is the tutorial Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.). This is a terminal diploma in most tutorial fields and is primarily oriented towards training for analysis, writing and educating at a sophisticated stage. These degrees are often designated by the subject, such as Master of Engineering for engineering, Master of Physics for physics, Master of Mathematics for mathematics, and so forth; it usually takes 4 years to learn for them. There are two broad classes of undergraduate faculty degrees: affiliate’s levels and bachelor’s levels. It might be loosely divided into three principal areas: master’s degrees, doctoral levels and professional levels.
Licencjat title – given by a college ; the equivalent of Bachelor of Arts diploma or Bachelor of Science diploma (relying on educational major ); granted after not less than 3 years of study. The average amount of time it takes to earn a degree – additionally called time to diploma – is two years for an associate’s diploma and 4 years for a bachelor’s diploma.

Japan announced on April 13 that the bidders being evaluated for the replacement next-generation fighter programme, dubbed F-X, have been whittled down to three candidates: Boeing, with its F/A-18E/F Super Hornet; Lockheed Martin, with its F-35 Joint Strike Fighter; and BAE Systems, representing the Eurofighter consortium for the Typhoon fighter jet.
Many industry watchers say the F-35 and the Eurofighter are the two strongest contenders, according to Satoshi Tsuzukibashi, director of the Office of Defense Production Committee at Nippon Keidanren (the Japan Business Federation), Japan's biggest industrial lobby. Militarily, it also appears unlikely that Japan could select the F/A-18E.
The Japanese MOD's "wish-list" for the F-X included stealthness and twin engines. Two propulsors were indicated as a vital requirement to ensure the highest possible safety to the new fighter, which will be deployed mainly on islands the sovranity of which is contested by China. For planes which will spend their life flying over the ocean, two engines are seen as a desirable safety factor.
It is well known that the F35 is single-engined, however, and that the Typhoon is Low Observable maily only from the front, so that it cannot be defined a stealth fighter.
Both main contenders do not really fit into the requirements of Japan, which in fact had compiled its wish-list aiming for the F22A Raptor jet fighter, which the US won't sold and even less allow the building of it abroad under license.
Japan's MoD is looking for a fighter to counter an increasingly capable Chinese Air Force.
Japanese industry - in particular Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), which built a Japanese version of the F-16C/D, the Mitsubishi F-2, under license from Lockheed Martin, but which will soon complete work on it and be left without anything to build - is looking for licensed production. Keidanren supports this goal in order to sustain Japan's high-tech industrial base, Tsuzukibashi said.
"Actually, we don't care which one it is, as long as Japanese industry has the means to continue its industrial base with licensed production and technology," he said. "Actually, in that sense, the Eurofighter might be a little bit easier."
In terms of Industry support, the Typhoon appears to be well placed: Japanese industry was reportedly delighted by the offers of the Eurofighter consortium, which has promised to Japanese industry a seat into the Consortium if they buy the jet fighter. This would allow Japan to see its industry securing an important source of work and revenues for many years into the future. It appears more complex for LM to agree to allow a license production of the F35 in Japan: Lockheed has agreed to have a Forward Assemply and Check Out (FACO) plant in Italy which will assemble the planes destined to Italy and, potentially, to the Netherlands and other Europe-area countries interested in the F35 (UK will reportedly have its own assembled in the US, this leaves Turkey and, if they will choose the F35B to replace their Harriers, Spain), but this is not the same of a production on license as wanted by Japan, and it is unlikely that LM can accept to allow another FACO either, which might end up building the F35s (eventually) bought in future by Taiwan and South Korea, leaving the LM plants back in the US with little work to do.
However, politically, the F35 is the one contender with the advantage: US-Japan links are well known, and the post WWII Japan has never bought a plane which wasn't US-designed, if not US-built.
The bids are to replace the Japan Air Self-Defense Force's F-4EJ Kai Phantoms built by MHI, which are due to begin retiring in 2015, and will be for 40 planes, according to MoD documents. Japan also will need to replace its F-15Js in the next 10 years, which could increase the number of F-X fighters to 150, depending on what will happen with the national Stealth Fighter programme officially expected to see the prototype making its first flight in 2014.
Taisei Ugaki, a veteran military commentator here, said April 14 that there was strong pressure for MHI to maintain its assembly line, and that any move toward the Eurofighter would face "strong U.S. pressure" to buy American in order to maintain the U.S.-Japan alliance.
Despite the latest delay due to the earthquake and tsunami, bids will be due Aug. 31, and a contract awarded at the end of the year, according to Japan MoD documents.
For Eurofighter Typhoon a victory in Japan would be a historic triumph for the whole european industry.
DefenseNews Article
Brazil warships deal
In September 2010, Brazil and the UK signed a Defence Cooperation Agreement on board of HMS Ocean in visit in the port of Rio. In the occasion, BAE also made its bid for the construction of warships for the Brazilian navy. The offer is designed to meet the objectives set out in Brazil’s National Strategy of Defence to enhance its indigenous industrial capability by enabling Brazil to develop an independent, sustainable naval shipbuilding and through-life maritime support capability.
The Brazilian Navy has a requirement for
- 5 Frigates
- 5 Ocean Patrol Vessels
- 1 logistic support vessel
BAE's offer verted on bringing Brazil into the Type 26 frigate programme. Becoming involved at this early stage would give Brazil the opportunity to influence design development. The resulting rationalised design, build and procurement process would also reduce the cost per ship and deliver substantial through-life savings to both Brazil and the UK in training, maintenance and support. The modular nature of the Tyèe 26 would allow Brazil to see its own national requirements and mandated-equipment fitted to the same baseline design.
The OPV would the '90 meters' BAE design, based on the River class in service in the Royal Navy and used for the 3 patrol ships built for Trinidad and Tobago. The ships would be of course fitted with Brazilian-mandated equipment. BAE already has a similar technology transfer agreement in place with Bangkok Dock in Thailand, which is building one vessel of this class for the Royal Thai Navy. The logistic vessel would have been a Fleet Tanker based on the Wave design.
Yesterday, however, DefenseNews reported that the UK government has apparently made a new, lower-cost interim offer. The article has vanished from the website, leaving, at the moment in which i write, a dead link behind itself. I'm not sure of what this implies. Possibly, the source was not reliable and the site preferred to avoid publishing not-confirmed rumors. But it was a very interesting read, and if true, it would be such a bargain for Brazil that i struggle to see how they could refuse.
The UK seems to have offered 3 of the retired/soon to be retired Type 22 frigates (what about the fourth, i wonder...?) and BAE would add the 3 offshore patrol vessels built for Trinidad and Tobago but never delivered after the order was cancelled in September last year. Rumors are that the UK would also add the recently decommissioned RFA Fort George to the offer. I don't know the price tag, but it is likely to be a true bargain. The rationale behind this proposal is probably to spur Brazil into an early order by seducing them with a pretty much unbeatable price, which could later on see a follow-on build phase for two new Type 26 frigates (or more, perhaps) and at least 2 more OPVs, killing-off the rivalry from FREMM and Italian and French shipyards.
For BAE, selling the 3 OPVs would help remedy to the losses caused by the messy Trinidad and Tobago disaster, while the MOD (after the recent agreement which saw the Treasury allowing the ministry of defence to keep and use money obtained by selling kit) would be able to pocket a good amount of precious money to reinvest to cover other needs.
Looks like an "Everyone Wins", all things considered. It will be interesting to follow both of these cases, and see what happens..The U.S. Open sectional Monday at Wedgewood Golf & Country Club and Kinsale Golf & Fitness Club, both in the nearby Columbus suburb of Powell, reported seven additional withdrawals, taking the list of WDs to 20, before played started on Monday morning.

The object is to see how high you can get it before it falls, the one who makes it fall is the one who loses. Again we were in the pool, except for this time it was our pool. Anna and I were playing with a beach ball. We would sit on it and make it shoot out from underneath us. I also pulled her around on a floating mesh raft, she would keep getting off and I would tell her when she wasn't on anymore. After a while, though I got out and we had dinner. Encheladas, quesadillas, chips and salsa.
After that I had a guinness and the other adults played hand and foot.

Foodservice Success University to help operators increase employee knowledge and shrink training costs
Raleigh, NC (RestaurantNews.com) Foodservice Training Portal, a leading provider of cloud-based learning for foodservice, hospitality and retail operators is pleased to introduce the Foodservice Success University offering. This offering functions as a ‘living catalog’ of access to Foodservice Training Portal’s full portfolio of restaurant-focused content in the areas of sales & service and safety & security.
Foodservice Training Portal works with thousands of foodservice and hospitality businesses across the U.S. and abroad. By combining insights from those engagements, and with deep industry expertise from our technology and distribution partners, Foodservice Success University will help restaurant operators better harness their employee learning to improve sales and the overall customer experience. Delivered as an ongoing service to strengthen preparation and response behaviors, the platform will also help reduce overall business liability.
Foodservice Success University uses a ‘Netflix-style approach’ allowing restauranteurs to utilize all included courses if needed or access only the content that is relevant to their operation. The course catalog is currently populated with nine courses and will be updated as Foodservice Training Portal releases new modules to the market. The company currently plans to launch its foodservice and hospitality-focused sexual harassment course in January 2018 as well as a back of house-focused cost control and waste management course in May 2018. All training is delivered via the company’s robust restaurant LMS that allows operators to evaluate and track employee results efficiently from one online destination.
“Foodservice Success University was designed in collaboration with our clients and intended to dramatically improve traditional training models using a broader range of products and increased flexibility. This strategy represents innovation in our approach to growth and is a testament to the reality that every foodservice operator needs to integrate technology in order to onboard a new generation of employees,” noted Eric Webster, Managing Director of Foodservice Training Portal. “We understand that the independent operator does not typically have the training budget to invest in multiple a la carte education applications as well as a restaurant LMS to satisfy all of their instructional needs. They don’t want to juggle costs, delivery methods, logins and points of contact at various training providers. What we’ve done with Foodservice Success University is increase the value proposition by consolidating the delivery, lowering the cost and increasing the overall access to content.”
Foodservice Success University represents another important expansion of Foodservice Training Portal’s product offerings for the foodservice, hospitality and retail sectors. This specialized University platform provides the opportunity to introduce to these markets a unique business model unlike any other- one subscription to a diversified content catalog with unlimited restaurant LMS access.
Foodservice Success University is available for $99/month per location for one year for up to 100 students. When purchased through Foodservice Training Portal’s food distribution partner, further discounts will apply.

My husband and I recently sought therapy here in Belgrade, Serbia, where we moved from Zagreb, Croatia some months ago after living there for close to three years. A point of contention in our marriage has been my desire to live — and stay — abroad, and my husband’s wish to return to the U.S., a place he considers his home despite having been born in Iran and living there until he was eight.
I have previously written about my experiences in the Balkans, and how, given the history of the region, anti-Blackness is minimal compared to that of my “birth” nation, the United States. That I was seen and treated as subhuman there was one of the biggest motivators in deciding to leave and live abroad shortly after my husband and I married in 2014.
In fact, the burden of living as a Black woman in America had gotten so great that this was a matter I viewed as “life and death,” both in the sense of my physical safety (Sandra Bland, Rekia Boyd, etc.) and my spiritual health. Living in America is soul-crushing. It eats away at your humanity, sometimes slowly, sometimes all at once (the latter being personified in those who’ve had their fates sealed permanently by the racist police system or a vigilante, such as with Trayvon Martin).
However, in all “traditional” marriages, compromises are needed to ensure both partners are fulfilled. Living abroad, specifically in this region, has allowed me to re-affirm my humanity in ways not previously afforded to me, and I am grateful for that privilege. (I would not say the same for other Western countries, such as Italy, where I have personally experienced racial hostility and where African migrants have literally been hosed down as if in a concentration camp.) I am open to returning to the U.S. for a time, but I would need to do it with the recognition and understanding that I could leave at any time if again I felt that same overwhelming poison that permeates life for Black people in America. We agreed a therapist could help us reach a compromise in this regard.
Despite the history in the Balkans—specifically the former Yugoslavian countries Croatia and Serbia, which have been insulated from traditional forms of the colonialism of Africans and anti-Black racism—my latest experience in therapy underscores that anti-Blackness, intersected with gender, is not only global but informs every institution (including psychiatry) originating from the West, no matter where it is practiced. Given globalism and the reach of American culture (particularly movies and television shows), it is impossible that biases and stereotypes about Black people have not seeped into the consciousness of nearly everyone on the globe.
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) developed by the American Psychiatry Association is the “global” standard for practicing psychologists and diagnosing an array of disorders and mental illnesses. A brief history of today’s manual is spoken about here:.
It is interesting to note that during this time the United States was a slave-owning nation, and other “disorders” of the day, including Drapetomania, which pathologized an enslaved African’s desire to escape their captivity, were seen as valid mental illnesses.
Of course, it must be acknowledged that psychiatry and the DSM has evolved from then, but it must also be acknowledged that the historical context of modern psychiatry has been enshrined, rooted in, and defined by white maleness as the default. In other words, white men were the architects of this system at a time where they literally “owned” other human beings.
This matters because psychiatry does not exist in a vacuum. Those trained in psychiatry also do not exist free of cultural and implicit biases and their judgements, opinions, and diagnoses bear witness to these things.
When I spoke about my desire to leave the States, through tears and passion, the therapist we found in the Balkans showed no empathy, and in fact her body language and facial expressions denoted incredulity. “I know a Black lawyer,” she rebutted in response to me talking about the racial climate in the U.S. I reminded her of Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. (with whom she was unfamiliar) being arrested in his own neighborhood because of a perceived threat rooted in him being a Black man living in a white upper crust neighborhood. She was unmoved.
I even noted that the conditions of Black people in the U.S. are so bad that we technically qualify, according to the 1951 Geneva Convention, as “refugees” if it can be proven that we have a “well-founded fear of persecution based on … race.” She immediately interjected, looked at my husband and said, “but he was actually a refugee when he left Iran.” At this point, it was clear that no matter what I said, she would not believe me, and I made the decision not to return.
My husband had a remaining appointment with the psychiatrist a week later, and he was told (which I believe breaches some type of ethical code) that I displayed “paranoia” with regards to race, and that my behavior was “abnormal and pathological.”
In other words, just like with drapetomania, my normal and appropriate response to both my own personal experiences of racism (which I explained in detail the first session, along with the experiences of my family— me being just one generation removed from my mother and father having to go to segregated schools) had been pathologized. It was also not surprising that my lived experiences were essentially reduced to paranoid delusions given that it has been shown that Black men are overdiagnosed with schizophrenia and that schizophrenia is perceived as a “Black Disease.”
Later in his session, my husband went on, again, to explain the very real issues Black people in America face, including stereotypes, and she feigned ignorance. But when he mentioned he also fought on behalf of the rights of Black people (in fact, one of the reasons he wanted to return to the U.S. was so we could be on the “front lines” of our activism, so to speak), she did not tell him that he was paranoid. Even though she is a woman, she saw men as inherently more rational, and his lack of visible emotion gave validity to his claims more than mine, despite the fact that he is not actually Black.
Although in my heart I’ve always known it, I now realize for a fact that there’s no place on Earth one can go to fully escape anti-Blackness.
It makes my husband’s desire to move back to the United States a slightly less bitter pill to swallow. Toxic U.S. culture, which is inextricably linked with whiteness, has still shaped perceptions towards Black people in non-imperial regions of Europe, or even regions that were themselves colonial provinces and outposts, like the Balkans. This holds true even if those assumptions are considered “benign” (such as superior athletic disposition or sexual prowess), and not the kind of violent vitriol and subjugation seen in places like America where Black people are oppressed by the State. And although we still do not deal with the same type of overt racism in this region, the fact remains that anti-Black bias is everywhere, and no institution is safe from it.
Brenda Nasr is a writer, photographer, and activist from Northern Virginia. She currently lives with her husband in Belgrade, Serbia, where they co-manage the blog, Nasr Post.
“Although in my heart I’ve always known it, I now realize for a fact that there’s no place on Earth one can go to fully escape anti-Blackness. ”
Seems like lady has found what she was looking for.
that makes zero sense
This is a comment only an asshole could leave. Victim-blame much, you shithead?
@Noneya
Trauma alters thought process and creates paranoid fears. There is no blame in that, that s normal. The fact that you associate blame and guilt with post-traumatic conditions reveals something about you.
Btw, using toilet language is a sure way for a woman to get herself seen as insanely lacking dignity in Europe. Please do not think this is creeping racism regarding ghetto culture. It is just a cultural difference.
I’ve had frustrating therapy sessions myself, for various reasons. Having your reality doubted and your struggles belittled can be the worst. I hope you eventually find a compassionate nurturing therapist, as I have.

hdmaturevideo.net © 2018One of the most important lessons in early childhood education is teaching the significance of shapes and colors. From the shades of leaves on a tree to the shape of chocolate chip cookies on your kitchen counter, it’s important for your child to know how to describe what they see verbally. When your child attends Miss Sue’s, not only will they learn the basic fundamentals of shapes and colors, but they’ll also learn how to apply this knowledge on a daily basis. To break it down further, here’s why teaching shapes and colors at an early age matter:
Shape
Circles, squares and triangles, oh my! When it comes to shapes, they’re everywhere and used in every single environment to describe a multitude of objects. From the circumference of a flower’s stem to a baking sheet in your kitchen, shapes are seen everywhere and it’s important for your child to be able to describe them; especially within conversation. Additionally, shapes are important to teach since they also stand for symbols. For example, when your child learns the fundamentals of math, they’ll be using shapes to describe the symbols such as plus, minus and the equals sign. Here at Miss Sue’s, we teach our students the importance of shapes and how they play such a huge part in their lives, especially when it comes to their academics!
Color
From deep shades of green to bright hues of blue, the color wheel is truly endless — and appears around us on a daily basis. By teaching your child colors at an early age, it will help them develop a stronger sense of categorizing what they see and being able to relay that message to you and their peers. It’s truly an important skill to pick up since it will be beneficial in a multitude of areas, such as describing what they see, what they like and more. Additionally, color really comes into a play when your child is partaking in activities such as arts and crafts, science, and mathematics, to name a few. Here at Miss Sue’s, we teach our students as one of the first lessons, since we understand the importance and know how it will be of great use on a daily basis.
Importance
When it comes to early childhood education, Miss Sue’s take the lead. Believe it or not, teaching children colors and shapes before any additional subject is important — since your child will be able to implement these new skills into an array of different areas of their academic schedule. From mathematics to reading, colors and shapes play a huge role since they will help your child describe what they’re referring to, in regard to answering questions or asking for assistance on their work. In short, learning colors and shapes at an early age will open the doors to incredible educational opportunities on the road ahead.
At Miss Sue’s Nursery School, our prime educational goal is the development of the whole child — socially, emotionally, physically and educationally. A multi-sensory, holistic approach to learning is provided through play, art, music and physical activities. To learn more about the school and give your child the best pre-k experience, give us a call at 516-938-0894.Corn, has introduced the new packs in two flavours; Caramel Sea Salt crumbly fudge topped with milk chocolate (120g) and Caramel Sea Salt Honeycomb dipped in dark chocolate (100g).

Those involved soldiered on, but eventually one needs to focus on feeding the family, and available time becomes limited or non-existent. Yes. It sucks.

Introduction
Increasing attention is being paid to foreign language teaching in primary school, which is important for state educational policy. Earlier foreign language acquisition has a positive effect on the formation of personality and the overall development of the child in support of such mental and physiological characteristics as curiosity, the need for communication, the ability to mimic, and the ability to articulate, thereby promoting the development of a personal emotional relationship of the child with the foreign language.
According to I. Zimnyaya and Z. Klychnikova, early foreign language teaching gives the child an opportunity to study the language intensively during a long period of time and, in general, positively influences the activity of learning (Zimnyaya, 1991, 2008; Klychnikova, 1973). The activity of learning, which is diverse in content and complex, leads to the production of different styles of intellectual activity (Kulyutkin & Sukhobskaya, 1971).
The study of the features of the activity of learning and the processes of conceptualization at primary-school age shows that cognitive styles, as factors of individual regulation, play a significant regulative role in the formation of intellectual strategies (Klaus, 1987).
The concept of “cognitive styles” includes a variety of individual characteristics of cognitive activity during personality development (Kagan, 1966; Witkin & Goodenough, 1981). Klaus examines the cognitive component of the activity of learning and analyzes the individual characteristics of information perception, processing, storage and utilization. Klaus also emphasizes differences in pupils’ personal characteristics, such as gender, age, features of cognitive style and achievement motivation. “The cognitive styles appear as soon as the person addresses the situation, in which he has not adopted the way of behavior yet, or where a personal ‘contribution’ is needed to solve the problem: the personal activity” (Klaus, 1987, p. 56). According to Klaus, the most important feature of cognitive styles is the fact that they result in the learning process, and it is necessary to take them into account in the individualization of the pupil’s learning (Klaus, 1987, pp. 41-78).
A review of the works of the Russian researchers who address the problem of cognitive styles and linguistic competence in the activity of learning (e.g., E.V. Artsishevskaya, S.V. Boldyreva, E.P. Gustova, M.K. Kabardov, Ya.A. Tunkun, I.L. Zhirnova et.al) as well as an analysis of psychological theories and concepts (A. Adler, J. Bruner, J. Kagan, R. Solso, H.A. Witkin, V.A. Kolga, A.A. Leontiev, I.S. Yakimanskaya, V.N. Druzhinin, V.P. Zinchenko, I.A. Zimnyaya, M.A. Luria, M.A. Kholodnaya) demonstrates the timeliness of the question under discussion.
The relevance of this study is primarily based on the presence of vexing questions concerning the study of cognitive styles in conjunction with the individual ways a person uses the acquisition of new information and the handling of obtained data (Averin, Kireeva, & Kotova, 2014; Barabanshhikov, Nosulenko, & Samojlenko, 2011, etc.). This issue becomes especially significant for the subject-subject approach to foreign language teaching in primary school (Ilyin, 2011; Protasova, 2011, Nikitenko, 2011; Shchukin, 2010, etc.).
Since the individual style of foreign language acquisition can be considered the success factor for foreign language acquisition (Boldyreva, 2004; Kabardov, 1983, 2001), one may state that the formation of cognitive style contributes to effective foreign language teaching. Therefore, it becomes necessary to study the correlation between success in foreign language acquisition and the features of cognitive styles. This research also has great importance because foreign language teaching is one of the most promising endeavors in the modernization of elementary education. The scientific novelty of the present work lies in the study of the orientation of correlations 1) between success in foreign language acquisition by primary-school students and reaction type (the cognitive styles of impulsivity and reflexivity) and 2) between success in foreign language acquisition by primary-school students and the features of cognitive control (rigidity and flexibility).
Before presenting the empirical part of this work, it is necessary to review the key concepts of the problem.
In both Russian and foreign psychology, there are a great number of works dedicated to the study of cognitive styles (Witkin, Moore, Goodenough, & Cox, 1977; Kolga, 1976; Holodnaja, 2004). Some researchers use concepts that form a semantic field with the concept of the cognitive style, such as “lifestyle” (Adler, 2002), “rigidity” (Cattell, 1971), “control rigidity” (Stroop, 1935), and the concept of balance between the first and second signal systems (Pavlov, 1951).
A. Adler used the concept of cognitive style to define such personal characteristics as the individual features of the cognitive processes that predetermine the utilization of different research strategies. In his scheme of individual psychology, the cognitive style is the peculiarity of the personal way of living, structured by goal-setting and achievement (Bunduls, 1982).
Cognitive styles are relevant to operating style because all of them characterize the typical features of intellectual activity, including perception, thought and action, which are connected to the solution of cognitive tasks, particularly in situations of uncertainty (Klaus, 1987).
At the present time, there is no consensus concerning the content and the meaning of the concept of cognitive style. However, this concept may turn out to be very useful in pedagogical psychology, where cognitive style can be considered to be educational style (Kolga, 1976).
In his book, G. Klaus describes the regulative functions of two the most popular and well-known cognitive styles that occur in the process of teaching: “field dependence – field independence” and “impulsivity – reflectivity”. The intensity of each of these bipolar styles influences the strategy of pupils’ perceptions, their conceptual sphere and the development of reasoning. “Like other cognitive styles, they are: 1) stable towards the age group the individual belongs to; 2) relatively independent of the person’s motivation and goal intentions. They demonstrate another personal characteristic of cognition” (Klaus, 1987, p.78).
According to Klaus, “the intensity of the cognitive styles changes during the ontogenetic development but stays the same in…each particular person, if we compare his characteristics with those of the age group he belongs to” (Klaus, 1987, p. 91).
The idea of the existence of stable differences in ways of perception and thinking was suggested by G. Klein (1970), and the concept of “cognitive style” was proposed by the American psychologist R. Gardner (1953). Cognitive style as a stable individual characteristic of personal interconnection with the information field, connected to different aspects of cognitive-sphere functioning, was studied by H. Witkin (Witkin et al., 1977). The analysis of the sources showed that the most frequently explored parameters of cognitive styles are 1) the type of perception: field dependence – field independence (Witkin, 1949); 2) the type of reaction: impulsivity – reflexivity (Kagan, 1966); 3) the type of thinking: analyticity – syntheticity (Gardner, Holzman, Klein, Linton, & Spence, 1959); 4) the equivalence range: narrowness – largeness of the categorization (Pettigrew, 1958); and 5) the degree of complexity: cognitive complexity – simplicity (Bieri, 1955). “However, the first results have already shown that the researchers deal with the psychological reality, analysis of which can not be limited by the understanding of the style only as the cognitive variable” (Libin, 1999, p.163).
There are other cognitive styles described in native and foreign sources, such as 1) the features of cognitive control: rigidity – flexibility; 2) the predominant method of information processing: figurative – verbal; and 3) the locus of control: external – internal (Holodnaja, 2004, p.122).
The mental activity of learning varies in content and complexity and leads to the emergence of different styles of intellectual activity. The study of the intellectual activity involved in decision-making in situations of uncertainty distinguishes the styles according to the reaction type (reflexivity and impulsivity) when it is necessary to make the right choice from several alternatives. Impulsive people tend to respond to a problem quickly, making decisions without thorough thinking. In contrast, reflexive people can be characterized by delayed reaction in such situations, making a decision only after thorough consideration of all pros and cons. They collect more information before the answer, use more effective ways of problem-solving, and utilize strategies acquired in the learning process more successfully (Kagan, 1966).
According to the data of S. Messick (1984), response rate does not depend on intelligence level, unlike the number of incorrect decisions.
In terms of the type of cognitive control, psychologists emphasize such cognitive styles as rigidity and flexibility. These styles are connected with the simplicity or complexity of changing work methods or changing from one information alphabet to another. The complexity of the change leads to the narrowness and inflexibility of the cognitive control (R. Kettell, J. Stroop).
The cognitive styles discussed above become especially important in the situation of foreign language study, when mental flexibility and a rapid rate of response to the new stimuli are needed. Therefore, to learn a foreign language successfully, it is necessary to have characteristics such as communicative activity, a focus on the language behavior and language system, and fluency in solving linguistic tasks. In view of this understanding, there are two styles (types) of language acquisition: communicative (typical of people with high nervous system lability) and linguistic (typical of inactive people) (Kabardov, 1983).
Method
The main goal of this research is to define the correlation between success in foreign language acquisition by primary-school students and cognitive styles that vary by the type of reaction and the features of the cognitive control. For this purpose, an empirical study was organized and conducted.
Participants
A total of 74 elementary school pupils aged 8-11 years were studied. The sample group included 24 second-form pupils aged 8-9, 25 third-form pupils aged 9-10 and 25 fourth-form pupils aged 10-11 years.
Measures and procedure
To examine the problem, the author used the following diagnostic test instruments: “A comparison of similar pictures” (J. Kagan), “Stroop interference” (J. Stroop), and “evaluation of the level of the foreign language acquisition” (E. Bicherova, N. Volchkova).
The “comparison of similar pictures” method is used to diagnose the cognitive style of the reaction type “impulsivity – reflexivity”. According to a tentative assumption by J. Kagan, this cognitive style characterizes individual differences by the tendency to make decisions quickly or slowly. This style becomes especially significant in conditions of uncertainty, when it is necessary to make the right choice from several alternatives (Kagan, 1966).
The procedure. The subject is shown 2 training and 12 main papers with an image of a known object (a reference figure) on the top and 8 almost identical images of the same object in two rows at the bottom, where only one image is identical to the reference figure. The subject’s instruction is to find and point to the image that is identical to the reference figure.
People with the impulsive style make assumptions in the situation of alternative choice promptly but make many errors. A slow rate of decision-making is typical of people with the reflexive style; they make few mistakes due to their thorough preliminary analysis.
To determine the type of cognitive control (flexibility – rigidity), the “Stroop interference” method was used. A predominant cognitive style characterizes the degree of psychological difficulty in changing the ways that information is processed in situations of cognitive conflict. Rigid control indicates difficulties in moving from verbal functions to perceptive functions because of their low automation degree, whereas flexible control indicates relative ease with such a transition because of their high automation degree (Stroop, 1935).
To analyze success in foreign language acquisition by primary-school children, we have developed a method, “evaluation of the level of foreign language acquisition”. This method is based on the approach of structured control. The pupils’ activity was observed directly during English lessons, and five main levels of educational material acquisition were determined.
The zero level (Understanding) is the level at which a pupil is able to understand, i.e., to acquire new information consciously. Strictly speaking, this level cannot be called the level of “educational material acquisition” because this concerns the student’s background, which allows him to understand the new educational material.
The first level (Identification) is the recognition of the objects and processes in the study during the re-experience of information about them or actions with them that were acquired earlier (for example, the separation of the studied object from the variety of proposed different objects).
The second level (Reproduction) is the representation of the knowledge acquired earlier from imitation to implementation in typical situations (for example, information reproduction off the top of the head or solving standard problems using the sample acquired earlier).
The third level (Application) is the level at which a pupil is able to reproduce and transform acquired information by himself for discussion of known objects and the application of the information in unusual situations. In this case, the pupil can generate new information about studied objects and processes (for example, the solution of nonstandard problems or the choice of a proper algorithm from a variety of algorithms studied earlier for the solution of the particular task).
The fourth level (Creative activity) is the level at which a pupil is able to produce new information that is previously unknown to everyone (for example, the development of a new algorithm to solve a problem).
Results
In the beginning of the study, the pupils were presented with the “comparison of similar pictures” task (J. Kagan). This task was used to diagnose cognitive style with the reaction type “impulsivity – reflexivity”. The analysis of the obtained results showed that most of the primary-school pupils aged 8-11 (44 students, or 58.5% of the participants) demonstrated impulsivity in cognitive activity rather than reflexivity (30 students, or 41.5%). This finding might be due to the intensive expression of the cognitive style “impulsivity” when the learning situation is accompanied by difficulties in the study of the subject.
The results of the study of the cognitive style “reflexivity – impulsivity” of the pupils as a function of forms are shown in Fig. 1.
Figure 1. The results of the study of the reaction type “reflexivity – impulsivity” in the primary-school students
It can be seen in Fig. 1 that in the second form, half of the participants (12 pupils aged 8-9) demonstrate the styles “reflexivity” and “impulsivity” on the same level. This finding can be explained by the assumption that these cognitive style features are connected not to the method of new material acquisition (at ages 8-9, an approximate basis of learning activity has only begun to form, whereas the acquisition of new methods of activity is in the process of forming and occurs at ages 9-11) but with the individual typological features of the pupils appearing in accordance with the extent of their mental activity. Quickness and ease of new material acquisition depend on the strength of the nervous system, the predominance of excitation over extinction, a dynamic of the ability to work and fatigability.
However, we can detect the tendency that, during the study of a foreign language, most participants demonstrate the cognitive style “impulsivity” (17 pupils of the third form, aged 9-10 (67%), and 15 pupils of the fourth form, aged 10-11 (60%)). These results illustrate the cognitive style features of foreign language acquisition by primary-school students as a new work method: a tendency toward rapid reactions in new situations (the new educational material) and in situations of multiple choice without the analysis of possible solutions. The tested pupils with the impulsive cognitive style can be characterized by word fluency, a high rate of fulfilling separate linguistic tasks, the presence of recurrent errors and stereotypical answers. The children with the reflexive cognitive style differ: they have a slow rate of foreign language acquisition but a higher quality of cognitive activity. Erroneous answers are almost absent, there is no repetition, and solutions are nonstandard.
At the next stage of our study, the students were presented with the “Stroop interference” task, intended to diagnose the ratio of flexibility to rigidity of cognitive control as well as mental flexibility. Fig. 2 presents the results.
Figure 2. The results of the study of the ratio “flexibility – rigidity” of the schoolchildren’s cognitive control
Most of the participants (50, or 67%) exhibited a flexible style of cognitive control. In this case, a strong automation of the cognitive processes is typical of children with predominant flexible control. However, 33% of the tested pupils (24 children) had a rigid style of thinking with weak automation of cognitive processes.
To study the success of foreign language acquisition, the “evaluation of the level of foreign language acquisition” task was used to establish the degree of educational material acquisition, with consideration of the following factors: vocabulary, speaking, grammar, and listening comprehension. Using these factors, a general level of foreign language acquisition was determined.
Analysis of the results shows that level zero (understanding) was found for 25% of pupils (18 pupils), the first level (identification) was found for most of the participants (50%, or 37 pupils), the second level (reproduction) was found for 8% of children (6 pupils), and the third level (application) was found for 17% (13 pupils). Hence, we can conclude that the level of identification, which is characterized by recognition of the studied objects in the process of re-experiencing information about them that was acquired earlier, is predominant among the primary-school students.
The fourth level (creative activity) was not found at all (0%). The summarized results of the evaluation of the level of foreign language acquisition are shown in Fig. 3.

Summary
A benchmark qualitative study of the obtained results allows us to generalize and to state the following. Impulsive pupils are more successful in foreign language acquisition because they have a flexible style of thinking. Reflexive pupils are less successful because of their individual features and because they are characterized by a rigid style of thinking. These pupils learn the material at the minimal standard level.
To confirm the reliability of the results obtained in the empirical study, we have applied a combination of mathematical methods with the help of the statistical package SPSS 19.0. In particular, to find the connection between success in foreign language acquisition and the individual cognitive styles of the pupils, such as impulsivity – reflexivity and rigidity -– flexibility, Pearson's correlation coefficient was used. The results are shown in Table 1.
Table 1. The correlation of cognitive styles and success in foreign language acquisition by primary school students
Note: ** - correlation is significant at the 0.01 level; * - correlation is insignificant at the 0.05 level. The levels of critical significance for the Pearson correlation coefficient are p0.05 = 0.576 and p0.01 = 0.708 (Nasledov, 2012).
The results of the correlation analysis allow us to make the following conclusions.
There is a statistically significant correlation between success in foreign language acquisition and the cognitive style “impulsivity – reflexivity” index at the 0.01 level. This correlation indicates that the more impulsive primary-school pupils are, the more successful they are in foreign language acquisition.
Moreover, there is a significant correlation between the cognitive style “impulsivity – reflexivity” index and the all factors of success in foreign language acquisition. For instance, a significant correlation was found at the 0.05 level between the cognitive style “impulsivity - reflexivity” index and the success factor “speaking”. This connection indicates that the more impulsive pupils are, the higher their “speaking” factor is.
A statistically significant correlation was also found at the 0.01 level between the cognitive style “impulsivity – reflexivity” index and success factors of foreign language acquisition such as “vocabulary”, “grammar” and “listening comprehension”. This correlation implies that the more impulsive pupils are, the larger their vocabulary is and the better they are in grammar and listening comprehension.
A statistically significant correlation between success in foreign language acquisition and the cognitive style “rigidity – flexibility” was not found.
Discussion
In this work, we proposed that the important factors of success in primary-school foreign language acquisition are individual styles of acquisition such as cognitive style and the cognitive control that is used in the training process. The results of the present empirical research are similar to those obtained by M. Kabardov (Kabardov, 1983), according to which there are interconnections between the success – failure parameter in foreign language teaching and individual stable characteristics of pupils such as the mental process reaction rate (lability – passivity of mental and language processes). In our research, we study the lability – rigidity parameter. The results of the analysis imply that pupils with a labile nervous system are more successful in knowledge updating and in new information processing, whereas pupils with the passive (or rigid) cognitive type have more advantages in determining logical and grammatical rules in the unknown language.
The comparison of Kabardov’s results with our results reveals some discrepancies. According to Kabardov, children with both the labile and passive cognitive types could be successful in foreign language acquisition, but with different parameters. For instance, children with the labile cognitive type are more successful in the acquisition of the communicative components of language, and children with the rigid type are more efficient in language analysis and foreign speech perception. In our research, we have shown that pupils with the rigid cognitive style, in general, are less successful in foreign language acquisition.
We also note a congruence of our results with the claim proposed by I. Zimnyaya (Zimnyaya, 1991) that success in foreign language acquisition by primary-school pupils depends on “the self-reflection of the language behavior”. This claim reflects the statistically significant connections found in this work between the cognitive style “impulsivity – reflexivity” parameter and such success criteria in foreign language acquisition as “speaking” and “listening comprehension”.
Conclusion
The data obtained in this benchmark analysis allows us to make conclusions and generalizations about the connection between success in foreign language acquisition by primary-school students and their reaction type (cognitive styles: impulsivity and reflexivity) and between successful assimilation of the foreign language by pupils and the features of their cognitive control (rigidity and flexibility).
The study has shown that impulsive students are more successful in foreign language acquisition than reflexive students are. For the majority of students, a flexible way of thinking is more typical, and they are successful in the assimilation of the program material in the foreign language. The rest of the students are characterized by the rigid style of thinking. Generally, these are students who learn the material at the minimum standard level.
The statistical analysis of the results allow us to determine a reliable significant correlation between success in foreign language acquisition and the cognitive style factors of the "impulsivity – reflexivity" reaction type. Statistically significant correlations between success in foreign language acquisition and the cognitive control "rigidity – flexibility" index were not discovered.
On the basis of the foregoing, we can say that at primary-school age, success in foreign language acquisition is greatly dependent on the reaction type (impulsivity – reflexivity) rather than on the type of cognitive control (rigidity – flexibility).
This study has allowed us to consider theoretical and practical problems of success in foreign language acquisition at primary-school age. A consideration of the cognitive style characteristics of pupils, such as the reaction type, allows for the actualization of the personal and communicative abilities of the pupils, to implement the person-centered approach in the learning process, to optimize the learning process and to create favorable conditions for the cognitive development of the pupils.
Prospects for further study may be related to empirical tests of the importance of other cognitive styles during the process of foreign language acquisition by children of primary-school age in modern school conditions.

Many people are feeling out of touch with their spiritual sides and this can manifest itself in a series of mental and physical ailments. Intuitive is a book written by Craigh Wilson, an experienced medical and business intuitive who has spent decades working in an area that ultimately draws upon new-age topics and popular psychology. This volume is a decent one that offers up some intriguing points and pieces, which allow for further thought and exploration.
This book is the first in a series that Wilson is penning about the many facets to intuition. In this one, Wilson uses plenty of inspirational quotes, whilst drawing on his experience working with clients offering business advice and as a life coach. He uses their stories plus his own as case studies to guide the reader through the process of getting more in-tune with their intuitive side. Intuitiveness is where one goes along with instinct or a gut-feeling in order to make decisions. It’s something that we’re born with but too often we lose without practice.
There are a series of short chapters gathered here that make this book an easy one to read. There is a lot of repetition in the ideas and these seem very anecdotal in nature. There is also a summary at the end of each of the 38 chapters, which can be over-kill when some of these are barely a few pages long. There are also a few spelling and grammatical mistakes in the text, which is annoying.
The content itself is pitched at those seeking guidance from a motivational guide or self-help manual. You get the sense that those ruled by their head, or overruled by logic, analytics and examining things in methodical detail may not get much out of this. Instead the book is about mindfulness, spirituality and getting in touch with touchy-feely emotions and other feelings. So while this book comes from a positive and affirmative place, there will be some readers who will no doubt be closed off to its key messages.
Intuitive is ultimately a book that should empower those readers seeking new insights and perspectives as they dance through modern life. It is a guide that seems well-meaning and warm and it could help some people affect real change, if that’s what they choose. This is important because how we think and feel impacts on our physical and mental wellbeing, so when you sit back and consider it like that, it makes a perfect sixth sense.
Intuitive is available now directly from the authorFacing tough competition, a four-student team from SJSU walked away with a first-place trophy at the CFA Institute Investment Research Challenge for the Northern California region.
They were up against teams from the Stanford MBA program, the Wharton executive MBA program, Santa Clara University, the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of San Francisco.
The win was a major accomplishment,” said Stoyu Ivanov, associate professor of accounting and finance, Nancie Fimbel Investment Fellow, and assistant director of the Center for Banking and Financial Services.
The teams
Two teams from SJSU took part in the competition March 5 in San Francisco’s financial district. Earning the top spot at the competition was the Spartan Gold Team made up of Joel Gonzales, ’15 Finance; Shayan Khales, ’15 Accounting; Valeriya Razdyakonova, ’18 Corporate Accounting and Finance; and Nirav Shah, ’15 MBA.
A second SJSU team, the Spartan Blue Team, consisted of Aaron Foster, Tarriq Hansrajh, Michael Farrell and Mark Smith, all finance majors.
The teams were required to research and analyze Gilead Sciences, a Bay Area biotech company. As part of their pitch, they wrote a paper, gave a presentation, and participated in a question-and-answer session.
We applied a lot from what we learned in the Spartan Fund and our finance classes,” Gonzales said.
Spartan Fund
The Financial Navigator Student Managed Investment Fund, also known as the Spartan Fund, was established with a $100,000 donation from Nancie Fimbel, and her husband C. Edward Van Deman, CEO of Financial Navigator.
Fimbel, who capped a 28-year career at SJSU by serving as acting MBA director and senior director of development for the Lucas College and Graduate School of Business, wanted to give back to the university.
I’m very proud of having started this,” Fimbel said. “I had dreamed of this, and it’s really a kick to see the students pitch to each other.”
Students manage the $50,000 Spartan fund using 12 Bloomberg terminals in their classroom. They’ve raised the fund to $52,000 in just six months.
Next up for the Spartan Gold Team is the national competition on April 15 in Atlanta. A win there will send them to the Global Final, where they’ll face teams from the Europe and Asia Pacific regions.- View Affiliations Hide Affiliations

I say “co-writes” as it's rather evident the vast majority of crafting isn't in his style. That said, they are usually pretty good reads.

Mars, slightly redder than Uranus.
Factors that contribute to loudness
Loudness is a subjective measure that indicates the intensity of a sound that a person experiences. For the greater glory of Slayer, it is more apt to use less subjective standards of measure such as decibels. The decibel is the unit of sound pressure, so regardless of how loud the tree in the forest is when it falls, you can still measure the sound pressure even if you can't necessarily hear it. The decibel is a logarithmic unit of measurement that expresses the magnitude of a physical quantity relative to a reference level.
What would be our reference level?
For our reference, we may choose the theoretical maximum pressure of sound on planet earth at standard atmospheric pressure level. This is 101 325 Pa, which is the equivalent of 194,094 db, which is kak loud. The threshold of pain for audio lies at 134 db, so Slayer this loud could cause your ears to bleed. Only recommended for true fans.
How do we determine the theoretical maximum pressure of sound on Mars?
This is a little more tricky because Mars isn't 30 seconds away just yet. However, with some creative accounting we might get there. Sound pressure depends on the medium that carries the sound. Our reference level is already measured at standard atmospheric pressure, so all we need is the standard atmospheric pressure on Mars. This is about 0,7 % of the average surface pressure at sea level on Earth, meaning we have (0,7 x 101 325) / 100 which is 709,275 Pa. This is the equivalent of 150,996 db, which is considerably softer (I used this handy sound level calculator).
What would Slayer sound like on Mars?
Carbon dioxide is the main component of Mars's atmosphere so you ecological fascists should really be taxing Martians instead of your terrestrial slaves. Carbon dioxide comprises of 95 % of Mars's atmosphere. The main components of the Earth's atmosphere are Nitrogen (78 %) and Oxygen (21 %).
The molar mass of Carbon Dioxide is greater than that of Nitrogen and Oxygen combined. Even though the molar mass of Mars's atmosphere is greater than that of the Earth, the area of Mars's atmosphere is much larger. Pressure depends on force per pressure area. More molar mass means greater force, but a greater pressure area means less resulting pressure, despite a greater molar mass.
Thus, on Mars, Slayer would sound softer, but also lower. If you like it loud, be thankful that we evolved on Earth and not on Mars, otherwise it might sound like Brad Roberts is singing for Slayer! There are a few samples of what sound would theoretically sound like on Mars on the Mars Microphone page.lighting stage lighting system 1 musician s friend

UPCOMING EVENTS
There are no upcoming events at this time.To operate from a thought system called the ego-based mind that is only aware of the body and the material world; for that reason, we all make mistakes.
We likewise do things with the best of intentions, just to see them not work out the way we had initially prepared.
Sadly, fixing a broken relationship or struggling at how to rebuild a relationship, is typically among those things.
(By the way, I suggest you also visit this article how to have inner strength when needed to shift forward by letting go of ego.)
We say our vows with conviction and cannot wait to live a delighted life together.
Then truth hits. We begin discovering that being in a wonderful relationship takes work.
If this sounds familiar to you, and you feel your relationship might be better, then continue reading.
Don’t get discouraged.
When you think how to save my relationship:
(Here’s a review of Save the Marriage and is it for you or not?)
The very fact that you acknowledge that there is a problem is an excellent indication. It means you’re taking note and understand exactly what’s going on.
It means you realize the “holy relationship,” as the Course in Miracles terms, is within you—being of you, and that you are both capable of bringing it forth together.
After all, you cannot start fixing a broken relationship if you are not aware it is broken.
Take heart and start working towards learning how to rebuild a relationship, making yours a holy one at that.
The Course in Miracles states, “The holy relationship is a phenomenal teaching accomplishment. In all its aspects, as it begins, develops and becomes accomplished, it represents the reversal of the unholy relationship.”
If you and your partner are excellent at interacting with one another, then you may be able to patch things up on your own.
Maybe there was a time when you could talk to each other, but you have actually since started drifting apart and have lost trust in one another.
See in this brief thought provoking article how trust in relationships ends fear and among our inner most strengths.
Make certain to keep your emotions in check. As quickly as you spot your discussions getting too heated, make a note of it and take a break to cool down.
You need to stop immediately, otherwise you may end up in a complete blown argument and state things you will regret later on.
Speaking of saying things you’ll be sorry for later is one of the things to let go of when fixing a broken relationship.
Being concerned about how to rebuild a relationship:
Remember to deal with each other with respect as you’re working things out. You both may not like some of things the other one is doing, however you don’t need to make it personal.
The key to fixing a broken relationship and making this work is to take it slowly, discuss the habits (not the person), and how it makes you feel.
You may be shocked at simply how efficient this technique can be. The reason it works is that it avoids each of you from getting overly protective.
If, in spite of your finest efforts, you find that you’re not making any progress, then it’s time to take the next step.
(Here’s more on coping with an affair and can a marriage survive infidelity?)
Don’t worry, more couples than you’d ever believe have actually had counseling for fixing a broken relationship at one point or another.
It’s not a reflection on your weak points, however rather proof that you still care enough about your relationship and to save your marriage to try to heal it.
The Course in Miracles further teaches that, “This is the first result of offering the relationship to the Holy Spirit, to use for His purposes.”
Inner Healing
Your inner divine Guide—the Holy Spirit, always has healing as His goal, so whether you opt to try to repair things yourself or seek relationship counseling, what counts is that you are doing something.
By the way here’s more on how to listen to your inner voice by first knowing your true Teacher or Guide while in this world.
This means healing has already started, so stick with it, be willing to do whatever it takes, and you will have your love relationship back in shape in no time.
In conclusion, we all have that fearful and doubtful ego-based mind aspect in us that only can think from the material and never from within to the core.
Again, I must add in this article like I do in many others, this is why I urge you to learn mindfulness training, and more on that here.
We likewise do things with the finest of intents, just to see them not work out the way we had originally planned.
Sadly, fixing a broken relationship and worrying over how to save my relationship is typically one of those things.
If you and your partner are great at communicating with one another, then see it as a holy relationship and shift forward in mind from within yourself to patching things up.
Remember to keep in mind to treat each other with respect as you’re working things out. You both might not like some of things the other one is doing, however you don’t need to make it personal.
Simply act from within your heart, and your love for each other will grow.

I’m thinking of adding an element to the ivanwlam.com theme. For months I’ve tried to work transparencies and transparencies alone into the layout, but it always felt that something’s missing, practically literally.
I needed a contrast against the transparencies to bring attention both the transparency and this new more opaque substance. I’m thinking of using a paper texture, but I’m afraid it’s too much contrast. Maybe something in between, like tracing paper or vellum? Exploration and experimentation ensue.
For the few of you who read this blog (you know, both of you), feel free to give comments and feedback on the idea.

I’ve been reading (finally) Cradle-to-Cradle, and I’m at the part about how so many things we do in the industrialized world releases so much toxins into the environment, even when we try to recycle plastics by melting them.
I have no scientific knowledge/background about this, but what if, assuming that it doesn’t blow up immediately, you throw large amount of trash into a volcano? What kind of toxic stuff would get spewed into the atmosphere, compared to what it would normally spew out anyway, and how much of the toxic stuff gets swallowed by the volcano?

(This is the type of stuff I would have posted through Twitter if I had set it up (and in less than 133 characters).
The few of you who follow this blog notice that it is not updated as frequently as it should. I know this probably falls under the “hey guys, sorry for like, not updating this blog in like, FOREVER” category, since like most people who aren’t professional bloggers, I have other things that require more of my attention.
But that doesn’t mean I don’t want to keep this blog fresh, creative, and interesting. I started this blog (and naming it so) with the intent to “dump” my ideas, or, if you prefer, throw them onto the wall, and see what sticks. Between the lack of time and the growing concern to produce good, original content on this blog, I have started to regard it as a burden. Also, I started another blog, the Experiments, to actually materialize some of those ideas. So what type of content is left for this blog?
Since I last updated, I have begun working on a project at Zynga as a freelance UI/UX designer. Originally, I was asked to work on only one aspect of the project, but I have since been asked to work on a second part. I am becoming more familiar with the project and am curious to how it’ll turn out in the end.
I’m not going to lie; I’ve enjoyed the work very much. I have mentioned last time that I haven’t done anything exactly like this before, so it is exciting, fascinating, and eye opening, and I’m learning a lot. I myself have started thinking of ways to further enhance the experience in future releases, if I am given the opportunity to continue.
I was looking for eco-friendly/sustainable paper notepads online and found this online store eConscious Market, which sells a bunch of different “econscious” stuff, from clothing to body care to paper supplies. All of this could be another post in itself, but during the browse, I found a term that caught my eye.
There is this one product called “Perpetual Calendar,” and I immediately thought of my experiment concept for a “reusable calendar.” The product ended up not being what my experiment was, but I quickly searched online for that term, especially for products with that name.
I found one product that has the same concept as mine. Here’s the link: The product is a bit ugly for my taste (mainly the month part at the bottom), but it’s such a delight to see that concept out there.

One of my designer friends (whom I’ll call “Lame-y,” which is what I call her anyway) was working on a thesis project and asked a bunch of friends to do a quick survey.
The survey asked for three things (not living objects) that I have an emotional attachment to despite their imperfections.
I sat there in my room looking around for things that I might have an emotional attachment to, but I quickly realized how I don’t really have emotional attachment to a lot of my stuff, which felt both great and disappointing. My approach to this, actually, was to pretend that there’s a fire and I can only take three things with me, no matter how heavy or long they would take. What would I really miss if I didn’t take with me? And here’s what I came up with:Goldenglove (Maxie Costello) was a moderately successful "black mask" criminal from the Kiefer Square district.
Maxie Costello, a former boxer with a knack for tinkering. He turned criminal after discovering a pair of hi-tech golden gloves, the property of a now dead alien found inside a crashed spaceship.
Like several other residents in the Kiefer Square area, every time he accumulated a decent sum of money, it soon was gone. In his case, almost all of it went back into his criminal endeavors, whether it was enhancing his lab or acquiring more sophisticated equipment. He once bought a blimp, that he converted into a submarine, only to have to destroy it and fake his death when being pursued by the Street Angel.
A fatality of the Black Mask Killer in 1998, his daughter took his gloves and became the new Goldenglove.
The gloves augment some of the skills of the wearer, like super-strength.

Just stopping by to say I've something waiting for you on my blog! :o)As I am currently unable to sleep due to a largish nap at mid-morning, I shall begin my reflections on my first week working at Escuela Maureen Courtney and Colegio del Nino Jesus. The schoolgrounds are lovely, located right where the land starts to descend towards the seashore, with a view of the ocean and a nice breeze. Like all the facilities, the grass is maintained by the students, and mowing is a BYOM (Bring Your Own Machete) affair. It was really adorable to see all these 7-12 year old boys with their big machetes from home swinging away at the grass, frequently cutting down to the root and leaving nothing but a patch of dirt.
We spent most of the week sitting in on classes and talking with the teachers. Because the religion teacher was out, I also got to teach religion classes to 3rd and 5th graders at the last minute on Monday. Fortunately, I had brought my Spanish-language Bible with me that day and was able to pull together passable lessons. Though I felt a little bit useless and aimless, sitting in on classes was very important, because the teachers talked very directly to me at times about what they were doing and the issues their students have. I was at times taken aback by how freely they discussed their students' needs in front of them. After this week, I feel like I have begun to develop relationships with a fair number of teachers and understand their methodologies and the functioning of the school a lot better.
As my integration into the school begins, so does my learning Miskito and Nicaraguan Sign Language. I plan to do a fair amount of work with the "Nivelacion" class for students who function are not developmentally delayed but are very behind their grade level, mostly in reading and writing. There are several students in this class who are deaf-mute, and so I have begun to learn how to sign with them. I actually had my first missed communication in sign language just today, when I asked the teacher of the audition classes, who is deaf mute herself, if she was leaving with the woman who teaches the special needs kids. She signed back, "No, we're just friends." Like English, spoken and signed Nicaraguan Spanish use the verb "to leave/to go out" to mean dating.
Though most of the people here speak Spanish and teachers give class in Spanish, they frequently speak to each other and individual students in Miskito. Still, even those with the most dramatic developmental issues have to be bilingual enough to speak Miskito at home and Spanish in school. Because I miss a substantial part of the dialogue and the culture, I am looking forward to further cultivating my Miskito skills. The teachers at Maureen Courtney have decided that they want us to teach them English every week, and have offered to give us Miskito lessons in exchange.
English is not a recent arrival to the Atlantic Coast. It's been here longer than Spanish, and is the linguistic seat of the Creole culture here. As the pastor of the Creole Moravian Church informed me, it is also fast dying out. Young people go to school in Spanish, make their friendships in that language, and speak English less and less. The Moravian Church is the only remaining English-speaking church in the city. All this is to say that I used to see teaching English as a venture with imperialistic overtones, but I think it's different here. In this region, increasing knowledge of English is actually a mechanism of cultural preservation for the descendants of escaped African slaves. It's a small measure, to be sure, but nonetheless important.
This language stuff is super interesting! I look forward to hearing more about your time at the school, and I am keeping you in my prayers as you begin your work.
Yeah improvised religion classes! (often the best kind.)
Wow! First day observing and you end up teaching! Talk about a gutsy move.
What was your religion lesson about, by the way? I also look forward to learning more! (from Mom on

Hi-Well, I know you don't know me, so this is seeminly very random. My name is Marah and I was in Puerto Cabezas this past summer for two months working at the Maureen Courtney school. I've been missing the city like crazy so I googles it and I found this blog. I see that you are currently in PC right now, and I couldn't help but commenting. If you have any time, I would love to email you about how things are going at the school and in the city-it really is a wonderful place. my email is mar_bar90@hotmail.com. If you could, please say hi to the teachers at the school for me! If it's not too much to ask(from a complete stranger), I was just wondering what you are there for? Thank you so much and I hope your experience is amazing:)There are a few basic rules to follow if you represent a brand trying to leverage the power of social media. Chief among them should be Don’t hold a Twitter Q&A session at exactly the same time as you deliver earth-shatteringly bad news to your customers. That’s what British Gas decided to do today when they got their Customer Services Director, Bert Pijls, to answer questions on Twitter using the #AskBG hashtag on the same day that they announced a 9.2% price hike.
The result? Well, you’ve no doubt heard about it: #AskBG is currently trending on Twitter for all the wrong reasons as British Gas experience a deluge of public (and often hilarious) abuse.
There’s really no need to analyse a mistake of such epic proportions. What we will do, however, is take a look at some of our favourite tweets. The #AskBG feed has been keeping us amused all afternoon, so here are a few of our faves:

Many may remember him aggressively manning the low post for the basketball Bearcats in the '80s. Although some players tend to shrink from a challenge in the paint, University of Cincinnati opponents came to realize that Myron Hughes wasn't one of them.
In the 20 years since his graduation, Hughes has maintained that persona. His marketing degree led him to the Greater Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce, working to recruit business development prospects to Cincinnati -- much like he had been recruited here earlier from Alabama.
After leaving Cincinnati in 1995, Hughes served in leadership roles for the primary business organizations in St. Louis, Memphis and now Tampa, where he is the Greater Tampa Chamber's vice president of economic development. No matter where he lived, though, he continued to follow the Bearcats closely. Fortunately, his work has taken him to cities with universities on UC's schedule.
Hughes, a UC Alumni Association life member, has a balanced view of his UC experience. "More than basketball brought me to UC, and more than basketball kept me at UC even as we went through our own coaching change at the time," Hughes said, recalling the 1983 transition from Ed Badger to Tony Yates.
He has watched the past year of transition at UC unfold with a reassuring perspective. "UC will always be a strong academic university, and it will always be a strong basketball school. What's most important, however, is remembering what makes it truly special.
"UC will always be near and dear to me regardless of who might occupy the most visible positions or what the issues of the day may be. It's really all about the relationships we make through the university and community, and the joy and opportunities they bring."
Recruiting 'the next generation'
Current alumni team up to attract future alumni through recruitment teams
by Keith Stichtenoth
Tom Vick, DAAP '69, of Chicago, engages with UC sophomore and Office of Admissions student ambassador Jennifer Moore in college-fair role-playing at a UCART training session.
Dedicated alumni are turning their passion for the University of Cincinnati into recruiting the next generation of Bearcats through University of Cincinnati Alumni Recruitment Teams. After an initial training program, UCART volunteers come to understand UC from a student-recruitment perspective, then represent the university in recruitment fairs, campus visits and other events that steer high school students toward their college destinations.
The UC Alumni Association's initiative, operated in conjunction with the Office of Admissions, offers alumni an opportunity to be ambassadors for their alma mater in meaningful and tangible ways -- an option they were seeking, according to a recent survey. At the same time, it addresses the university's critical objective of increasing enrollment, not only with local students, but with pupils from around the country.
"We have developed strong messaging, a lively set of print materials and, most recently, personalized 'Bearcat VIP' Web pages and e-mail campaigns," says Caroline Miller, UC's associate vice president for enrollment management. "Our goal is to connect with students through new and traditional media that focus on each student's specific interests. Yet we know that personal contact makes the deepest, most positive and lasting impression on students and their parents."
UCART reflects the realities of a new and more competitive era in higher education. "Some universities are renowned for their alumni involvement in the recruiting process, and it shows in their enrollments, as well as their 'alumni cultures,'" says Miller.
"For a high school junior or senior who is inundated with college mailings, the difference may be breaking through the clutter with a truly credible message -- something that makes our university more real and more human than the others. Who can make a more compelling case for attending UC than someone whose experience, devotion and success bear witness to that crucial choice?"
Representatives from the UC Alumni Association are also encouraged by UCART's beginnings and potential.
"Alumni engagement, for the betterment of the university and the individual alum, can be a hard thing to quantify," says UCAA executive director David Macejko. "But we talk with our constituents every day. Whether they have stayed here in town or live many states away, they generally want to preserve their bonds with UC.
"With UCART, we're finding that everyone wins -- the university, the alumni, and the students they meet in the recruitment process." Some of this happens naturally when alumni appreciate the education they received -- especially when they consider how UC's "real world" advantages translate to new opportunities throughout their lives. But for serious inroads to be made in ambitious enrollment goals, as well as the cultivation of more engaged alumni, UCART is filling a critical niche.
What do UCART volunteers do?
Depending on their available time commitments, UCART volunteers may do some or all of these activities:Undergo training with the University of Cincinnati's office of admissions
- Attend college fairs in their home areas, typically in the spring and fall
- Serve as chaperones or hosts for campus visits and participate in tours, orientations or panel discussions
- Host receptions in their home areas, effectively "bringing UC to the students"
- Visit high schools and foster relations with high school staff
- Make personal contact with students as appropriate by phone, letters and e-mail
- Continuously look for high-achieving, well-rounded, college-bound students in their communities and refer them to UC (This is something all alumni can do, not just UCART volunteers.)
All UCART activity is performed in full coordination with the UC Alumni Association and the Office of Admissions.

Recruitment program volunteers share their ideas, experience
"Serving as a UCART volunteer is a meaningful way to give back to the University of Cincinnati. Prospective students are literally the future of UC. Without them, there would be no campus, no faculty, no research, no university. While monetary donations are important, volunteering time can be even more rewarding."
Doug Yerkeson, Eng '90, Law '93,
UCAA life member
Indianapolis
"My UC degree is an investment. It's like real estate. I wouldn't put money into it and then walk away. Just because I graduated, I won't let the investment go unattended. We must continue to nurture it, put it in front of others.
"UCART is an excellent opportunity to help the best qualified students come to UC. If alumni don't bring their personal passion to that challenge, then who will? This is our role to fill."
Dennis Hubbell, Bus '95, UCAA life member
Jacksonville, Fla.
"Our overall profile is rising. Interest in UC is increasing. Students are clearly being told that UC is moving up, and the test scores and GPAs of interested students and applicants show it.
"My UCART involvement is a reflection of the quality of my education and experience at UC. It's a form of repayment to the university. I'm doing what I can now for UC, since UC has been good to me."
Tom Vick, DAAP '69, UCAA member
Chicago
"Our Admissions Office runs the events we attend, and they are very prepared and really invested in student recruitment. As an alumnus, that's great to see.
"The students we visit with are very focused and enthusiastic. I almost envy them -- the glint in their eyes. These are bright students who have choices. Whatever we can do to help them make that choice -- and to choose UC -- is a service to them and our university."
Rich Foley, Eng '61, UCAA member
Dayton, Ohio
Online community brings UC alumni 'inCircle'
"It's not what you know, but who you know."
Don't expect a university that is responsible for providing an outstanding education to completely buy into that cliché.
But since the key to post-graduate success is leveraging your total educational experience (especially with those who have shared it with you), don't expect your university to disavow it, either.
Each University of Cincinnati alum is connected to more people via the university than he or she probably realizes. And facilitating those connections, 21st century style, is the enormous value of inCircle, the new online community exclusively for UC alumni.
Since its debut last year as a free service from the UC Alumni Association, inCircle has brought an increasingly powerful and flexible communications platform to the broad community of UC grads. In meeting the needs of a wired (and wireless) world, inCircle is a secure and user-friendly tool for social and professional networking that uses such functions as a search, bulletin board, blog and photo site.
"This is the ideal way to stay in touch with your UC friends -- people who mean the world to you," said UCAA program director Jennifer Heisey. "Further, when you meet someone new and discover you're both UC alumni, that means a lot, too. The natural bond spans generations, colleges, business experience, geographic location, everything.
"InCircle enables that phenomenon to be leveraged to everyone's benefit."
Also, alumni say they highly value anything UC can provide to facilitate their career development and job-search capabilities.
"While organizations 'fill jobs,' it's more accurate to say that people hire people," Heisey said. "It's back to 'what you know vs. who you know.' Your qualifications become important only when you can identify and interact with the people who have a need or know those who do.
"Using online capabilities that didn't exist until recently, inCircle makes those connections easier than ever."
How inCircle works:
- Basic data (name, grad year, college) lives in the inCircle database, but nothing further is visible to UC's inCircle community unless the alum registers, completes his or her profile as desired and elects to make the information available to the network. The detail in these expanded personal profiles naturally creates groups of alumni who have things in common.
- Alumni invite each other to become "friends" on the network. As these circles of friends expand and overlap, viable connections within the vast UC alumni community become evident. Think "Six Degrees of Separation," but on a smaller scale. (If Kevin Bacon was a Bearcat, he'd only be a few degrees away from anybody.)
- A career-development module answers one of the needs most commonly cited by alumni. And seeing a valuable opportunity to tap into a great resource for hiring, companies have listed hundreds of jobs within inCircle.
"InCircle is entirely alumni-driven, where everything is within the individual's control -- how much information to share, who to connect with, how active to be in the network.
"For example, through inCircle, UC Army ROTC alumni have been able to reconnect, whether they're stationed in Iraq or civilians living in the U.S. It's a forum that touches former cadets anywhere in the world. We post reunion opportunities, share photos, stay in touch with current UC ROTC events, network both in and outside the military and reconnect to classmates in ways never before possible."
-- Owen Waske, Bus '97
Alum dedicated to helping others
The bond between the University of Cincinnati and its namesake community will always be fundamental to the university, yet such an institutional reputation depends upon being nurtured by the personal commitment of individual members of the UC family, such as Betsy Haverkamp Wallbrown, A&S '01.
That personal commitment is evident in Wallbrown, who has channeled her communications degree and desire to help others into a career as development manager with the United Way of Greater Cincinnati. "I had always considered health and human-services work, but my experiences as a UC student helped solidify that interest," said Wallbrown, a UC Young Alumni Association board member.
Given the UC-community connection, it's not surprising that, for the last two years, she has served as UC's chairperson for the annual Crosstown Helpout, the event that flips the fierce UC-Xavier Crosstown Shootout rivalry into off-court collaboration for one day each winter. The Helpout coordinates 1,100 volunteers -- students, alumni, staff and friends of each school -- who fan out to 40 area schools, agencies and community centers to paint, clean, do light repairs and handle other service projects.
"The Crosstown Helpout is an amazing event," Wallbrown said, "because it unites the time, talents and resources of these two universities and allows us to give back to the community we all cherish."Zafar Ahmed Qureshi, who assumed the charge of the additional director general of Federal Investigation Agency on Saturday, has written a letter to his boss – Director General Tahseen Anwar Shah – to restore the four officials of his team to their previous position for their ‘utility’ in the National Insurance Corporation Limited (NICL) scam. Mr Qureshi was reinstated in the FIA after the Supreme Court suspended on Friday the notification regarding his transfer to the National Police Foundation. After returning to the office on Saturday, Mr Qureshi wrote a letter to the DG, asking him to restore – deputy director Javed Shah, assistant directors Muhammad Ahmed and Khalid Anees and inspector Muhammad Sarwar (transferred on Saturday to DI Khan, Turbat, Peshawar and Gawadar, respectively) – to their previous place of posting (Lahore) as they had assisted him in the NICL scam. The letter says: “The transfer of the officials in question is tantamount to violation of the Supreme Court’s orders. It shows malafide intention and aims at creating hurdles in the investigation of the scam.” A copy of the letter has also been dispatched to the Supreme Court registrar. There is a word in the agency that these officials have been transferred because they had investigated PML-Q leader Moonis Elahi. However, Q’s information secretary Kamil Ali Agha said to link the transfer of the FIA officials with Moonis was an attempt to “damage his case legally”. “Moonis has been indicted after a challan submitted in the banking court. Besides, all the witnesses have been testified and an acquittal application has already been filed,” he said. Mr. Agha said the PML-Q also smelt a rat in the move as it seemed “some hidden hands in the government are on the agenda of irritating the judiciary in Moonis’ case to achieve their vested interests.” According to an FIA official, some eight officials were transferred on Saturday. “There has been no standing direction from the apex court to transfer the officials in question,” he said. After Mr Qureshi’s return to the FIA, a PPP’s federal minister may be in trouble for his alleged share in the scam. According to sources, the minister in question has received Rs200 million in the NICL land deal in Dubai. PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif has publically called action against Commerce Minister Amin Fahim for his alleged involvement in the NICL scam. The FIA has so far arrested 13 people, including former NICL chairman Ayaz Khan Niazi. Three other accused, Mohsin Habib Warriach, Amin Qasim Dada and Javed Syed are at large. — Zulqernain Tahir

At a time when all hell has broken loose – inside and outside the Parliament – to demand that the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) should conduct the civil services exams in all the Indian languages, the results of the a recent experiment with the largest engineering entrance examination in India show that the move does not do much to improve the performance of the students that it intends to benefit.
JEE Main 2014, which is the biggest all-India engineering test in the country, was conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) in Marathi and Urdu too this year. Only a handful of students chose the new language options – and those who did could not perform well. Only 23 candidates, out of 758 Marathi-medium students qualified for JEE Advanced. Similarly, only 2 students, out of 300 Urdu-medium students, made it to the list of JEE Advanced qualifiers.
Till 2012, all-India engineering entrance examination – then known as IIT JEE – was conducted only in English and Hindi. Last year, when JEE Main was introduced, Gujarat decided to accept its scores for admission to state-level engineering colleges too and scrapped its state-engineering entrance exam on the condition that students of the state are able to take the exam in Gujarati too.
This year, Odisha, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand joined the JEE system. Maharashtra demanded that its students should be allowed to appear for the engineering exam in Marathi and Urdu too – languages allowed in its state-level test. It is expected that as the states keep joining the JEE Main exam, more and more regional languages will be added to the list of available options.
Experts argue that it might not be fair for Marathi-medium or Urdu-medium students to judge them by their ability to make it to the IITs as they might be competing only for the seats in state engineering colleges. But the fact remains that in face of the recent agitation against English in the civil services exam, these findings are quite significant.
JEE Main 2014 result analysis comes with many insights relevant for the UPSC Civil Services Examination row, such as:
- A senior CBSE official shared that most students who took JEE Main in Marathi and Urdu were from government schools and poor families. Their poor performance and weak success rate can be attributed to lack of coaching and guidance too. Most of the JEE coaching is either available in English or in Hindi (in some regions), is expensive and is concentrated in urban areas.
State governments offer IAS coaching (for civil services exam) in regional languages for free but private IAS coaching institutes in urban areas mostly teach in English.
An IIT faculty member opines that even the JEE Main aspirants taking exams in regional languages can have a better success rate of they have adequate study material and training in the languages they choose. This trend can be seen in the case of Gujarat where even students from well-off families study in Gujarati medium. Hence, the success rate of students who took JEE Main in Gujarati is quite high.
- Science education – at Class XII level – is mostly preferred in English. Hence, it is natural that engineering aspirants must have a grasp over the language. Regional languages do not do them much good at later stages.
Civil services exam, however, does not test only science students. It is mainly a test of Humanities, which can easily be taught well in Indian languages and hence, civil service aspirants may perform better if they are allowed to take exams in the languages they are comfortable with.
Former Vice-Chancellor of the Central University of Bihar, Janak Pandey, pointed out, “These days when parents in rural areas too are admitting their students in English-medium schools, call from MPs to introduce regional languages in competitive exams may be against the drift of the times.”

Jude Clutch, House of Harlow. 2.Pure Red Lipstick, NYX. 3.Chain Bracelet, Forever 21. 4.3 Chainz Necklace, PacSun. 5.Peplum Dress, Luna B. 6.Black Heel, Zara. 7.Lucite Box Clutch, Nasty Gal. 8.Toggle to the Top, Essie.
So now that you have an outfit here are a few rules for your holiday event:
1. Show up!
It might seem easy to skip out on a holiday work event but trust that it will not go unnoticed. Unless you have a great reason to miss the event you should go for at least an hour to show that you
2. Have fun and know your limits.
The point of a party is...to party! Employers are now looking for people who are more than just great workers they want you to have a great personality as well. Showing that you can handle yourself in a social setting when drinks are free and flowing and you are off the clock could win you points with your coworkers and your boss!
If you are allergic to a certain food do not eat it just to impress someone at your company. Feel free to ask the server or bartender what is in the food or drink you are consuming but try not to make a scene.
Also, remind yourself that you are at a work function and not a house party so stay clear of pounding too many drinks (my favorite is Cranberry and vodka), swinging from ANYTHING, and don't drink and drive!
3. Work the room, darling!
Have a home base (friends that you are familiar with) to spend most of the night with but don't forget to acknowledge other people in the room. This is a great time to start up a conversation with the IT team (comes in handy when your computer crashes right before a meeting) or make small talk with someone you pass by everyday but say more than good morning. Show your wonderful personality and the ability to talk about things that aren't work related!
What rules do you live by when attending holiday work events?A recent survey of Canadian workers by pension consulting firm Towers Watson found that economic uncertainty is fueling fears among workers that they won’t have adequate income in retirement. This has made employee savings plans increasingly valued by employees of small businesses, as well as an increasingly important benefit that employers can use to attract and retain good long-term workers.
The survey found 50 per cent of workers with a traditional defined benefit (DB) pension plan, which pays a guaranteed level of income in retirement, identified their pension plan as a key reason for joining their current employer.
But just 30 per cent of workers whose companies have a defined contribution (DC) plan or a group RRSP said the programs were a key factor in taking their jobs. Those plans, which are more prevalent in the private sector, do not pay a guaranteed level of income in retirement but to 50 percent with DC pension plans.
The findings reinforce the fact that companies with DB pension plans can achieve a more stable work force than those with a DC plan, and suggests companies with traditional pensions should highlight that advantage to prospective employees.
The survey also found that one third of Canadian employees would be willing to sacrifice part of their pay in return for enhanced retirement security, and one in four would give up a bonus in exchange for additional retirement benefits.
The fact that so many workers would trade pay for better retirement security is an indicator of the significant unease that employees have about their ability to save for retirement. The obvious benefit of a payroll savings plan is that it fits the ”pay yourself first” process that financial advisors promote, as money comes off one’s paycheck tax free into an RRSP before it gets spent on other things. Plus regular monthly deposits into an RRSP are a much more efficient way to build savings with the significant benefit of dollar cost averaging over lump sum contributions.

Publisher: Piatkus
Publication date: February 2nd, 2012
Number of pages: 310 pgs
Format: Paperback
Purchase: Amazon | The Book Depository | Kind third installment to the Charley Davidson series is just as awesome as the previous two. Seriously, there is just nothing not to love. These characters. Hilarious lines and a swoonworthy love interest in the form of the son of Satan. What can get any better than that?
These characters just get better and better. While Charley is trying to not to sleep because she is told she is summoning Reyes, who she has bound his spirit back to his body and he aint too pleased about that. It's like her subconscious wants him there with her, no matter what she thinks in the daytime.
There were some scenes that were downright heartbreaking, there were others that were sexy as well. This is what you get when dealing with Reyes. He is sex on a stick, man. No way to go around that.
We have other characters that come into play. Cookie, who is just as great as ever, and then there is Charley's dad. Now, okay. I can understand where he is coming from, and I felt bad for him in time especially toward the end, but I guess it was also his own doing when you think about it. Not wanting your daughter involved with this kind of stuff anymore is hard to explain when you're the one who got her into it in the first place. I think he is kinda regretting that now. Ah, men! I hated seeing them fight though, because I love their father/daughter relationship they have going on.
Garrett's story just is too heartbreaking, and there was a little something that happens at the end where he is concerned. I was both concerned and worried he may not come back from this, but thankfully it is not his time yet.
And then we have the Biker gang who happen to own the asylum. They were a crack and a half, and interesting and new interactions we have with our Charley.
The relationship between Charley and Reyes heats again, and he is more present in this book than he was in the previous one. We discover a lot about him that we didn't before. He will make your heart bleed, and make you swoon all at the same time.
Onto the next book it is.

Diagnosis Diabetes Type 1
As Type two diabetes becomes more and more commonplace in our society so are the commercials on TV telling you the simplest way to avoid getting it. The commercials talk about doctors caution their patients that they have pre-diabetes and with weight control and exercise there could be a way to never get full blown diabetes. What they fail to mention, almost all of the time, is that pre-diabetes is just for folks with Type two diabetes. Folks with Type 1 diabetes do not get that out. There’s no out when it comes to ‘our’ diabetes.
Come visit us right here for more info on Juvenile Diabetes Type 1. We are the greatest source of info on Diabetes today.
Children and adults that get Type 1 diabetes are often moving right along in their life when all of a sudden something isn’t right. Either they get a flu-like sickness that won’t leave, or they start shedding weight at a shocking rate, or they’re never stuffed of thirst, or they use the rest room more times than they can imagine in one hour, but whatever it is and however it happens, it comes on in an instant. And once these symptoms start there’s no plan of action apart from insulin that can help the situation.
There isn’t any slowing down of Type one. Once the T cells attack and decimate the beta cells in the pancreas there isn’t any exercise or eating healthily that will turn the process around. It is a one-way ticket to having Type 1 diabetes.
The same holds true for severity of Type 1 diabetes. All cases of Type one diabetes are serious. All folks with Type one diabetes take insulin to live. Whether they wear a pump or take shots, or test four time a day or twelve, it doesn’t matter.
So the next time you see a kid with Type one diabetes understand there is nothing he ( or his ma and pa ) might have done to stop this dreaded illness. And there is nothing he’ll do to lose it either. It comes out of the blue and stays for the duration.
All people from the second they’re diagnosed need insulin to cover their carbohydrate intake. So whether they are eating a bagel equaling 70 carbs, or a complete wheat turkey sandwich equaling 30 carbohydrates, or a bit of candy equaling eleven carbohydrates they still need to take insulin. So ‘pre-diabetes’, ‘severe’, ‘brittle’, and whatever other word they use to spice up a story are all words utilized by the media to fill up airtime about a disease that they really know little about. Type one diabetes is it’s own disease, different from Type two diabetes, and it must be handled that way.

I was not a happy camper! I created this video with the YouTube Video Editor () INSTAGRAM @jennyandbrett I Use GoPro Hero 5 and a Sony Point and Shoot “We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated.A year ago, Gary and I were in midst of making a very difficult decision……a decision that meant we would leave a place and a people that we loved because reconciliation had been denied to us. It was a painful time for us, as well as for some dear friends that were left behind. One day one of those friends called and asked if she and her husband could come over that evening to talk to us. Gary and I were happy to have them come, but we didn’t think we should talk too much about the situation. We really didn’t know what the visit would entail………or what a huge blessing awaited us.
Mike and Beth sat on the love seat in our living room that night, while Gary and I sat on the couch. We exchanged small talk, and then one thing led to another as Mike and Beth started telling us about their youth. They told us how they came to know the Lord; about how they met; about their dating days and their engagement, and then their marriage. Through laughter and shaking of heads, they shared with us some stories of their early rocky experiences but also of how gracious God was to them in so many ways. Their differing backgrounds and their stubbornness and their immaturity all melded together over the months and years as God worked on them, and exhibited to them His continuing grace. They grew in their love for the Lord and their love for each other. God blessed them with three wonderful children who love and serve the Lord today.
Gary and I sat there, listening and laughing as they told their story. Yet I must admit that I wondered why they were telling us all of this. We thought that Mike and Beth had come to encourage us in this painful time, and while our visit was very enjoyable it just wasn’t exactly what I expected. Until Mike reached a point in their story where he sat up on the edge of that love seat and excitedly said, “You see, God had a plan for Beth and me. All along, He was connecting the dots in our lives and bringing us to where we needed to be…….and He still is doing that today.” Mike continued, “I don’t know what all has happened with you guys, and I don’t need to know. But I do know that God is connecting the dots in your lives, too.”
So simple. So amazing. God pried open my heart with those words and the tears rolled down my cheeks. I didn’t have to say a word or share a word about our situation. The Holy Spirit was there, directing the conversation and using it to soothe our hurting hearts.
I’ve given that night and Mike’s words a lot of thought over the months since. God connecting the dots………orchestrating the events in our lives in such a way that the end result is a beautiful picture, full of His handiwork and love.
It reminds me of the pictures I used to work on in my coloring books, those dot-to-dot pictures. I used to love doing those. Sometimes it was fairly easy to see what the finished picture was going to be, but as I got older I enjoyed the harder pictures. Those were the ones that were more difficult to figure out before they were fully finished. There was just a mass of numbered dots but no order. Yet as I carefully followed the numbers……1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on, the picture eventually took shape.
In Psalm 37:3, David said that a man’s steps are established…….are directed……by the Lord. Each step of ours God directs, even bringing us back into order when we mess up. It’s easy to look back now and see how step 1 led to step 2 and so forth. But I’m still stepping and still following, often unsure of where the next dot is or the next number, but knowing that God has promised to direct each step that I take. Just as I can look back at some of the connected dots and see the picture taking shape, I can also look ahead with full trust that God is connecting the dots, guiding my way.
And there’s another beautiful truth connected to all this business of connecting the dots. It’s something that Peter wrote about in I Peter 2:21. He said that Jesus left us an example to follow. That word for example means an outline of a sketch that is waiting to be filled in with details. Jesus designs the sketch of our lives and then carefully fills in the details that are designed for each of us. My unique details will not be your unique details. Or my husband’s or my children’s, even.
God is leading me, step by step. And as each step is taken, each dot is connecting and forming a sketch……a design made just for me……..in which God then carefully colors in the most beautiful details that I can ever imagine.
Some of the dots may be full of pain…..others with laughter…..some with doubts and questions…….many with hurt…….and a few with carefree ease. Parts of my sketch may already be completed, other parts are partially done, and still some haven’t even been started. But one day, I’ll be able to look and see a wonderful picture, whether simple or complex, completed with God’s direction and with His brush strokes of sovereign love.
There sure is a lot I don’t understand about so many things. I still have questions that roll around in my mind during the dark hours of the night…….pain in my heart at some of the hurt we’ve experienced……..wondering why and how things happened the way they did. But I love thinking about those dots that are connecting into what will someday be a complete and fully understood picture, thanks to God’s grace.
When I last talked to Mike and Beth about that night, and asked if I could write about it, both of them laughed and said they couldn’t even remember what all they said. Oh, but Gary and I remember, because God wanted us to hear those words and to have that lesson penetrate our hearts.
Connecting the dots.
And seeing a sketch filled in with God’s perfect details.The Commission offered grant funding to reimburse schools that purchased emergency communications systems or entrance security systems for their buildings between January 2013 and March 2017.

CLEVELAND, Ohio — At the end of a private, tree-lined road just a stone’s throw from where the old Richfield Coliseum used to stand, there is a stunning home, a textbook example of modernist architecture.
Situated on five secluded acres of forest on the edge of a pond, the home features three bedrooms and three and a half bathrooms in over 3,600 square feet. It has an asking price of $925,000.
Designed by Thomas Montalto and built in 1997, the house at 2524 W. Streetsboro Road (Route 303) in Peninsula is “a modernist retreat that combines art and nature,” listing agent Cathy LeSueur of Howard Hanna said. “The home features light-filled interior spaces, surrounded by beautiful views of the natural landscape.”

Soft Patching Guide
This is a guide to patching Snes rom images. Since I use Windows, this guide is for Windows. There are two methods in which you can patch a rom. First, there is soft patching which is the recommended method, as it does not permanently change your rom, and secondly there is hard patching, which is not as good unless you want to permanently change your rom.
The first few steps pertain to both methods, so I will show them first. I will use J2E Translations' Final Fantasy IV translation patch as an example.
Step one: Extraction
First off, extract your rom and patch in the same directory:
Step Two: Verification
Your next step is to ensure that your rom is the proper one to patch. Indicators of a good rom are that it has a good checksum. The easiest way to do this is to open the rom in either zsnes or snes9x and see what appears at the start.
First load the game:
And the following information pops up when the game loads:
The important information here is the CHSUM (checksum). Since the checksum is OK, then the rom can be patched. If it is not ok, then the rom is corrupt and you should search for a non-corrupt one before continuing.
Step 3: Patching
At this point, there are two methods in which you can actually patch your rom. They will be described in further detail below:
Soft Patching
This is the easiest method of patching, and the best as it does not permanently change the rom. It works in Zsnes and Snes9x.
In order to soft patch, you must rename your patch (it will be a .IPS extension file) and your rom so that they are the same. In the Final Fantasy IV case the following file names must be the same, as illustrated below:
After this, open up the rom in Zsnes or Snes9x, and the game is patched! Note that quite often after patching the Checksum will be bad. This is normal. Enjoy the game!

Ron Howard was right. “Rush,” opening Friday, is one of his more entertaining and accomplished films.
I might even go so far as to say it’s the best Grand Prix auto racing film I’ve ever seen. But then all that means is that its only real competition would be John Frankenheimer’s apparent 1966 template for “Rush” called “Grand Prix” that starred James Garner, Yves Montand, Eva Marie Saint, Toshiro Mifune and Brian Bedford, a quantum leap in casting over the more modest names on the marquee of “Rush” – Chris Hemsworth, Daniel Bruhl and Olivia Wilde. It, too, raced along with two competitors from bedroom to track to hospital.
“Rush” is exciting. And sexy. And full of the luxe and grime and grease and physical terror of Grand Prix auto racing. (One of its two principals throws up before every race. Shades of Jim Kelly with his Super Bowl Bills in their history-making serial performances.)
It is full of liquids being spilled indiscriminately in a kind of popular vision of that wonderful year 1976 – principally champagne, oil and gas and bodily fluids.
And that is Howard’s triumph, what he was right about.
The reason he was right is simple: He had financial trouble making this one. He had to arrange a good chunk of its financing himself, which is not really supposed to be the case with a film director who has Howard’s track record (if you’ll pardon the expression). He didn’t get a simple, “yes, of course.”
And that’s no doubt because of some lesser recent films (“The Dilemma”), but also because Grand Prix racing for all its international glamor and kinetic visual orgies for a camera-loving filmmaker, is a recondite subject to put it mildly. It’s almost as obscure as the cerebral functions and dysfunctions of “A Beautiful Mind.”
It’s great to watch in two hours of periodic nudity and fancy European locations (obviously “The Da Vinci Code” whetted Howard’s appetite for European exteriors). And what Howard proved here is that you don’t need to follow the sport to be with the stars during every gear change and every pit stop.
It’s about the real mid-’70s Formula One rivalry between studly Scottish driver James Hunt and Austria’s Niki Lauda, two temperamental, physical and mental opposites who jumped up from Formula Three competition into Formula One dominance.
The absurdly handsome Hemsworth – who will again play Thor in your local movie theater soon – stars as Hunt and looks like a male model buddy of Fabio’s. The breathtakingly beautiful Wilde plays his wife, Suzy, who coped with his rejections and strayings by finding a bewitched, bothered and bewildered Richard Burton and marrying him after they both got free.
Racetrack gossips liked to pass along the information that Hunt was even more of a bedroom athlete than he was a racetrack champ.
Bruhl plays Lauda, the saturnine, all-business type who uses his self-discipline to make mincemeat of everyone else.
When Lauda’s brain tells him that one rain-sloshed race on an already dangerous track is too perilous to drive in, he’s right. He competes in the race anyway because of the rivalry and the result is a near-catastrophe for him. It is, of course, life changing.
And that, I say, is the problem with “Rush.” It is great to look at in every second whether you’re watching beautiful people or roaring, thundering race cars. And the true story of Hunt and Lauda has built-in suspense, as does any sporting tale. (Peter Morgan, who wrote “The Queen” and Howard’s “Nixon/Frost” wrote the script.)
But don’t bother asking – or even thinking for a second – about where such polar personalities and minds came from. The movie, essentially, couldn’t possibly care less.
When you get down to what ironic people still sometimes called “the nitty gritty” in 1976, “Rush” can’t really shake the essential brainlessness of all rivalries, as if the only way excellence or even dominance on its own ever happens is by measuring one’s self against a despised Other.
It’s as if the Howard who gave us “A Beautiful Mind” and even “The Da Vinci Code” were somehow ashamed of his artistic reach and decided only to do what was within his cinematic grasp. It’s as if he got tired of the human brain and decided to make a film that’s almost completely for the human eye instead.
At the age of 59, he again felt secure being the super-annuated teen he so often was before, albeit with a great deal more cinematographic skill.
“Rush” is enjoyable to watch, to be sure. To get real, though, for a second, there wasn’t a “Beautiful Mind” within 100 miles of this film. If Howard had been my friend, I might have advised against making it, too.

Deadline midnight 21 December.Blumhouse strictly announced that prolongation has started on a Halloween reboot in South Carolina by a amicable media post. Production was ostensible to have started behind in Oct of 2017, though casting was reportedly an emanate that bogged a whole plan down. Whatever a box might be, a Halloween reboot is behind on lane and appears to be gripping a Oct 2018 recover date. It was recently announced that original Michael Myers actor Nick Castle will be returning to play The Shape once some-more along with Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode.
Rough House Pictures took to Instagram to wish a Halloween reboot a happy initial day of filming in a video that facilities a lady dancing with a iconic Michael Myers facade along with a strange John Carpenter measure in a background. It was reported behind in Nov that prolongation grinded to a hindrance due to casting issues. However, those reports also forked to a Jan to Feb prolongation start, so it looks like prolongation is relocating full steam forward to get a film ready for a Oct 19th, 2018 recover date.
With a lapse of Jamie Lee Curtis, a Halloween reboot has combined a lot of additional pressure. Fans of a strange Halloween cinema have been doubtful about a plan given it was initial announced, especially due to Danny McBride and David Gordon Green’s impasse in a project. Many insincere that a duo, essentially famous for comedy, would have no thought what to do with a Halloween authorization and worse yet, several fans believed that a plan would get incited into a joke. McBride and Green have turned those fears into excitement as they have been articulate about staying loyal to a suggestion of a strange film and ignoring a sequels. This information along with a lapse of strange expel members has put faith into a plan along with additional vigour to live adult to a hype.
In a new interview, Danny McBride suggested that they were ignoring a events of a sequels and were flattering most treating a new Halloween reboot as a sequel to a strange movie. He also suggested that they’re going to be operative with tragedy as against to gore in a movie, a trait that a strange film used expertly. Jamie Lee Curtis’ Laurie Strode doesn’t even unequivocally know about Michael Myers until a finish of a initial movie, that is something that McBride and David Gordon Green will regulating to their advantage for a new movie.
Though Danny McBride, David Gordon Green, and Jason Blum have oral a lot about a Halloween reboot and what it will be, we still don’t have a sum per what it will be about. Blum has betrothed that a film will keep a Oct 19th, 2018 recover date, though what accurately are Halloween fans going to see on a large shade this entrance Halloween? Hopefully a group can keep a story of a film a tip until it hits theaters. In a meantime, we can check out a proclamation of a initial day of filming below, pleasantness of Rough House Pictures’ Instagram account....Meanwhile,. Tim and Beatrice continued to tend to Jim's wound in the kitchen, re-bandaging it after Jim said he would wait until morning to go to the doctor. It was between nine thirty and ten o'clock at night when they heard a "terrific crash" at the middle door, by the dining room. Tim got up to investigate when he suddenly saw a flash of light and heard gun shots and breaking glass. Without warning or provocation, the Troopers at Lieutenant Daniel Rogers' orders opened fire on the farmhouse.
The first shots had been fired. The siege had begun!

A fab personalised card Steph and I love your colouring too. Have a lovely BH weekend. Hugs, Claire xMy sister in law Kathie had rented a boat for the summer, and it was finally water ready. I went with her to Stonington, where the boat was set to be launched. She and a friend, Phil, were going to bring the boat over to her mooring, and I was going to drive her car back to the house. Sounds simple enough, right?
Just as the boat was about to be launched, a small duck came running up to Kathie, yipping away in great distress. Kathie has this amazing ability to calm even the most distressed beings, and she immediately picked up the duck. Here she is with the little one:
The rest of us went looking around for the duck’s family, since it was obvious that this duckling had strayed. But there were no other ducks to be found. There had been a sighting of a weasel-like family in the area, and speculation is that the duck family must have been decimated.
With no family reunion in the cards, a brilliant plan was hatched that I should take the duck, in Kathie’s Saab, to Oceanville, an area of the island where Dean, the boat launcher, had just seen a duck family near the crossover. Luckily, I knew where he was talking about, and off I drove (oh, so reluctantly) with the duck on the back seat:
When we bring Hobby, our cat, into the truck with us (in his carrier), he is vocal for at least the first hour of the ride. Not this duck! As soon as I started driving, it just settled in, and quietly cruised with me around the island.
As you can expect, there was no duck family to be found at any of the waterways that I searched. Plan C was to bring the duck back to Kathie’s, and she would look into what to do next when she arrived home.
I decided that the duck is a girl, and that her name is Annie, since she is a little orphan. So, Annie and I hung out in the studio while David worked on the kitchenette that he is installing. When I tried to leave, Annie squawked like crazy, leading David to make endless “imprinting” jokes.
Handyman David adding a cabinet, countertop, sink, fridge to the “Studio”:
When she returned, Kathie and Grandpa contemplated what to do:
With feedback from local animal rescuers, it was decided that Kathie would keep the duck, and that the duck would fly away when it was ready. So, we took Annie down to the garden to root around, to the shore for a swim, and then settled her into a temporary cage inside. The three foxes that live around here cannot be expected to pass up this gourmet meal, so Annie will have to be indoors at night.
The next day, David and Grandpa Harold built a nifty pen for her in the boat house:
And she spends her days growing, chirping, and digging for worms in the soil that I brought up from the garden:
Yes, I am bringing up worms from the garden. Yes, I dig through the dirt for Annie and she gobbles down the worms. And yes, I am bringing Annie up to the shower in the cabin for the night. This does have me questioning whom imprinted on whom.
When Kathie gets back from her boat trip, she is going to assume the role of surrogate mom. I have to get ready to hit the road next week, and boy, do I have projects to finish!
So, we have made way for a duckling. We have picked wild blueberries. And we have truly enjoyed this magical island. But the leaves are starting to turn on some of the trees (already) and Aztec Soccer () is calling. It must be time to wrap it up here, and start on the trek back to CA!

~ NancyRural towns in South Florida and across the country have long been challenged with how to get rid of piles of horse manure that accumulate around stables and barns. It's not just about odor and aesthetics, it's about keeping harmful phosphorus from seeping into the ground water.
But one person's manure is another's moneymaker.
As towns have searched for ways to solve this problem, some companies in recent years have come up with innovative ways to rapidly transform horse manure and other types of organic waste into compost fertilizer that can be repackaged and sold to farms and nurseries.
A byproduct of some of these new composting methods is steam and gases that can be sources of alternative energy. Entrepreneurs imagine a world where collecting horse manure could become a profitable enterprise.
It's also giving hope that the same technologies designed to get rid of manure could one day be part of a larger solution to reduce landfill waste in communities such as Southwest Ranches, Wellington, in Palm Beach County, and throughout the state.
"We've all got the responsibility to take care of [manure] in the proper way," said Don Maines, vice mayor of Southwest Ranches and a former president of the South Florida Trail Riders Association in Broward County.
Residents of Southwest Ranches, where horses almost equal the town's human population of 7,500, have long used a low-tech solution to get rid of manure. Many shovel it into plastic sacks and place it roadside for the garbage pickup, officials said.
But town officials are asking residents to find other ways to dispose of manure to cut garbage costs, sparking interest in more creative composting methods, Maines said.
"There are some real opportunities here for businesses," he said. "It's time for them to get going."
If Southwest Ranches has a manure problem, Wellington has a crisis. The more than 9,000 horses that live there year round produce about 100 tons of manure a day, enough to cover a football field two feet deep.NHL game summary from 01/22/1972

Dennis The Menace
With five homes, five Rolls-Royces, and a Rolodex of mistresses, Felix Dennis is a story worthy of his own testosterone-and-cleavage-packed Maxim, the runaway hit of U.S. newsstands. But the British media mogul's transatlantic invasion has only just begun, as he launches three more magazines in America.
The Mustique telephone directory, a stapled pamphlet, includes three-digit phone numbers for such residents as the Earl of Lichfield, Prince & Princess Rupert Loewenstein, and Tommy Hilfiger. Mick Jagger's number is unlisted. "We politely request that if you recognize visiting celebrities or members of the Royal Family, you respect their privacy and do not ask them for autographs or take their picture," reads a flier in my hotel. "Mustique isn't for the rich—it's for the very rich," Bud Fisher reminds me as we drive up a steep hill one February evening to meet his boss, Felix Dennis, who counts, being the 72nd richest man in Britain, worth over half a billion dollars, according to the Sunday Times Rich List.
Passing through a gate guarded by two stone Griffins spitting flames, we arrive at Mandalay, Dennis' hill-top compound and the former home of David Bowie, which Dennis bought in 1995 for $6 million. Included with the Indonesian-style pavilions were their contents: furniture and fixtures, sheets and towels, and Bowie's two pets, a calico cat and an overweight little dog.
Dennis, 54, looks a bit like one of Maurice Sendak's wild things. This evening, he wears undistinguished khakis and a Hawaiian shirt; his gray hair and thick beard are ungroomed. We walk together along a veranda lined with intricately carved teak columns and doors sent from a remote village in Java. In the courtyard are two ponds stocked with goldfish and Japanese koi; gently, water spills over from one pond into the other. We descend to a wide terrace, overlooking the lush hills of Mustique. Below us, the faint, glassy lights of sailboats and yachts portion out the bay. The salt air is scented with frangipani, jasmine and hibiscus. Tree frogs sing. Above are thousands of stars. We've just missed what must have been a glorious sunset.
"There will be others," Dennis remarks, as if glorious sunsets were a dime a dozen; perhaps they are in Mustique. Tossing a cigarette butt over the balustrade and into the bushes, he maneuvers his ample body in the direction of a stained glass door depicting two full-bosomed mermaids (one with boxing gloves, the other with a pool cue) and enters his newly constructed rec room. Eric Clapton bellows from the Rock-Ola jukebox. Silk Cut cigarette in hand (they're always in hand; he smokes three, maybe four packs of Silk Cuts a day), Dennis heads to the Harley-Davidson pinball machine. Ding! Ding! Ding! He scores! A round of air hockey follows; Dennis beats his opponent with ease. Against one wall are other pinball machines: Striker Xtreme, Adams Family and Star Trek. There's also a foosball table and leather lounge chairs shaped like a baseball glove.
Dennis lights another cigarette. "If I get lung cancer," he says. "I will die by an overdose of crack cocaine with an 18-year-old perched on top of me; I absolutely swear to you I will" Then he takes off a white Docksider to display his pale left foot: "In six weeks here these feet haven't touched the sand once!" he boasts with a laugh that makes it sound as if he's choking on a bone. "I let the guests go off and amuse themselves while I stay indoors." In the six weeks since Christmas that he has been on Mustique, Dennis has hardly left his compound. He is not interested in other people's parties.
"Watch this!" He twists around so that his body faces in one direction, his feet in another. It's a party trick. A Chuck Berry song starts up on the jukebox. Grabbing the remote control, Dennis turns the volume way up, and, not unpleasingly, roars: "Go, go, go Johnny go, go, go Johnny, go go! His mama told him someday you will be a man! and you will be the leader of a big band! Go Johnny go, go, go Johnny go go!"
Felix relishes being a hillbilly moving into a high-class neighborhood, putting a car up on cinderblocks and embarrassing everyone else on the block," says Mark Golin, who used to work as an editor for Dennis. Embarrassing everyone on the block is just what Felix Dennis did in 1997 when he introduced the American version of Maxim, his British magazine for young men. Maxim's cinderblock tagline is "Sex. Sports. Beer. Gadgets. Clothes. Fitness." Unapologetically crass, the magazine features reviews of TV dinners ("Looks bad. Like poo-poo."); jokes ("Q: How did the hillbilly find his sister in the woods? A: Pretty good."); investment ideas ("Proudly putting the 'ass' back into 'managed asset allocation.'"); etiquette tips ("In the morning, after the postcoital high and those shots of tequila have worn off, say sayonara with a line like, 'I had fun'—then get going."); and revealing photo shoots of young female celebrities you've never heard of ("If Scandinavian stunner and Vertical Limit star Izabella Scorupco is from such a wintry land, why does it feel like a sauna in here?").
When American Maxim was launched in April, 1997, few people believed it would succeed. "Anyone would have told him there was no room for another men's magazine. Men don't read magazines. It was futile," says Reed Philips of DeSilva & Philips Inc., a New York investment bank specializing in media deals. Dennis's competitors were condescending: "It's not a bad magazine," Esquire's editor David Granger informed Newsweek in early 1999, "It's just limited in its aspirations and ideas of what a man is." GQ's editor Art Cooper opined in the New York Post: "Maxim is a magazine for men who not only move their lips when they read, they drool when they read."
Apparently millions of American men do drool when they read. Today, Maxim is one of the country's most successful magazines. Each month, two-and-a-half million copies are sold on newsstands and by subscription. By comparison, GQ's circulation is 900,000; Esquire's is 680,000. On many US newsstands—including those at 7-Eleven convenience stores—Maxim is not simply the top men's magazine; it's the number-one selling magazine, period. Last year, the US edition, named Magazine of the year by Advertising Age, sold $115 million worth of advertisements—more than GQ; nearly twice as much as Esquire; and more than Playboy and Penthouse combined. Meanwhile, US newsstands are increasingly crowded with magazines imitating Maxim's PG-13 raunchiness.
Currently published in nine countries and seven languages, Maxim is but one title in Dennis's magazine empire. In the U.K., his homeland, he owns a dozen serviceable but highly successful computing, gaming and automobile titles, among them: Computer Shopper, PC Pro, Auto Express, Computer & Video Games, and MacUser. He also publishes a newsmagazine called The Week, a breezy digest of newspaper and magazine articles from around the world that is one of the U.K.'s fastest growing publications. But it is Dennis's success in the vast, lucrative, and highly competitive U.S. market that has made him one of the world's most respected and feared publishers. Indeed, making it in the United States is something of an initiation rite for foreign publishers—think of Austalia's Rupert Murdoch, who first made a name for himself here with The New York Post, and Canada's Conrad Black, owner of The Chicago Sun-Times. Two years after introducing Maxim, Dennis Publishing U.S.A. followed with Stuff, another magazine for young men which now sells some 800,000 copies a month, almost as many as Fortune or Forbes. Over the next few months, three more Dennis magazines will be introduced in the US: Maxim Fashion; an American version of The Week; and Blender, a glossy music magazine.
If bringing Maxim to America was bold, launching Blender, which will compete with Rolling Stone and Spin, seems almost foolhardy. Now that Dennis Publishing U.S.A. cuts such a high profile, more is at stake than the success of a single magazine. As Dennis readily concedes: "[Blender] will tell us whether Dennis Publishing US is a real magazine publishing company or not. … It will sort the men from the boys. It really will." As for The Week, it will be taking on such long-established U.S. titles as Time and Newsweek just as ad sales for those publications are dropping. As the Wall Street Journal asked recently, "Is Felix Dennis Mad?"
Not really, according to most people I talked to. Instead, the word that friends, competitors, employees, partners, relatives, and former mistresses reach for to describe Dennis is "fearless." "People will cross Felix at their own peril," warns Robin Miller, chairman of Britain's Emap P.L.C., the magazine publisher whose FHM competes with Maxim in both the U,K. and the U.S. "He has the habit of putting the fear of God in people." If so, it may be because, like God, Dennis is beholden to no one. "There are very few people in negotiations who are prepared to go to the brink and walk away if they don't get exactly what they want," says Peter Godfrey, one of Dennis's business partners in the U.S. Adds Robert Bartner, Dennis's other U.S. partner: "Felix negotiates fully prepared to walk away—that's his strength."
And he insists on walking away with the last word. In July 1999, for instance, about six months before Maxim's circulation numbers were first audited, Dennis took out a full-page ad in The New York Times claiming that his magazine was thrashing the competition. In a slick quick response, one competitor sent a case of Vaseline to Dennis with a note: "Apparently the numbers aren't the only thing you massage." Delighted, Dennis faxed a hand-written reply from Mustique: "Thanks, but I'm a bit too busy counting my money to polish the wood right now."
His competitive streak extends to his private life. One of his old friends told me about a party in London two years ago; with 50 or 60 people watching, Dennis got into an argument with some woman he'd just met. "It was heated and embarrassing," the friend recalls. "And in the end he challenged her to competitive strip. They got down to their underwear and it was clear that Felix was prepared to go all the way. She backed off." It was not an isolated incident. "We've been to two parties where women tried to call him out—it's a mistake, because he will always go further."
Felix Dennis has never been married. He has no children. Though he does support a number of former and current mistresses—helping with the rent, supplementing their income, buying them apartments and jeweled wristwatches, providing them with nominal jobs—he strenuously avoids the emotional and financial responsibility of family life. "He's very generous with material things; he's very affectionate physically," explains an ex-girlfriend. "But with his emotions..." She trails off, adding, "Emotional detachment gives him total freedom." In this, he's the poster boy for Maxim just as Hugh Heffner in his silk pajamas is a full-page ad for Playboy. As Dennis once snapped when a BBC reporter raised the matter of his promiscuity: "Let's get real. I mean, you know, if you had million of pounds and you could be in love with half a dozen beautiful women at the same time, and they were happy with that arrangement, would you? Or would you like to be married and have children? Choose!"
It is now past midnight in Mustique. Still holding court in his excessively air-conditioned rec room, far from frangipani, hibiscus and clusters of stars, Dennis drinks red wine, goblet after goblet after goblet. He keeps smoking. And all the while he's talking passionately, about himself. "You know, I write Maxim's cover lines," he tells his four guests. Maxim's New York editors have just faxed him a draft of the March cover, the main headline of which reads "Sexaholic!" In Dennis's view, the headline is "fucking stupid." Maxim's new cover line: "Vodoo Sex! Turn Any Girl Into Your Lust Puppet."
Unlike big American publishing companies (Conde Nast and Time Inc, for example) Dennis won't permit his writers and editors to become celebrities. At Dennis Publishing, there is only one star. While leaving the tedious details to his staff, Dennis has the final word on all major editorial decisions. "You have to subjugate your ego to work with Felix," one of his executives confides, sotto voce.
"I am one of the finest magazine publishers in the world," Dennis tells me. "That's not braggadocio—I refuse to engage in false modesty—it's what I am."
In the UK, Felix Dennis is best known for having been a defendant in the country's most famous obscenity trail. In 1970, when he was 23, Dennis and two codefendants were charged with, among other offenses, conspiring to "debauch and corrupt the moral of children and young persons." The magazine, an underground hippie journal called Oz, rocked the English establishment: there was the "Cunt Power" issue, with a cover story by Germaine Greer; the gay issue, with two naked men embracing on the cover; and the "Beautiful Freaks" issue, dedicated to LSD.
How Dennis landed at Oz is its own story. He was born in 1947 to an ordinary couple in an ordinary London suburb, but his life changed abruptly when his father, a shopkeeper, left his mother in 1950. Dennis never saw his father again. "My mother is a very strong-willed woman," he says matter-of-factly, "but it was very difficult for her. He did not send her money. He never sent her any money." For the next six years, Dennis and his younger brother, Julian, lived with their maternal grandparents in a plain brick house without electricity or indoor plumbing. Even then, it seems, Dennis was independent and fearless. At one school, his contempt for authority got him kicked out. "He was not the brightest guy around," says a former classmate, John Leaver. "But he had confidence, and at that age that's what everyone wanted—confidence. He was ballsy." He was also proud: once, when someone slandered his mother, Dennis beat the kid up.
An average student, and impatient, Dennis dropped out of school and left home when he was 15. Renting a room in Harrow, a borough northwest of London, Dennis spent a few years playing drums in a band, designing shop windows for a furniture store, and mowing lawns.
In London, a young Australian by the name of Richard Neville was launching Oz. It was 1967. The moment Dennis saw an early issue of Oz, he sent Neville an urgent tape-recorded message: "The most fucking fantastic mag I've ever seen in my life... Your editorial address to fucking slimy politicians takes the cake. I will do anything to help you guys, anything."
As Neville tells the story in his 1995 book Hippie Hippie Shake, Dennis arrived at his door: "Felix was broke. To pay for his girlfriend's abortion, he had sold a precious drum-kit, but it was not enough... 'You can have five hundred Ozes for free,' I said, pointing to the stacks of returns against the wall. If he sold the lot, he would clear sixty pounds. Felix was effusively grateful, and lugged the bundles out the door."
That was the start of Felix Dennis' publishing career. Each day, standing on Kings Road with three girls in miniskirts as lures, Dennis managed to sell hundreds and hundreds of copies of Oz. In the twinkling of an eye, he became its business manager.
Neville and his editors wore caftans and beads, smoked dope, and circulated memorial posters for Che Guevara. Dennis, on the other hand, wore three-piece chocolate-brown suits and high-heeled snakeskin boots to meet with advertisers. He also accumulated objects, filling his London flat with middle-class art and furnishings. His colleagues referred to him as a "bread-head." "Felix had an instinctive head for business," says Dick Pountain, who was Oz's production manager.
What landed Felix Dennis in jail was the issue of June 1970. Even by today's standards, the cover is dirty: nipples sucked; dildos held; rats' tails pulled. You get the picture. Recalls Jim Anderson, Oz's designer: "The printer called us, 'Boys! Boys! Do you really want to do this?' The minute the issue hit the streets the shit hit the fan."
Armed with a warrant under the Obscene Publications Act, Scotland Yard raided the Oz offices. Neville, Anderson and Dennis were charged with obscenity, conspiracy, and with sending indecent articles through the post. The trial began on June 22, 1971. John Lennon and Yoko Ono marched in "Save Oz" protests and raised money for the trial by recording a single titled "God Save Oz." David Hockney helped out by auctioning sketches of the three defendants, nude. The Oz Three were found guilty. Neville was sentenced to 15 months in prison, Anderson to 12, and Dennis to 9. "You are younger than the other two and very much less intelligent," is how the judge justified Dennis' shorter sentence. But after less than two weeks in jail, the boys were freed, their sentences commuted. Neville moved to the Australian bush and became a social commentator. Anderson joined a hippie commune on the beach in Bolinas, California. Dennis became the 72nd-richest man in Britain.
Earlier this year, visiting his country estate in Warwickshire, two hours by car from London, I asked Dennis to identify his greatest strength. "Timing," he replied, without hesitation (or braggadocio).
It's uncanny, Dennis' sense of timing—his genius for turning loss into gain. For a short time after Oz folded, Dennis published underground comics on a shoestring. But as the hippie era waned, he went mainstream, launching a motorcycle-review magazine and buying Hi-Fi Choice. One day in 1974, passing a long line of teenagers outside a London movie theater, Dennis discovered Bruce Lee. "I thought, what the hell is going on? And I went over, and they told me they were queuing up to see this wonderful Chinaman who beat people up. So I went into the cinema and had a look and I wasn't in the movie house 15, 20 minutes, seen him turn around and stare at the camera a couple of times and beat people up, and I was already rushing out the movie house down to the offices: Let's go! This is going to be big!"
The result was Kung Fu Monthly, a magazine that would eventually be published in 17 countries and 11 languages. Having landed in the business of marketing fads to teenagers, Dennis produced inexpensive "one-shots"—single sheets of text that unfolded into glossy posters of James Dean, the Bay City Rollers, man-eating sharks, and Starsky and Hutch.
In 1975, Dennis, then 28, introduced his one shots to America. "He arrived on my doorstep on West 44th Street, virtually unannounced," says Peter Godfrey, one of Dennis's partners in the US. "He pulled out of his bag a flimsy publication—It was a Bruce Lee poster magazine. Who on earth would want a folded poster? I asked." Still, the profit margins intrigued Godfrey: one-shot poster magazines could be produced for pennies and sold for dollars. With Godfrey and his partner Robert Bartner overseeing distribution, Dennis sold "one-shots" all across America.
In 1979, Godfrey called Dennis in London: "We have more returns on a Star Wars movie poster than expected, so we overpaid you a couple thousand dollars."
"Well, I've spent it," Dennis replied. "I've bought a PC newsletter."
Godfrey asked, "What's a PC?"
Bill Gates was 24 in 1979. Personal computers were largely the domain of hobbyists. Dennis hardly knew what one was. And yet, presciently, thanks to advice from friends who understood the potential of such things, Dennis had just bought Europe's first publication devoted to the P.C.: Personal Computer World. The price was 100,000 Pounds. Less than three years later, Dennis sold what was now known as PC World to a Dutch publishing company for the then-astonishing sum of 3 million Pounds. Adjusted for inflation, that's about $10 million.
Dennis' next big magazine, MacUser, hit US newsstands in October 1985, a year and nine months after the introduction of the Apple Macintosh computer. Fourteen months later, Ziff-Davis Publishing bought MacUser from Dennis and his two American partners for $20 million. Adjusted for inflation, that's $31 million.
By all accounts, Dennis had always been self-indulgent. Now, suddenly rich, he became insatiable, boasting of his 14 mistresses and hinting at odd, unmentionable, sexual proclivities. He told The Guardian that he avoided old-fashioned intercourse—"not because of AIDS, but because I found out it was easier not having penetrative sex because you can do three things at once" (Dennis didn't elaborate.) His very conspicuous consumption began with the purchase of an oversized gold Rolex watch, then a cream-colored Rolls Royce, bought on the spot at a dealership in London. In a 1993 interview with the UK edition of Esquire, Dennis described the purchase this way: "I did say the classic thing: Excuse me—how much is this? And this prat actually said to me: 'If you have to ask, it's probably too much money.' So I said: You fucking cunt, go and get me the manager! And when he came I said to him: I don't know who this cunt is, but why don't you fire him and get me someone who'll sell me this motorcar? And he said: 'Yes, sir!' I bought that fucking motorcar because that bastard told me I couldn't afford it."
The money from the MacUser sale also funded Dennis' one business venture outside publishing: MicroWarehouse, a Connecticut-based mail order operation that sold computers and computer accessories. In early 2000, the company was bought by a group of private investors. In total, it earned Dennis $100 million.
Ironically, the 1995 launch of Maxim in the U.K. was one of the few times Felix Dennis was late to market. By the time he started the magazine, other so-called lads' magazines such as FHM and Loaded were well established. When he introduced Maxim to America, however, its adolescent mix of dirty jokes and boobs—somewhere between Mad and Juggs—was a novelty. "The timing was absolutely perfect," says Mark Golin, who was one of Maxim's early U.S. editors. "Maxim was showing up at the end of the long, politically correct era. Where you were supposed to discuss Woody Allen with your girlfriend over a glass of Chardonnay, here was Maxim saying, It's ok to be a guy." Especially a guy who drools when he reads.
The success of Maxim in the U.S. sent the existing U.S. men's magazines into a tailspin. In response, Conde Nast, publisher of GQ (and of this magazine), hired away Golin in April 1999 to run Details, a once-hot young-men's magazine that was now floundering. At first, the raid appeared to be a blow to Dennis Publishing. But from Dennis's point of view, the success of Maxim had nothing to do with some editor; after all, Dennis had created it.
Within hours of Golin's resignation, Dennis co-authored a clever press release, naming "Sammy the Office Hamster" as acting editor-in-chief. The girls featured in Maxim would be selected by Sammy. "One squeak means she gets the double-page spread," Dennis told a reporter. "Three squeaks and we've found our cover girl." Typically, ingeniously, Dennis turned rejection into a win. Impressed, the Wall Street Journal ran Dennis' press release on page one of its Marketplace section.
As for Mark Golin, less than a year after arriving at Details he found himself out of work. At present, he's responsible for content at Moviefone, an unglamorous division of AOL Time Warner. No wonder he sounds nostalgic: "Felix is somebody I would certainly drop anything to go and have 9 or 10 beers with," he admitted recently over a late-afternoon gin-and-tonic.
So far, 2001 has not been kind to newspaper and magazine publishers: almost without exception, advertising is down sharply this year. Yet Dennis seems unconcerned. He claims his U.S. titles will report overall revenues of $200 million this year, a more than 80% increase from 2000. Besides, he argues that he does not publish magazines for advertisers, nor to impress his peers—at Dennis Publishing, the only thing that counts is the reader. "I adore my readers," he says. "I like my advertisers, but I don't adore them. I adore my readers. Everything I publish is for my readers."
On April 14, Dennis Publishing launches its U.S. version of The Week, whose ambitious slogan read, "All You Need To Know About Everything That Matters." The launch of The Week is expected to cost $17 million. Less than four weeks later, on May 8, comes Dennis's new music magazine, Blender, edited by Andy Pemberton, who used to run Britain's quick-witted music magazine Q. Just as Maxim made the older men's magazines look stodgy, so too does Blender promise to be younger and more inclusive than its competitors. Unlike Rolling Stone, Blender will not write about politics or cultural trends. And rather than focus on one style of music, as Spin and The Source do, Blender will cover whatever kids are listening to on their MP3 players. Above all, Blender intends to be as irreverent as Maxim; it will not be self-important. "A magazine is just a piece of fluff in people's lives," Stephen Colvin, head of Dennis Publishing U.S.A. reminds me—not the sort of admission you'd hear from most U.S. publishers, who tend to think their magazines matter.
Felix Dennis now owns five Rolls Royces and five homes, each with its own wine cellar and dedicated full-time staff. His English country house, for example, is maintained by five gardeners and seven housekeepers, among others. The gardeners clip hedges, trim topiary, and manicure grass. The housekeepers dust, wax, hoover, mop and, yes, polish the wood—every day. At Dennis's specific request, they "groom" the carpets, making very sure that every single fiber faces the same way. They also button his freshly laundered shirts which can then be slipped over his head. He has two personal assistants, three personal accountants, a bookkeeper, a chauffeur and a "purchaser," who stocks Dennis's homes with clothing, toiletries, food, and other necessities of life.
Increasingly, though, what matters most to Dennis is neither money nor women but his legacy. "He loves being successful, he loves that people like you are doing profiles of him, he loves the game, but I suspect he has other hidden motivations," says Robert Bartlett, his longtime U.S. partner. "He started as far outside the English establishment as you can get and has been moving ever inward: at some point he will be knighted, or whatever it is you get from the Queen, and that to me would complete the circle from Oz."
With posterity, or Burke's Peerage, firmly in mind, Dennis has turned one building on his English estate into a vermin-proof, humidity-conditioned archive of his life. Organized by theme and date, the archive includes every scrap of paper that has ever entered Dennis's life: bus tickets, invitations, photographs, newspaper clippings, letters, receipts. As well, the archive includes thousands of pages of notes taken by a researcher hired to document his life. From time to time, 250 of his friends and associates are sent packages documenting the latest accomplishments of Felix Dennis: video tapes of his parties; bound copies of speeches he's given; recent issues of his magazines; press releases; stunning sales figures; company T-shirts. Recently, he announced that the bulk of his vast estate will go toward creating the "Forest of Dennis" in an as-yet-undecided location: 50,000 deciduous trees are to be planted on 100,000 acres of land, an area seven times the size of Manhattan.
In the past year, Dennis has also started writing poetry; it takes itself very seriously:
"I do not speak of secrets, long dormant or concealed;
Of passion unrequited, of wounds which never healed.
I seek for treasures buried, a hoard, as you might say,
Though what I seek is worthless, encased in human clay."
On a late February afternoon, at his Warwickshire house, Dennis and I share a Sunday lunch: roast lamb with gravy, green beans, and julienne carrots, all prepared by his attentive companion—his "favorite companion—Marie-France Demolis. She is a tall, suntanned, 42-year-old Frenchwoman, a hairdresser he met at a party. I have been invited here because there is something very important Dennis wants me to see. And so, after lunch, outfitted with a pair of Wellington boots and a warm coat, I am sent off with the chauffeur in a navy-blue stretch Rolls Royce to visit Dennis's current "big project"—the Garden of Heroes.
Down a narrow, rutted path, in a fog, a mile or so from the main house, the car stops. Flanking a long avenue of smooth lawn, lined up with absolute precision, are a series of life-sized bronze statues of Chuck Berry playing the guitar, Charles Darwin riding a Galapagos tortoise, Mark Twain sitting on a bench, Oscar Wilde, and Stephen Hawking in his wheelchair with its attached speech synthesizer and computer screen that reads "The universe has no boundary." Soon to be installed in this pantheon, I am told, are Vincent Van Gogh, Gregory Alexander Potemkin, Bob Dylan with Woody Guthrie, Dorothy Parker with her dogs, Muhammad Ali, Yuri Gagarin, Billie Holiday, and Alistair Cook, announcing the death of Bobby Kennedy. Already in the Garden of Heroes, between Wilde and Hawkings, is a life-sized bronze of Felix Dennis from his Oz days. To quote the title of one of his poems, The Greeks Had A Word For It. As Dennis explains in a footnote to the poem, "The word begins with ‘H.’"You may have heard the old advice that we "put away the things of childhood" when we grow up. I think many people take that well-meant advice too far, and let go of part of what makes us interact with our world in the most special and aweinspiring ways. My being an artist/scientist is just the continuation of the wonder that I felt as a child in a strange and awesome new world.
It is also is about exploring the processes that can lead me to some end, to some thrilling new discovery. Oftentimes it is an end or discovery I can neither foresee or predict, but because I loved the process of discovery itself, it is okay if something (an experiment, a painting) does not turn out the way I might have anticipated. In fact, anticipating the end result is often selfdefeating. My own artistic vision and style is much more about searching out all the parts and seeing what flows from those, without trying to unduly influencing the end result. One of the best things about these explorations is that you learn as much from something that doesn't work out as you do from something that does (sometimes more!)
I believe that art is generated by a vital force within a person and that force can continue to revitalize others through the sharing of the work of art for generations to come. It is through this force, this vitality, that we not only come to know ourselves, but also that which we all share in our collective humanity, since we are all connected.
Listen to Earthcreated music and understand where the inspiration came from; then taking the inspirations all around you, create your own. Do the same with images, words and experiential art such as plays, virtual environments, and games. Create so that we can all share in your adventure. Explore so we can all learn what you will discover. Let the energies flow back to enrich us all.I'm doing something different this week. Instead of one review on Thursday, I'll be doing mini reviews on my progression through EVE Online. I'm hoping to post every day, or every couple of days, until the trial period runs out. And then, I'll tell you, my dear readers, whether or not I'm going to pony up the $15/month to keep playing.
I'd heard of EVE years ago, and totally ignored it like I do all MMORPGS. You know, Mentally Malignant Oppressively Redundant Grind Systems. It isn't so much that I find the idea of a MMORPG repulsive. Indeed, I love RPGs of all genres, and only in a multiplayer setting is there any chance for actual role-playing. It's rather that they lack the thing that draws me to RPGs in the first place: the ability to make a difference in the game world.
In WoW, for instance, you're assigned a quest. You go and fulfill the quest, kill the Giant Demon Dragon of Spoogeton, and five minutes later the goddamn thing respawns. It's literally impossible to affect the world, because the quest has to be available for the next player who wanders through. There may be alliances and guilds who play together, and against one another, but there's nothing that's actually owned by those groups... there's no reason to fight, other than the rapidly-tarnishing joy of killing another player by repeatedly clicking on them. I had figured EVE was the same way.
And then I heard about the Band of Brothers vs. GoonSwarm fiasco that made even mainstream internet news. Apparently, in EVE, player-owned corporations can actually hold territory. There's a functional and nuanced economy. There is strategy, and not merely raid-level tactics. There are giant battles between hundreds of ships.
So, after reading a lot on the BoB/GoonSwarm intrigue, I finally decided to give it a go. I checked online and discovered that they have both a linux and a Mac client, which is mandatory since I don't have Windows. It runs flawlessly on my high-end Ubuntu box, and it runs pretty well but with occasional stutter on on my Macbook. This is despite the fact that the minsysreqs claim that I need a discrete graphics processor, while the Macbook has only integrated Intel. I do suspect, however, that the Macbook would flicker along at an unacceptable 5 frames per second if I were involved in a large fleet action.
So, I signed up for my 14-day trial account and logged in.
I created my character based on *gasp* roleplaying choices, since I had not the slightest idea how to minmax a character. Hell, I didn't even know which skill made it easier to shoot somebody. I chose the race that claimed to support democracy; chose some other options to maximize my stats; chose to have a special forces background.
There's lots of information during the character creation process as to how the different attributes and skills interact, but nothing about the high-level actions that they enable. You'd assume that "Gunnery" would be shooting, and I think you'd be right... but, I didn't find anything that explicitly said, "Higher ranks of Gunnery improve your probability to hit an enemy." Already, I was wishing for a manual. One about six inches thick, if you don't mind.
So, after finishing my character creation, I accidentally skipped some intro movie, and was dumped in space. In a ship, mind you, not naked with my blood boiling out of my eye sockets. In EVE, you practically are your ship. Aside from a relatively generic character portrait, the only avatar you'll ever have is whatever ship you're piloting today. You can't get out of your ship and run around the space stations at which you dock.
There's a tutorial that started to guide me through piloting my ship in space. Of course, when it told me to double click on empty space to fly there, I accidentally wound up directing my ship close enough to a training drone for it to aggro. And I had not the slightest clue how to defend myself.
The interface is complex and non-intuitive. The left-hand edge of the screen is a column of buttons with labels such as "Journal", "Wallet", and "People and Places". There's a cluster of GUI elements at the bottom center that's made up entirely of icons and infographics. There's a proximal object list on the right-hand side--essentially a list of every visible object within range.
In a panic as blue plasma death rained down on my poor frigate, I clicked next on the tutorial window until the bitch told me how to shoot back.
I can't figure out if combat is complex or as simplistic as other MMORPG combat. To shoot down that pirate, I had to select it either in the game display or in the proximal objects list (I'll call that the POL from here on in). Right click it. Tell the computer to orbit the pirate at 1500m. Then, I clicked the icon representing the only gun I had mounted. After that, I had nothing to do but watch as the training drone and I circled each other exchanging fire.
My difficulty in determining the complexity of combat comes from the difficulty of selecting a target and navigating the context menus under fire. Since space is three dimensional, it's next to impossible to visually acquire the bad guy and select him directly. This is exacerbated by the fact that the selection/targeting rectangle is tiny. So, right-clicking a fast-moving object and selecting "Orbit at->1500m" before the sucker flies off the screen is damn-near impossible.
The POL makes life easier, but only a little. There's no obvious mechanism that ties a POL entry to a game-display object. If there's more than one baddie attacking you, the only clue you have as to which target to prioritize is a range entry on the list. Depending on the attack pattern, the currently closest ship may or may not be the best target.
Life got a little easier when I noticed the row of tiny buttons at the top of the POL that allow you to quickly select actions without going through the context menus. There is, for instance, an orbit button. And if you right click those buttons, you can select default parameters. So, now it only takes me two clicks to orbit at 1500m instead of three clicks with a very finicky context-menu selection in between--the menu disappears when your mouse leaves the confines, meaning that imprecise mousing results in starting over.
So, I made it through that battle. And the next one. And then I mined some ore.
Ore is part of the economy. And this economy bears no resemblance to that of any other MMORPG I've heard of. Instead of mining ore and then taking it to some shopkeeper who will buy it at a set price from anyone who shows up with the stuff, there's an entire commodities exchange. You can place buy and sell orders in a market, which has fluctuating prices based on demand. That ore you mine can be processed into metals; those metals can be built into ships or guns or cargo pods or whatever. And there're multiple kinds of ore, producing multiple kinds of raw stock, producing LOTS of different manufactured goods.
Almost all of this economy is player driven. Prices fluctuate with the demand of players for manufactured goods, rippling all the way back down the supply chain organically. If there's a big war between two alliances, they'll need more ships. More ships means more metals. More metals means more ore. The prices go up.
The prices are also local, varying with location. I've sold several objects at ludicrously low prices, and bought them at stupidly high prices, simply because that's the price at which they were selling at the station at which I was docked. The game does tell you the best price you could get, and how many hyperspace jumps away it is. But, just like I'll pay an extra fifty cents for a pack of cigarettes at the village general store instead of driving all the way to WalMart, I couldn't be bothered to make the ten minute trip to some less-secure region of space in order to buy ammo.
One thing that I noticed in the fora threads discussing EVE is the level of boredom many people experienced. I can't say that I've felt bored yet, but I do understand what elements of the game would turn them off. It hasn't struck me as the kind of boredom that comes from repetition, but rather the sort of boredom that comes from downtime.
The developers understand that space is really, really big. Huge, even. And so to move around it requires time. You travel at obviously faster-than-light speeds, so you needn't worry about properly briefing your kids to carry on after you've died mid flight. But, you do spend a fair amount of time letting the autopilot guide you between jump gates and through systems.
Likewise, combat seems to be a war of attrition. You designate targets and ranges, and click on the weapons you want to use, and your computer handles the rest of it automatically. When one target is destroyed, designate a new one and repeat. If you have the shields and weapons to destroy them before they destroy you, you'll win; if your shields or weapons are weak, you'll die.
One thing I find interesting is that improving skills requires realworld time. Instead of leveling up and getting points to spend for immediate skill upgrades, you choose a skill to train and go about your business. A progress bar slowly creeps upward until you gain the next skill level. The question I have now is whether or not time counts if you're not logged in. Like, can you select a skill to train, log out, go to sleep, and have finished training when you wake up? We'll see.

Progressive Review: EVE Online
Posted by Aubrey Jones at 2:06 AM
Hi,
Congrats on joining the most mature MMO out there ;)
I have been involved with EvE Online for now almost 6 years as a very casual player. As a very casual player I am still one of the most skilled (character skill points) player out there. This skill is not acquired with grinding, but as you say... the passage of time. And yes, your skills train when you log off, but they do not if when your account expires (which will only happen if you stop paying for more play time).
your POL is called an overview btw :) and you can ctrl + left click to quickly target stuff on the overview. Also note the small triangles next to the text "overview" where you can color code different stuff and further customize what your overview displays.
You are very perceptive about the economy and the grand scheme of things. Indeed there are great virtual events in the world that effect everyone. I for one couldn't stop giggling that day when the Goons closed down BoB.
Characters as spaceships. This is subject to change. There is an update coming to the game (soon - you'll see this word a lot but it actually means "you will see this feature eventually") that is called Ambulation. In ambulation you will be able to exit your spaceship and walk around in space stations, meeting other people and set up shops and stuff... it's more of a cosmetic addition as far as I can tell.
Also, updates are free. There are two updates each year (BIG patches). We are talking graphic engine updates, huge content patches and revolutionary new mechanics ... FREE. You don't have to go to the store to buy it for $30 or whatever, you could say it is included in your monthly fee (you can decide to pay 3, 6 and 12 month subscription ... saving you some money).
More on the money, if you actually do good and make a fair good amount of isk (the ingame currency "interstellar kredits") you can buy gametime for that ingame isk. Current rates are around 300 million for 30 days:
There is mindless grinding stuff available in EvE of course ... but it is your choice to go down that path. Sure, it is the easiest way to make isk but no way the only one ... and most surely not the biggest bucks way either.
EvE is complicated ... in a good and bad way at the same time. As I said before, I am constantly learning something new (discovered I could use scrolling on my mouse to increase or decrease the number of units or the sell/buy price in the market buy/sell window ... wtf?!? - keyboard free shopping!)

Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) require very explicit and systematic instruction to reach their full potential. Although researchers have identified methods for accomplishing such outcomes in research settings, these methods have yet to flourish within educational environments. Using recent reviews of the intervention literature by the National Professional Development Center on Autism Spectrum Disorders and Dr. Plavnick's experimental research on technological innovations for teaching reading, language, and social interaction, he offers practical suggestions for engineering educational environments in ways that optimize learning for children with ASD.

With these problems, you simply drop a few drops at the affected site and rub it into the skin. Improvement usually occurs very rapidly and repeat applications increase the effectiveness and recovery time. There is no real limit to the number of applications that can be applied.
I have used it as a carrier to enhance the deep penetration and absorption of certain topical herbal solutions that are joint, connective tissue and/or membrane targeted. Example: I tore the supraspinatus (shoulder tendon) while playing competitive basketball at the age of 53. It was such a serious tear that I was unable to move my arm 1 inch away from my body while hanging at my side. I was told that I would need surgery, months of rehabilitation, steroids and at least one year before I might expect a partial, perhaps 90% recovery. I declined "modern medicine" as usual and took matters into my own hands and trusting the experience, knowledge and most of all direct help that comes from the GREAT PHYSICIAN. Meanwhile a younger b-ball co-player had suffered the same injury 3 months prior. He had already had his surgery, a big scar, physical therapy and some drugs. He wasn't doing so well and was amazed that a man nearly 25 years his senior was showing signs of recovery that he was not able to match. (Not to mention the pain problem he suffered)
I attribute my COMPLETE recovery, (I am able to military press 145 pounds 10 times without extreme effort) and was playing basketball competitively at 6 months after injury... to Soor Balm, some other topical herbal solution and various methods of rehabilitation that I developed myself with the guidance of the Great Physician.
Soor Balm should be used on burns, cuts, and sprains and provides relief almost immediately, lasting up to 6 hours. A swollen sprained ankle will show signs of the reduction of swelling within one hour and there is no other known treatment I am aware of that can make this claim.
Any auto-immune health problem can be greatly benefited by the use of Soor Balm. This also applies to anyone that has suffered stroke or other types of brain injuries.
Soor Balm can be taken internally as well as topically.. Soor Balm hooks on to those molecules and they are then expelled from the body.
Soor Balm.
Soor Balm promotes the excretion of urine and functions as a muscle relaxant. It boosts the immune system, increasing the production of white cells and macrophages that destroy foreign material and pathogens in the body. It also has anti-bacterial, anti-viral and anti-fungal properties. Soor Balm also increases the permeability of cell membranes, allowing a flushing of toxins from the cell.
Soor Balm has radioprotective properties against lethal and mutagenic effects of X-rays in cells, cellular systems and whole animals. It also has cryoprotective properties, meaning that it is capable of protecting against injury due to freezing.
As a source of sulfur, Soor Balm aids in heavy metal detoxification. Sulfur binds with toxic heavy metals (mercury, lead, aluminum, cadmium, arsenic, nickel) and eliminates them via urination, defecation and sweating.Project Management Office - Organization Chart

It’s a pity that the market participants’ focus is on the childish political theater in Washington D.C. which is nothing but a symptom of a greater problem. Nations like families and individuals should restrain excessive spending habits (especially those that advance vested special interests and have nothing to do with the nation’s various security matters, infrastructure, education, and health), while learning to live within their means and reducing liabilities that will burden future generations. However, it seems that all the focus has been on the here and now, without even considering how the here and now could matter simply because every market participant has a yesterday, a today, and a tomorrow. There is an organic link that ties together the past, the present, and the future. When we subvert this natural order of things, then we suffer the consequences. Eric Arthur Blair (a.k.a. George Orwell) once observed: “He who controls the past, controls the future. He who controls the future, controls the present.”
The emphasis on the here and now is another symptom of a fiat money system that is getting old, and thus cannot clearly focus on nearby objects (a.k.a. presbyopia). The impasse observed over budget negotiations in Washington D.C., has raised fears of a technical default. That seems to be an excuse for further monetary accommodation, as The Boston Fed president hinted last week. I do not expect the US to go through a technical default, thus any market drop should be used as an opportunity to buy securities with strong fundamentals and with a viable growth path.
The inability to see far away objects (myopia) refers to the ongoing efforts by the US Fed and the ECB to stimulate their respective economies without understanding that no nation or federation of nations has ever been able to survive in the past with a fiat money system. The US Fed operations are bifurcated. The Fed has started tapering through the operations they initiated on September 23rd through repo agreements with their primary dealers, hedge funds, and other institutional players. Through those repo agreements the Fed loans the counter-parties bonds from its portfolio with the promise to buy them back at a higher price. The Fed’s counter-parties use those bonds as collateral to create credit and through the credit creation to increase money supply and keep rates down. Needless to say that each counter-party uses the same bond as collateral for credit creation and that chain can go on for several rounds (re-hypothecating the same collateral for multiple credit creation, which is not only absurd but the real cause that brought the system down in 2008).
As the number of participants in that re-hypothecation chain expands (as it did on Sept. 23rd) then a new bubble is created, and bubbles always burst. So we have the bifurcated reality of the Fed continuing to buy “assets” while technically shrinking its balance sheet through the repo agreements.
I have very little doubt that this will indeed increase money supply and the next several months could become another party for equities and a number of corporate bonds. At the same time, The Fed will continue supporting the ECB through swap agreements and thus assist the ECB in its goal of keeping interest rates down, and especially for its goal of lowering the cost of capital for medium and small EU enterprises (see graph below).
Therefore, it is my belief that in the foreseeable future markets in their myopic view and without presbyopic lenses will experience new record highs, once the political theater is over.
My concern is focused on the period two-three years hence when an elderly person’s myopia glasses have been crushed and the bubble created by expanding the collateral base (via the repo agreements described above) and the re-hypothecation chain, start bursting. Unless the global monetary system prepares itself in the next two-three years by establishing sound money that will be based on hard-assets collateral, my fear is that we may be setting ourselves up for a crisis like no other.
Maybe, that’s the reason that the Fed still plans to buy record amounts of gold at these low gold prices (which I expect to drop further), as reported by Bloomberg on Monday October 7th. This may be their way of sending us a subliminal message., 1994
GWENDOLYN CUFF
v.
INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINE CO.
The opinion of the court was delivered by: THOMAS N. O'NEILL, JR.
MEMORANDUM
O'Neill, J.
I. Introduction
Plaintiff Gwendolyn Cuff alleges that she was discharged by defendant International Business Machine Company ("IBM") for the purpose of depriving her of IBM employee benefits in violation of section 510 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA"), 29 U.S.C. § 1140.
A bench trial was held. This Memorandum constitutes my findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 52(a). For the reasons that follow, I conclude that plaintiff has not shown that defendant terminated plaintiff's employment in order to deprive her of employee benefits in violation of section 510 of ERISA. Accordingly, I will enter judgment in favor of defendant and against plaintiff.
II. Findings of Fact
A. Background
1. Defendant IBM is a corporation involved in the computer business. During the period relevant to this dispute, it operated a customer service center and other facilities in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
2. Plaintiff was employed by defendant at its Philadelphia office from June 24, 1974, until February 14, 1990.
3. IBM provides to its employees a number of benefit programs, including its Sickness and Accident Income Plan ("S & A Plan") and its Medical Disability Income Plan. As an IBM employee, plaintiff was eligible for defendant's benefit programs.
4. Under the S & A Plan, an employee who misses work due to illness or injury is eligible for regular salary for each day of absence up to a maximum of 52 weeks in 24 consecutive months. In order to receive benefits under the S & A Plan, an employee must, upon request, submit a certificate of disability from his or her physician.
5. Under the Medical Disability Income Plan, an employee who becomes disabled after five or more years of service is eligible for income until age 65.
*fn1"
In order to receive benefits under the Medical Disability Income Plan, an employee must offer satisfactory proof that the person suffers from a disability that prevents him or her from working. The disability must have existed for at least nine months and be the type of condition that will continue during the employee's lifetime. IBM may require a physical examination to determine the continuance of the disability.
6. At IBM, employment is at will and can be terminated at any time. IBM's attendance policy requires employees to report to work each day as scheduled. According to the IBM employment handbook, an employee who fails to comply with the company's attendance requirements may be dismissed.
7. IBM's medical department determines whether an employee's absence is medically justified. As part of its determination, the department evaluates information received from employees' doctors. In situations in which the medical diagnosis needs clarification, the medical department has a medical consultant conduct an independent evaluation. The consultant's assessment generally prevails over that of the employee's doctor.
8. If the medical department finds a medical justification for the employee's absence, it will notify management that the absence is appropriate. If the medical department finds that the absence is not medically justified, it will notify management accordingly and management will handle the situation as if no medical issue is involved.
B. Plaintiff's Employment History
9. During the course of her employment, Ms. Cuff received a number of promotions. From 1987 until her termination in 1990, she held the position of senior customer center administrator.
10. Ms. Cuff testified that in May 1988, she began to experience mental and physical problems including fatigue, weakness and an inability to concentrate. Her treating physician was Dr. Stanley Lane, who had a specialized practice in allergy and immunology.
11. Plaintiff's condition did not improve. In September 1988, Ms. Cuff informed her supervisor, Ms. Donna Jennings, that she was ill. Plaintiff missed work from September 20 to September 23, 1988, and from September 29, 1988 to January 2, 1989. During this time, she was hospitalized for four days in November.
12. Ms. Cuff received her full salary while absent.
13. Pursuant to company policy, Ms. Jennings notified IBM's medical department of plaintiff's absence.
14. Dr. Lane diagnosed plaintiff as having chronic Epstein-Barr Virus.
*fn2"
He also submitted a medical certificate to IBM's medical department identifying Epstein-Barr Virus as Ms. Cuff's illness.
15. Dr. Lane sent Ms. Cuff to Dr. Lawrence Frenkel, who was director of the division of immunology, allergy and infectious diseases at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. In December 1988, Dr. Frenkel performed a detailed examination of Ms. Cuff. In a letter to Dr. Lane, Dr. Frenkel stated that a "review of [plaintiff's] systems except for . . . sinus problems and lethargy is essentially unremarkable. . . . the physical exam today is essentially unremarkable."
*fn3"
16. Ms. Cuff returned to work in early January 1989. In a letter to Dr. Silverberg dated January 6, 1989, Dr. Lane stated that Ms. Cuff had "recovered from her outbreak of EBV problems" and that she "has had an extensive immunologic work-up done, which, thus far, has shown normal results." Dr. Lane also advised against plaintiff performing any heavy manual labor or working overtime.
17. On January 9, 1989, Dr. Timothy Tomasi, an IBM physician specialist, signed off on plaintiff's return-to-work slip. He did not evaluate Ms. Cuff before signing the slip. As discussed below, Dr. Tomasi was the primary IBM physician responsible for evaluating Ms. Cuff's health as it related to her employment.
18. During the first five months of 1989, plaintiff missed only one full day and two half days due to illness.
19. On June 13, 1989, Ms. Cuff reported that she was ill and left work early. She was absent from work for the rest of June, with the exception of three days: June 19, 21 and 26.
20. On June 26, 1989, Ms. Jennings contacted Dr. Timothy Tomasi because Ms. Cuff had been outUniversal RA/GA Tuition Scholarships
Research assistants and graduate assistants receive the same tuition scholarship benefits as teaching assistants. As part of this policy, all principal investigators who include research or graduate assistants on a grant or contract are required to include a separate budget line for tuition
in any new proposal submission; the Office of Sponsored Projects Administration (OSPA) has been assisting PIs in meeting this requirement. For RAs and GAs who are not funded from grants and contracts, departmental funds may be used to provide the Universal
Tuition Scholarships.
The Universal Tuition Scholarships for research assistants and graduate assistants will automatically apply to the student's account upon submission and review of a Graduate Student Academic Staff Notice of Appointment (GSAS) form to the Graduate School Funding Office.
Each fall and spring semester, programs and colleges will receive an invoice for that semester listing all research and graduate assistants who are degree-seeking in their unit, as well as the amount of their Universal Tuition Scholarship charge. Colleges should review and complete the on-line invoice in order to move the funding to a central pool that has been established to support these scholarships...

But at Christmas time c and I were given $500.00 worth of Walmart gift cards. I guess the thought is you can buy anything there. So we finally we went to the pits to spend, because, lets face it, $500.00 is a lot of money.
I had specifics. C is on a health food kick and it has nothing to do with the 15 pounds he packed on over his Christmas vacation; except it has everything to do with it. So I grabbed some wok type frying pans, and an electric wok, and a ricer. I also grabbed a deep fryer and completely fucked the health kick by making my famous deep fried pepperettes, if you have never tried them DO! They are fucking awesome with mustard, or better yet Dijon mustard, because I am all super-fucking-sophisticated;).
After we finished at hades we went to a few markets. I love markets, but they are funny around here because each market has a very defined purpose. Downtown is a farmers market, so foods, and some knit clothing, and homemade baked goods by one of my Nonna's old neighbor. I really love to see her but it is tres awkward as she seems to want to fatten me up in the 15 minutes I stand there, and won't take my money or no for an answer. She shovels cookies and cakes and tarts at me. I got around a strawberry and rhubarb pie (yuck), by pleading C's "diet".... Ummm , yeah, he is not, I repeat NOT on a diet, just a resolution to eat healthier.... Uh huh.
Another market is.... Well, lets just say frm the parking lot you can get singed, because 90% of the shit is hot. Like panel Tvs with no bases, because they were stolen off the walls. Knock off fashions, yeah, real D&G sunglasses for $5.00, I might have been born at night, but it wasn't last night. Oh,and of course the table of pirated movies, for those too lazy to pirate them yourselves.
A couple blocks over is the flea flea market. One that is likely to give you fleas. Old, gross, disgusting kids toys from 20 years ago, not washed, and clothes that make you think "damn, a mullet would make that outfit look better".
Finally we have, okay, technically no longer in my city, but this old barn antiques market. It is about 5 buildings (mostly old barns), and lots of outdoor tables. Mostly junk, but some actual antiques, by far my fave this side of Brantford. I picked up a cedar chest there a few weeks ago. It looks like shit, but for a few fairy tale moments I thought : I'm good with tools, I can strip it down and stain and varnish the wood. Yeah, not so much. C has threatened to throw it out if I don't do something with it, and it actually smells a bit. Smells like a bad decision to buy that is:P
For home and found out that my television actor crush (damn the things I would like to do to that man) was over at one of our malls. *Le sigh*. I missed him:'(
It sounds like you did a massive amount of shopping... hopefully you got everything you needed:)
I feel that way about Walmart too... there are some good buys there though:)
we dont have wallmart in my country but we sure do have the counterpart. It's not as crappy as that though. we are still blessed hehe:)
Walmart isn't that bad, I think :-)
"...because I am all super-fucking-sophisticated" Probably one of your better lines, lol.
Who's that actor crush? I'm curious now.Resume Writer Lance Resume Example Contributing Ted Perrotti Web Content Copywriter And Editor Front

The hungry target market; also giving away free test-drives throughout Europe.
The Boxter s price was its main advantage. It was said that by pricing the car exactly right Porsche executives had cornerstoned the market. The Boxter S was cunningly underpriced, so that when it was actually purchased, it would rise in value. Thus the demand for these cars was massive, and due to the waiting list, people tried to buy second hand, from Porsches own recently established second-hand dealers.
To outline basically the influences on demand for the Boxter:
1) Features of the car, i.e. Safety, Power, Speed etc
2) Reputation of the Porsche group in both the manufacture of race-cars and road-cars
3) Perceived future value of the Boxter S
4) Available customer choice
5) Lack of competition in this field
6) Rarity of the good
And to outline the influences on supply:
1) Limited available production due to there only being one Porsche production plant
2) Personal customisation of the vehicles
3) Purposeful creation of rarity
In 1997/98, Porsche was able to expand its business because of the strong demand for the 911 and Boxster models. The Group’s sales rose by 13 percent to 36,686 vehicles, its turnover by 20 percent to 4.9 billion DM. This was thanks to a high volume of orders in hand and a cautious medium-term hedging policy against possible exchange-rate fluctuations in the most important currencies, earnings and turnover prospects for the current year are also encouraging. Due to continuing strong demand for both model lines, Porsche were almost certain to increase the previous year’s high production and sales levels still further in 1998/99. Since Porsche is engaged in optimising processes throughout the Group, further strengthening of the company’s internal earning power is anticipated. Looking into the future, Porsche has also hedged against possible fluctuations and weaknesses of the most important currencies in the medium to long term.
In Frankfurt, Porsche, the sportscar maker, announced on Tuesday that group sales for the fiscal year ended July 31 were up 24 per cent to DM6.1bn ($3.2bn), against DM4.9bn one year earlier.
Unit sales were 20 per cent higher at 43,980 from 36,686 last year. The company described pre-tax profit in 1999 as “reasonable” but declined to provide exact figures.
Despite expenses associated with the development of a new four-wheel drive vehicle, Porsche said it aimed to match last year’s earnings in the current business.The authenticity of this employer is yet to be ascertained by Careerslip.com

This tranquil village is located in the Kullu district around 75 kms from Manali – one of the most beautiful hill stations in North India. It can take around 2.5 hours to 3 hours depending on the traffic.
Breathe the clean air of the mountains and enjoy the peace and quiet in this remote Himalayan village. Whether you are a trekker or simply visiting with family, a relaxing walk along the Parvati River is a must. White stones, pine trees and clear blue sky! Can you ask for more? If your answer is yes, and you are the adventurous sort, you can proceed to trek the Kheer Ganga Peak. The trek is fairly easy. The view, of course, is stunning, but the cherry on the top is the hot water spring that originates here. That should soothe your muscles after the 9 kms hike.
At a height of 6000ft above the sea level, where the river Parvati meets river Bhunter and flows into the river Beas, is the holy Manikar Sahib Gurudwara, one of the holiest pilgrimages according to the Brahmand Puran. Manikar Sahib Gurudwara accommodates 4000 people. They also have a hot water pool and a langar. Eating at a langar is a one-of-a-kind experience if you have never done that before. The kindness will fill your heart with joy.
Along with adventure activities, Kasol is also an interesting place for culture lovers. Chhalal village, you may not guess, is known for its Israeli population. Experience some of the best Israeli food in the roadside cafes. This ‘Little Israel’ has reggae bars, body piercing, tattoo parlours and hippie culture that is very different from the rest of India. The Israeli influence is evident in signboards in Kasol which are written in both Hindi and Hebrew.
Another village nearby called Pulga, around 16 km from Kasol, is known for its tea. Lush green pastures and tea shops attract a lot of foreign backpackers. There is a Lord Narayan Temple in the middle of the village which is frequented by the locals. If you are a fan of the Russian painter Nicholas Roerich, you may want to visit Naggar village. It’s not a surprise that he spent 20 years painting in this paradise. His paintings are now a part of the Roerich Museum which is maintained by the Indian government. Naggar castle, which is now a heritage hotel, is a scenic spot for viewing the Kullu valley on both sides. There is also the mythical Jagti Patt stone which is said to cure people against illnesses. If you are a Bollywood fan you can remember Kareena Kapoor dancing in the Naggar Castle in Jab we met.
The local flea markets in Kasol are perfect for souvenirs, t-shirts, trinkets, semi-precious stones and winter wear. If you want to do more extensive shopping, Manali – the valley of gods – is only a short ride away. Carpets, shawls and other Tibetian goods are few of the things you can spend on in Manali.
If you are travelling around winter, Skiing in Manali is yet another thing to do to enjoy the snow. A few days in Kasol and a few days in Manali is the perfect balance between the quaint and the bustling hill station. Choose from the plethora of places to visit in Manali for a fun trip with your family and friends. Take your pick from the spectacular Jogani Falls to the well-known Maniram ke Dhaba. Snow does make the road a bit tricky to drive through. Be careful while driving or hire a driver from Himachal Pradesh who is experienced in driving on winter roads.

In Gainesville, Fla., Mike Rosario scored 15 points and Patric Young added 14 to pace a balanced attack that helped Florida (22-4, 12-2) rebound from one of its two conference losses with a victory over Arkansas
(17-10, 8-6).
Kenny Boynton and Erik Murphy both had 12 points for the first-place Gators, who also bounced back from squandering a 13-point lead over the final 11 minutes of a 63-60 loss at Missouri to regain a two-game lead in the conference over Alabama.
LOUISIANA STATE 97,

In Oxford, Miss., Marshall Henderson scored 28 points, Derrick Millinghaus added 14 and Mississippi (20-7, 9-5) routed Auburn (9-18, 3-11).The Union website is to undergo a bit of a facelift in the coming months, with a number of revisions to the design. The changes will not, however, include the restoration of news feeds from Live!, Felix and stoic tv. The three media outlets had all been a permanent fixture on the old site and Live! was given assurances in June last year that they would return. Despite plans to do so being well advanced they have now been dropped from the final redesign, apparently at the behest of ICU President John Collins. Mr Collins denied all knowledge, claiming - with a wry smile on his face - that small details like that did not concern him. Earlier in the year he said of the plan: "what if there's bad news?"
The news section of the redesigned website will continue carrying propaganda amongst event advertising and election results. Burying bad news is not uncommon this year and was especially apparent when Mr Collins came off his bike - the page advertising his progress was swiftly dumped from the front page, where it was intended to stay for the duration of his ride. Those visiting it through the feed on the Live! front page noted that it did not mention an accident until several days later, initially claiming the ride had been stopped due to bad weather.
Live! Editor Ashley Brown commented on the U-turn: "We must be doing a good job if they are trying to limit our audience - what does the Union have to hide? I'm sure Stephen Brown is made of sterner stuff: I've seen him in a kilt and he didn't mind having his dirty laundry on display then."
Unconfirmed rumours are circulating that this latest spat between Beit Towers and Live! is down to the ICU President being sore at having no picture of himself with the Queen in Reporter, Imperial's staff magazine. His only presence is in the background of another photo, apparently wiping his nose. A certain media editor received much more coverage.
Anyone looking for a balanced view of events in the Union should, of course, add Live! as their home page. As well as the latest news and critical analysis, the front page includes news feeds from College, ICU and the BBC, alongside the latest weather forecast and tube status. Events taken from the union website, as well as extra ones added directly by clubs, are also visible on both the front page and events calendar.The June PMQG meeting is this coming Thursday, June 16th from 7-9 pm at PNCA (1241 NW Johnson Street).

Each morning that they come to the office they greet us with their "Good Morning" jingle and smiling faces.
They set a wonderful example to us of gospel living and sharing. They are obedient and just super young men. They work tirelessly beside the President and Sister Trayner. They truly serve the other elders and sisters. They encourage and inspire the other missionaries. They help take some of the burden off of the President.
They also help us with various tasks and are always willing to serve us. They are great!This route is known as the Camí de la Central because in the past there was a small electrical generating station here. On the way back from the weir you pass through a well-preserved section of riparian woodland with interesting associated flora.
The Ruta de la Capelleta takes you to the remains of this small church (or chapel) that was once a popular place of worship for local people. Today, it is semi-derelict.
© Copyright 2018 | Turisme Garrotxa | La Garrotxa, the land of volcanoesFrom the 17th century onwards more documentation about the Church and its priests has become available and it is referred to by the Leeds historian Ralph Thoresby. During the 19th century, which is better documented, a picture emerges of a Church building which has been in existence for some centuries and no longer meets the needs of the local congregation. The building of "industrial revolution" housing, for example in the Hawthorns and the Methleys, indicates the level of population growth in the area at a time when Leeds itself was growing considerably. In 1819 and again in the 1830's, 1850's, 1860's and the 1880's, various attempts were made to enlarge the Church to cope with this greater congregation and to deal with various structural problems. It appears from drawings of the period to have undergone a facelift into a Georgian Chapel with a small tower and spire, an apsidal east end and an internal gallery. Eventually in 1894 while discussions were being held about the provision of a new organ, it became apparent that there was no point in improving specific aspects of a building which was said to be damp, unhealthy and ugly, and not appropriate to the worship of God. A grant of land which had been made by a parishioner in 1879 for the construction of a parsonage house, and possibly a chapel of ease, on what was then known as Shortcliffe Lane but which we now know as Wood Lane, offered an opportunity to start again. The scheme proposed by Mr G. F. Bodley was accepted and the foundation stone was laid on the 18th October 1897. The new Church was consecrated on the 3rd February 1900.
This was not the end of use of the old Church; it continued for some years to be used for guild meetings and occasional services but its main use was for funerals. The top of the tower became insecure, making the building unsuitable for further use, and it was demolished in the summer of 1935. The shape of the old Church can still be seen in the foundations in the grass of the graveyard. This had been extended several times to cope with the growing population and it continued in use until it was closed by an Order in Council in 1974.

Many attractive landscapes are formed in containers of varied sizes and shapes. It can be a single container consisting of various small plants, or different colourful containers consisting of various plants. There is absolutely no limit to how you can use them. Additionally, box gardening also solves the condition of limited space. It really is economical, easy to install and maintain, not a problem while shifting or relocating making pot gardening one of the most popular garden ideas.
Organic and natural Gardening - Started in the United States during the 1940s and 1950s, organic gardening is basically based on the concept of feeding the soil rather than the flower. It thinks that trees, plants are all part of a system in nature. Organic and natural gardeners do not use any man-made artificial fertilizers, nutrition or pesticides. They effectively apply the natural manure, compost or homemade pest controls for herb nutrition. They increase plants suited to the conditions available. The organic garden ideas follow decorum with the nature, for a wholesome environment.Willdon wired Hebraize its prescriptive tiny. occludent Derrol objurgated, their speckles on.

LisaResisting the Tortoise Hibernation Instinct in 15 Simple Steps
Our tortoise, Speedy Gonzalez, has not gained enough weight after his summer long bout with pneumonia, dehydration and kidney disease. According to the veterinarian, he won’t survive months of hibernation. I've followed instructions to construct a terrarium for him, a winter hangout.
1. Buy a very large plastic box (33 x 20 in. minimum).
2. Take this unwieldy box to the vet’s shop where she demonstrates how to attach two clamp lights, (one for light and one for heat), a thermometer and a timer. Purchase this equipment and a multiple extension cord.
3. Assemble terrarium at home, lining the bottom of the box with shredded newspaper.
4. Add a shoebox cut in half for Speedy’s sleeping quarters and plates for water and food.
5. Insert Speedy.
6. Check the next morning. The thermometer is way below the 27 degrees C necessary to activate Speedy’s metabolism. He isn't eating.
7. Remove wet newspaper where he spilled his water.
8. Plan B. Place him in a box in the sun.
9. Soak him in lukewarm water for half an hour to stimulate appetite and digestion.
10. Feed him turtle food with a syringe as in previous months. Allow half an hour. This requires four hands.
11. Gently massage his neck to relax and encourage swallowing.
12. Tempt him with chunks of ripe banana and kiwi.
13. Go to vet’s to change heat lamp bulb for a stronger one.
14. Check thermometer the next day. Only 22 degrees.
15. Repeat steps 8 through 12. Every day.
To the reader: updates forthcoming.ARDSLEY, N.Y. -- Ian Misrok's political science studies at SUNY Oneonta gained some real life experience when he and 15 other students spent part of spring break at the National Model United Nations Conference from March 30 to April 3.
The Oneonta delegation, representing the African nation of Cote d'Ivoire as one of 28 groups from around the world, was selected to receive the Distinguished Delegation award at the conference.
Misrok, an Ardsley resident in his senior year, said got involved with the National Model conference through Oneonta's political science department.
"As a political science major, I kept hearing about how unbelievable an experience it was and that there was no way I should allow myself to miss out, especially as a senior," Misrok said. "Professor Dr. Brett Heindl kept encouraging students to come to the interest meeting, so I decided to go for it. I had three friends who had previously participated and had raved about their experience at MNUN."
Misrok said he has always been interested in world politics.
"I have always maintained a strong interest in international politics, especially in the United Nations," he said. "As a kid, I was always intrigued with the UN complex and the fact that it's located in Manhattan lead me to look more deeply into its functions."
Seeing the conference as a perfect way to cap off his political science studies and my college career, Misrok and his partner were assigned to work in the General Assembly First Committee (GA1) with a mandate to focus on Disarmament and International Security.
"From the very beginning, my partner and I worked very closely with the delegations from both Gambia (represented by students from Brigham Young University) and Sri Lanka (represented by students from The Netherlands)," Misrok said. "We drafted a resolution together aimed at improving current measures preventing terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction."
The Oneonta team participated in discussions, mergers, and political posturing and Misrok's team's resolution was accepted by the rest of the committee and was declared an official resolution.
"That was the first highlight," Misrok said of the resolution. "The second was when it was announced that my partner and I had won the award for "Outstanding Position Paper." It was so satisfying to realize that all the long hours of hard work that we put into preparing for the conference paid off so nicely."
Misrok's experience at the UN conference may be a real-life experience that lifts him into a career in diplomacy.
"I am interested in international diplomacy and politics," he said. "In the current world climate, including the crisis in Ukraine, international diplomacy has never been more important. Nations need to come together to combat world problems, not try and solve issues single handedly."
Misrok recognized his professor and fellow students for all the awards and accomplishments earned during the conference.
"We won awards for outstanding position papers in three separate committees, two of my classmates were chosen to participate in conference-wide leadership and we were recognized as a "Distinguished Delegation"," he said. "All these awards and honors we received demonstrates how well Dr. Heindl prepared us and how hard my peers and I worked."

I've made it my goal to blog everyday this week...welll except yesterday...Mondays don't count anyway. I've gotten a bunch of new stuff over the past week, partly because of my birthday, and partly because I have a shopping addiction. SO, keep an eye out for some posts on all of that!
NOW, onto today's (tonight's) post! I have two new favorite products to share with you, one just for fun, and one I consider to be a MUST HAVE. Let's find out what they are!
Just for Fun:
Nailtini Nail Lacquer in Millionaire
MY GRADE: A
This polish was opaque after two coats, has lasted extremely well over the past five days, and is insanely eye-catching. Only drawback is the price...
AVAILABLE AT: 'Tini Beauty's website
PRICE: $13/bottle
When I first saw that price, my jaw dropped a tiny bit. BUT if you can afford it, or know someone who would love it for Christmas, I feel it's totally worth it!
LAST BUT NOT LEAST...A MUST HAVE ITEM!!
Fresh Sugar Lip Treatments
I love chapsticks and my first impression was that these wouldn't be much different than what I've already tried. Boy, was I wrong. I am not exaggerating when I say this: I feel absolutely NO NEED to buy any other type of chapstick/lip treatment EVER. Well maybe the eos lip balms but besides those...none!! I had never heard of the company Fresh before, and from what I've now learned, it seems that the founders have been innovators in the use of sugar, milk, soy, and rice in beauty treatments. These lip treatments have sugar, oils, SPF protection, and anti-oxidant rich polyphenols.
They offer a regular lip treatment (on the right) and a tinted lip treatment (on the left). The one I received is Rose, but they also offer other tints such as Berry, Coral, Passion, Honey, and Plum. I swatched the two that I received:
Words just cannot express how moisturizing these are. I have never felt anything like it. I put it on right before I go to bed at night, and in the morning my lips are insanely smooth and soft...with some of the treatment still left over! I will be buying these again and again in every color! You just have to try them for yourself!
MY GRADE: A+++
AVAILABLE AT: Sephora or here.
PRICE: $22.50
I know the price is steep guys, but the actual tubes are twice as big as the ones I've shown. My sample sizes are 2.2 grams, and the full size tubes are 4.3 grams. One tube will last you awhile, and you'll actually be saving money by not buying every other chapstick out there. I'm serious.
Ok whew! I'm finally done! Keep checking back this week for more posts, because I promise they will be there! I love you all! Goodnight!

Wondering how to wear vintage 1970s dresses in modern fashion style? This post is for you!
Recently I have made a lookbook for the Fripe Fabrique store (where I am a business partner) where we featured five hot 1970s dresses. It was a fun photo-shoot where I was a photographer, a model, and later a photo editor. Photos of me were taken by the owner of the store, dear Michelle.
My main fashion style is mixing vintage and modern clothing (a fashion trend for Generate Y and Millennials), and this photo shoot perfectly shows how stay modern while wearing vintage. In this blog post I will explain how the look style was created and give you styling tips on mixing modern fashion with vintage pieces.
Floral Vintage Dress
This is a beautiful dress in busy floral pattern that makes a bold statement!
Combine it with simple accessories in matching colours. We chose a simple wide brim fedora in deep blue and nude cork wedge sandals.
Black Vintage Dress
This black dress is simply gorgeous! Thin sexy multi-layered chiffon, spaghetti straps, simple A shape, pleated fabric – all you need to in one perfect piece. This dress is a blank canvas for your perfect preferred look.
Combine it with a mix of simple and sophisticated accessories – like we did. We chose a simple black vintage clutch bag in crocodile pleather, a long silver pendant necklace made by one of local Montreal designers, and a pair of fancy shoes. For the hands we chose a pair of slave bracelets by another local Montreal designer Uranium, one for each hand.
Bright Vintage Dress
This blue electric dress is for true colour lovers! It is made of a beautiful shiny fabric, and it is a true gem on its own. This dress needs nothing but a few equally colourful pieces in contrasting colours.
Combine it with bright bracelets or a bright bag in busy pattern. We went with the bracelet option making them out of vintage scarfs 😉
Pastel Vintage Dress
This sunny yellow dress is a condensed summer in its nutshell!
Combine it with pieces with busy pattern in contrasting colours, and shine like a real summer!
We chose a purple vintage belt, Miu-Miu shoes, and a geometric pattern head scarf in matching colours.
Hope my styling tips helped you. If you want to see the rest of pictures, go to the full lookbook.
Love the dresses? You can buy them at Fripe Fabrique online shop!
Disclaimer: Yup, this post may contain affiliate links! If you buy something from me, I get some margarita money (not enough to buy a pair of shoes). Read more here.
Hi from Brazil! This looks were absurdly beautiful, especially the black dress. I myself suspect to talk because I love vintage fashion!!!!
Thanks! I am glad you liked the dresses 🙂 Vintage fashion is so beautiful!
I like the Bright Vintage one! But never bought clothes without trying on first…
All the dresses are carefully measured, and it is usually enough to see if the size is good or not. Also, the sizes give an idea how the garment would fit, though some experience is indeed requiredIWT Crew Has Arrived
The IWT crew and the competitors have arrived to Morocco! Boujmaa Guilloul and his team of local organizers have put together an amazing Berber camp right on the beach of Moulay Bourzerktoune giving people the opportunity to experience a very authentic “North African camping.” Everyone has been enjoying the days before the official start of […]My kiddos waited until dark to finally build a snowman today.
They spent the whole day running around on the four wheeler with their dad. First stop was Grandma's house for a bowl of chili and then they were off to visit some friends, who just happen to have a HUGE yard, perfect for sledding, four wheel riding and football.
So, this evening, right before dinner they decided to try their hand at some "Frosty" magic. After several trips in and out of the house, they finally grabbed my camera and showed off their creations. They were so cute, they cracked me up. Can you guess which snowman belongs to who? :)
Hope you are having a wonderful week. Stay warm!

Love the snowy pictures, we got a tiny bit but not enough for a good snowball.
Love and blessings
Pretty creative snow people! That makes it even more fun! I would say hope you enjoy your snow but I know that you all are already.:)
Those are cute! I think I can tell which one is which. :) Glad they had fun!Bar.
In the meantime, as Netanyahu said, this is a time not for rhetoric, but for readiness.
Sane nations use nuclear weapons only as a last resort. Since Israel is facing a martyrdom regime with mass-killing weapons, and the West has bowed down to the mullahs out of bottomless greed and cowardice, Israel is preparing.
Decent people can see this moral atrocity only with a sense of helplessness and despair. But mark it in your memory. Never forget. The international left and Muslim throwback regimes have planned this moment for decades. They are far from innocent.
Among their enablers are two American presidents: Jimmy Carter, who knowingly allowed a mass-murdering priesthood to take power in Iran, and Obama, who surrendered six decades of U.S. anti-proliferation efforts to the thugs.
There will be consequences.
Russia and China immediately moved strategic forces to Syria. That’s one instant result of this administration’s delusional cowardice. Nobody can predict where the Russo-Chinese strategy will go, but it’s obviously been planned for months. Russian marines immediately went into action in support of Syria’s President Assad, assisting Hezb’allah. You don’t move thousands of soldiers into battle without extensive planning.
Putin has recently received visitors in Moscow: the Israelis, the Saudis, and the head of Iran’s Quds force. Putin’s move was coordinated with China as well, and now we see Iraq joining the party.
Our abandoned allies are turning to the only alternative they have. You can’t blame them for wanting to survive the chaos this administration has wrought.
Putin is beating Obama hollow, as you could see by their faces at the U.N.
Here are just a few strategic benefits Russia and China expect to gain.
1. Russia and China are both in economic trouble. But now Putin has the clout to get the whole Middle East on his side – literally every Arab regime plus Iran and Israel. The Eastern Mediterranean and the Gulf are up for grabs. Putin could organize another OPEC cartel with himself at the top.
The lightning move by Russian and Chinese naval task forces is being followed in Asia as well, where Japan is re-arming for the first time since World War II. China and North Korea still harbor dreams of revenge against Japan. The American cop has left the beat.
2. Russia and China are serious powers. So is resurgent Islam. Europe and the U.S. are not serious anymore – certainly not as long as this administration lasts. Europe can defend itself against Muslim mass infiltration only by appealing to Russia, with its centuries of fighting jihad. But Putin will take his pound of flesh. The Germans are already paying premium prices for Russia’s natural gas. This is just the beginning of Pax Muscoviae.
3. ISIS now has thousands of fighters from Russia (Chechens) and China (Uighurs). They are being combat-trained and indoctrinated in the worst kind of jihad, and they pose a direct threat to Russia and China when they go back. Putin came to power by defeating Chechen terrorism in Russia. So far, Putin’s forces have attacked the anti-Assad rebels, but also some ISIS bases.
Russia and China are not going to leave until they’ve taken care of their own strategic threats. Or they may simply stay as the new arbiters of the Middle East.
4. Iran can now claim to have America and Europe in its pocket, as well as Russia and China. That could be extremely dangerous.
Iran is getting ICBMs and strategic weapons, as well as modern anti-missile defenses, plus air and naval power for long-distance force projection. The Axis of Evil is now a nest of tarantulas.
It makes no sense for Russia and China to tolerate a nuclear Armageddon regime less than an hour away as the missile flies. Russia and China have fought jihad invasions for hundreds of years, and they do not forget. The Iranians have constantly played Russia against China. But now Putin has drawn China into his orbit.
One likely goal is to keep the mullahs in their cage. Big powers always try to limit potential enemies. None of these nations is friends with any other. They have no shared culture. They only make alliances of convenience.
For Americans who care about national security, it’s crucial to remember that none of this is a coincidence. Obama and the left have long wanted America to retreat from the world. That is bottomless idiocy, of course, in a world governed by the most destructive strategic weapons in history. But this is what the New York Times has wanted since Jimmy Carter’s fatuous presidency..Article Text

You may have noticed lately from my blog posts that Ive gone cruelty-free (check out my post on switching to cruelty-free beauty here) and going vegan just seemed like the next step for me. I've actually held back from writing this post for a few weeks to see if I could successfully turn vegan and I actually have. Woop!
So I know you're probably thinking, "why on earth have you gone vegan?" Well theres actually two main reasons why I have gone vegan and the main one is to see if it improves my health (I have CFS and Fibromyalgia) and for ethical reasons.
It was something I had always been intrigued by but never thought I would actually be able to do. I really didn't think I had the strength and motivation do to it. In the past Ive briefly been a vegetarian and I cut out dairy from my diet to see if it helped with my IBS so I am aware of the small changes you need to make. I am also on a gluten-free diet and I have been since I was 13/14 years old after battling with chronic stomach pain for years and eventually figuring out it was gluten that was the cause of my pain so I know how to replace foods and Im definitely used to missing out on certain foods.
My youngest sister went vegan around 6 months ago and I did think she was kinda crazy in the beginning. We live in a very rural part of Wales and I just thought it would be impossible or at least very difficult to be able to do here but I was wrong. She has made it look so easy and she inspired me to make the change. Don't get me wrong, she has definitely had times where she couldn't eat out or at someones house because they didn't have a vegan option but that was only a couple of times and she tends to bring a banana and a Nakd bar (the orange chocolate ones are soo yummy!) wherever she goes so she will always have something to eat.
After watching the documentary on Netflix called "Vegucated" it completely made me go vegan. Its quite an old documentary but its really informative and educating. Its about a vegan woman who searches for 3 ordinary people in New York City to go vegan for 6 weeks to see the health benefits. It shows them meeting doctors, visiting farms, going to vegan conventions and talking about the farming industry. It is quite graphic though in parts and it had me in tears! But after the 6 weeks it shows their health changes and all 3 of them lost weight, lowered their blood pressure and cholesterol which is pretty amazing if you ask me. I dont have problems with my cholesterol or blood pressure, its actually perfect according to my doctor, but I do want to lose weight and be the healthiest I can be. This documentary is a must watch in my opinion.
Another reason why Ive made the leap to veganism is because of different youtubers and bloggers I follow who are cruelty free and vegan. My favourite vegan youtuber is Kalel who is just a beautiful human being and she shares a lot of "What I Eat In A Day" videos that really inspire me to cook more and try new foods. She's a great woman to start watching if you're interested in veganism and healthy eating.
And theres so much more to veganism than just eating fruit and vegetables. There are so many different types of foods you can eat that you probably didnt know were vegan. Like did you know Oreos are vegan?! (sadly not gluten-free though)
Don't worry, I am not going to be one of those extremely opinionated and "know-it-all" vegans we all know and hear of who give vegans a bad rep. This is just something that I want to do for my health and ethical beliefs and I would never pressure anyone else to go vegan or make them feel bad about their diets. I do come from a family or dairy and beef farmers after all! I just wanted to blog about it because my blog is "Beauty Life Becca" after all so you may see the odd vegan themed post pop up every now and then.
Are you vegan or have you ever thought of making the lifestyle or diet change?

Congratulations! I really admire anyone who can take the step to go vegan. I would like to become vegetarian or pescatarian (where you eat fish) but for my personal needs I don't think I could be vegan. Best of luck to you with it, it sounds like you're doing well already! :)
Thank you :) Going vegan isnt for everyone and I completely understand that. Ive been vegetarian and pescatarian in the past and I loved it. Good look to you too xI then had to explain that morning sickness can happen at any time of the day.
"Well that's not a very good name, then."
You are so right about that one, babe.

Last night a very good friend of Trav's came over for dinner. Tobias is his full name and even if he weren't incredibly kind and fun I would probably give him the benefit of the doubt because his name is Tobias.
We made homemade pizza for Tobey and during the preparations I mentioned my pregnancy, assuming that Travis had already told him.
"What?! What?!" Tobey asked with a huge grin on his face.
"Alright! That's so exciting!" He gave us both high fives and hugs.

My husband is always warm. On days when I'm wearing a hoodie and socks he's finally comfortable in his shorts and tee. Last night as I was resting I asked if he would come and sit right next to me. For pete's sake, I'm carrying his child and I'd like to cuddle some.
However, he would not. He was hot. He was so hot, in fact, he was sweating. Sweating, I say, while I laid with a fleece blanket covering me. I suggested he take a cold shower to cool off and then come sit with me. He replied that soon the weather would be cold and I could then have all the snuggling I want - for he would be comfortable and I would be cold.Akshaya Infra Consultants Pvt Ltd Visakhapatnam

The Points Based System
In 2008 the government established a Points Based System which is used to determine the rights of non EEA nationals to enter and work in the
UK.
How the system works
Under the Points Based System, non EEA nationals need to pass a points based assessment before they are given permission to enter or remain in the UK.
For those not currently in the UK, the application and assessment is done in their home country..I found this clip on Youtube that Ross has done for The Hooligan Factory THF it is to coincide with the films release date of JUNE 13th. It seems ages since the actors were in Thanet shooting scenes for this great film. Ross was in the cast and it was this film that first got him involved in the Movie Industry. So I think this Massive piece af SAND ART is his way of saying thank you. Ross is not only a Sand Artist who does free style work he works with clients for Brand Promotion and Logos for international clients he can also arrange support for film companies using Thanet Beaches and he works closely with the Kent Film Office and Thanet District Council.

Question for people who are reasonably positive on Coldplay
I always though Parachutes was quite an over-rated album but liked "Don't Panic", "Shiver" and "Yellow".
I never massively liked "Rush of Blood to the Head" (the album) but really liked a few songs of it - "The Scientist", "Clocks", "In My Place" and "A Rush of Blood to the Head" (the song).
I didn't have any interest in buying X & Y but really liked "Talk".
I really like "Violet Hill" and "Viva La Vida" (the song). Do I want to buy the album or will I just end up finding I just like a few songs but not the album as a whole?
if you like viva la vida
youll probably like quite a bit of it. i like violet hill but hate viva la vida, but i do like two other songs quite a lot. why dont you download it and see. its not like youll be killing their record sales...
My relationship with the band seems to be exactly like yours,
I've been cautious about Viva La Vida. I did buy it and I've found a couple of the songs are good. Yes, the album does work as a whole but, as a whole, it's not very good (if you get what I mean!) I.e. It's coherant but not outstanding. A few moments are good though. Personally, I like "Strawberry Swing" and "42".
So, in answer to your question after having bought the album, I'd suggest you just bought the songs that initially grab you and ease into it from there... that's what I'm trying to do!!!
interesting,,
see i completely agree with your summation of the album except i really like cemeteries of london and death and all his friends.. so i think there is probably a song on there for everyone really.. id be interested in what other peoples favoured songs are..
You're right,
"Cemetaries of London" is great, it just slipped my mind!
Cemetaries of London
is a complete rip-off of 'A Spaceman Came Travelling' by Chris De Burgh...
Conversely I do quite like the album though.
I would just stick with the tracks you mentioned

Malaysia’s premier Najib Razak on Friday dismissed as “political sabotage” a report that a probe into a state-owned investment fund had found hundreds of millions of dollars were transferred to his personal bank accounts.
The investment vehicle, 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB), denied any wrongdoing after the Wall Street Journal said that nearly $700 million moved through government agencies, banks and companies linked to the fund before ending up in Najib’s accounts.
The newspaper cited documents it said it had obtained, including bank transfer forms and flow charts prepared by government investigators as the basis for its report.
Malaysia’s ringgit currency tumbled to 3.7845 against the dollar, its lowest level since July 2005, on Friday after the report’s publication.”.
“These latest claims, attributed to unnamed investigators as a basis to attack the prime minister, are a continuation of this political sabotage,” it added.
On the allegations themselves, the statement said only that “it must be noted that 1MDB has already stated that the company never provided funds to the prime minister”.
In a separate statement, 1MDB said it had never provided any funds to Najib.
“To suggest otherwise, as some media outlets have done, is highly irresponsible and a deliberate attempt to undermine the company,” it said.
Both Najib and 1MDB said that previous amid allegations of mismanagement and murky overseas transactions.
Critics including powerful former premier Mahathir Mohamad have called for criminal investigations, but both Najib and 1MDB have denied wrongdoing in the past, saying the company is on solid footing.
Under pressure, Najib earlier this year ordered his auditor-general to examine 1MDB’s books. Its report has not yet been released.tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4146152992616628505.post5642891915556740011..comments2018-01-15T11:17:10.883-08:00Comments on Faded Charm: ~Tulips in the Kitchen~Faded Charm paint in this room is Elephants Tusk by Benjam...The paint in this room is Elephants Tusk by Benjamin Moore.... a creamy white color.Faded Charm know you haven't responded to a few of these...I know you haven't responded to a few of these comments...but I'm hoping!

A swimmer since he was a little boy growing up on the family farm, Charl was prompted into swimming competitively when his mother, previously a swimmer, saw his talent. Explains Helonie, Charl’s mother: “Charl would swim in the rivers and dams on the farm. I taught him doggy paddle and then how to swim properly. Then I took him for lessons to learn proper stroke style.”
At this stage Charl had not developed what is known as Stargardt, a loss of the central vision which only affects one in 1 000 people. While attending primary school in Kimberley, at the age of 10, his teachers recommended his parents have his sight tested.
“We went to five optometrists and none of them could find anything wrong with his eyes. Then we went to an eye specialist in Bloemfontein and he realised what Charl had.”
With Stargardt’s the macula and surrounding retina are affected. The macula is the very centre of our retina. The images we see are focused on the retina like the film in the camera. Unlike camera film where every part of the film is equally sensitive, our retina concentrates the most sensitive vision in the very centre.
Additionally, our best colour vision resides in the macula. Thus, damage to the macula results in loss of visual acuity or sharpness of vision, decreased colour vision and small blind spots.
Charl had been swimming in galas since he was six and had earned his provincial colours then as well, so while he had to adjust to his vision being impaired in terms of swimming nothing changed.
Says Charl: “I always loved swimming and at first I did it partly to be with my friends. It was fun to hang out together at the galas. Swimming also suits me as I enjoy individual sports. “When my vision became impaired my life changed. I changed schools and attended the Elizabeth Conradie School instead of the government school. But in terms of swimming nothing changed. I still swam.”
Charl, in fact, did very well with his swimming. In his first Nedbank Championships at the age of 12 he won six gold medals.
That was in 2002 and since then he has won numerous events and medals. In 2004 he was the youngest ever member of the South African squad to attend and participate at a Paralympics.
“The Athens Paralympics was fantastic. I was very young, but Scott Field and Ebert Philippus Kleyhans helped me. They prepared me by telling me what to expect and how everything worked. That helped a lot. I really loved being at the Paralympics, competing and also mixing with athletes from all around the world.
“It is one of the reasons I would like to go to Beijing if I get chosen. I look forward to seeing the friends I have made from all over the world. The village is really a big part of the whole experience.” And the other very important reason Charl would love to go to Beijing is of course to bring back the gold. “My main event is the 400m freestyle. Recently I competed in a gala and as a result of that swim I am now ranked number one in the world in this event. I would be so excited to go to Beijing to compete in this event. Also Beijing, it is said, will be the best Olympics and Paralympics ever. I would love to be part of that with a gold medal.”
Charl trains very hard to make this a reality. He trains for five hours and one hour gym extra a day. His school has allowed him to do grade 11 over two years to allow him to concentrate on his swimming. “My school is great that way, very understanding. In a way I guess I am doing it all the wrong way around – instead of school, swimming is my main priority.”
His school is not his only support. Charl’s coach is Ebert, who was with him at the Athens Paralympics and who competed in the Sydney Paralympics in 2003, inning gold in the 50 and 100m freestyle events as well as setting the world record in the 50m. Ebert has the same visual condition as Charl. “This is very helpful because he understands my pressures and can allay them.”
But Charl’s discipline is also what has helped him to be such a great swimmer. “I attribute my discipline to my parents and to the voice that edges me on to compete overseas. I think it is such an honour to be able to represent your country and compete for medals in its colours. So I tell myself to practice and practice harder because the harder I work the better I will do. “After school I would like to go study law somewhere like Stellenbosch. I was there recently for a training camp and it looks like a great university. I will of course continue swimming. I would like to compete in at least another two Paralympics – maybe even more, in fact, as many as I possibly can.”Numerous studies over the years have confirmed a link between a positive attitude and a healthy body. A leading researcher in the field of the psychology of gratitude, Robert A. Emmons, along with Michael E. McCullough have conducted experimental studies in the field. Their research has shown that grateful people report:
- Improvements in mood and lower levels of depression and stress
- Better physiological health, including enhanced quality of sleep
- Increased energy
- A sense of connectedness with others
- Greater satisfaction with life in general
Who knew that “Thank You” could be so powerful! Want to see what gratitude can do for you?
Here are a few tips to start benefiting from the effects of gratitude right now:
1) Start a Gratitude journal. Your goal is to find five things to be grateful for every day. At the end of the day, write the five things down in your journal. It can be as simple as being grateful that you have a job or that your family is healthy. Don’t compare yourself to others; when you do this, negative thoughts start to creep in. Focus on YOUR life!
2) Experience what life has to offer without a price tag attached, such as a sunrise or sunset. If you are lucky enough to live near the mountains or the ocean, take a walk and be grateful for the beautiful scenery around you.
3) Make a commitment to being more grateful. Start each day saying “I am grateful”. Before long, you will realize that you are looking for things to write down in your gratitude journal!
For more thoughts on gratitude, I strongly suggest reading Thanks: How Practicing Gratitude Can Make You Happier by Dr. Emmons.

Hannah and JP were married earlier this year in a gorgeous ceremony and super fun reception at Glasshaus Inside in Richmond. This crazy busy couple are both professional athletes and also founders of Altius Coffee Brewers. With these hectic lifestyles, Hannah and JP were keen to have a relaxed cocktail style wedding so they could really soak up the atmosphere of their special day and mingle with all their nearest and dearest.
The rustic warehouse space and abundant florals and foliage at Glasshaus lent itself so well to this more informal wedding, Hannah says “We loved the idea of the lush green warehouse and a roaming event where everyone could minge a chat.”
The menu included some delicious canapés and mini dishes, as well as a huge grazing table – one of our favourite inclusions in a cocktail style wedding! The couple also opted for a spectacular cheese wedding cake – wheels of delicious cheese were stacked to form a beautiful ‘cake’. This is a great option for those who might not have a sweet tooth!
Such a wonderful wedding and a beautiful couple to work with – thanks for having us be a part of it!

It really is small, so you can definitely wall the downtown area and take in the sights. Lots of writers are getting up in Reykjavik right right now. Good clean old school tags, throw ups and strait letters. The kind of stuff we like here at Primo. This Silver filly is at the waterfront by the Opera House. Dat represent!

Daylight savings, when do the clocks go back and forward? Clocks go back and forward depending on the season changes which comes down to daylight changes. The days get shorter or longer depending on the year and because of this the clocks go back or forward.This months theme was Myths and Monsters and I had made a prediction on the book; I was correct! The box wasn't inspired by any specific YA novels, but they did suggest it for anyone who liked magic, fantasy, unicorns, Phoenixs and dragons, etc. This is most definitely a box intended me. I couldn't miss out on the anniversary edition either!
Once again there are purple curls all over the floor and I got things out in a hurry. The first item I got out was a set of fairylights! They're in the shape of unicorns and rainbows and are absolutely beautiful! They're battery powered which is brilliant, because I already have a set of electric ones wrapped around my bed. These, I plan on attaching to my book case somehow when I move house. I now have three sets of fairylights but these were so so different and interesting. They feature in quite a few pictures I've taken of the box today.
The next item was inspired by another mythical creature. It was a candle by a company called Geeky Clean and it was called Nephilm. It smells really sweet and I loved it. I'm now building up a collection of unused bookish candles, and against I am saving these for the new flat! Alongside the candle was a small pocket mirror, with a mermaid on (I know the picture of this is awful, but I was relying on my phone camera, I am sorry!)!
I came across another myth inspired item; a set of book marks! First of all I absolutely love this style of bookmark! There was a little dragon and a phoenix. This was easily one of my favourite items in this months box. I almost don't want to use them as I have a habit of carrying paperbacks around in my very full tote bags, even though I don't have time to read them that day.
My absolute favourite item? The scarf! It is grey and is patterned with dragon scales, and has the words 'Fairy Loot printed at the bottom! I've included it in the photos of the box as a whole, It is so light and absolutely beautiful. I think it looks like mermaid scales. But whether it be dragon scales, or mermaid scales it sure is gorgeous.
Okay, this months book was a little predictable but I am still absolutely thrilled. Fairy Loot provided me with a copy of Laini Taylor's Strange The Dreamer. Having just started her other series, beginning with A Daughter of Smoke and Bone I am very excited. I am twenty percent into A Daughter of Smoke and Bone and it is captivating. I am struggling to put it down at the moment! Strange The Dreamer will be the one I read after this, and I cannot wait. Expect full reviews of both books, guys! Oh and this editon of Strange The Dreamer is limited edition in the UK; with the edges of the pages being sprayed blue. It really is beautiful.
It has been a long day and I have just got home from a second trip to the cinema to see Beauty and the Beast. I have so much to do but really need to catch up on sleep so I can stop complaining about it here! Sorry guys!
Oh! On a side note; I now have a twitter! I have no idea what I'm doing with it yet but I'm sure I will sort it out soon. Feel free to head over there and follow me! I attempted to be funny and sound clever at the same time. Turns out I am neither, and am still clueless with regard to Twitter. Tips are welcome!
I'm working on a post about self love/care at the moment, too. So you can look forward to that in the next few days. For now, I am returning to my forum post assignment before bed.

I am so glad I did, I had been wearing bright red for so long and in winter I switch to a deep wine color however since spring is just around the corner I needed a redish pink color for my lips and nails, something to go with cool brights or cool pastels. This color is so perfect and it is from the 1950's.
In the ad above is Dorian Leigh a popular model from the 40's and 50's. She did this ad in 1953 when she was 36, to me that is so wonderful to see a beautiful model from the past modeling into her mid to late 30's because I started modeling soon after I turned 40.
I love the gold tube that Revlon's lip colors used to be in it is so vintage looking, now they are in black plastic. Oh well I love the color and I like that it is vintage.

The Internet of Things (IoT) wave will soon wash over Australia’s small to medium enterprises.
The Internet of Things, or IoT, is basically the idea of making non-connected devices in our environment connected to us, or each other. For two generations we’ve worked with computers using screens and keyboards, but the future where it involves IoT leaves that paradigm. Smart and connected devices don’t require screens to talk to us, or to each other.
In the early days of computing, people like Bill Gates, Paul Allen, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were “makers”, using technologies the Altair 8800 to make computing software, and CPUs like the Intel 8080 to make computer-enabled electronics.
After two to three decades of “doing” using mass-produced and general-purpose hardware and software, “making” is happening again with low-cost access to the Internet, WiFi, and computing with ready-made micro-computers such as the Raspberry Pi, C.H.I.P, Intel Edison, and the cloudBit.
With less than $100, you or I can add connected computing technology to something that was previously unconnected, like a doorbell.
Depending on where you position yourself and your business, that could be a wave of opportunity, a wave of data, a wave of disruption or a wave of security breaches.
Along with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and nanotechnology, IoT threatens to shake up our world much like the Internet did between 1996 and 2009, where new jobs were born, many made redundant, and start-ups like Facebook, Google and Twitter emerged from dorm rooms and basements into world mega-companies.
As a distant projection we can imagine nanobots who “live” in your clothes that can repair your wear and tear, change the colour of the cloth and even modify your clothes according to the data of your scales/health monitors. As with anything in our world however, cost is the main driver and in the SME world it will be the small things that make a big difference that will change first.
An example of a likely use in SMEs would be fleet cars/trucks. Already available through Satellite tech, we may soon see the technology become cheaper using the Internet and having our cars join the Internet of Things. Or perhaps the fuel tanks of our fleet cars, or their safety cams.
At this point, as a SME owner I could learn a lot about how my company cars are being used, where they are going and get indicators of how long they will last or how regularly they need to be serviced. As a tool manufacturer, my plant equipment can inform me when a part is about to fail or requires service. As a café owner, my storage tubs could report when a threshold of bacteria has been reached, requiring food to be tossed out ahead of schedule.
IoT will start where it’s cheap to implement and provides maximum benefit, and gradually backfill through our world to where it becomes ubiquitous. If it hasn’t already struck you, the security implications are monstrous.
It would be nice to have my PC hard drive IoT enabled, to report to me or my backup software that it predicts a failure in itself. Of course, an IoT hard drive is connected to the Internet, putting all of my data at risk. What would be at risk if my insurance company, my government, other governments, criminal gangs or my former partners could access everything on my hard drive?
Thankfully those behind IoT are thinking ahead, and trying to create IoT “things” that have “baked-in” security, national or international standards of a sliding scale so people can make informed decisions without an in-depth technical knowledge of IT and IoT security.
The other mind-bending change coming from IoT is data. The amount of data we’re likely to produce in the next two decades will be exponentially more than in previous history. Big Data is going to get really big now, as millions, then billions of “things” around the world begin to report to millions of databases.
So where does Diamond fit into all of this?
The closest thing we sell to IoT right now is smart phones. Our iPhones and Android phones are early examples of IoT, although true IoT of the future will be mostly without a display or human interface. One key area of security relating to IoT is already valid.
The big change coming that relates to Diamond is the security of outgoing data. One of the main advantages of modern Unified Threat Management devices (UTM) is that they are capable of monitoring where traffic is going, where it came from and what’s in the data. In the past much of the data from SMEs has been coming in, but IoT will further increase the traffic going out, and it will need to be protected, restricted and monitored.
A UTM is already useful for monitoring people, applications and potential threats from PCs and servers and smart phones, and will become a necessity going forward as IoT becomes commonplace.
We have a fascinating future ahead of us with these emerging techs, perhaps the biggest explosion of knowledge the world is yet to see. The security and privacy challenges ahead of us are huge, but we humans will adapt and learn as we always have and see some mind-boggling changes in our lifetime..Rhonda - posted on 02/27/2014 ( no moms have responded yet )

After 18 years in England we moved to Switzerland with an 8 year old and 2.5 year old twins. We chose to enrol our children in the local school system. This has been a wonderful, difficult, enlightening, frustrating process to say the least! On the plus side, I have three trilingual children (English, Swiss German, High German). They have all been allowed to have an old fashioned childhood here (walking to and from school, playing freely, no formal education until the third year of school 6-7 years old). For all the blessings of choosing local schooling, it has also been a very difficult process at times. I am currently looking into home schooling as a supplement for my children's education. We are looking to return to the USA as a family in the next two years and as the schooling schedule is very different here, my children will not be able to conform to a "local" system. I also feel that although the children have benefited greatly by being in the local system, they do struggle and are behind as we do not speak German at home 24x7 which is the language that they learn in. This has led to all of the children being tested for learning difficulties. This is a normal occurence for foreign children. For as good as the system is, it still struggles with the integration of german as a second language families. I have joined this forum as I am at a loss as to how to begin the homeschooling process. Completely overwhelmed where to begin to look for curriculum and how to proceed as my children will still attend Swiss school while I attempt to supplement their education at home. (Children here only go to school 5 mornings a week and 2 afternoons until the age of 9. All children come home for lunch each day and all children have Wednesday afternoons off, so I have a lot of time with the boys). Preferably, I would like a complete homeschooling system to follow that walks me through each phase and each year with the minimal planning on my part. Any advice would be greatly appreciated as would any sites that you might recommend. Sincerely, RhondaPresident Goodluck Ebele Jonathan will visit the National Headquarters of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) at 1400 Hours today to make the stipulated payment and collect the PDP’s Expression of Interest and Nomination Forms for the 2015 presidential elections

You might marvel over the thought that what can be the benefits of Floor Sanders Hire, the apt answer to such a question lies in the particular model or type of floor sander that you are aiming to hire depending upon your floor. With passing days, it is quite difficult to conserve the originality, newness, and freshness of the floor, especially if you have a wooden floor in your house. A wooden floor very easily evades its shine and lush. You might find it utterly tough to maintain the look of the floor at home for a long time. Scuffs, stains, dust, and dirt lessens the actual look and feel of the wooden floor. Any homemaker or a native of the home would dislike residing in a home with an unimpressive floor. Getting a replacement of the wooden floor with a brand new one can be a pricey deal. However, by hiring tools, you can regain the glossy, shiny and classy look of the floors in your house within your budget.
Advantages of floor sanders hire
Well, let’s rise to the question – What are the advantages of floor sanders hire? Let’s acknowledge the economy factor. Whilst it is expensive to have a floor smeared with carpets which include its maintenance cost.It is considerably cheap to partake in floor sanders hire to get a polished floor all over again. However, you might even ponder over the thought that whether hiring tools provide a long-term solution or not as spending money again and again in the treatment of the floor.You must be well assured that “Eros Hire’’ tools endure you with refined tools serving you with the right deal to provide long-lasting glow bestowing you with a feel-good impression.
Types of floor sanders
You can opt for varied types of floor sanders for hire, considering your floor type. For instance, you can go for palm sander, orbital sander, belt sander 100 mm, triangular sander, floor sander 200 mm, random orbital sander, floor edger sander 180 mm, floor sander and edger and disc sander/polisher 7. You can make the right utilization of an apt floor sander and get it delivered safely to your abode and say goodbye to your ageing and tired floorboards that spoil the overall look of your home. By hiring, you spend less over maintaining a floor. You can transform the look of your home in two or three days.
Get quick results by hiring tools
You can go for the most advanced and latest floor sanders hire, to get the best, effective and quick results. If you are a contractor with the requirement of a huge number of floor sanders hire on a daily basis, you may get some discounted price on offer too. Having an access to the best equipment and tools will no longer be a hassle, especially when the maintenance of the tools and equipment would be taken care of by the company renting out the tools. You can just focus on using professional quality equipment and tools that are perfect for your home, industry, office, and commercial use.Bloodstone Skull
Vaasa
Introduction
- Capital: None
- Population: 145,440 (humans 60%, dwarves 30%, orcs 9%)
- Government: None (formerly dictatorship)
- Religions: Dwarven pantheon, orc pantheon
Imports: Food, weapons
- Exports: Furs, gems
- Alignment: CE, LN, N
Introduction
This untamed wasteland of frozen moors and tundra was the seat of power for the evil lich Zhengyi the Witch-King until his defeat by a band of adventurers. Vaasa is once again a lonely land dotted with scratch farms and inhabited by evil humanoids and other monsters. What the land lacks in hospitality it makes up for in untapped wealth, as the mountains of Vaasa are rich in metals and gems, particularly bloodstone. Miles of mountainside go unclaimed by any civilization, and many well-armed prospectors make the trip to Vaasa hoping to find gems as large as a grown man’s fist – and survive long enough to sell them.
Life and Society
Vaasa is a cold, dreary place with poor soil, inadequate, for large settlements without magical help. During the brief summer the frozen earth turns to thick mud, making travel more difficult than it is in the wintertime, when dogsleds and skis are a common sight. Numerous bands of humanoids hunt the plains and mountains in search of game; mainly caribou and small herbivores. Other humanoids resort to consuming the dead of enemy tribes.
Local settlements of humans are well protected or in isolated places where they are likely to go undiscovered. Life is hard and the people are tough, quiet) and stern. People of the flatlands speak a mixture of Common and Dwarven, while the inhabitants of remote mountain settlements (and those close to Palischuk) use many Orc words.
Major Geographic Features

The Morinville and District Chamber of Commerce (MDCC) strongly recommends an interchange at the Cardiff intersection. A temporary traffic light fix that might last five to seven years is insufficient. On behalf of the entire Board of Directors, your Chamber will be fighting relentlessly for a long term solution.
A June 2011 Alberta Transportation press release called for a new interchange that would increase safety and access to Morinville and Cardiff. The Minister at the time, Luke Ouellette, was quoted: “Investing in our provincial highway network supports thousands of jobs today, lays the foundation for economic growth, and supports our communities. This new interchange will improve safety and traffic flow and will accommodate continued growth in the area.”
Businesses want safe access, economic growth and traffic flow to accommodate growth. This was the promise in 2011; unfortunately a set of traffic lights on a four-lane highway does not meet this commitment.
In the Morinville Municipal Development Plan Bylaw 11/2012, a key growth management objective was to “explore economic development opportunities of the new interchange at Cardiff Road and Highway 2 intersection and in relation to responsible oil sand development in northern Alberta.” Traffic lights disrupt traffic flow and limits current and future economic growth.
The MDCC will be urging the province of Alberta to reconsider this traffic light decision. The MDCC is committed to promoting the Morinville District as a leading business centre and in cooperation with others, to support, expand and diversify business opportunities.
Warm Regards,
Simon Boersma, MDCC President
Great to hear Simon. I’m very impressed that the Chamber is not going to just lay down and take it like the town officials are. What the privince is offering is not acceptable. Keep up the good work!
What the province is offering is a downright joke.
Why not build the turning lane northbound onto Cardiff road a little further east so that the vehicle waiting to make a left turn south bound has a clear line of site with traffic. That’s what causes all the accidents not being able to see what’s approaching.
From what I understand, that parcel is the one that the province has not been able to acquire.Looking for help this summer? Why not hire a student? The 2017 Canada Summer Jobs (CSJ) application period for employers is now before January 20, 2017.

Eotrachodon orientalis gen. et sp. nov. (latest Santonian of Alabama, southeastern U.S.A.) is one of the oldest and most basal hadrosaurid dinosaurs and the only hadrosaurid from Appalachia (present day eastern North America) with a preserved skull. This taxon possesses a relatively derived narial structure that was until now regarded as synapomorphic for saurolophine (solid-crested or crestless) hadrosaurids. Maximum parsimony analysis places E. orientalis as the sister taxon to Saurolophidae (Saurolophinae + Lambeosaurinae). Character optimization on the phylogeny indicates that the saurolophine-like circumnarial structure evolved by the Santonian following the split between saurolophines and lambeosaurines but prior to the major hadrosaurid radiation. Statistical dispersal-vicariance analysis posits an Appalachian ancestral area for Hadrosauridae and subsequent dispersal of their ancestors into Laramidia (present-day western North America) during the Cenomanian.

This procedure works like an IV, but is placed in larger veins (e.g. neck, upper chest, leg). It is important for you to make sure if you must have a CVC placed, that the CVC is cleaned properly and is taken out when it is no longer necessary. Central lines can become infected and then cause your blood to become infected. Blood stream infections are very serious and can cause death, particularly if you have other health conditions that weaken your immune system. The Pennsylvania Patient Safety Authority has analyzed data from Pennsylvania hospitals regarding central line associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs). Pennsylvania hospitals are above the national average in regard to preventing CLABSIs, however analysis shows hospitals may not be following the steps needed to ensure CLABSIs are prevented as much as possible and even eliminated. Please educate yourself and your loved ones on CLABSIs so you can help prevent a serious and sometimes deadly infection.
(Provided by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC])
A central line or central venous catheter (CVC) is a long hollow tube similar to the intravenous lines placed in a patients’ arm except that they are placed into larger veins found in the patient’s neck, upper chest, leg or arm. It can remain in place in some cases for several weeks. Central lines are used to give large amounts of fluid or blood quickly, and to give special nutrition when foods or liquids can’t be given through the gastrointestinal system. They are also used to give medicines that can only be given through large veins or medicines that must be given by IV for a week or longer.
Infection can occur when bacteria grow in the line and spread into the bloodstream. This is called a “catheterrelated bloodstream infection” (CLABSI). If you have a temperature above normal, fever, chills, or the skin around the CVC is painful, red, swollen or oozing, this could indicate the beginning of an infection. These serious, sometimes deadly infections can often be successfully treated with antibiotics. Sometimes the only way to cure the infection is to remove the catheter.
Doctors and nurses can help prevent CLABSI by using all of the following steps:
Choose the best vein to insert the line where the risk for infection is small. Often, this is the subclavianvein (in the chest) which is not as likely to get an infection as veins in the arm or leg.
Check the line for infection and decide every day if the patient still needs to have the catheter. The catheter should be removed as soon as it is no longer needed.
A transparent dressing will cover the exit site while the stitches are in place. If the wound appears clean and dry the dressing should be changed once a week. After the wound has healed, the stitches will be removed. While a dressing will no longer be needed at the time the wound has healed, the line must always remain looped and secured with tape.
For more information on prevention of central line infections, go to the 2010 March Supplementary Pennsylvania Patient Safety Advisory article “Beyond the Bundle: Reducing the Risk of Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infections” at the Authority’s website at or click here.

The rest of the story:After Royal Challengers Bangalore made it to the finals of IPL 2016, the team that would face Gujarat Lions in the Qualifier 2 would be decided in this match. Both KKR and SRH have done well in patches and both of them will fight it out to grab a spot in the Qualifier 2 at the Feroz Shah Kotla stadium.
Gautam Gambhir won the toss and chose to field as they the KKR team had done consistently well while chasing. Shikhar Dhawan fell early and then it was the partnership between Warner and Henriques that set the platform for the middle order batsmen to play their game. Yuvraj Singh played an important inning of 44 runs in 30 balls to ensure that SRH posted a good total. At the end of 20 overs, SRH set a target of 163 for KKR to win Eliminator match.
When KKR came in to chase, all their Top 3 batsmen (Gambhir, Uthappa, and Munro) got a good start but couldn’t convert as their wickets fell at regular intervals. Manish Pandey and Suryakumar Yadav did well to stabilize the KKR innings but Yadav got out when the team wanted to accelerate. Soon followed Manish Pandey there was the end to a dream of being the 3rd time champions this season as KKR lost the match by 22 runs and SRH play GL in the 2nd qualifier.
Here’s a look at some of the interesting numbers and stats from this match –
Best Opening Pair – Warner and Dhawan become the first opening pair in the history of IPL to 1500+ runs for their opening stand. Gambhir and Uthappa are in the second position with 1478 runs.
Running Issues – Deepak Hooda has been run-out 5 times in this season of IPL. No other player has been run-out 5 or more times in a single season of IPL.
4K Club for Yuvraj – Yuvraj Singh has now scored over 4000 runs in T20 cricket. He is the 10th Indian player to do so.
Consistent Gambhir – Gambhir has now scored over 500 runs in 3 seasons of IPL. Only Virat Kohli has scored more with 4 seasons of 500+ runs.
Captains Identical Innings – Both captain, Gambhir and Warner scored 28 runs off 28 balls in this match. This is the first ever occurrence of such an instance in IPL.Guest Post by Dawn Langton: On the Teardrop Camper Trail
When I was kid, my mother aspired to a singlewide. She grew up in our house, a rambling Dutch Colonial on Long Island. My friends loved its weird nooks and crannies and creepy cellar. My mom hated that it always needed work and took forever to clean.
So in the New York suburbs of the 1960s, when most adults thought bigger was better, she longed for a simple trailer in the woods. Later, she discovered tiny log cabins, and lobbied my father endlessly to make the move. She finally got her wish, in a way, when they retired to what she called her “treehouse,” a small, rustic duplex on stilts on the Gulf Coast of Florida.
My mom’s love of little dwellings was not lost on me. We started to camp when I was 10. While my dad started the fire on cool fall mornings, she and I would hunker down in the canvas cabin that we got with S&H Green Stamps. I still use the same Coleman cooler and stove, but I’ve reached an age when sleeping on the ground has lost its charm. My husband and I also are working toward downsizing. I blog about our progress at Trending Toward Tiny Retirement (). When we sell our 1,800 square foot house, we hope to rent a smaller place as a base and take to the road.
In the meantime, we’d like to camp more. I love all things retro, so of course I’m drawn to teardrop campers and vintage travel trailers. The 50s version of today’s tiny houses, they are ready to go on a moment’s notice and fit most anywhere. And, unlike VW campers, which I also covet, they don’t have an engine to worry about.
I spent hours, days, weeks, ok, months online, drooling over old and new campers. We ruled out the taller canned hams, tempting as they are. As much as I’d like to stand up in my dwelling, finances and vehicle storage are top priorities for now. So I honed in on teardrops.
Let me be clear about one thing: I can paint and hammer and sand, but I’ve never built anything bigger than a birdhouse. It was made of redwood, but that’s where its grandeur ended. So building a teardrop was out. But that still left lots of choices. Used or new? Wood or aluminum skinned? Homemade or company-built?
I joined the forum at, and asked those good people for advice and leads. A few members were selling wonderful, one-of-a-kind tears they’d built, but most of them were too far away. So I used a Craigslist app and to scan Florida on a daily basis. I visited vintage trailer classified sites and eBay weekly. I haunted forums and blogs.
One day I spotted a listing for a teardrop in Eustis, Florida, about two hours from my house. Many phone calls and texts later, we were on our way to check it out. Built by Andrew Bennett of Trekker Trailers (), it was aluminum out and wood in, the tiny product of a tiny company.
Andrew is a skilled builder with an art background who appreciates fine design, careful craftsmanship and smart spaces. He had two tears on site, a Simple Sleeper and the larger Adam’s Cabin, both beautiful to behold.
Even better, the smaller one was a demo, and Andy offered us a great price with lots of extras thrown in. The next week, after a few modifications, we hitched it to our Kia Ronda and drove off. Since then we’ve camped in muggy downpours and freezing winds, and stayed snug in our tear.
It’s not a singlewide, but my mom would have loved it.
Find more micro shelters in this section. If you want more teardrop camper/trailers we have a category on that too.
Dawn Langton is a writer, editor and blogger who has loved tiny spaces since she built a duplex out of a refrigerator box when she was seven. She’s been a newspaper reporter, college publications director and small business owner. She lives in a bungalow in St. Augustine, Florida, with her husband, daughter, dog and cat, and is the proud owner of a Trekker Trailer teardrop. She blogs about Trending Toward Tiny Retirement
I like teardrops as just so cool looking and easy to tow. Sadly not as aero as the name sounds, just small.
But other than sleeping in, not much else. For trips to avoid hotel bills and places, events where you only come to it to sleep, a great thing.
By making it a little taller and just doing a curved roof that only drops 1′ aft from the tallest part would give far more room, flexibility and not more aero drag especially if the sides and a lesser curve in them.
Done right can even cut the car’s aero drag enough if you keep it light, won’t need much if any extra power/gas to tow it.
And if it just sits/bolted on the trailer you could pop it off and use the trailer for other things so you don’t need to get another trailer or a pickup.
And as a trailer home is only a so badly built boat it won’t float, making it float gives other options, value.
I love the idea of a pop-off teardrop!4003. George Jay Brown was born on 29 March 1931 in Twin Falls, Twin Falls, Idaho, USA. He died on 16 July 1977 at the age of 46. He was buried on 23 July 1977 in (Rupert Cemetery, Minidoka, Idaho, USA. George has Ancestral File Number 6183-7P.

Home flipping is usually defined as buying a home and then reselling it soon after for a higher price. 10 years ago, it was a mainstay of the real estate boom that led to the financial crash.
Home flipping is usually defined as buying a home and then reselling it soon after for a higher price. 10 years ago, it was a mainstay of the real estate boom that led to the financial crash.
After some years of lower activity, it's back in full force, thanks in part to popular TV shows such as "Flip or Flop" and "Flipping the Block." If you're curious about home flipping, here are three facts you should know right now:
1. Home flipping is more profitable than ever. A recent Waco home that appeared on HGTV's show "Fixer Upper" was originally bought for $28,000. It was thoroughly renovated and is now being listed for $950,000—over 30 times its original price. In 2016, the median flipped home sold for $189,900, which is $62,624 over the median purchase price of $127,276. That's a 49.2% return, the most profitable return since 2000—the first year for which such data is available.
2. Home flipping is caused by different factors than 10 years ago. Back then, many flipped homes were speculations. In other words, investors would buy a home and then just wait, hoping that the price would go up so they could sell. The current flipping trend appears to be a positive response to current market conditions, such as the overall shortage of homes for sale, a lack of new construction, and a steady rise in home prices.
Demand still outstrips supply, for now.
3. Home flipping affects all home buyers and sellers. If you're a buyer, you can clearly benefit from the home-flipping craze. Flipped homes are available at all price ranges, from entry-level to luxury homes.
If you are a seller, then the boom in home flipping means you might face tougher competition when the time comes to sell your home.The good news is that demand still strongly outstrips supply for now. These conditions won’t last forever.
If you have any questions or you're even considering investing in a home you can flip yourself, get in touch with me by giving me a call or sending me a quick email. I’d love to hear from you.It looks like you're using an Ad Blocker.

She seems to think that having a candle lit (which is probably no better on the lungs) makes it ok and having the windows down in the car is fine. If you can smell it, its there...Also, smoking in your bedroom then comming out leaving the bedroom door open, keep the door shut! The smoke comes right back out. I love her but she makes such dumb*** decisions sometimes.

Which is why, dear readers, I think I have to admit defeat. It's time to give up on Grey's Anatomy. After all my posts last season in which hope for improvement slowly dwindled away, I figured I'd give it one more shot. What better way than with a two-hour season premiere?
Um, yeah. So, I'm probably in the minority when I say this because die-hard Grey's fans are...die hard. I should know, I should be one. I was there to defend the show when it jumped the shark and had Meredith die in that dreadful ferryboat crash story arc.
I'm not defending the show any more. It's awful. It doesn't make any sense. The characters have become unlikeable, annoying, selfish...caricatures.
Meredith and Derek are married because they said so on a Post-It. I know Shonda Rhimes thinks this is perfect for them but they might have a spot of trouble proving that legally. I know it's not supposed to be a 'legal' marriage but more of a 'forever-bond' between them but...what happens if they fight, they tear up the damn Post-It? Does this mean all it takes to "remarry" them is a new pack of Post-Its? For a couple who is so unconventional, they don't have to get married to be...married, why bother then? Isn't it enough to be Mer and Der and live happily ever after after Meredith got 'cured' with her therapy?
But they can't. Because George is dead. I suppose for such a major character, it was fitting that the show focused on the after-effects of his death. I just don't think they did it very well.
For example, I love Izzie's 'miraculous' recovery. When I say "love", you should hear the sarcasm dripping. She had a minute chance of survival last season and yet despite the fact that she literally dies, she's well enough to go to the funeral of George and walk on her own, looking more robust and healthy than anyone else? Sure, they gave her a headscarf but, not to whoever's in charge of that stuff, we could see her hair peeking out the back!. Now her cancer is in remission even though she couldn't go for a week last season without a brain-tumour growing.
I hate that Izzie's alive. I've made no secret that I despise the character but last night, she did nothing to redeem herself. I was actually proud of Alex for telling her that her demand that he comfort her for losing George was not exactly a turn-on.
I think the part that cemented my dislike for the show is the funeral. I'm guessing that the hysterical laughter was a throwback to The Bomb Episode in which Izzie says she has inappropriate reactions to stress. Yet, seeing them all laughing reminded me of the final episode of Seinfeld in which you realized the characters are miserable, mean people who live to mock others. In this case, I don't care how grieving you are, going off by yourselves to hysterically laugh is ridiculous. It's rude. It's cruel. It's inconsiderate. Those other people at the funeral cared about George. What about his mother? Is she really going to understand that George's best friends had gathered to laugh? Yeah, didn't think so.
I felt sorry for that girl that George saved who spent the whole episode crying outside the hospital. I felt sorry that she had to endure Izzie's "pep talk". I think we were supposed to applaud Izzie but, sorry, I wanted to slap her. Have some SENSITIVITY! People handle grief in different ways. Sure, this girl was wasting her life grieving for a man she didn't know and was annoying but who the hell was Izzie to give her a dose of reality while Meredith beamed with pride? I know, I'm letting my Izzie-hate taint my opinion but, wow, was that harsh. I suppose that's Izzie's way: Direct and insensitive to other people's feelings.
The rest of the characters irked me. You know when I find Lexie the most interesting character, something's wrong. Callie bothered me. Bailey bothered me. Bailey has become WAY too soft for my liking. I know she's having a crappy time with her former intern's illnesses and deaths. I know her husband left and she's a single mother but...Bailey breaks down too much. She does get too emotionally involved. She said it herself. I miss "The Nazi", the Bailey who would push the elevator button to hold the elevator to let another doctor have a meltdown away from prying eyes. I hate that she's now the one having the button pushed for her.
Overall....I was bored. There were no surprises. Owen and Christina made strides in therapy so they're becoming yet another happy-but-tormented couple. Lexie and Mark are a couple. Derek and Meredith are married on a Post-It. Alex and Izzie are married but seemingly regretful. Arizona and Callie are living together, it seems, and both are emotional wrecks. Isn't there ANYONE on this show with a backbone anymore? I like Arizona but I didn't like how she used Callie to get what she wanted. I don't like that she's becoming as screwed up as everyone else on this show.
I've flip-flopped. What I used to love about Grey's, I now hate. I'm fed up of all these people and their soap-opera drama. Where's the reality? Is it a girl who they call 'cerviche' because she was crippled from a boating accident? That storyline got way old with Lexie-as-cheerleader and the parallel's to all the other characters on the show. I guess she was grief in a human body, angry, denying, bargaining, depressed and, finally, accepting. Yes, writers, WE GOT IT. Thanks. Now if you could do it in a way that didn't involve a nasty, flacid pair of amputated arms wrapped in a towel, that'd be dandy.
I'm going through grief myself when it comes to Grey's Anatomy. I was in denial for a while that the show had begun to suck. Then I was angry because they kept bringing Dead Denny back, even though the fans hated it. Then I bargained..."Give me one storyline that makes me care and I'll keep watching!". I sort of got depressed because I was disappointed but, ok, that stage is a little dramatic for a TV show..now I'm accepting that the show is just...bad.
I think I'm going to have to give it up. I started DVR'ing Fringe so I can catch up. The Office is already on at the same time and I also watch Skins, BBC America's gritty, dark and fascinating teen drama. They're all on at the same time as Grey's and...they're all better.
So, maybe it's time to let it go. It's going to be a hard break-up but maybe it's time. I just don't care anymore.
And that's not a good thing.

Grey's Anatomy: Thanks for the Grief...

Monday May 15, 2017
Featured in Richmond BizSense: Full Article Here
Nearly five years in the making, the gates at a major development in Short Pump are beginning to open.
GreenGate, a 75-acre mixed-use project on West Broad Street by Markel | Eagle Partners, has its first wave of commercial tenants opening their doors, with others on the way.
CycleBar, a national chain of cycling gyms, will open May 11, with neighbor Carytown Bicycle Co. set to open later this month.
The CycleBar location is run by local franchisees Donna Suro and Libbie Crane. GreenGate will be CBC’s third location.
Concurrently, pizza and coffee became available at GreenGate. Mellow Mushroom opened on Monday, and Starbucks opened in late April.
J.B. Gurley, a Markel principal, said other eateries within the development are on track to open this summer.
“The Daily (Kitchen & Bar) and Red Salt (Chophouse & Sushi) will be ready in about July,” Gurley said.
The former comes from Richmond Restaurant Group, and the latter from EAT Restaurant Group.
Also from RRG in GreenGate will be Coast, a spinoff of its Carytown seafood restaurant, East Coast Provisions. Gurley said Coast would be ready to open in fall 2017.
“We have a real bias toward local tenants, and it’s reflected in who we’ve signed to date in some degree,” Gurley said. “There are good national tenants we’d love to have be a part of the development, as well.”
GreenGate is anchored by German grocer Lidl, whose 36,000-square-foot building will be complete in June, Gurley said. Lidl will have seven stores in the Richmond area, which it announced would all open in one wave this summer, though an exact date hasn’t been announced.
It’s not only GreenGate’s retail and restaurant spaces that are being snatched up.
Last week Tuckahoe Orthopaedics announced it will open a 14,800-square-foot office in the development – the first office tenant to sign on. It will be the medical group’s fourth location.
Bill Reynolds of CBRE | Richmond represented Tuckahoe Orthopaedics in lease negotiations.
GreenGate will have two 45,000-square-foot office buildings, and Gurley said construction would begin on the first one in the next two months.
The development’s residential spaces also are taking shape.
With townhomes in the middle of the project and single-family houses on the perimeter, Gurley said the company has sold over 20 townhomes, of which it has built seven. He said GreenGate’s first resident may move in as soon as June.
“We have some other tenants coming in that we’re getting ready to announce,” Gurley said.
Markel put GreenGate into motion in late 2012, when it purchased the land for $8.5 million.
It was one of three major developments announced around the same time that showed the boundaries of Short Pump would continue pushing west. GreenGate is joined on that stretch of Broad Street by the Wegman’s- and Cabela’s-anchored West Broad Marketplace, and Atack Properties’ 70-acre, Aldi- and Bon Secours-anchored Broad Hill Centre.pandora charms ocean city md

The young, smart and funny (insert more superlatives here) Wilmington sketch comedy troupe Pineapple-Shaped Lamps brings its weekly season of “Thursday Night Live” shows to an end with “Sing, Pineapples, Sing!” a comic homage to musical theater.
According to a press release from troupe prez Wesley Brown, “the show will feature argumentative Disney princesses food percussionists, Beethoven and, of course, dancing cats.”
PSL formed in 2010 and since then has produced not only dozens of skits for “TNL” but also an original play and productions of established shows such as “Dr. Horrible’s Sing-along Blog” and “Cannibal! The Musical.”
In my estimation at least, their talent and persistence has earned in them a spot in the pantheon of fabled Wilmington comedy troupes, a hall of fame (and occasional shame) that includes Changing Channels, The Other Side and The Comically Impaired. Plus, they make great videos. Check out a couple below.

Many young drivers competing at the Jack in the Box Summer Shootout Series dream of racing alongside their favorite NASCAR drivers one day, but not so many of them get their start from playing video games. William Byron, a native of Charlotte, N.C., learned the basics of driving by using iRacing, an online motorsports racing simulation. But it was after he went to his first Summer Shootout Series race that he got the bug to get behind the wheel of a real car.
"I started using iRacing about two years ago, then later on I went to my Dad and we came to a Summer Shootout race and I told him I wanted to try one of those Legend Cars out," said the 16-year-old. "It all went from there. It all started out here at the track on a Tuesday night, so it's pretty cool that I'm back out here where I first started."
Growing up, Byron started following NASCAR and eventually asked his dad to take him to his first race at Martinsville Speedway in 2006. It was an instant connection and he knew from then on that racing would become much more than a hobby for him. Six years later, he would climb behind the wheel of a Legend Car.
"I had never raced anything full speed before and I didn't really know what it was going to feel like, so it was weird getting into a car for the first time," he said. "I had no idea that the iRacing would translate so much for me."
Byron began competing full-time in the Legend Car Young Lions division in 2013 and competed in 69 Legend Car races across the United States, posting 33 wins, 59 top-fives and 64 top-10 finishes. In addition, he had great success at his hometown track, Charlotte Motor Speedway, when he won the 2013 Young Lions Division Legends All-Star race. This year, he has one win in three races in the Legend Car Pro division at the Jack in the Box Summer Shootout Series.
"When we first got started, it was definitely surprising to me how well we did and when I got in a car for the first time how much the iRacing crossed over," said Byron. "But I kind of knew once we got farther into the season that we would succeed. I didn't know we would get so many wins so quickly."
Byron transitioned to the Legend Car Pro division in January of this year and immediately won the Charlotte Winter Heat Series championship. A big break came shortly after for Byron when it was announced he would sign with JR Motorsports, the team owned by NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt Jr., to compete regionally in its late model program. Liberty University later signed on to be the primary sponsor of his No. 9 late model for JRM. Even though he now races for NASCAR's most popular driver, the Jack in the Box Summer Shootout Series is still a priority for Byron.
"The Legend Cars are the hardest cars to drive, even my late model is a little bit easier to drive," he said. "I come out here because it keeps me on the edge of my seat and really challenges me."
Byron says that while the adjustment of moving to late models has been tough, driving a Legend Car at Charlotte Motor Speedway in the Jack in the Box Summer Shootout Series against the best grassroots drivers in the country has really helped him prepare.
"There's much more to driving late models and the races are longer so it's definitely different," said Byron. "Even though we haven't had a win yet we'll definitely get there. We improve every week and it's a lot being thrown at you at one time, but the Legend Car definitely helped me prepare for it. I really enjoy it and I get to hang out with Dale Jr. a little bit so that's pretty cool."
JR Motorsports has a developmental program that helps train young drivers and ultimately prepares them to move on to more advanced racing series, including the possibility of their NASCAR Nationwide Series team.
Even though he has so much on his plate right now, Byron keeps himself driven with the dream of one day driving in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series.
"It's absolutely a dream of mine to be a NASCAR driver one day," he said. "I'm kind of amazed that I'm this close to it now because it seemed so distant two years ago. It's so close to home now that I can feel it."
Fans can watch Byron and other aspiring professional auto racers when the 21st annual Jack in the Box Summer Shootout Series continues Tuesday, June 24, with Media Mayhem bus racing. In addition to the regular racing divisions, fans can see local TV and radio personalities go head-to-head in 13-ton school buses for a spectacular school bus slobberknocker..PARTNERSHIP
perhaps the most simple
part of being ready to meet another
is a shared idea
an enough-shared purpose
maybe underneath that
is the very notion
of a shared idea
that it is even possible
to create in delicious together
from strong self
yes a world that has existed forever
yet has been hidden
forgotten
perhaps these are just stages
needing to be lived
in their own time
through the vessels
we call us
I won’t be managed again
not in love
not in relation
life is in the invitation
I won’t live in assignment
that masks lack of imagination
and remembering
of what together can be
partnership is more vibrant
I won’t live in single view
when so much more exists
beyond the unchallenged assumptions
choice is soooo much more aligned
with the brilliant energy of the universe
those are false boundaries
that I thought I had to live
it turns out
I don’t
LIFE IS IN THE INVITATION
Tenneson Woolf, 2010Sleep is immensely important to children’s performance in school. At ISM school starts early and the day can be a long one. Most of our students wake between 5 and 6am… so what time should be be going to sleep? the article below from webmd offers these guidelines.
3-6 Years Old: 10 – 12 hours per day
Children at this age typically go to bed between 7 and 9 p.m. and wake up around 6 and 8 a.m., just as they did when they were younger. At 3, most children are still napping while at 5, most are not. Naps gradually become shorter as well. New sleep problems do not usually develop after 3 years of age.. Now, however, social pressures conspire against getting the proper amount and quality of sleep.
So – our pre-schoolers and kindergarteners should be going to sleep at around 7pm. Students in grades 1-4 should be sleeping around 8pm. This seems early, especially in a culture where children seem to stay up very late but it would seem that the doctors are advising an average of 10 hours sleep per night for all elementary school kids.Hello everyone,

Jammeh is expected to head for Malabo but it is unclear if he will stay in that country.
Former president of the Gambia Yahya Jammeh, who initially declined to relinquish power after his defeat at the polls, will now leave the country Saturday on a Mauritanian aircraft.
He is expected to head for Malabo, Equatorial Guinea, but it is unclear if he will stay in that country.
Jammeh ruled the Gambia nation for 22 years after seizing power as a 29-year old army officer in 1994. But the longtime leader bowed to pressure from West African forces who entered the country shortly after the man who handed defeat him at the polls, Adama Barrow, was sworn in at the Gambian embassy in Dakar, Senegal.
“I have decided today in good conscience to relinquish the mantle of leadership of this great nation with infinite gratitude to all Gambians,” Jammeh said on state television in the early hours of Saturday.
“My decision today was not dictated by anything else than the supreme interest of you, the Gambian people and our dear country,” he said following hours of talks with Guinea’s Alpha Conde and Mauritania’s Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz.
At Friday’s talks, backed by the 15-nation Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), an agreement was reached in principle for Jammeh to leave, but by Saturday morning, it had still not been signed.
The agreement “foresees the departure of Yahya Jammeh from The Gambia for an African country with guarantees for himself, his family and his relatives,” Abdel Aziz said on return to Nouakchott in remarks quoted by the official AMI news agency.Aulay Macaulay, founder of rostering software maker Ento, spent three years living in his office after a cash crunch meant he had to choose between work or a home.

If the distance sensor detects a stranger gets closer more than 1 meter, 3d printed spikes start to move up and down to protect the wearer.
The defense system serves as a metaphor which highlights a method of appropriation where the human body is enhanced through the process of bio-mimicry.Janitorial Cover Letter

Twenty years ago, one of the most controversial engineers of the 20th century died under suspicious circumstances. Stanley Meyer, who was once hailed as a revolutionary innovator after apparently discovering a method which allowed cars to be powered with water, collapsed suddenly while dining with two Belgian investors who were interested in his work.
The 57-year-old had just raised a toast with the men and taken a sip of cranberry juice when he became unexpectedly overwhelmed with pain.
He died just moments later after running out into the parking lot screaming, "they poisoned me".
Despite the coroner later denying that Meyer had died from unnatural causes, those who supported the engineer claimed there was foul play involved. Even now, almost two whole decades later, people are still convinced that Meyer had been deliberately silenced by official powers.

Some years before this meeting, Meyer had claimed that he had devised a way for motor vehicles to run on water-based fuel. According to him, the method could be achieved by splitting H20 into its core elements, burning the hydrogen, and then converting the two back into water vapor using a conventional combustion engine.
However, as any scientists out there will know, this would theoretically break the first and second laws of thermodynamics, as it allows for operation as a perpetual motion machine.
What's more, during Meyer's patenting of his invention, he described the molecules in the engine as "Fuel Cells". This term is usually reserved for cells that produce electricity - not consume them, as Meyer's did.
Understandably, then, there was a lot of suspicion over whether the process was legitimate, and it was eventually found to be fraudulent during a 1996 Ohio court case. So, if he had been proven to be a phony, why would someone want to kill him?
During the trial, three expert witnesses found that there "was nothing revolutionary about the cell at all and it was simply using conventional electrolysis," which eventually led to Meyer being found guilty of committing "gross and egregious fraud". As a result, he was ordered to repay a total of $50,000 to investors.
Essentially, he was outed as a scammer.
However, some people believe that the whole case was a cover-up, and that Meyer's method does work. It's a huge conspiracy theory, of course, but there are folks out there who just don't buy the coroner's verdict that Meyer - who was known to have high blood pressure - died of a cerebral aneurysm.
Credit: YouTube/PESNetwork
As it's been so long since Meyer registered the patents, his inventions are now in the public domain, meaning they're available for all to use without restriction or royalty payment. And yet, nobody has ever pursued the invention.
This should be evidence enough to prove that, as suspected, the method never worked.
Or - for the more dubious theorists out there - perhaps it means that everyone who did try it ended up being surreptitiously silenced... but I suppose we'll never know forSummer time party decorations

That is according to Ludovic Colin, head of global flexible bonds at Vontobel, who shared this view in the firm’s latest fixed income outlook.
'Derivatives are excellent for this kind of situation, and fixed income investors need to increasingly take them into consideration,' he said.
'Options specifically allow you to limit the downside when markets go against you and correspondingly optimise the upside when the market goes in your favour.'
Colin’s team doesn’t see the end of a 30-year bull market for bonds and instead said equity valuations approaching the end of cycle mode.
'We have an 8% recovery in the cycle in the US. Mr Trump is probably going to add two-to-three years of extra growth, but if it doesn’t go to plan, then we start to have a slowdown earlier than discounted by the markets.'
Credit view
In terms of credit, Mondher Bettaieb, head of corporate bonds at the firm, said banking, energy and construction sectors are going to be beneficiaries in the US market.
He added that new US corporate bond issuance in 2017 is expected to be lower than the record-breaking levels seen last year.
‘Large M&A transaction levels are slowing, and cash is expected to be repatriated from Europe to the US, which is supportive news for credit spreads.’
He said Asian and European investors are expected to continue buying US bonds, as those might have more attractive yield levels.
‘For bond investors looking for higher coupons and spread-tightening potential with limited volatility, US corporates particularly in the mid-yield segment (rated A to BBB) offer a sweet spot. ‘
When it comes to high yield bonds, Bettaieb is also positive, as default rates are forecasted to stay at or below long-term averages. He said to focus on European names despite yields seeming lower than those in the US.
‘With US Treasury yields around 240 basis points higher than Bunds, hedging any currency exposure pretty much eliminates most of the difference in yields.’
He added that duration in high yield is also lower in Europe than in the US, and Europe has more BB-rated bonds and less B-rated than the US.
Emerging markets outlook
The firm's head of emerging markets bonds, Luc D’Hooge, said his team is focusing on EM hard-currency debt and expects growth from Latin America, in particular Brazil and Argentina.
D'Hooge also likes Indonesia due to beneficial structural reforms and is keeping a close eye on the upcoming local elections in 2017.
'The election in Jakarta will be important to see if President Joko Widodo’s close collaborators win there; it will be a test vote on the president himself.'
D'Hooge is taking advantage of euro-denominated bonds that deliver a spread pick up 40-50% higher than on the US dollar equivalent bonds.
He is also positive on Mexico, as it is attractively priced based on its potentially big exposure to Trump’s policies. His team is invested in Mexico’s external debt with a special focus on long-maturity paper in euros and pound sterling.
‘At the very long end, several century bonds offer a 3.8% pick-up over the risk-free rate and thanks to that, the interest rate risk (modified duration) is lower than for the German 30-year Bund. That’s an anomaly for a mixed A/BBB issuer.’Magazine

 press syndicates.
{jcomments on}Joining the journalist’s trade union is claimed to become a target that has nothing to do with protecting journalist’s source of income or ensuring freedom of expression and maintaining free press. Joining the journalist’s trade union became part of a plan to shelter and protect individuals who have political views, under the umbrella of the press in the name of journalism.
One of such cases discussed at present is Israa Abdel Fattah’s membership at the The Egyptian Journalists Syndicate (EJS) . Israa is an Egyptian activist who had nothing to do with journalism. But she was singled out by Egyptian Businessman and politician, Naguib Sawiris, and offered a job as a host of a television show at prime time on his television Channel “On TV” in January 2012. Her application was sent to the national union of journalists in Egypt to offer her membership, which is still debated.
There are individuals who were nominated to join the journalists’ union after the revolution that had no previous professional work in journalism; such as Israa Abdel Fattah who has never published an article in the press before, though she was an on-line activist. This has angered many Egyptian journalists such as Abdel Jawad Abu Kab, who published an article on Egyptian newspaper, Rosa Elyoussef, entitled ‘Israa Abdel Fattah’s scandal’, protesting against her membership. Clearly, journalist’s trade union should not be used for political purposes and should scrutinise membership applications.
Israa has co-founded April 6 Youth Movement Egypt in 2008, a group established to support the workers at El-Mahalla El-Kubra industrial town, who were planning to strike on April 6. This group gradually became a popular political movement. Israa was arrested by Egyptian security in 2008. After two weeks in prison she was released, to make a brief public statement renouncing political activism for good. But she reappeared again during the January 2011 protests, calling for ending Hosni Mubarak’s regime and started to appear on Al Jazeera television channel to offer updates on the latest news of the opposition.Feb 10

Dan Johnson (kentucky.gov)
SHEPHERDSVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- The widow of a Kentucky lawmaker who killed himself following a sexual assault allegation has been nominated by Republicans to fill the seat he held.
Bullitt County GOP Chairman Paul Ham said a vote was taken Thursday night to nominate Rebecca Johnson.
Gov. Matt Bevin set a Feb. 20 special election to find a replacement for Republican Dan Johnson, whose body was found this month with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. He died a day after denying that he sexually assaulted a teenage girl in 2013. Johnson was in his first term representing a House district south of Louisville.
Rebecca Johnson will face former state Rep. Linda Belcher. The Bullitt County Democratic Party announced on Thursday that Belcher was selected as the nominee by a unanimous vote..Author – Harika Bantupalli
With a number of beaches, tourist attractions, heavy industries and a bustling port, Visakhapatnam is surely the Jewel of The East Coast. But, not many know that it had a considerable Buddhist influence. The city holds the legacy of Buddhism in the region and it is surrounded by a few ancient Buddhist complexes that dated back to the 3rd century BC.
Thotlakonda and Bavikonda are two among the five excavated Buddhist centres located near the city of Visakhapatnam. These complexes have various structures including maha stupas, votive stupas, bhojanasalas (dining halls), pakasalas (Kitchen), congregation halls, chaitya grihas, viharas and well-carved stone pathways. It is said that each of these centres must have accommodated more than 100 monks who practiced Hinayana Buddhism

If you are fighting back pain, you may no longer count on acupuncture – at least in the UK. A group is comparing it to sham treatment. (Photo : Pfc. Jennifer Kennemer, 16th MPAD | U.S. Army)
Suffering from back pain? The UK's National Health Service is now discouraging people with low back pain from seeking acupuncture due to the lack of sufficient evidence that it works.
The revised guidelines developed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) on back pain and sciatica management no longer include acupuncture because its benefits are no different than a sham treatment or a placebo.
"[T]here is a lack of convincing evidence of effectiveness for some widely used treatments [like] acupuncture," said Professor Mark Baker, NICE clinical practice director.
An Australian study in early 2016 alreadydebunked the benefits of acupuncture in treating menopausal symptoms like hot flushes.
NICE instead recommends a variety of combined physical and psychological approaches depending on the symptoms, clinical considerations, and preferences of patients.
The group also advocates exercises that emphasize the back, such as yoga and stretching, as the first line of treatment. They can then be complemented with massage and manipulation by a physiotherapist. The guidelines do not limit the activities of sufferers, but tell them to continue normal routines as much as they can.
When it comes to medications, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the first choice. If the medication is not effective or the back pain is diagnosed as acute, weak opioids are provided. Paracetamol can no longer be taken alone.
Sufferers may also benefit from psychological treatments like "talking therapies" especially if they are facing social or mental issues that hinder or delay their recovery or when they have become less tolerant to pain. These may also work if the patient does not respond positively to medications and other forms of treatment.
The revised guideline, which is currently open for consultation until May 5 and meant for publication in September, is applicable to sufferers with low back pain and sciatica regardless of how long they have been diagnosed or when the condition has started.
The British Medical Acupuncture Society (BMAS) has already expressed its disappointment on the recommendation and believes the assessment of these studies has problems.
"It is partly to do with the decision to put the biggest emphasis on the difference over sham ... That is a problem for all physical therapies because physical therapy shams tend to be active - because you have to touch patients,"said Dr. Mike Cummings, the BMAS medical director.
In the United States, where eight of 10 people are diagnosed with back pain, at least 3 million undergo acupuncture annually, according to the American Association of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine.Now let´s get straight into it and clarify one thing:
We are NOT talking about the fake product that contains hydrogenated vegetable oils, additives, preservatives, colours, flavour, powdered milk solids, soy, protein isolates, lecithin, and much more.
We´re talking about the real deal. Chocolate made from really natural, possibly even organic, but always healthy ingredients, like cacao beans or the real, raw cacao powder, coconut oil or coconut butter and sweeteners like agave syrup, honey or rapadura sugar – depending on your preferences (vegan, raw, etc.)
Reno
wned nutritionist David Wolfe has dedicated a whole blog to chocolate. His book Naked Chocolate is filled with lots of love for and information about the benefits of this ancient power food.
You have probably heard that dark chocolate is better for you, which is true, as long as – again – we talk about high quality chocolate, containing the real cacao and non of the earlier mentioned additives, preservatives….However, this kind of chocolate is hard to find on the shelves in the supermarkets.
If you want to make your own chocolate, Changing Habits can provide you with all the ingredients necessary.
The Aztecs and Mayans had it right.
They knew about the power of cocoa, the “food of the Gods”, which today is classified as a so-called “superfood”. And that is for a reason.
Chocolate, made from the cocoa bean, which grows on a cacao tree
- contains polyphenol antioxidants (helps to boost your cardiovascular system, lower blood pressure, has anti-inflammatory properties, reduces platelet aggregation, increases the HDL/LDL ratio and reduces LDL oxidation)
- provides you with important minerals, like
- copper and potassium (vital for good health)
- magnesium (helps to relax tense muscles and reduces the risk of several chronic illnesses such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease),
- plant-based iron (strengthens the formation of the red blood cells and dilates blood vessels for better circulation) and
- manganese (not only supports the regulation of blood sugar but also improves the metabolising of fats and carbohydrates)
- includes theobromine (has been shown to be beneficial to suppress fevers and coughs, can combat fatigue and provides an energy boost.)
- is a naturally low-glycemic snack

Accomplishing what many considered unthinkable, Boller threw for 253 yards and three touchdowns in the Ravens' 48-3 rout of the Green Bay Packers last night, out-dueling Brett Favre in what might be the final Monday Night Football appearance of a storied career..
Boller shredded the NFL's top-ranked pass defense, completing 19 of 27 passes (70 percent) before leaving with eight minutes left. Eight days after perhaps his worst game - two interceptions and one fumble in Denver - he was nearly perfect, recording a career-best 136.8 quarterback rating (out of a possible 158.3).
There's still no guarantee Boller will return as the starter next year, but at least for one night, he showed the promise the Ravens had long envisioned.
"This means a lot especially with what I've been going through," Boller said. "I felt this game I was going to go out there and play relaxed and smooth ... [and] let the game come to me."
He threw two touchdown passes to tight end Todd Heap (2 and 27 yards) and one to receiver Randy Hymes (13 yards), leading the Ravens to the most points scored in their 10-year history.
In a measure of the Ravens fans' confidence in Boller, one purple-clad fan carried a sign at the beginning of the night that read: "Santa, Please Send Us An NFL Quarterback For Christmas."
Boller then left the field hearing fans chanting his name.
It was quite a turnaround for Boller, whose coach suggested a week ago that he might need to see a sports psychologist to help him calm down.
"It's always good to recognize that's what your potential is and you can live up to that against a very good defense," coach Brian Billick said. "There's never a downside to producing like that."
Favre, meanwhile, was only a shell of his former All-Pro self. He was 14-for-29 for 144 yards and two interceptions, exiting with 2:14 left in the third quarter.
The Ravens, who have struggled at forcing turnovers, came away with five last night, including three from Favre's replacement Aaron Rodgers.
"It just seemed like [Favre] was throwing balls up in the air, which is not typical of him," cornerback Chris McAlister said.
The low point for Favre was a high one in a tumultous season for the Ravens (5-9), who scored two touchdowns in the first quarter for the first time since Billick took over in 1999.
The league's second-lowest-scoring offense beat up the floundering Packers (3-11), totaling 435 yards and eclipsing 40 points for the first time since November 2003, a span of 33 games.
Heap caught nine passes for 110 yards to become the team's all-time leader in receiving yards, and Jamal Lewis gained 100 yards for the second time this season (105 yards on 22 carries).
In the end, the Ravens scored on seven of their first nine possessions, reeling off drives of 18, 75, 96, 63, 72, 56 and 14 yards.
"As a whole offense, we saw what we're capable of," Heap said. "Now, we just need to go and build off that."The Imagination of Mr. Gilliam
An Interview with Mick AudsleyBy Garrett GilchristFor The Editor's Guild MagazineAugust 2009
From his long history with Steven Frears to his work with directors like Mike Newell, Neil Jordan, and John Madden, Mick Audsley has, over thirty years, proven himself to be one of the finest editors in Britain. The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus is his second collaboration with Terry Gilliam, the mad genius who started out in Monty Python, and went on to create some of the most original, unforgettable and visually inventive films of the 80s and 90s, from Brazil and The Adventures of Baron Munchausen to The Fisher King, Twelve Monkeys and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. But even as he's dazzled critics and fans, he's been too quirky to succeed at the box office, and his films have often been plagued by behind the scenes drama, such as his unfinished film The Man Who Shot Don Quixote, which shut down after just a week of filming. His new film, The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus, starring Christopher Plummer, could be a return to form for Gilliam. It's a stunning, immersive feast for the senses, taking us into a world of imagination of the kind only Gilliam can create. But the film nearly shut down completely, due to the death of Heath Ledger. Gilliam and the crew were devastated by the loss of their friend. But they were determined to salvage his final performance, and with the help of Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell, they were able to raise a phoenix from the ashes and complete the film. It will be released around the world in September and October, and will be released in the United States at an unknown date, perhaps around Christmas.
GG: The 12 Monkeys documentary, the Hamster Factor, shows Terry Gilliam as a very driven, very brilliant man, but also a wounded man who seems to be waiting for something to go terribly wrong, almost willing it to, just because it's happened on so many of his films.
MA: It's extraordinary- his misfortunes have been at a level beyond belief. 12 Monkeys went very very smoothly. I had a great time. It was the last time I did film, not non-linear editing. It's the end of an era, for me. But the struggle is often to do with money. It was always ironic to me that Terry somehow was given this legacy of being- not difficult, but irresponsible with money.
GG: When he can actually make magic out of less money than most filmmakers.
MA: Exactly. I always found that very upsetting because in my experience the opposite is true. He's enormously responsible about what to do and where to put his efforts financially, to make the film happen. He has got such an enormously succinct and precise vision of what he wants to get, that makes it an efficient process. Filmmaking is precarious. You can't control weather and all the rest of it. But it's unfair that whatever happened on Munchausen all those years ago was a legacy that would prevent him going forward all these years later.
GG: On Munchausen, the producer Thomas Schuhly had left him this great mess to clean up- they were over budget before they started shooting. The production was being stolen from left and right. And yet still he turned in one of the most beautiful films of that era.
MA: I know- extraordinary, isn't it? It's always a struggle to get funding, get financial solidity. If Terry struggles, imagine younger filmmakers who are less well known starting out, people who are exploding with ideas. That paints a rather bleak picture of our situation as filmmakers. But, as with this film, Terry was still able to spring back and be inventive to an incredible degree and come out on top.
GG: This, like all of Terry Gilliam's films, is a visual feast. It's also his fifth collaboration with cinematographer Nicola Pecorini, who's worked with Terry since 1998.
MA: I think there is nobody better, between Terry and Nicola. They're so confident with the visual language of cinema. Exquisitely good with angles, lenses, lighting- I'm a huge fan of it. And one can't always say that. Because circumstances on a film set are difficult and you don't always get there. But Terry is the master of that language and he appears to do that effortlessly. We never have ridiculous amounts of material searching for the right angle. He gives me what I need and it's always very strong. They're good friends. They understand each other and can be flippant, with this enormous respect underneath. They enjoy the process very much. Very nice guys to hang out with. And Nicola cooks fine Italian food.
GG: It's impossible to talk about this film without talking about the tragic death of Heath Ledger. Much has been said about the pain of his custody battle over his daughter. The stress and the drugs and just not sleeping and being so worked up and...
MA: I never met Heath, and it was such a shock to know that there was anything- even if he hadn't been sleeping well- there was no evidence of him being tired or under-energized in the work that I received on the movie, of him being anything other than absolutely well prepared for every day, working very hard. You can always tell in my job if somebody's connected to the piece.
GG: Terry Gilliam has said the work was really fueling him, that he got an energy from working that overwhelmed any personal problems he was having.
MA: That's very plausible. Work can be so all consuming that it blocks everything else out. He was very involved in the whole project, not just as a fine actor.
GG: He wanted to direct, and probably could have been a fine filmmaker.
MA: I'm sure he would've been. I was packing up to leave for Vancouver. The others had gone ahead. My daughter came in with a laptop- I thought it was a hoax at first. We switched on the television. This was half of ten at night in London. It suddenly dawned on me that this was all real. I phoned Terry immediately and I think we both said, how are we ever gonna finish this? It's not possible to finish the film.
GG: But [producer] Amy Gilliam and Nicola became very tenacious, saying this must be finished, this will not become another Don Quixote.
MA: That's right. They also had a stronger personal relationship with Heath, a personal reason as well as a professional reason to want to represent him as best we could. None of us wanted this material to go the way of an extra on a DVD. It just didn't seem right. But it took us a while. We were all in shock for a couple of weeks. It was unthinkable what had happened. And with Terry's reputation for disaster, I thought, why are the gods being so unkind to him? It's hard enough getting through these things- you're very reliant on friendship. Heath and Terry got on well together. They were looking ahead to what was next.
GG: Gilliam has said, the money to finish the film just vanished.
MA: The wrangling went on for six months. We had to start making a different film. The insurers said, obviously, you can't. But it is a different film. It has to be rewritten and rethought. As it turned out, to have abandoned the project would've cost more than completing it the best we could. And so eventually that's what happened, thank god.
GG: You've said that you hid the film footage, so that no one could take it away.
MA: We didn't want it to get into the wrong hands. It was personal to us as filmmakers, and it was owned by the producers of the film. Maybe it was silly of us. I made jokes about it and said, look, I literally have hidden it under the sofa in the cutting room and taken the name off the door so that nobody knows who we are, and can't see the film. Of course anybody could have found us. But Terry and I share the same agent, and they were trying to get to him and me in those few days after Heath's death, and he protected us from all that. Perhaps a little overreacting but...
GG: Probably not, considering the world's reaction.
MA: We got everything off the Air Canada flight and returned it to London. We were shut down at that point. Then the insurers paid for a week, for Terry and I to go into the cutting room, when he got back from L.A., to figure out what we could do. I just carried on doing the work, polishing up Heath's scenes, blocking out how we could reconceive the transformations. He had filmed one side of the mirror, in the real world. The other side, the Imaginarium, Heath was going to shoot those on a stage in Vancouver. So we had to figure out whether we were going to use a double, or write him out of the scene... Nicola and Amy put their shoulders to the wind, to figure out the availabilities for Johnny, then Jude and Colin. When we saw their willingness to help, we finally thought, we're gonna carry on and make this happen. Let's pull together and see what we can do.
GG: How was this different from 12 Monkeys for you?
MA: Parnassus, the writing was changing as we went along. Twelve Monkeys, I was familiar with that screenplay before Terry got involved- David and Janet Peoples, who I knew personally. It's a very subjectively conceived story, which is why it's so much fun. The relationship with La Jette. It's a jigsaw puzzle where the audience needs to make connections, fragments of evidence that tie the story together. We had to be sure that information was placed where it needed to be, and was communicating clearly. Slowly it comes into focus and you can draw all the strands together in his frame of mind. An exciting project.
GG: Terry Gilliam is particularly good at point of view films where you're seeing the world through an unreliable narrator.
MA: He has a very strong visual inventive eye, and it's his subjective world that he's placing in the eyes of the character. A surreal world.
GG: Christopher Plummer plays Dr. Parnassus in the film.
MA: A wonderful actor. His voice is fantastic. From his years and years of filmmaking, he's got all the practical skills that as an editor you admire so much. He's very clear and precise about he's going to do, not wasting any time with practical problems, hitting marks, all that stuff that filmmaking involves. And a delightful gentleman, very social. We'd worked together on 12 Monkeys, and it was a great pleasure working with him again.
GG: Tom Waits is an interesting choice as the devil, Mr. Nick.
MA: Such an vastly intelligent creative mind. He is in my view one of the great contemporary American poets. His voice is such a great instrument musically, as well as from an actor's point of view. He was a joy. Very committed, very helpful, very willing to come with us on whatever we asked him to do. Absolutely solid artistically, and I think he's marvelous in the film. It's one of those things that struck me, how well he comes through. I liked all the cast, particularly Andrew Garfield, a very exciting young actor. I've become a great fan. And Verne Troyer. Lily Cole. Because of what happened, their commitment to the project was tested, and revealed. In the end, it was Terry's generosity, his command of the production, and his love of filmmaking. All of us benefit from that enthusiasm. It rubs off on us. I think we all felt the same. Under the circumstances that were so extreme, we all had a good ride.
GG: In the final film, Heath Ledger's Tony steps through the mirror and becomes first Johnny Depp, then Jude Law, then Colin Farrell.
MA: The order was dictated to a certain degree by the time they could offer. We had Johnny only for two days, and half of one of those days he wasn't very well. Very fine actors, whose natural personas help represent different aspects of Tony's personality. Johnny we used as the elegant charmer. There's a seduction involved. Colin was the last, this duplicitous character- by then the cards were on the table so it was just, run with it. It's out now. Jude, all three of them came and had access to what Heath had done. I don't know whether they asked for it. Terry offered it, so they would have a relationship with what he had done, and solve it in their own way. They were very generous about it, and it was their support of the whole project that made it work.
GG: Since 1982, you've made over a dozen films with Stephen Frears, including Dirty Pretty Things, High Fidelity, Hero, The Grifters, and My Beautiful Laundrette.
MA: Yes, and probably another in late September. We're close friends, and I've met a lot of the filmmakers I've worked with through Steven. He's been a sort of mentor for me and somebody who I've learned a great deal from over those 25 years of making films. If you have that trust with somebody, that's the great joy, of being let loose with their material, and being given the freedom to manipulate it and offer it back to them in its new form. It's a bit like family. You know each other so well. It makes it very efficient, that you know what he likes. You have a likeness of view for the material and hopefully what to get out of it.
GG: You've worked frequently with Mike Newell.
MA: I've known Mike since 1984. He's involved in a big Bruckheimer film at the moment, Prince of Persia, which I was working on up to fairly recently. They wanted two editors, and I was only available to do a part of it. We did Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire in '04, and before that Mona Lisa Smile. We've had a good time together, making quite different films. Mike's great strength is his empathy for actors. It makes him very popular. There's a certain theatricality to Mike, and he's rooted in theater as well as films.
GG: You worked with Neil Jordan on Interview with a Vampire and We're No Angels.
MA: Gosh, I haven't seen Neil for years actually. If I see him we have a good time together. He's always very involved in, or has written, the screenplay. A bit like Terry. Dare I use that word- an auteur. You have to acknowledge that they've already done perhaps two, three, four years work before you even start shooting the movie itself. That requires a sensitivity to the diplomatic process of cutting a film.
GG: They could become attached to the material, but they could also know which of their babies to cut, hopefully.
MA: Exactly. I'll emphasize to student editors that the relationship between screenwriting and editing is extremely close. The rebirth of the movie in the cutting room. Working with somebody like Neil, who is a writer and novelist, can be very gratifying because they have so internalized the material in that way. I was always thinking this should go, so let's get rid of it. Or, you need a scene to do this job here. That's very much an intimate process. Directors like Steven or Mike Newell or John Madden, they can take on board other people's work and turn it inside out to invent it for themselves. But they come with perhaps a degree more objectivity.
GG: You've worked on very low and very high budget films.
MA: There's always time constraints, money constraints. It seems crazy when you spend a year on a film, but you still feel like a passenger ready to jump on a bus the whole way! Bigger budget films leave you more room, but there are more people who, quite rightly, have input into the final film. Cutting on film 10-15 years ago, we had a much more regimented process of completion. Now people can take it home and look at it. We can work perhaps twice the speed. But it takes longer, because people want all these different versions created, which have to be fought over, and presented sometimes against your own better judgement. Most of my friends and colleagues have, at one stage, been under the gun to produce cuts which we didn't believe in.
GG: On Terry's film Brazil (editor Julian Doyle), the studio prepared an edit so terrible it's become legendary.
MA: Oh, I've blocked that out of my head! It's just the nature of the job, and hopefully it doesn't happen too often. Occasionally I've thought, we've just kind of slid off the rails near the end. We had a better film a month ago. I've been lucky with most of the projects I've worked on. You can cut a film forever, til the cows come home. The skill for us all is to be able to step away at a certain point and say that's it. Done. And recognizing that is quite tricky after the fatigue of endless different permutations of the material. It's changed quite a lot, but how I work is much like I always did, taking a lot of notes and being very careful about how I first see it and respond to it.
GG: How do you approach editing a film? What is your personal style?
MA: I like to think that there isn't a style that you carry around like a bag of tricks and plaster over a film. What you bring is a response and a reaction. First, what you imagine the film to be when it's still a screenplay. Then as the material comes in, you respond to that. You must be the first audience, and try and make the film you'd like to see. But they're all very different animals, that need to be taken on their own terms, rather than forcing your own viewpoint upon them. The process of shooting and editing that first stage is crucial because we're responding on a daily basis to what's being given us. We're constructing it as a sketch, how the actors are playing as they come on board, how the film is growing in its kind of jigsaw-like way. You discover these hidden secrets, this power. We've got to be frank when shooting a film because time is short. Not to be overbearing, but that you can say look, I don't think that's quite right. Can we do something about that? When that's something that we all engage in without feeling threatened. I've been lucky to have that with all the directors you've mentioned. You need to have a voice which is supportive but also critical, when there's still time to do something about it.
GG: I'd imagine that Terry is someone who really pushes when something's needed.
MA: Certainly. He'll say okay, that didn't work, we'll have to find another day and do it again. On 12 Monkeys, Brad Pitt said, look, I had an off day. He genuinely offered to pay for that day again, himself. We did shoot it again- as far as I know they didn't make him pay for it! It's trusting each others' viewpoints during this funny little window which is the shoot, in order that the growth of the film is going to be as fluid and as expansive and interesting as is possible within those constraints.
GG: Are you able to rewatch the films?
MA: It usually takes me about three to five years. I can still do bits of dialogue from all the films over 20 years. You've been running it backwards and forwards...
GG: You're credited as "Special Thanks" on John Madden's Oscar winner...
MA: I helped John finish Shakespeare in Love. The editor, David Gamble, who was a friend of mine, was very seriously ill. I didn't want to tread too much on his work, since the film was very healthy when I saw it, apart from the last reel. I put back together a lot of his work over a couple months and we remade the ending, which was rewritten and reshot. We then did Captain Corelli's Mandolin, and Proof, which I enjoyed a great deal. Then Killshot, which I didn't actually complete. It was rewritten and reshot completely in the middle of production as it didn't preview terribly well. They wanted a change of tone. Six months went by, by which time I wasn't free to complete it. It did get released in the end, but I haven't completely seen it finished. It was an Elmore Leonard story, and I think the audience at that time wanted it to be a more conventional sort of thriller, rather than a noir thriller, or a film like The Grifters. Audiences are fickle things and movies are expensive and they need to get their money back. I don't think the audience we got that film to was the right one. Mickey Rourke was in it, before The Wrestler. He was in his coming back phase. But John was very tenacious and hung in there, and also had an obligation to satisfy his producers.
GG: That can be the most painful part of filmmaking, being subjected to that dreaded test screening.
MA: Oh, indeed! We've done hundreds of them in our time! I completely understood the need to satisfy that audience and perhaps that was the right way to turn it round.
GG: But it wasn't a film that set the box office afire either.
MA: No. The climate between one year and another can change for one particular project and maybe John was just unlucky with that particular project. 12 Monkeys did not preview particularly well. We got very average responses. Fortunately Universal were absolutely immensely supportive of us, and god bless em. They said, we're really happy. Carry on doing what you're doing, don't be put off. We expected better responses than we got. But people would go and see the film again- the complexity of it needed two viewings, and audiences enjoyed that. So it all had a happy ending, but that's not always the case.
GG: Difficult material almost never tests well.
MA: Exactly. At the same time, it's easy just to say, oh, a bad preview, oh, it's all their fault. They don't get it.
GG: You have to please an audience regardless.
MA: You don't necessarily have to literally please them. But you need to know what's coming across, what's clear, what's unclear. Even if you know the information that comes back, we as filmmakers should take it very seriously. Up to a certain point, and then saying, well, is that the film we're making or not? If you want to make a film that's challenging. If it isn't just fireworks display filmmaking- swizz bang noisy and running around a lot.
GG: Not that a Terry Gilliam film doesn't involve fireworks!
MA: They're all hard to make. Each time you get involved in one of these things, you're thinking, I don't know how this is going to work. How the audience will respond.
GG: And, can I live with this for a year and put my life and soul into it...
MA: Yes, and I'm a person of a certain age. I think it would be very hard to make 12 Monkeys now. People's feelings change, literally over a couple years. Audiences change. You can't assume anything until it's onscreen. We try to listen to everything, at least. What you do after is the tricky thing.
GG: And make the best version of the movie you set out to make rather than...
MA: Well, you try. In the end it's the director's movie, and we have obligations to the people who have employed us. There's a complexity of people to satisfy, quite rightly so. We're cogs in a bigger machine. You believe in the film and want to make as much of a contribution as you can. But in the end you've got to step aside. It's a tightrope to walk.
GG: Dr. Parnassus is a timeless fellow who tells very old fashioned stories, and his audience has moved on and no longer cares about what he's saying. He's been compared to Terry himself.
MA: There's certainly a parallel to be drawn if you want to. Imagination, the love of old fashioned storytelling, once upon a time, and taking you on a journey, as all storytelling should and has traditionally done. It's Terry's world, and he's been true to himself for three decades of filmmaking. He's an uncompromising artist, and in a way he's timeless. We never said, we have to do this for this contemporary audience. We never really previewed that film with an audience, because it just wasn't possible to do it. Quite rightly Terry said, this is the film I want to make. If you're going to make a low budget film with all these problems, it should have his signature on it competely. To ask an audience to be filmmakers under these circumstances, that's a dangerous place to go.
GG: It was impossible to reshoot at that point. The film hung by a thread, in some ways. A mall audience might not...
MA: No- I think we'd have got a really wide range of responses. Maybe it still will. We did show it to friends, and took those reactions very seriously. "I don't understand that bit. Why are you doing that?" But it's for Terry ultimately to decide. I'd say, "Do you think this is playing slow here?" He'd say, "No, I like it, it's fine, leave it alone. Don't take any more out." If he's happy, I'm happy. There's a certain point where we have to push all the responses away. Your own responses are in the end all you've got to go on. But there were two very chilling moments which we always worried about. One is that you meet Heath as he's dead! Hanging by his neck, having apparently committed suicide.
GG: It's a hell of a way to start his last film though.
MA: I know- it's completely bizarre. Similarly, when the first switch comes, the mask of revealing faces, and it turns out to be Johnny Depp. This was all written in before Heath's death. We had no way of understanding how those moments were going to play. Terry had a screening for the Directors Guild in L.A., which was the biggest audience I'd seen the film with, 500 people. It was electrifying when Heath came up there, and when Johnny first appeared. The impact- I could feel it in the room. I thought, it's bigger than I ever imagined.
GG: When you first started editing, that's something you could never have known- that people would be waiting for Tony.
MA: Exactly! I had always worried about his arrival in the film being a little late, in terms of kicking the story forward. It's 20 minutes in maybe. But that's good showmanship. They know Heath's coming and we're gonna make them wait! Then when we deliver, it'll be very strong, and it was. My responses are jaded by everything that happened making the film, and my familiarity with the material, so other viewers must be the judge of that.
GG: It might take you more than three to five years to watch this one again.
MA: This one might. [laughs]
GG: Terry Gilliam often says that he never gets it all onscreen. He gets as much of it as he can.
MA: He has more ideas than all of us put together.
GG: He'll try to reuse concepts that went unfilmed. For many years there was talk about a script with Charles McKeown again, The Defective Detective.
MA: Oh yes. I did read it. I was asking the other day what happened to it. He said it's in the top drawer somewhere.
GG: Has he spoken about Don Quixote?
MA: Yes. I never read the original, but I've read this new draft he's done and it's very very exciting. I believe he's trying to raise money to make that in the spring next year.
GG: You mentioned another project...
MA: I'm involved in starting up an online film editing education course. It's called 16x9. It's in the early stages. Steven [Frears] is involved. You'll download information and conversations and eventually we'll be doing online film tutorials with filmmakers around the world.
GG: These days anyone can make a film and put it on the internet, but it's unlikely that film will be seen by anyone. What's labeled as independent films these days are really just smaller studio films. Even many of Terry's films have not gotten the audience they deserved.
MA: Because exhibition and advertising is so expensive, you have this huge gap between the blockbusters, the big studio films, and independent films. The more that we could provide outlets for the exhibition of low budget films, they would get recognition. Maybe I'm just more aware of it now, but as the costs of filmmaking spiral ever upwards I'm reminded more and more of how precarious the process of getting started and getting to the end really is. We used to say, oh, well, if the first clapperboard goes I guess the film is gonna get made. But it's not always true. You may have five different sources of funding. If you get to the end of filming, but sometimes films get stuck in post production. It's always a struggle. We did think on every friday, this is the last week. It could all collapse tomorrow.
GG: Because of Heath really, I think this is something that people are going to watch and actually pay attention to.
MA: I suspect that's the case. I hope that's true for the right reasons, rather than just idle curiosity of how we wriggled out of the rather extreme situation. I hope they go and see it because it's Heath, and because it's a Terry Gilliam film.

A predator is no match for her protector…
It's been ten years since the attack that drove Maggie Delacorte to become an FBI SWAT agent. She's an elite fighter now—and when the Fishhook Rapist sends her a letter saying he's coming back for her, she knows she has to find him first. Her teammate Grant Larkin is assigned to the case, and he's determined to protect Maggie, even if it damages the connection that's been growing between them. And even if her attacker has decided that the way to get to Maggie is by targeting the people she cares about. Her feelings for Grant could get him killed, but she needs him—and his love—to make it through the worst danger yet…,
Maggie Delacorte’s history with the Fishhook rapist is about to come to a head but she isn’t in this alone. Grant Larkin, a member of her SWAT team who had transferred over 9 months ago, is determined to work the case and protect her at all costs, even as their attraction to each other grows steadily. Grant’s easy-going, smiley nature had me from the start and I thought he was a good match for Maggie, who has fought her way (and still fights) out of the trauma she endured 10 years ago.
I definitely liked the action although Ms Heiter’s apparent reluctance at following through with love scenes made the unresolved sexual tension as frustrating as coitus interruptus. It was good to see how the story played out and I only took issue with the passion that never really hit fever pitch between Maggie and Grant.Would you like our system to automatically remember your login details?

The Gorge provides a spectacular setting for fans and artists, and now its story will be told in a documentary film, Enormous: The Gorge Story.

A couple of guys dressed like pirates (I guess).
Art dealer Albert Moy. Love that Badtime Stories cover behind him.
The Gecks. I'm not sure what that was, maybe a band. We kept seeing this guy around. Scott Parrish on the right.
We called this guy "Captain Tape" because of the abundance of tape on his costume.

These are great pics!
But I have to point out that they can't all be from 1985 -- in the first photo in the "dealers room" section, roughly at the center, we can see a couple of what appear to be cardboard standees depicting Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson as Batman and the Joker from Tim Burton's first Batman film, which was released in 1989.
Still amazing to see the 'con as it used to be. Thanks!Welcome to Artemis Self-Defense

The conflict comes when you want to change carts, or your affiliate moves to a new cart, or any number of things that can happen to change some or all of those links.
I had a very successful client change shopping carts recently and the headache was made a lot easier with the use of pretty links. Granted – he had to change all of his regular cart links to pretty links, and create a pretty link to direct to each of his products, but now that it’s done he doesn’t have to worry about that ever again!
Pretty link is a plugin that operates on the wordpress platform, however it can be used for sites that are HTML based, or otherwise. You create a pretty link that links to your products, and that pretty link database becomes the only place you need to change anything if that link changes.
You then put the actual Pretty Link in place of the cart link on your site. This is all kept track of in one place, on your wordpress installation. You never have the need to go hunting through your HTML pages or any other pages if that link needs to change. You simply go into your main control panel in Pretty Link on wordpress and change it there.
Even if you have the Buy Now button in several different pages on your site – or if you are not in control of the pages that have that Buy Now button, all you have to do is change the end result in your Pretty Link control panel and it will go to the new page.
This blew my mind when I first discovered it, thanks to Jonathan Kraft of and
I hope this saves you a ton of headaches in the future!
If you are interested in moving your links to Pretty Link I can certainly help you with that! Let me hunt through your site and also create the Pretty Links for all your products and you will never have to do it again!

As human beings, we want to be in control of our own lives. This is a universal characteristic, whether people profess faith or not. Control is interpreted as freedom, while loss of control is interpreted as freedom, while loss of control is interpreted as slavery. The paradox is that we invite excessities into our lives from our position of control. We use our control and decide to engage in the Gotta Have It! behavior.
Excessities, however, are notoriously bad guests. They don’t tend to stay within the boundaries we set. Once told yes, they don’t like to be told no, and they perpetually promise what they can’t deliver. Before long, what you invited into your life to obey your needs ends up becoming the one you obey. The sad reality is we begin excessities thinking they will be our slaves – to bring us significance or value or pleasure or numbness whenever we decide – but they end up enslaving us.
Perhaps one of the most insightful groups into this phenomenon of control and slavery and how one can turn into the other rather quickly is Alcoholics Anonymous. The alcohol doesn’t take that first drink thinking it’s going to take over his or her life. No one forces them to take that first drink or the second or maybe even the third. After that, however, it gets a little murky. Alcoholism is a very slippery slope, and Alcoholics Anonymous bands together people in sobriety with a Twelve-Step path to recovery. Here are those Twelve Steps. As you read them, think in the context of Gotta Have It! behavior, whether it’s alcohol or}
The Twelve Steps, especially the first three, speak to a very fundamental reality that is constantly misconstrued and overlooked: first, that when our lives become unmanageable, they are out of control; and second, that in order to get back control, we have to completely give up control. Jesus puts it this way: “For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will save it” (Luke 9:24). Again, self-control isn’t something you can arrive at all on your own. Rather, you gain self-control when you give it up to something else.
Giving up control is a frightening prospect for many people. They believe the control they have is the only thing holding the monsters of life at bay. What they don’t realize is that this control isn’t opening the door to freedom; it’s keeping the door closed with them imprisoned inside. The monsters aren’t being kept on the other side of the door; the monsters are really on their side of the door, being kept in.
As topsy-turvy and scary as it sounds, the best way to gain control is to give it up. You need to understand an important point: The control you are so hesitant to give up is in reality not your control; it is the control the excessity has over you. This is a tug-of-war of wills – yours versus the excessity. You need to give up your control, as the AA second step says, to a Power greater than yourself.

Well I guess it's just a matter of only create one player and disable all the cooperative functions and the teleport.
there should be a #define ( and consequent #ifdef's... for this)
f.e: #define co-op 0/1
if it is one enable all the co op stuff and 0 disabling them...
It's best to set this as a quest option. Cooperative-play is the default, but the user could make a custom quest and add an option like "singleplayer". So a character selection screen would pop up. But the quest could also have a fixed character (ie, sonic), so no character selecion screen would be shown at all. And of course there would be the regular quests (cooperative-play)
The current levels of Open Sonic are unsolveable without cooperative play. We can't (won't) disable that on compile-time. Besides, this is one of the main features of the game. But it would be nice to have both gamemodes (single and cooperative)
Try to play the tutorial level using only one character. Even if you remove the doors and the teleporter, you won't be able to clear it.Warragul tournament basketball

Ministry of Education and the State Radio and Television Corporation (CERTV) signed an agreement to dedicate the TV Channel 17 frequency exclusively to educational programming, announced Ellis Perez, president of the CERTV board. The Ministry’s radio and television education division will be in charge of the programming.
The announcement was made on occasion of commemorating the 65th anniversary of the start of television in the Dominican Republic.
The agreement was signed by Education Minister Andrés Navarro and the director of CERTV, Ramon Tejada Read in the presence of the Communications director for the Presidency, Roberto Rodríguez Marchena.
Navarro said the Ministry will be investing RD$105 million in the project that includes the setting up of installations for educational radio and television, production of educational audiovisuals and the hiring of international programming.

Migration Agency says 13,446 foreigners deported in July 2017
The Migration Agency (DGM) reported that some 13,446 illegal foreigners were repatriated to their respective countries during the month of July 2017. According to Diario Libre, persons from Colombia, Cuba, France, Haiti, Peru, Venezuela and Russia were among those deported. This brings the total to 38,426 persons repatriated in 2017.
According to the DGM, there were 21,403 persons entering the country across the border with Haiti and 18,447 persons going from the Dominican Republic into Haiti, mostly through the town of Jimani, the main point for land crossings.
DR and MLB to make it harder for foreign ballplayers to audition for scouts
The combination of abundant native talent that can be evaluated periodically over short distances, the operation of 30 baseball academies in the country run by Major League Baseball teams and the existence of an office of Major League Baseball (MLB) in Santo Domingo, makes the Dominican Republic a continental hub for recruiting and developing young baseball players. All this, plus being a few hours from most MLB offices in the United States poses a tantalizing option for young ballplayers and their caretakers to make their way to the Dominican Republic for tryouts.
However, these competitive advantages have also triggered an uncontrolled flow of teenagers coming to the Dominican Republic from all around the Americas. The youngsters, who come in pursuit of their dream of making it to the Major Leagues, often find themselves victims of abuses, which MLB and the Dominican Migration Agency wish to put a stop to.
It appears that the group that set off the alarm is from Venezuela. Hundreds of Venezuelans have migrated to the country, spurred by the current political turmoil in their native country. Among these, dozens have come given the difficulties that Major League Baseball teams have traveling to Venezuela to recruit ballplayers. These factors have led to an unprecedented influx of Venezuelan teenagers into the Dominican Republic.
Cuban ballplayers, who encounter obstacles in their home country to sign with MLB teams, have also immigrated to the Dominican Republic, many times without parental permission.
On Tuesday, the Migration Agency enacted a set of instructions that will regulate the entry and permanence in this country of foreigners who are pursuing careers in baseball. Now prospects interested in exhibiting their talents or training in the country will have to obtain a different sort of visa, called the NM (multiple business) that can be granted by the Ministry of Foreign Relations if the applicant has a valid passport (at least six months from expiring), a return ticket, and an address where he will be staying in the country. If the ballplayers are minors, they must present an authorization signed by either parents or legal guardians.
Fidelio Despradel against allowing mining in San Juan de la Maguana
Deputy Fidelio Despradel again warns the Ministry of Environment against granting the environmental permission for gold mining in the Yaque del Sur farming area. He notes that mining would negatively impact water sources in San Juan de la Maguana, Elías Piña, Bahoruco and other communities.
Despradel has been opposing the operations of GoldQuest that he says wants to install operations for the Romero project three kilometers from the Sabaneta Dam. “There is a water crisis in San Juan, where this year we have only been able to have one harvest of beans because of serious irrigation problems. If the mine is installed, the producers will go bankrupt and the community will enter into crisis,” said the Alianza País deputy. Despradel says there are no guarantees that the processed wastes from the mining operation will not affect the waters in the area.
Hotel and restaurant workers protest at ProComsumidor
Dozens of employees of hotels and restaurants demonstrated on Wednesday, 1 August 2017, in front of the ProConsumidor, the consumer defense body of the government. They protested the move by ProConsumidor to eliminate the obligatory 10% charge on food and beverage consumptions. The Superior Administrative Court recently ordered that the 10% not be levied on takeout orders, but kept the surcharge for deliveries.
Carrying signs and escorted by members of the National Police, cooks, delivery men, bartenders and cooks demanded for the reversal of these policies. Alexis Matos, the spokesman for the group, said that the income from the obligatory tip is a vital supplement to the low salaries they receive and under no circumstance are they willing to have the 10% removed from their wages.
Asonahores asks Senate to reject proposal affecting long weekends
The leadership of the Hotel and Tourism Association of the Dominican Republic (Asonahores) has called the recent effort to eliminate Law 0139–97, “a stab in the heart for domestic tourism.” Law 139–97 allows for movable days of certain holidays, such as Labor Day or Constitution Day. The moving of these creates long weekends that stimulate domestic tourism.
Asonahores says similar moves to change the law in 2014 were rejected by the Senate. Asonahores again trusts this legislation will also not pass into law.
What is known is that some deputies are trying to obtain a ban to moving religious holidays as well as others, and this means the reversal of the current law.
The current law defines five holidays that are not movable: 1 and 21 January, 27 February, 24 September and 25 December. There are five days that are moved to Monday when they coincide with the workday, and these are: 6 January (Three Kings Day), 26 January (Duarte’s birthday), 1 May (Labor Day), Restoration Day (16 August – when it does not coincide with a presidential inauguration), and 6 November (Constitution Day).
If the Senate were to approve these changes suggested by the Chamber of Deputies, only two days would be movable: 16 August and 6 November. This would reduce the positive impact of the law on the economy that was enacted in June 1997 by President Leonel Fernandez.
Accident leaves thousands without electricity in Santiago
A major traffic accident on the Duarte Highway, some 10 km before reaching the city of Santiago, knocked out electricity for thousands of homes and businesses in the area. According to EdeNorte, the accident occurred at 5pm and forced EdeNorte to shut down the Cana 103 and Cana 108 circuits. Because of this, there was no electricity in Canabacoa, Colorado, Arenoso, Laguna Prieta, Guayabal and Tavera. Those residing on the road to the Tavera Dam, businesses along Duarte Highway between the entrance to Moca and the entrance to the Cibao International Airport were also affected.
EdeNorte reported that minutes after the accident occurred, technicians began repairs to restore power within 12 hours.
Bernardo Castellanos returns to face Odebrecht charges
The 14th man who faces charges in the Odebrecht bribes case arrived yesterday, 2 August 2017 from Panama to Las Americas International Airport and was awaited by National District prosecutors who arrested him. Castellanos spent his first night at the jail of the National District prosecutors offices. His lawyer Marino Elsevyf said the arrest was illegal and arbitrary because the arrest order was not issued by the judge who is preparing the case. Castellanos had been summoned to appear in court on Friday, 4 August.
Because he was abroad, Castellanos’ case will be heard separately from the 13 others charged in the Odebrecht bribes case. The others are Temístocles Montás, Víctor Díaz Rúa, Conrado Pittaluga, Andrés Bautista, Ruddy González, César Sánchez, Máximo De Óleo, Radhamés Segura, Roberto Rodríguez Hernández, Julio César Valentín, Tommy Alberto Galán and Alfredo Pacheco.
Bernardo Castellanos was director for hydroelectric projects for the Empresa de Generación Hidroeléctrica Dominicana (EgeHID) from 2000 to 2004. The Attorney General accuses him of having received money from Odebrecht lobbyist Angel Rondón to give a favorable opinion on the construction of the Pinalito hydroelectric. Castellanos said that the construction of Pinalito began after he left the post. He said he acted as a technician, without a role in the Public Electricity Corporation (CDEEE) and thus did not have a deciding vote in the implementation of the project.
Marcha Verde accuses government of using violence against movement
On Wednesday, 2 August 2017, the civic group called March Verde accused the government of trying to instill fear in the population and especially in members of their organization. In a press communiqué, the Marcha Verde lamented the death of a FALPO leader in San Francisco de Macoris as well as police aggression and the use of riot police against members of Los Cañeros in the National District. Marcha Verde calls for a full investigation into the incident in San Francisco de Macoris.
Specifically, the movement singled out the death of one of the principal leaders of the “Broad Front of Popular Struggle” (FALPO) in San Francisco de Macoris during a 48-hour public demonstration as a sign that the authorities are trying to intimidate people gathering to peacefully protest.
The Marcha Verde says there is no way to justify the tear gas attack against Los Cañeros since the movement is well known for years for expressing its opinions in an organized and pacific manner.
This Sunday, 6 August, there will be a march in the town of Nagua, the provincial capital of Maria Trinidad Sanchez province.
Forensic report reveals shot was from a “chilena”
General Nelson Rosario, the spokesman for the National Police, told a press conference on Wednesday afternoon that the shot that killed Vladimir Baldera (El Cacu), came from a homemade weapon called a “chilena” and was fired from a short distance away. General Rosario said that the investigation and forensic work had been headed by the director of Internal Affairs, General Garcia Cuevas, as well as inspector General Sarita.
Rosario indicated that the preliminary examination determined that police agents who were on duty in the area were some two blocks away from the place where the FALPO leader Baldera was shot and killed. He added that according to information gathered by the police commission that is investigating the incident, at the moment that the FALPO leader was shot there were no disturbances. They are also trying to find out if it is true that the shot that killed the popular leader was carried out by two hooded men, as some eyewitnesses are claiming.
The death of the FALPO leader caused members of the Marcha Verde to protest against government violence. It also caused the state university to close for a day after classes on the campus with the Police.
Samana prosecutor fired for sexual harassment
News commentators are wondering how such a person could have been named prosecutor, but regardless, it took the Judicial Branch over a year to fire Samana prosecutor Robert Francis Justo Bobadilla, after seven women, including four employees, accused him of sexual harassment.
The firing took place on Tuesday, 1 August 2017, by the Inspectoría de la Procuraduría General de la República after witnesses appeared before the Disciplinary Council of the Public Ministry. Four Samana prosecutor office employees filed the sexual harassment claim against him for obliging them to have sex with him at their workplace.
Another of the pieces of evidence was an interview TV investigative journalist Alicia Ortega had done with one of his victims for her El Informe program. The woman said she suffered sexual aggression when she went to file a claim for gender violence at the prosecutor office.
Justo Bobadilla defended himself alleging a group of lawyers who were angered by his recent decisions had orchestrated the women’s sexual harassment stories. The group of lawyers was supposedly upset with Bobadilla when the prosecutor aggressively pursued charges against drug traffickers who supposedly had connections to officials.
But the Disciplinary Council of the Public Ministry declared him at fault for committing serious violations in the exercise of his duties and ordered that he not be allowed to hold office in the Public Ministry or any other government post for five years.
Justo Bobadilla may now tried in court to answer the sexual harassment charges against him.
Police recover lots of cash from home robbery
The National Police reported have recovered RD$2.5 million and US$2,000 of a reported US$223,000 of cash reported stolen during a robbery of residence. In addition, vehicles, household goods, jewelry and cell phones were reportedly stolen by a gang of thieves on 17 July 2017.
The robbery report was filed by Vanessa Peña, daughter of government officer Evergito Peña Acosta, administrative and financial director of the Consejo Nacional para el Cambio Climatico. Peña is the brother of chief of the Armada in the Dominican Republic, Vice Admiral Miguel Enrique Peña Acosta.
The Police say six suspects have been arrested, and one is still at large.
Judge José Alejandro Vargas ordered three months pre-trial custody for Otto Gaspar Féliz Alcántara, at La Victoria jail. Others receiving pre-trial custody were Matías Goiscou Vargas (Keko), and Junior Correa González (Cuba). The Police confiscated a vehicle Coiscou Vargas had recently purchased for RD$600,000 at a dealer.
The Police say arrested in the case are Jorge Luis Valdez Figuereo, lover of the Los Ríos house maid Deyanira Barrera Bravo; also Salvador Antonio López (Pinguilo); Junior Correa González (Cuba), who were arrested in Bonao; and Matías Coiscou Vargas (Keko).
The file on the case explains that on Tuesday, 17 July, around 9:30am, Vanessa Raquel Peña Rodríguez was at work when she received a call from a person interested in buying her vehicle. She showed the vehicle to Matías Coiscou Vargas, who was accompanied by supposed mechanics. These ‘mechanics’ requested to test drive the vehicle. Minutes later, the ‘mechanics’ returned and forced her to take them to her home where they committed the robbery at Calle Mao 14, Los Ríos.
As reported, Coiscou Vargas went with Vanessa to the bedroom from where the objects were stolen as well as the US$223,000 that were in a suitcase belonging to her father.
Earthquake recorded in San Jose de Ocoa
A 4.2 Richter scale magnitude earthquake was reported at 5:25pm with its epicenter some 12 km north of central San José de Ocoa city, at a depth of 10 kilometers. The earthquake was felt as a moderate shake in Santo Domingo.
The Seismological Institute of the Santo Domingo Autonomous University (UASD) said the earthquake was felt in Santo Domingo and beyond. They had initial reports from as far northeast as Cotuí. It was felt strongly in Los Alcarrizos, San Cristóbal, Monte Plata, Azua and Baní.
UASD seismologist Félix Martínez told El Caribe that the earthquake occurred at 18.6 latitude north and 70.4 longitude west.
The USGS originally reported the earthquake at 4.7 magnitude, but later reduced this to 4.3 magnitude.
Rough seas and rains
According to the National Weather Office (Onamet), abnormally high seas along the Atlantic and Caribbean coastline as well as thunderstorms will be affecting the island. From Barahona to La Romana swells are expected to be over 8 feet and in the Atlantic from La Altagracia to Puerto Plata, some 7-foot swells are expected. Small boat warnings are in effect. Bathers at the nation’s beaches in these areas should also be aware of the abnormal waves that can produce dangerous rip tides.
Forecaster José Medina predicted thunderstorms for La Altagracia, El Seibo, La Romana, San Pedro de Macoris, Monte Plata, Samana, San Cristobal, Peravia, Azua and Barahona as a result of a tropical wave that is crossing the national territory.

© 2015 Delta Presbyterian ChurchAge: 29
Laboratory technician Christopher Edwards and his younger sisters Gail and Anne were keen members of the local church. Chris also had interests in music, computers and football, and loved playing golf with his father, Sydney, every week.
Sydney Edwards told the inquests: "I often wonder to this day about the family life he could have had, had his life not been cut short. The only comfort I have is that Chris experienced what it was like to be loved, and lived his life to the full."
My son, Christopher Edwards, was born on May 11, 1959. He was our first born and he was followed by his sisters Gail and Anne. Chris was 29 years old when he was taken from us.
Chris mixed extremely well with the children in the neighbourhood and at our church. Chris and his siblings went to church every Sunday and sang in the choir, Chris becoming head choir boy. He had a beautiful voice, which we did not appreciate until he sang Silent Night at our social club's Christmas lunch. He must have been 11 or 12 at the time.
Towards the later part of Christopher's secondary education, he joined a small musical group and performed at school shows. Chris loved spending time at church and enjoyed ringing the church bells with his sisters. According to our daughter Anne, they swung off the ropes like monkeys.
As Chris spent a lot of his time at church, he often looked after the local parishioners' children. His sisters describe how he watched football in the vicarage with the vicar, while the other kids enjoyed themselves around the church pews and in the aisles.
Chris had such a dry sense of humour. I remember an occasion when we were all sat in church and Chris popped up and said to us all, "My name is on that wall". My heart dropped, as I thought he may have written his name on the church wall with a marker pen, but what he was actually referring to was the names of the saints on the stained glass window, one of which was St Christopher. Religion was important to Chris, and he was still very close to his friends from church at the time of his death.
Chris was well liked at school. He achieved good academic results throughout his school. His final report stated that he was 'a pupil on good terms with his fellow students, teachers and achievements'. After leaving school, Chris gained a position as a junior laboratory technician after many interviews and obtained a senior position after four years working and studying. We were very proud of his achievement.
Chris' love of football came from me. I introduced him to the game by taking him to see Liverpool around the age of eight or nine, years before he became an avid supporter. I, along with a group of other dads, took our sons to the match after work on a Saturday and Chris got the bug from that point.
Anfield truly became his second home. As Chris grew older, his support for Liverpool took him abroad to the away games. He even went as far as Canada, where our relations were.
Chris was the type of person that would never miss an opportunity and made the most of his life, quietly enjoying it as he went along. Being able to travel abroad and watch his favourite team was just one illustration of that.
Chris was also a fan of playing video games. As a teenager and when computer games became all the craze, he played on his game console and listened to music on headphones as a way to relax.
Music was another joy in his life. Like any other lad of that time, he liked the up and coming music, like Status Quo, The Weird and Wonderful, The Communards and The Flock of Seagulls. I remember him sitting in the living room and recording the Top 40 by holding a microphone to the radio. As he got older, he joined a record club and had an ever-increasing vinyl collection, which today is in our loft at home.
He was such a skinny lad, though he loved his food and especially his mother's cooking. He used to make us laugh because when he went to the Chinese and ordered a meal, he always used to ask for a small packet of chips so he could eat them on his walk home before the main meal. It was ironic, because we only lived 70 yards away. The owners sent us a condolence card after Chris' passing and for weeks we couldn't work out who it was from. It just goes to show how well he was liked.
Chris was the apple of his mother's eye. He was not only her only son, but the first born in two generations. His nan shared this precious love of him and spoilt him rotten. Nothing was too much for our Chris and even his sisters shared the same sentiments, with him running to Anne's house to get his washing done and Gail's to cut his hair.
That being said, Chris was always there for them in return. Chris was a witness at his sister's, Anne's, wedding and godfather to her first child, Kelly. Anne recalls the time when she miscarried and Chris came to the hospital with a bunch of fuchsias and a box of Milk Tray. He also kept her company when she went through a divorce from her husband by taking care of Kelly and joining them on holiday. This allowed Anne time to get to know him all over again.
During his 20s, Chris got into golf and eventually travelled all over the world playing with his friends, but it was also something we shared together. Every Monday we would play together at the local course. It was our time, memories that I will cherish.
I would tease him and ask him when he was going to get married, but he always said, "Not yet". His mother and nan always gave me a ticking-off when I asked our Chris whether he was ever going to tie the knot. As much as it was a joke then, I often wonder to this day about the family life he could have had, had his life not been cut short.
The only comfort I have is that Chris experienced what it was like to be loved and lived his life to the full.
Rest in PeaceSkinny Dipping in the creek
Last weekend my sister and nephew were in town for the kids' birthday party. Sunday before they flew back to Louisiana we took a walk down to the creek behind my mom's house to do some fishing. The water is crystal clear so we could see right where to put our bait in. After we were done fishing the kids decided to do some swimming sans swim wear. The water was really cold but it was a beautiful day and we weren't going to waste the moment.Since all the princes have had an episode focusing on them, I assumed this episode would be more broad so to speak. I certainly wasn’t surprised to see Count Rosenberg again, now wondering which prince he’s going to try and hurt next. Based on a brief skimming on the episode, it seems we’ll finally get an explanation for some of the rumors Heine gathered about Prince Kai.
Heine and Kai are called into King Viktor’s office, and find Bruno there waiting for them as well. Viktor informs Heine that aside from being groomed for the throne, Granzreich princes have traditionally been sent to military school at age 15. But due to a certain incident a year ago, this tradition has been put on hold. Viktor then shows Heine a tabloid article in that day’s paper exposing “the second prince’s violent episode.” According to the article, Kai and Bruno were enrolled in military school a year ago and used their positions to dominate the school, skipping classes and military exercises. Teachers were supposedly threatened into giving them top grades and anyone who challenged them was beaten into submission. Their tyranny ended when a student, identified as Student R, was found with serious injuries and Kai caught “red-handed” at the scene, thus unleashing the rumor of his violent temper. As a result, Kai was formally suspended and Bruno took a leave of absence, though Student R received an expulsion and claimed to still suffer under “pressure of the state’s power.”
Bruno is quick to argue to article’s inaccuracy, and Heine admits that he’d heard the rumors prior to arriving at the palace but quickly dismissed them upon meeting Kai. Frustrated by the article, Bruno wishes they could crush the newspaper but Viktor reminds him that the citizens have freedom of thought and speech even if they don’t like their speech. Kai then admits there is truth in the fact that he did attack the unnamed student, but Bruno interjects that Kai only did it to protect him. Heine then asks for the true details about the incident and they agree.
Kai was in his second year at the school. Due to his appearance, everyone avoided him but he was able to attend class with no problems. One day, he meets up with Bruno to head home and notices his brother attempting to hide an injury. Bruno insists it was an accident during sword practice and that his sparring partner had already apologized, and Kai seems to believe him. However the next week, Kai notices a bruise on Bruno’s wrist, which the latter again attributes to sword practice and insists there’s nothing to worry about. The “accidents” keep occurring until one day Bruno fails to meet up with Kai after class. Overhearing some other students wondering how long “he” was going to bother with the prince, Kai goes looking for Bruno and finds him in a warehouse being beaten by another student claiming that he’ll toughen up the “soft royal.” Enraged at his brother’s treatment, Kai beats up the student who manages a few blows himself, despite Bruno’s protests. Both Kai and the student were badly injured and were respectively suspended and expelled. In addition, Leonhard and Licht’s admissions to military were put on hold and Bruno took a sabbatical.
Bruno adds that the student, now identified as Ralf von Fuchs, hated them for being royals and thus took out his frustrations on them. Viktor tells Heine that both the police and school investigated the incident at the time and confirmed the princes’ side of the story. He adds that he has already sent a letter of protest to the paper and warns his sons that they’ll likely be subjected to whispers and insults until the issue is resolved. Before returning the paper, Heine notices a second tabloid alleging that a criminal has managed to slip into the palace, though Viktor assures him that he’s been keeping a close eye on it since returning to the palace.
The princes and tutor take their leave and Bruno expresses his frustration that they can’t do anything about what the newspaper writes. Kai then asks Bruno if he knows where Ralf von Fuchs lives, saying he wants to try talking to him. Even though most of the article is unfounded, Kai believes they must’ve talked to sources (most likely Fuchs) and wants to ask Fuchs to have the paper correct the untrue parts. Bruno insists that Fuchs isn’t the type to hear them out, but Kai tells him that as royals they should be willing to talk with anyone. Heine reminds Kai that Fuchs may attack him, but the prince vows that he won’t raise a hand against Fuchs again. The petit professor accepts his resolve, but insists on going with him as an intermediary. Taking guards Maximilian and Ludwig as escorts, Heine and Kai prepare to head off. Kai confides that since he’s started getting along with the palace staff, he’d hate if they began avoiding him again because of the article. Just then, some of the servants appear and express their faith in him, believing that he’s truly a gentle soul, and that they’ll support him no matter what. Kai smiles and thanks them (though his smile once again briefly frightens them).
Later, they arrive at Fuchs’s estate. Heine tells Kai to wait isn’t he carriage while he and Ludwig find out if Fuchs will even agree to see them. Fuchs opens the door barely a crack, initially mistaking Heine for a child (for once, Heine actually seems peeved about that). Heine and Ludwig explain that Kai wants to speak to him regarding the article and that he deeply regrets their previous encounter. Fuchs opens the door to let them in and Heine excuses himself to fetch Kai. He returns with Kai and Maximilian to find Ludwig has disappeared, though Fuchs tells them he went to the bathroom. He escorts them into the parlor where he offers a toy soldier to Heine and suggests he play outside. After Heine once again protests being called a child, Kai asks Fuchs why he hurt Bruno back then. Fuchs reveals that he and his friends had heard rumors that royal could do anything they wanted at military school without fear of being punished and that they got top marks without trying. To him, Bruno seemed to hold true those rumors. Kai explains that Bruno was merely smart and never disobeyed and he himself never got top marks, but Fuchs asserts that he was good enough to at the top. He adds that the instructors were always reserved around them, so much so that they often lashed out at the other students. Fuchs and his friends vented about it every day and just got more and more heated.
He admits that he regrets what he did back and that he doesn’t expect Kai to forgive him. Kai apologizes for responding with and brings out the newspaper, asking Fuchs if he knew about the article. Fuchs recalls a reporter asking about the incident but he’d decline to answer them, assuming that the newspaper must’ve written the article as a result. Kai assures Fuchs that he doesn’t want to blame anyone, but that he wants his help so people can hear the real story. Fuchs offers his hand in apology but before Kai can accept, Fuchs withdraws and pulls out a gun. He calls his goons to toss the visitors in the cellar and confiscate any weapons they may have. After taking Heine’s pointer (which they think is a riding crop), the trio is chained to a shelf of wine casks and Fuchs remarks how easy it was to trick them. He then reveals his intention to hold them for ransom and that the newspaper really was his doing, claiming it wasn’t too much of a stretch. Heine asks how he intends to explain the situation to his family when they return, but Fuchs tells them his family all but disowned him following his expulsion, calling him a disgrace to the family name.
He then proceeds to take a photo of them for the ransom, but they respond by making ridiculous faces one photo after another. Frustrated, Fuchs pulls out a blade claiming there was nothing to keep him from hurting Kai. However finding no trace of fear on the prince’s face, he turns to Heine instead. Once again enraged by Fuchs’s provocation, Kai breaks free of his chains and moves to strike Fuchs but stops short upon remembering his promise to the people in his life. Fuchs then turns on Kai again only to be stopped by Heine using his own chain to catch Fuchs’s blade and in turn cuffing him to the shelves. Upon hearing the commotion, Fuchs’s goons arrive on the scene and Heine declares they are in need of “educational guidance.” While Maximilian protects Kai, Heine takes care of the goons, dodging their blows and dealing a few choice ones of his own. Reclaiming his pointer, he points a gun at the last goon but only shoots out a string of flags, saying that since Kai managed to restrain himself, he couldn’t go beyond “appropriate self defense.”
Just then, Ludwig shows up, having been previously captured by more of Fuchs’s goons but managed to escape to return to the palace for backup. Though disappointed for the “adventure” to be over, he apprehends Fuchs who claims he isn’t any worse off than before. Kai then suggests that someday Fuchs should come to the palace and apply for a job as a palace guard once he’s paid for his crimes, saying it’d be the best way for him to put his military school studies to use. Asking if the offer meant Kai would forgive him, the prince replies that he can’t but that he believes everyone deserves a chance to start over if they want, and that’s how he thinks the kingdom should be. Heine then asks Fuchs where he heard the rumors about the princes, who says he “probably” heard it from a friend of his parents.
The next day in town, Heine is approached by Count Rosenberg who tells the educator he has something to ask regarding his past.
Honestly, I had completely forgotten about the rumors about Kai, so I hadn’t expected an explanation for it. I certainly didn’t think it had anything to do with abuse from another student. But it’s always nice to see conflict resolved. While Heine fights Fuchs’s goons, we catch a glimpse of a similar flashback that seems to be Heine protecting a younger Viktor. Perhaps this means we’ll finally get some insight into Heine’s secret origins and his friendship with King Viktor. Based on the episode preview, looks like we’ll find out just how much Rosenberg knows about Heine and it seems we’ll get to meet some of Adele’s little friends. And based on the title, I have a feeling the princes’ regard for their tutor may drastically change.Friday Charts and News
This is probably due to the fact that the US has decided to make peaceful overtures to Iran and the fact that we are seeing demand destruction here in the U.S. and in other Western nations. However ...
* So far, demand destruction is NOT accelerating. Mastercard says U.S. retail gasoline demand plummeted more than 5 percent last week compared to the same week last year. But Mastercard's April 8th figures showed a 6.8% decline from the same point last year. So, according to Mastercard's measure, demand destruction slowed down from April to June.
Keep in mind that Mastercard only tracks credit card sales at the gas pump. Some retailers are now demanding payment in cash or offering discounts for cash payments. So Mastercard is probably undermeasuring gasoline sales. Still, this shows the inelasticity of demand comes in to play and mitigates demand destruction, even as prices go higher.* Global demand is still rising. If US demand destruction continues at 5% or even 10% per year, but global demand continues to grow, we're in trouble. IRecent figures are cause for alarm: China June auto sales up 15% year on year, India May sales up 14% year on year.

old. Except for Pipe o’ Peace on Halstead and 131st, there
weren’t places blacks could play in Chicago, so my stepfather
and three other blacks would drive an hour or so to Wicker
Park in Indiana, which had a golf course and an amusement
park. I’d hit a few balls on the range; then they’d put their
bags—big huge Burton bags—on pullcarts. I’d pull one around
for nine holes, and then, while they played the back nine, I’d
go on the rides, like the carousel. Today Pipe o’ Peace is called
Joe Louis “The Champ” GC, named after my dad [the former
world heavyweight champion].
˘ Growing up, after my mother and father divorced, I
didn’t get many chances to see my dad. When I did, it was
usually truncated. Lunch. Dinner. With a group of friends.
With my sister. But one day, when I was in my 20s, was
different. I’d flown to Vegas to play in the Frontier Airlines
Pro-Am Invitational. When I checked into Caesar’s Palace,
where my dad was working at the time, he came up to me
and put his hand on my shoulder. It was the first time Joe
Louis had ever greeted his son. The next day we played a
practice round at the Las Vegas Hilton course. Four hours,
he and I together in a cart. He talked about the [Max]
Schmeling fight, the [Billy] Conn fight, about who he was.
But more importantly, he talked about who I was, about
how things were going for me as a banker. It was one of the
most memorable days I ever had with him. It was the day
he really became a father to me.
˘ My parents’ best advice to me was: Be successful.
Don’t settle for second-best. Whatever the endeavor, be at
the top of your game. That’s who I am.
˘ I never boxed. Shortly after I was born, my father told
the media that if I ever tried, he had a good right [-hand
punch], and he’d use it.
˘ [Black golf pioneer] Ted Rhodes was a friend of my
father’s. I called him Uncle Ted. He was such a gentleman,
always dressed to the nines. I don’t remember his swing
clearly, other than it was silky. It pained me that he wasn’t
allowed to play the PGA Tour when he was at the pinnacle
of his game. The game would have been well served if he’d
have been allowed to play the tour.
˘ I don’t use notes when I speak publicly. The key for me
is to always speak from the heart. It’s OK to use notes, but
you still have to speak from the heart. Audiences tune out
when you don’t. They can tell from the get-go.
˘ The First Tee is important because it’s an opportunity
for young people to experience the game and determine
what golf gives them. It gives participants values—such as
honesty, perseverance, respect, judgment—that are important to golf and important to life.
˘ The First Tee is in 6,600 schools in 800 districts. We
teach some 6,000 educators. The fact is 90 percent of those
educators did not have golf in their lives before, and now
they are seeing their students change because of it. For a
lot of them, their image of the game is The First Tee. Golf is
presented in a different light. It’s not about wealth or exclusiveness. It’s not all about white males. It’s about females,
diversity—young people—experiencing the game in ways
they previously could not or did not.
˘ Hack Golf has the potential to give us two or three
ideas. Not necessarily ideas we haven’t already thought
about, but good ideas. Things like FootGolf at Haggin Oaks
in Sacramento or what’s going on at The First Tee’s Miami
chapter, where they’re building bigger holes where soccer
balls can actually enter.
˘ Part of the issue of growing the game is reducing the
time and cost that keeps people from committing. The key
is the facility operator and whether he or she is willing to
try new things. Those of us who are industry leaders can
pontificate about what has to happen, but if the operator
isn’t going to make the change, it’s not going to happen.

˘ I had a stroke last Nov. 23. I was in Palm Beach Gardens for the AJGA’s annual meeting. At the office they call
it The Glitch, and The Glitch was a wake-up call. It’s made
me reflect on what’s important. I have a realism that I didn’t

Muppets Most Wanted is going to be two hours of non-stop laughter, I'm sure. Tina Fey, Christoph Waltz, Salma Hayek, Lady Gaga, Stanley Tucci, Zack Galifianakis and Ricky Gervais all in one movie, along with Kermit and Miss Piggy? I'm loving it already!

Animal is our favourite. He is spazzy like us. :)

Gonzo has always been my favourite muppet!
My favourite is Fozzie Bear!
I like Kermit the frog. :)
Kermit for sure
Animal...all the way!! :D
Kermit all the way!!!
My favourite is no doubt Kermit
My personal favorite is a toss between Kermit (I love frogs) and Gonzo (just... weird guy, I guess I relate).
The wife's favorite would be Animal. I'm thinking she relates to the whole "emotionally unstable" thing. I'm sure she'd agree with me, then not.
Daughter's in LOVE with Miss Piggy - the bling, the dresses...
It has to be Fozzie. He's always trying to make people laugh.
I love love Miss Piggy!!! I used to LOVE animal as a kid!!
OMG my fave is ANIMAL!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thanks

Kermit!

Kermie - definitely my fave!
I think I would have to pick Gonzo.

Council bosses planned to fence off a green outside homes in Otterburn Gardens, Low Fell, Gateshead, to stop children's balls going into residents' gardens.
But a contractor went ahead without the green light - and put the 80ft long, 3ft high fence down the middle.
Property owners are so upset they have nick-named the area Otterberlin Gardens and say the fence is like the Berlin Wall. They have even called the ends of it Check Point Charlie and elected neighbours for guard duty.
Gateshead Council said they had received complaints from residents about balls and were planning to go ahead with construction of the fence.
But the contractor, who was on standby to build the wrought iron fence once residents had been informed, went ahead without the council's final say-so and erected it in the wrong place, cutting the green almost in half.
Now homeowners are furious and say it is an eyesore. "We never wanted the fence in the first place but this slices the green in two," said mum-of-two Trish Murphy, 44. "The green was so pretty before and now this makes it look terrible. It will not stop kids from playing ball games."
Phil Ward, 43, a father of two, said: "We now have an east and west divide. It is like the Berlin Wall. This fence serves no purpose. it's bureaucracy gone mad. It must have cost at least #1,500 to build this fence and it is terrible."
Gary Taylor, 40, a builder, said: "This fence is absolutely hideous and it carves up the view. Most people have bought their houses because of the green and it is now spoilt. The fence does not stop children from playing, it is now more of a hazard for them."
Gateshead Council was inundated with calls from furious residents. The contractor, who the council has not disclosed, has been told to remove it from near the middle of the green and transfer it to the sloping edge to stop balls from rolling into people's gardens.
Kate Israel, head of Community Support for Gateshead Council, said: "The contractor has installed the fence without our knowledge, before they were asked to do so and before we have had the chance to contact local residents. And, what's worse, they have erected it in the wrong place. We can only apologise to residents."A friend of friend exposes a corrections officer who is now facing bigamy charges. Washington authorities say, a man using Facebook found that that she and a potential "friend" were married to him at the same time to the same man.
According to the documents discovered Alan L. O'Neill, had married a women in 2001 and moved out in 2009. O'Neill had changed his name and remarried without divorcing the other woman.
Wife number 1 had noticed on her Facebook page had recommended her as people you may know, wife number 1 went to wife number's 2 page she had noticed a picture of wife number 2 with her husband. The man in the photo was also her husband. Wife number 1 then calls the O'Neil's mother and within an hour later, wife number 2 shows up on her door step saying, she had asked him several times if he was divorced.
O'Neil went to wife number one and asked her not to report him to authorities, that he would do everything possible to fix the situation. However, wife number 1 went to the authorities anyway.
That should be used as example of what exposing your whole life on Facebook will get you when you have a bitter ex and a Facebook or many other posts you may think are simple can land you in a lot of hot water. Some people will never learn about posting their whole life on Facebook.For the first time since they were sentenced last September, brothers Stewart and Michael Parnell are in federal prisons.

Rev. Christine Bellefeuille '82 and Ted Olson '82 with their family at the holidays.
Without Concordia, the Rev. Christine Bellefeuille '82 and Ted Olson '82 wouldn't be where they are today, and they show their thanks in any way possible.
Since graduation, Chris has held a seat on the Board of Regents and Alumni Board and the two come back for Homecoming and class reunions. Their post-graduation experiences with Concordia have simply solidified their own commitment to the college.
Chris explains, "The more you can get students in front of alumni, the better. That connection opens up so many opportunities for both alumni and students."
As a 10-year member of the Board of Regents, she introduced many prospective students to Concordia and values the connection.
The couple values giving and the mission of Concordia College. Supporting the college financially is important to the couple as it embraces both.
Chris challenges her peers to step up and become donors. She says, "We hope our leadership will inspire others to give. Concordia made us feel like we mattered, and that our giving mattered."

Some airlines even want to charge for additional carry-on bags (if they do, I’ll post an article on how to pack everything into a duffel bag for a one week vacation). Meanwhile, here’s a handy list for singles, couples, and families of how to pack all that you really need and avoid paying checked bag fees once and for all.
Buy New Luggage
Modern luggage is extremely light (a child can lift even the biggest case) and more space conscious that those clunky travel bags your aunt gave you. Newer luggage is designed to “beat the system” with a bigger interior and a streamlined exterior. Most even have an “expandable” option, so you can comfortably fit even more inside and still be well within airline guidelines. I recommend hardside carry-ons because they easily fit into the overhead compartment.
You can fit tons of stuff inside, despite its smaller appearance. Heavy items like sneakers, jeans, and sweaters as well as tons of swimwear and summer clothes will fit along with assorted items like laptops and books.
Newer luggage is also easier to manage because of features like multi-directional wheel configuration, so you can wheel it upright in any direction, rather than dragging it behind you like a peddler. This feature comes in handy in awkward locations and helps you to run to your gate more quickly. You can also fit a large tote bag on top of it and roll both at once, saving wear and tear on your arms.
Also, if you are traveling on your own, the newer hardsides are very easy to manage even if you have 2 or 3 bags, so make a small investment to save space, effort, and of course, money.
Learn From Packing Pros
You can find luggage packing videos on Youtube and I strongly suggest you watch them. Louis Vuitton has posted videos on how to efficiently pack every conceivable type of luggage. They’ve been doing it for over 200 years, so they know what they know what they’re talking about. If you must bring unusual items, you can find effective packing videos from professional movers and storage companies. Take their advice seriously. Taking 15 minutes to learn to pack better can save you a lot of space and money. It may take some practice to perfect those sharp folds on your clothes, but will be well worth it.
Also, if for some reason, airport security needs to search your bag or you need to get something, it’s much easier to find in a neatly organized travel bag.
List It or Leave It
Make a list of what you are going to need. Many websites offer travel check-lists to help you avoid bringing unnecessary items. TripAdvisor.com offers customers the chance to ask questions – take advantage of this feature to ask other travelers who have visited your same destination what to bring. Do you really need a beach chair if your hotel offers them? Why bring toiletries if your hotel will give them to you for free?
Ask yourself, “What’s the worst that will happen if I don’t pack XYZ?”
Write or type up a realistic list of things you actually need (i.e. prescriptions) and things you can leave behind. Keep the list attached to your luggage so when it’s time to pack you know exactly what goes and what stays.
Share A Bag
If you are traveling with people, try to bring one large piece of luggage (again I recommend a large, expandable hardside) and pack everything inside. That way, everyone can split the cost of a checked bag fee. But don’t become a space hog and try to pack more.
A large, expandable hardside can fit an enormous amount of shoes, clothes, electronics, and assorted vacation items, but if you overfill it, you will incur the dreaded “overweight” charge, so be sensible, share your luggage space, and split the cost.
You can pack your items in an airtight vacuum bag so they don’t get mixed in with others.
Get Ready To Fly!
Don’t feel deprived because you can’t bring the family tuba or 5 changes of clothes a day. Instead celebrate the opportunity to become one of those super-efficient business travelers, who seamlessly float through airports with a simple business case and garment bag.
Take essential items, get plenty of advice from travel websites and remember, the lighter you travel, the less you have to re-pack on your return trip!Intercultural communication
This workshop focuses on intercultural communication. Many factors are at stake when interacting with people from a different background, such as other values, power distance, the amount of uncertainty avoidance, decision-making practices, and an understanding of how members of the group communicate - verbally, non-verbally, in person, in writing, and in various business and social contexts.
Leila Jaffar will show video examples of cultural differences and analyse them with the audience. She will give tips for communicating with people from other countries, ranging from feedback to reaching an agreement.

It's watercolour on drawing paper, so it buckled and waved quite a bit as different areas got wet. That created a bit of an issue when i was trying to frame it, which turned out to be more frustrating than painting it.
The painting process began with flicking red paint on the flat paper. My original intention was to make it a Jackson Pollack-ish style drip painting. I haven't developed a great way to do that with a watercolor brush yet so i wasn't getting enough coverage to create much of a painting.
My next step was to make big really wet blotches and then to tilt the paper so the wet spot would run. I did several blotches in all four directions and ended up with a bit of a multi-paned window pattern.
Then i tried to fill in all the white areas but excluding the area immeadiately around my splatter dots. So in effect the dots would have little white halos. I filled some areas with warmer red and some with a cooler red. I added a bit of blue to some wet red areas to create even cooler areas, but they turned out pretty much blue.
I used a tiny brush so it took at least a couple hours to paint this. But that's about it and how it was created.
When i take pictures of these paintings i need to include a grey card so a colour balance can be done. I wish i had documented the process of the painting, but that's the idea for future paintings.
This painting reminds me of a tissue cut we do at the lab I now work at. I've always thought these cuts of tissue would make lovely pieces of art!! It's lovely, I really like it! I had no idea you were getting into painting. I remember photography... but most artist can play around with many mediums and it looks like you are one of them!

Enviros Seek to Preclude Affirmative Defenses in Clean Air Act Citizen Suits
On April 18, 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit upheld Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations setting emission standards for hazardous air pollutants from cement kilns but struck down an affirmative defense that protected cement plant operators from civil penalties in private citizen suits if the exceedances resulted from “unavoidable…… Read… Read… Read More »The Beverley Hills apartment buildings are curious, full of character, and to be honest, a little out of place. Situated on the banks of the Yarra River, with Melbourne’s gleaming city skyline beyond, these buildings channel a kind of faded Hollywood glamour, and are often the subject of intrigue for passers by, inspiring a certain level of curiosity about those who might live here, and the stories from bygone years which might have unfolded within these walls.
Constructed by architect and developer Howard Lawson between 1935 and 1936, the Beverley Hills complex comprises two separate buildings, and as the name suggests, the development has a distinctly international flavour, referencing a 1930’s Hollywood / Spanish revival aesthetic, with ornate stairwells and windows, almost gothic detailing and stuccoed walls. With an impressive outdoor pool and lush gardens overflowing with palms, vines and creepers, this is about as close as Melbourne gets to LA, or perhaps even Barcelona, aesthetically speaking.
Young couple Ellie King (an illustrator, designer and proprietor of online shop Pieces 4 Places) and her partner Cale Sexton, a musician, have lived in this apartment for just four months. They took over the lease from close friends, who actually moved into another apartment in the same building. It’s not uncommon, when apartments become available here, for them to be quickly snapped up via word of mouth, or for tenants to move from one apartment to another. ‘Beverley Hills is definitely a place where it helps to know someone that lives here if you what to rent a place’ says Ellie. ‘It’s run by a wonderful man named Don. You gotta get past him if you want to make it in!’
Ellie is a versatile and entrepreneurial creative, she’s an illustrator and designer, and also creates her own intricate and irreverent hand embroidered artworks and homewares under the name Rittle. She also has a special gift for sourcing the most weird and wonderful vintage textiles, ceramics and art, hence the recent launch of her online store, Pieces 4 Places.
At home, Ellie’s most treasured possessions include the large Matlok Griffiths painting above her bed. It holds fond memories and makes her feel somewhat ‘grown up’.
‘The painting was found through my good friend Lou’s gallery, Chapter House Lane, which was right next to a cafe I used to have in the city’ explains Ellie. ‘CHL is a non for profit gallery that Lou has been running for around 4 years. I was living in an apartment in the city for the first time by myself, and wanted to feel grown up and start an art collection, so I started with the biggest piece of his that I could find. Matlok is an amazing Melbourne-based artist so I’m very proud to have one of his pieces above my bed!’
Having been here for just four months, the novelty of living in this iconic building has yet to wear off for Ellie and Cale. ‘It feels like you are on holiday in another country!’ says Ellie. Aside from the unique character of the building itself (not to mention that incredible pool!), the community here is very much at the heart of what makes these apartments special. ‘We have excellent neighbours that lend you blenders when you want a smoothie but are too cheap to go out and buy one’ Ellie confirms. It’s unanimous then!
Huge thanks to Ellie and Cale (and Don!) for letting us photograph and share their very special home.

They are so cool! So are you TDF
can i please steal your home ?
I love when you show homes that are ‘real’. You can see they are loved, lived in and contain pieces that mean something to the owners, not just purchased because the rest of the world has. Brilliant.
OMG Lucy it’s like Melrose Place! Sweet apartment too x
There is nothing I don’t love about this house. SO GOOD!
Absolutely LOVE this home. Great stuff! Super cute. Xx
Best apartment ever! Go Ellie and Cale!!
Yes! I too love the ‘real’ homes from real people. I would love to see more of these. Go Ellie!
My aunt and uncle lived here in the 80s and 90s! Hasn’t changed at all…
Soooo lovely to see this post on this cold London morning. We had an apartment here 14 years ago and I’ve never forgotten the building – it had such a magic to it, from the plants hanging down inside the internal staircase and the huge bougainvillea on the outside – so many happy memories. I miss Melbourne – love my fix of TDF! x

THE TRANSPORTER
Director/producer Luc Besson has to be French culture's worst nightmare; a Gallic filmmaker who's making a fortune doing what the Minister of Culture loathes; Americanizing locally made films. Besson, best known here for big flashy action epics, (La Femme Nikita, The Professional, Fifth Element, The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc) also produces the films of other directors who enjoy his fascination with American pop culture. Here he backs director Corey Yues, a veteran of some 40 kung-fu movies made in Hong Kong. Using Besson's script, Yues delivers some remarkable action sequences reminiscent of John Woo's early films, but the plot, acting and camerawork are pedestrian.

Overcrowding and the lack of parking ushered Fort Lauderdale's first Baptist church and its oldest African-American congregation out of the city to a new home in Lauderdale Lakes on Saturday.
"I don't want to go inside. I want to remember it the way it was," said Charles Felder, 53, who drove more than 10 hours from Lithonia, Ga., with his wife, daughter and two grandchildren to witness the move. His grandson came all the way from Chicago. They joined Felder's parents, who live in Fort Lauderdale.
Felder was baptized at Piney Grove in 1957. His daughter was married there in 2000.
Around midmorning, four generations of Felders were among the 150 vehicles lined up as part of a motorcade that drove from the old church, past its original site, to the new building.
They waited while the pastor stole a last solo moment in the dim sanctuary of the downtown church, located at the corner of Northwest 11th Avenue and Fourth Street in Fort Lauderdale.
"I don't know why I'm looking around like I'm not coming back," said Pastor Joseph Roberts, surveying the empty pews. The hymnal books and cardboard fans were packed away.
"It's a momentous occasion for us."
He left the building to get on his motorcycle and lead the procession to the new church.
"Thank you, Lord! Thank you, God!" he shouted.
Piney Grove leaves a historical corridor of historic churches in the neighborhood. Farther down Northwest Fourth Street are Mount Olive Baptist, Mount Herman AME and St. Christopher's Episcopal.
Until they erected their first building in 1904, Piney Grove's parishioners conducted services among the trees near the spot where a lonely pine stands today at Northwest Fourth Avenue and Northwest Second Street. Community carpenters and masons built the church for $551.If you can not afford a new baby puppy we would like to help.

(not too bad for a first car!)Anyhow, recently, since the weather started getting colder, on the odd occasion my car has been going VERY slow & "AEC Failure" has appeared on the dash but when I switch my car off/on it's fine.Also, tonight, I was driving and going down a hill, nothing un-usual, doing 45 Mph and I heard a "click" from my clutch and my clutch pedal appeared to lose any compression and do nothing. It has raised higher than the other two pedals and when pressed down does nothing and almost falls down.I managed to get the car towed home, but it is not also stuck in reverse!

By Jonathan Greene
Published: May 13, 2015
A city man was wounded during the early morning hours of Wednesday in a shooting on Jefferson Street, according to the Paterson Police Department.
The victim, 22-year-old, sustained gunshot wound to the upper leg or buttocks, Patrick Murray, head of the Ceasefire Unit, said. The victim was on Jefferson Street between North Main Street and Presidential Boulevard at around 3:30 a.m. on Wednesday.
Police responded to reports of shots fired in the area, but did not find a victim. Moments later, the victim arrived at St. Joseph’s Regional Medical Center by private vehicle. Murray said the victim told police he was in the area when a group of males approached him with verbal demand for his personal property.
“A struggle ensued, at which time one of the suspects produced a handgun and several shots were fired,” Murray said. “The victim was struck at that time, and was taken to the hospital by private vehicle.”
Murray said the victim was treated and released from hospital.
Anyone with information about this or other shootings is being asked to contact Detective Edgar Taylor or Detective Francisco Brito of the Ceasefire Unit at 973-321-1342. Information can also be forwarded anonymously by texting the information to “274637” or by accessing the Paterson Police website at patersonpd.com.The story has it that when The Great Lady led her nomad band into the Nile valley, they abandoned the wandering life of eating catch-as-catch-can and took to growing food crops. Prosperity followed, then drove the one-upmanship urge in Egyptians, who wanted to gussy up their garden plots.
Pharaoh dispatched plant hunters far and wide to bring back appealing flowering herbs, shrubs and trees that would survive at home in east Africa. As a result, we also credit this famous pyramid-building civilization with the lesser-known invention of flower gardening. Who knew?
And, did you know that North Central Texas rests on same latitude in the earth’s temperate climate zone as ancient Egypt. If that’s not enough, it even hugs the east edge of a desert.
However, temperate region weather and geographic variations mean one size does not fit all the plants that can grow between the poles and the equator in the temperate belt that circles the planet.
Take, for example, apple trees, also known as malus domestica. In North Texas, gardeners need to choose trees that produce fruits with light “pink” blushing skins. Those malus varieties require a low number of annual chilling hours, or a short winter, each year in order to bear a bushel of Mother Nature’s fruity treat. Good luck if you buy a sapling malus that will produce deep red Winesaps that flourish in Washington State for a chilly good reason.
With our climate in mind, the modern cowboy version of Pharaoh’s plant hunters at the Texas Department of Agriculture have a research program to find and develop flowering plants, fruits, and vegetables they call Texas Superstars.
Every variety of Superstar plant has survived several years of tough field trials by an A&M AgriLife research team and has shown superior performance under Texas’ own tough temperate growing conditions. Next time you cruise the plant nursery aisles looking for some garden color or flavor, look for the Texas Superstar label to get proven winners.
Annuals include Angelonia Serenas, Whopper Begonias, the iconic Texas Bluebonnets (that also come in maroon), Gomphrenas, several Petunias, Vinca Coras, a number of Hibiscus varieties, some Lantanas, Turk’s Cap, Phloxes, and Salvias.
If you want to try out some tropical, that will probably only last one season here, look for sassy stuff like Brazilian Red Hots, Pride of Barbados Caesalpinias, Gold Star Esperanza and Firecracker Jatrophas, among others. Several roses including Knock Outs have become Texas Superstars, but don’t buy until you are sure the specimens for sale are not infected with Rose Rosette virus.
Why stop with flowers? Check out the lists of trees, grapes, and garden fruits and vegetables at.
If you don’t see Texas Superstars on sale where you buy plants, ask for them by name.: 1) Should the markup from the original source be maintained and exibit its attributes in the text that transcludes it? For example, if the text is in normal face font and the text transcludes another text that happens to be bold, should the bold be maintained? 2) Should the author which creates a text which transcludes another text be capable of modifying the attributes of the transcluded text? (I.e., should the author of the primary text be able to add bold, italic, etc. to the transcluded text?) One argument would be that if a author can add attributes to the transcluded text, the author is simply modifying its format to fit the current textual presentation. OTOH, this could intefere with the "art" of writing the transcluded text. (Some people might get a bit sensitive of people bolding, italicizing, changing the fonts, whatever, of the transcluded text. . 3) What granularity should the transcluded text maintain? What I mean by this is that there is a strong movement towards marking up the structure of a document and then assigning the fonts and other textual attributes based on the structure based on this -- SGML like (For example, all headers are Palentino, 25 pt, Bold.) Should the transcluded text have to maintain an entire document structure? For example, if you want to included part of a header, should you be able to included only part of it (say, 3-4 words) or should you have to include all of it since you are including the "header" and to prevent the meaning from being manipulated in the presentation? On one side, you could argue that by forcing a author to include an entire document structure (header, paragraph, footnote, etc.) it avoids words being taken out of context and if someone includes something they are including a "whole" something. On the other side, it could become quite combersome to have to do so. >>J1Tv | Online Movie

Killik stepped up behind her and pressed the muzzle of his pistol to the back of her head, he muttered, "Stupid Gnome, bringing a knife to a gun fight..." And he squeezed the trigger.
20 minutes earlier...
From a shadowed perch, she watched the Goblins advance through the trees. Each bore a rifle with a sword and pistol on their belts. She counted eight as they passed under her. Holding her position, she waited for several breaths. Two more Goblins came forward, similarly armed, but with goggles over their eyes. In a silent, shadowy rush, she shifted between the trees and glided down to the ground, appearing just behind the Goblins.
Drawing two long bladed daggers from their sheaths on her belt, she attacked. The first dagger stabbed through his back, piercing armor, flesh and bone with barely any effort. The second blade came up and across his throat, cutting off any sound he could make as he died. Before his body could hit the ground, with another shift of shadows, she rushed the other Goblin. The first attack went in low, into his lower back, as her follow up strike drove a blade through his neck from the side, stifling any cry of pain. Settling the body to ground, she cleaned and re-sheathed her blades. And then shifted back up into the trees.
Watching again from among the trees, she waited patiently as they passed under her. As the last Goblin stepped past the tree she was on, she shifted down the tree trunk. A gloved hand snaked out and covered the Goblin's mouth, cutting off any sound as a blade stabbed up through the bottom of his mouth, with the tip poking out the top of his head. She waited for any reaction from the others, and hearing nothing, dragged the body back into the shadows.
Grimsby turned and looked over his shoulder, and saw nothing. Raising his hand to call out to the rest of the squad, he felt something strike his vest. A soft beep sounded, then nothing as all sounds cut-off suddenly. As he tried to yell out a warning, he noticed movement to the side. A shape rushed forward, the shadows dissolving away to reveal a female Gnome dressed in the dark leathers, two blades in her hands. Bringing up his rifle, he managed to parry her first two strikes, but the third slipped past his guard, cutting a fine line along his right arm. Off balance from the pain and shock, he stumbled backwards as two more strikes connected, his rifle falling to the ground from his numb hands. Backing into a tree, and too weak to resist, he watched as she advanced on him. Holding his head against the tree, she raised a blade to his throat. He closed his eyes as she pushed.
She dropped the body to the ground and rolled him over, face-down. A small disc is stuck on his vest, blinking with a soft white light. Clasping it, she quickly traced a pattern on its face, and the blinking stopped. As well the unnatural silence surrounding her and the now dead Goblin. Listening for anything other then the ambient sounds of the forest, she heard nothing. Tucking the disc into one of her pouches, she disappeared back into the trees.
"Yo! Boss!" Someone called out from behind him, much too loudly. Turning on his heels to yell about volume protocols, Killik eyed his squad. And stopped mid-thought as he counted only 5 of them. His second-in-commander, Rivrok, nodded and stepped up, "Yeah, Grimsby and Nilton are gone. No one saw or heard anything, but they haven't caught up to us yet. I've also tried to call Guster and Horus on the buzzbox, nothing from either."
"Alright, that means she's behind us, so no sense in moving deeper into these damn woods," he said, gesturing in the direction they had been moving. He pointed at two of the other Goblins, "Hemlock, Cruzzer, you two with me. Riv, take Skiller and Zerg. We'll circle back, eyes open for her or the others. Anyone of yous sees anything, fire a shot into the air." All of them nodded in understanding, and moved off in their groupings.
She made a mental note of the one they called Boss, and watched his group walk away. Then she went off to follow the other group. The three Goblins had formed a triangle, the one called Riv up front with the other two behind him, each about ten feet from each other. Jumping down from the trees, she landed in front of Riv. A blade sliced up and through the rifle he held in his hands, the two halves flying off in opposite directions.
Still dazed from the sudden attack, he fumbled for his sword but was instead spun around and held tightly by his hair, a blade coming to rest under his chin. Skiller had his rifle aimed at him and the Gnome. Zerg fired a shot into the air, cycled the bolt and also aimed it at him and the Gnome. "Better give up now girl, the others will..."
She cut off his threat, literally, by pulling her blade across his throat. Continuing the movement of the cut, she whipped her hand around and forward, throwing her blade at the Goblin to her right. Both Goblins fired as they saw this, with one shot striking Riv in the chest and the other going wide as the thrown blade struck Skiller low in the abdomen.
With a swirl of shadows, the Gnome appeared in front of him, holding the handle of the blade. With a quick twist and slash, she opened his belly from side to side. Pushing off him, she launched herself at the last Goblin. Ducking low to avoid the clumsy swing of his rifle at her head, she sliced at his armpit in passing, spun on her heel and stabbed her second blade into his side, under his ribs, before rolling away from him.
Dropping his rifle, he clutched at his wounds, trying to stem the bleeding, his breath ragged and heavy. He turned to find the Gnome and saw her approaching, her arms down by her sides, blades out. Backing up, he tripped over his feet and landed on his back, his vision starting to grow dim. The last thing he saw before blackness took him was her face as she leaned over him, her green eyes hard and cold.
Killik raised his fist to signal a stop. Hemlock and Cruzzer came to stop slightly behind him, rifles up and scanning the area. Ahead he could see three bodies sprawled out on the ground. With a wave of his hand, they slowly crept forward. Looking down at the first body, Zerg stared up with lifeless eyes, a pool of blood seeping out from under him. Walking over to the second body, he saw Skiller, on his side, with half his innards spilling out of his belly. Steeling himself, he turned his attention toward the last body, and saw not a Goblin, but a Gnome laying face-down. Rushing over, he rolled the body over. Who reached up and grabbed the front of his vest, securing a line he had not seen. A line that suddenly went taut and pulled him toward the nearest tree.
Rolling and getting her feet under her, she dashed toward the other two Goblins. One of them fired his rifle at her. A blade flashed across her body, parrying the bullet, sending the ricochet off into the darkness. The other dropped his rifle and drew his sword. Hemlock worked the bolt of his rifle, taking a step back as she rushed toward him. As he raised it up to take a shot, she stepped into him, a blade coming up to knock the barrel aside, sending the shot wide. Pain blossomed in his gut as she stabbed him three times in rapid succession. Spinning around him, she stabbed one last time into his back, severing his spine, then turned to face the last Goblin.
Cruzzer charged the Gnome, leading with his sword. She dodged out of the way of his first swing. Parried and ducked under his second. She parried his third attack, forcing the tip of the sword into the ground. A step forward and she drove her blade into his chest, through his heart.
She trotted over to the tree where she had set the anchor for her winch trap and come to a quick stop when she saw the frayed end of a cut line.
Killik stepped up behind her and pressed the muzzle of his pistol to the back of her head, he muttered, "Stupid Gnome, bringing a knife to a gun fight..." And he squeezed the trigger.
She spun clockwise on her heel, stabbing out with her blade. With a loud *tink*, the hammer came down on the blade where it rested behind the bullet in the chamber. Her other hand came up, burying the blade to the hilt on the side of his head. "Stupid Goblin, bringing a gun to the knife fight..." she muttered.

- 74% of Saudi youth say their country is heading in the right direction of growth
More than a third (36 per cent) of the youth surveyed said Saudi Arabia is their country’s biggest supporter followed by the by the UAE (33 per cent), Qatar (25 per cent) and Kuwait (25 per cent). The United States is the only Western country to feature in the top five allies at 22 per cent. per cent stating that they are optimistic of the country’s future. With billions of dollars being invested in driving the growth of the Saudi economy, particularly to create jobs and homes for its youth, the survey reveals that a majority of the Saudi youth (70 per cent) feel the Kingdom is headed in the right direction of growth compared to 65 per cent last year. Nearly 76 per cent per cent), economic stability (63 per cent) and unemployment (68 per cent). Some two thirds (65 per cent) of Saudi youth also feel that people in this generation are more likely to start a business than in previous generations, highlighting a growing entrepreneurial spirit.
Three quarters (75 per cent) of Saudi youth feel that energy, electricity and transport fuel such as petrol and diesel must be subsidised by the government.
While nearly three in five (59 per cent) Saudi respondents rate the quality of healthcare as excellent or good, there is growing worry among them about lifestyle diseases such as obesity (26 per cent), diabetes (17 per cent) and cancer (14 per cent). A third of Saudi youth (33 per cent) say the quality of healthcare in the Kingdom has improved over the last year while around half (53 per cent) feel it has remained the same. The numbers who say they are ‘unconcerned’ about health issues also fell from 28 per cent in 2013 to 20 per cent in 2014.
The biggest challenge for the Middle East, according to more than half (52 per cent) of Saudi youth, is the rising cost of living. Corruption in government and public life (40 per cent), national economy issues (39 per cent), pan-Arab economy (33 per cent), unemployment (28 per cent), Israel-Palestinian conflict (27 per cent), loss of values and culture (25 per cent) and personal debt (23 per cent) are other pressing challenges faced by the region according to respondents. They see climate change and environmental issues (6 per cent) and lack of press freedom (7 per cent) as the least pressing issues..Biomass..

"Wuzzat?" Dick Grayson came awake in a fog that quickly cleared as he recognized Oracle's emergency alert. He swung out of bed and into his desk chair, scarcely aware of his feet touching the ground. "I'm awake," he announced.
"Nightwing, good." The Oracle mask faded to Barbara Gordon's worried features. "It's Bruce."
A cold feeling curled in his stomach. "What's wrong?"
"It's not clear. Superman just found him delirious up at the Watchtower. He's called an emergency JLA meeting and asked me to contact you."
"Delirious?" He already had half his costume on.
"Fever of 105 degrees."
"Jeez." He pulled his uniform top over his head. "He didn't sound sick when I talked to him this evening."
"I signed off right after midnight, and he was fine. In fact made a point of the fact that he'd slept over 10 hours in the last 24."
"Ten?" He affixed his mask to his face. "Maybe he was coming down with something."
"I don't think so. More likely he was catching up after J'onn brought it to his attention that none of us were getting much sleep."
Nightwing nodded as he pulled on his boots. "Preparing for the shit to hit the fan. You think he stumbled on whatever it is that's causing the mind-body disconnect?"
Barbara's brow creased in a frown. "I've pulled the notes he was working on from the JLA mainframe. It looks like he'd narrowed down possibilities."
"Switching to the comlink. And?" Nightwing swung out the window, flying across the rooftops to the warehouse where his bike was stored.
"It's not chemical or electronic. He seemed to think it might be telepathic, or something from the dream realm." She paused. "He seems to have already discounted magic."
Nightwing started his motorcycle and roared out of the warehouse, heading for route 61. "Yeah, we talked about that earlier. Garth reported that his magic had been decidedly even-keeled since the whole Poseidonis thing."
"Oh, right. I see that here, along with a note from Doctor Mid-Nite that Dr. Fate seems unaffected. And -" another pause - "it looks like he touched base with Zatanna at some point during the day. She had actually noticed her own physical tiredness because of her magic."
"Huh. But nothing definitive?"
"Not recorded here. Although if he did figure it out, whatever it is could have acted to take him out as soon as he thought it."
"That's not a comforting thought. Listen, call Alfred and let him know what's up. And contact Leslie. I'm about twenty minutes out from the Manor; I'll teleport out from there. They've still got Bruce on the moon?"
"Yeah. I think they're waiting for instructions from you."
"Tell 'em to hold tight. And see what else you can find out."
"Will do. Oracle out."
Nightwing tightened his grip on his bike, increasing his speed as he hurtled down the interstate toward the Bristol offramp. Whatever was happening could no longer be shrugged off, and now, it seemed, it was personal.
"His fever was so high we had to -" Superman tried to explain as he half led, half followed Nightwing to the med bay. His voice trailed off as they entered the room and Bruce's pale features and sweat-tangled hair became visible.
"You did what needed doing," Nightwing said gruffly, crossing quickly to Bruce's side.
"Normally we would just take him to STAR Labs, but I figured-"
"He'll appreciate that," Nightwing cut him off. The younger man had already stripped off one gauntlet to take Bruce's hand in his and was studying his mentor's face intently. He leaned over and spoke softly into Bruce's ear, words so quiet that only Superman's enhanced hearing allowed him to pick them up: "Bruce, it's Dick. You're in the Watchtower with a high fever. We're not sure what's wrong with you, but I'm taking you home to Leslie and Alfred. Okay, partner?"
The final question had almost a note of levity compared to the matter-of-fact tones of the rest of Dick's briefing, a nearly ironic check with a senior partner who was not in a position to object. Or was he? Superman could see Bruce's hand tightening around Dick's, and the stillness of his body was giving way to the same fitful tossing he had exhibited earlier. Bruce's eyes flew open, wildly unfocused.
Dick stayed right at Bruce's side, again squeezing his hand and murmuring, "I'm right here, Bruce."
"J'onn," Bruce gasped. "Find-"
"Shh," Dick soothed, shooting a hard look at Superman. "Where is J'onn?" he asked, his voice hinting dangerously at an accusation that somehow J'onn had not been informed of Bruce's condition.
"We don't know," Superman answered, holding back a cold response to the implied lack of trust. "We tried to reach him, but he's not answering his signal device and Aquaman can find no telepathic trace of him."
"No telepathic-" Nightwing echoed, looking back down at Bruce's anguished face. "I'll find him, Bruce," he promised. "Somehow-"
"NO!" Bruce objected, half-rising from the bed. Superman was immediately at his side, helping Dick urge him back down.
"His fever's rising again," Superman said grimly.
Nightwing nodded absently, his attention focused on Bruce who was now muttering incoherently. Then abruptly he looked up at Superman. "This isn't the same thing we've seen in the others. Do you know what he was doing when he collapsed?"
Superman nodded. "We've got the Watchtower tapes, but I frankly don't know what sense to make of them. We were hoping you might take a look at them."
"You didn't run them by Oracle?"
Superman felt a flush rise in his cheeks. That would have been the sensible move, one that had not occurred to him in his anxiety to get Bruce cared for and contact his family. The tape had seemed secondary to the needs of the moment.
"Never mind," Nightwing dismissed, somehow managing to make the dismissal as cutting as any of his mentor's pointed comments or silences would have been. His eyes were back on Bruce, now being tended by Plasticman. "I'm betting J'onn's involved in the tape."
Superman nodded, not bothering to ask how Nightwing had come to that conclusion. Whatever trace remained of the young man who had once been the light to Batman's dark had been swallowed by the brusque demeanor of a leader in a time of crisis.Kindergarten End of Year Goals

Welcome, Bakers!
Or, at least baking watchers. If you're like me, you love the Great British Bake Off (or, in the US, the Great British Baking Show, a title so charmingly on-the-nose that it mainly works because it's said with a British accent).
There was a massive shake-up since the filming of Series 7 (they're called "series" rather than "seasons" across the pond), in which the BBC lost the Bake Off to rival Channel 4 when Channel 4 threw down a giant pile of money. Presenters Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins opted to stay with the BBC and leave the show, and days later beloved octogenarian Mary Berry left the show as well. Paul Hollywood (yes, that's his real name) stayed, and the internet deemed him a heartless money grabber because dude wanted to keep his job.
Channel 4 set to work on the new series, hiring younger woman Prue Lieth (sprightly at 77) as a judge, and Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig as presenters. This was followed by a number of articles talking about how the new series would be "updated," with "modern humor."
The internet wrung its hands, tore its clothes, and threw ashes over its head.
Well, the first new series has aired in the UK, and I've seen alllllmost all of it, due to my a.) persistence and b.) YouTube. The first episode remains AWOL so far, but I've gotten to see episodes 2-10.
My take? Unknot your hands, mend your clothes, and wash your hair - everything's okay.
Honestly, Noel and Sandi were my biggest question marks. I knew Noel from The IT Crowd and wasn't familiar with Sandi at all. But they're both very charming in their roles, developing an increasingly odd-couple rapport as the series goes on.
Noel won me over first - standing taller than most of the contestants, usually wearing something outlandish, with a shaggy head of raven hair, he's basically a giant human muppet. With a background in stand-up, this may be his most dialed-down self, cracking silly jokes, listening to the bakers and asking questions, coming across more sweetly than you'd expect.
It look me another episode to bond with Sandi, but she really shines during segments taking the viewer through Britain's culinary history. As the episodes progress, you can't help but feel affection for her when she tears up during the task of telling the bakers who's eliminated.
And Prue? Where Mary Berry had a very grandmotherly appeal, Prue is your awesome and slightly eccentric great aunt, with her forthright nature and has a love for modern statement jewelry . She'll give praise where praise is due, but if something doesn't meet standards, she'll say so.
This changes the dynamic with Paul in an interesting way. With Mary and Paul, Paul was the tough "man judge," where Mary tended to be more diplomatic. It was the baking version of good cop, bad cop.
But Prue? Prue goes for it (and she clearly knows her stuff). The result is a more diplomatic Paul, a Paul who doesn't go for the kill because it's already dead. He seems a little off-balance at the start, but it's honestly a refreshing change of pace. We didn't need him to be the Simon Cowell of baking.
And the "modern updates"? Whatever. The tent looks exactly the same. The sheep look exactly the same. You'll still covet the Kitchen Aids. The musical cues twinkle in the background as always, the illustrations remain. As for the humor? Still goofy and charming. The only thing I noticed was that there wasn't the annual "soggy bottom" announcement; instead, Paul intoned, "the bottom is underbaked."
But all of this is the framework for the bakers themselves. Let's be honest - the show lives and dies by the contestants. I have watched Martha and Chetna's season a few times because I enjoy that group so much. Ruby's season? Eh.
This group is comprised of the strongest group of bakers the show may have ever seen. There are final bakes that will blow you away with their complexity and beauty. Paul and Prue go for it in the technical bakes, challenging the bakers because they know the bakers can handle it. What they're able to make is often astounding, not just for non-professional bakers, but as human people who bake.
The final is one of the closest I've seen, with each challenge impressive in its difficulty. With many finals you've got two contestants who are really close and one trailing behind - not so with this one. The winning baker absolutely deserved to win, but it was very close..
A quick note - Prue made news for congratulating the winner on Twitter, several hours before the show aired. She immediately apologized, explaining that she'd gotten the time zones mixed up, since she was currently in Bhutan. For several commenters, this has been a terrible gaff that only proves that Mary Berry is far superior, setting up jokes that Mary was sabotaging her.
This bugs me. Mary left of her own free will - there's nothing to avenge, here. We don't need to pit these women against each other. They can both be good at their jobs, and liking one doesn't mean you have to hate the other. Life doesn't have to work like that. Also, she's a 77-year-old who's traveling to Bhutan and apparently also writes foodie fiction that I need to figure out how to get my hands on. We should be thankful this woman exists! The internet needs to chill the fork out.
*end rant*
Have you seen any of the new episodes? What did you think?
Thanks for this review, Hillary! OF COURSE I was going to watch whenever the season arrives on PBS, but I was still a bit apprehensive. Not anymore. Bring it on :-)
Hillary, You watched it on youtube? I guess I know what I'll be doing this weekend!
The episodes can disappear fast - one time I waited too watch while I finished a task, and by the time I got back to it, it'd been removed.

Top Rest of the World Player Odds
2017 Tournament Record - Best 5 Performances
Ernie Els 2017 Form Guide
Undoubtedly one of the greats of the world game, Ernie Els heads to Britain harbouring very realistic hopes of winning another British Open. 'The Big Easy' added to the Open Championship he won in 2002 by landing the 2012 Championship, so he often ranks as a threat on the links.
There was a train of thought that Els was past his best and his form during the last couple of years suggests he is past his prime, although the British Open often brings out the best in him and it would be dangerous to rule Els out.
Check out Ernie Elthe past few weeks have seemed to be trying times. i found out about a very dear friend's unexpected passing that has felt like a ton of bricks was dropped on me. i still struggle knowing that they aren't here, that it wasn't their time to go and i feel like something happened along the way. i know he wouldn't have wanted me this upset - but inside, i hurt. i hurt because he was a good person, because he meant well, because i should've been a better friend. my friend - i am so so sorry for everything - for the things that you went through, for what life handed to you because you didn't deserve it, because you never got to live your dreams. i think of you often, i pray for you and talk to you.
and now my dog... i don't know what i'll do if we really have to put her down. please god, jesus, st anthony anyone please don't take my dog now. all i can keep thinking is life is so, so unfair..
just when things were looking up.. when i got my hours and my pay back... when i'm starting to have a good social life filled with friends and laughter... i don't know how the heck things like this happen. i am so, so sad. i can't imagine having to go through a lifetime of this - of losing people - friends, family, pets, neighbors - how do you do it?
these tears just keep leaking from my eyes - at work i'm crying silently wondering how to get over it... it's not even getting over it's learning to live with it, without it... my life will never be the same - my life was different because you came into it.
oh my god grandpa i still miss you. i still can't believe you are gone. i know god needed you back but my heart still weeps for you. and without you... grandma is forgetting my name, my age, where i live... are you barbara's daughter? yes.. i'm your granddaughter, i'm 24 years old, i live and work in san francisco. i drive a gold car, don't remember you've seen it?
i know you're supposed to look back on the better times but damnit all they do is make me cry because i realize that they aren't here anymore. it doesn't make the pain more tolerable; it doesn't make it hurt any less. it makes me angry, it makes me upset. i want to get in bed and cry, cry because they aren't here and i can't talk to them, feel them, touch them, acknowledge them anymore.
and what happens when you die? is that it? what about this voice inside my head that never turns off is that gone?
oh god. how do you deal...首页 > Products > Cut to length lineCut to length line

Thanks so much for choosing me! I've just sent through a message using the above link, hope it gets to you :)Ol' Meangenes stopped by this morning. I was at home, trying to recover from a nasty case of bronchitis, so I grabbed him a bottle of Yuengling,and poured myself a second cup of coffee.
"What brings you around ?" , I asked. "Beside the Yuengling, that is."
"Politics. Boy am I gettin' tired of this crap !"
"Hillary this, and Obama that on the Democrat side -and Whoever- Heard- of- Huckabee and Mitt Romney on the Republican side...Oops ! I almost forgot Ron Paul. He got about 10% of the votes and his followers are declaring victory (!)
This picture reminds me of that-for some reason or other ! "
I clicked on it to enlarge the image and found I had to agree.
I found a second bottle (the last) of Yuengling and handed it to Meangenes.
"Was that all you came over here for ? "
Meangenes sipped his beer, and didn't answer - but he looked at me imploringly.
"Okay,okay !", I snapped. " I do have some new pictures to show you. Here you go !"
Meangenes applauded. " Thanks for the look ! It kinda eases the too-much-politics syndrome a bit ."
"Happy to be of service ! Anything else I can do for you ?"
The old gaffer belched politely. " Yeah,as a matter of fact: That was your last bottle of Yuengling. Better re-stock next time you go to the store."The Rangers must manage the innings of their valuable young pitchers: must take all precautions to protect their health. A 22 year old arm is far more vulnerable than a 25 year old arm.
Innings must be built up gradually. As a loose rule, you don't want a young pitcher to increase his season's workload by more than 50 innings above his previous year's output.
Therefore, in 2010, the Rangers ought open the season with Hunter, Holland, Feliz, and Harrison in a 4 man bullpen rotation. When Hunter, Holland, Feliz, or Harrison came into a game, they would typically pitch 2 or 3 innings. If they were pitching well, and thus keeping their pitch count under 50 or so, then Hunter, Holland, Feliz, or Harrison would go ahead and close out the game. Such would be invaluable training. If Hunter, Holland, Feliz, or Harrison had pitched effectively in the 7th and/or 8th innings, there would be every chance that they could close out the 9th inning as effectively as Wilson or Francisco could. Hunter, Holland, Feliz, and Harrison have a full complement of pitches at their disposal. They are trained to go through line-ups more than once.
Francisco, Wilson, and O'Day could fill in when the 4 man Relief Rotation was unable to close out a game with excellence. Each of the 4 man Relief Rotation would typically pitch 2 or 3 innings, then not pitch again for 4 or 5 days (depending on off days). This would protect health while providing valuable pitching experience. Here's how it would look on Opening Day 2010:
5 Man Starting Rotation (pitches 5-8 innings per game):
Feldman
Millwood
McCarthy
Nippert
Mathis
4 Man Bullpen Rotation (pitches 1-4 innings per game):
Hunter
Holland
Feliz
Harrison
As a bonus: Hunter, Holland, Feliz, Harrison would be competing with each other to earn mid season slots in the 5 man Starting Rotation. Competition sharpens.
Down the stretch and into the playoffs, the Rangers would have hard throwing young pitchers both rested and firing away in a 5 man Starting Rotation which might look like this:
Feldman
Millwood
Holland
Feliz
Hunter

That really makes sense and as an "all time" Ranger fan, I'd love to see something like that put into effect.
Whatever is going to work, I am for. I hope the Rangers get out of a "Cubs" mentality and change things where they can take a legitimate run for the big dance.
emjay,
great minds think alike.
dusty,
"Cubs mentality"? Do you mean settling for not making the playoffs? Or overspending for Soriano and Milton Bradley, et al?
I might write, maybe Fri or Sat, about whether the Rangers ought empty some minor league talent and go for it now, or whether they ought hold tight with what they have for ooone mooore seeaason.The fourth session of the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD-4) completed the Commissions multi-year thematic programme of work and began considering preparations for the General Assemblys five-year review of Agenda 21 and beyond. During the High- Level Segment, one delegate voiced the opinion of many observers when he stated that CSD-4 lacked the sense of urgency of past years. Some seasoned observers of the debates on the sectoral issues (oceans and atmosphere) said that the discussions merely echoed recent negotiations in other fora. Others characterized the CSD as a missed opportunity to reinforce recent agreements and expressed disappointment that hard-fought details were not included in the final decisions. Discussions on financial issues were also revisited and, as many delegates noted during the High-Level Segment, will not change until political will emerges.
The one issue that inspired many was the preparation for the review of the CSD during a Special Session of the UN General Assembly in 1997. Most delegates agreed that the CSD should continue, but should not conduct another review of Agenda 21. Suggestions as to its future work varied from concentrating on certain sectors (e.g., oceans) to pressing issues (e.g., poverty) to specific problems (e.g., megacities). Many held out hope that in the coming year the CSD could redefine its role and accelerate progress in achieving the promises made in Rio.
During the course of CSD-4, the Commission, chaired by Rumen Gechev (Bulgaria), examined the third cluster of issues according to its multi-year thematic programme of work. Delegates discussed: trade, environment and sustainable development (Chapter 2); combating poverty (3); changing consumption patterns (4); demographic dynamics and sustainability (5); integrating environment and development in decision-making (8); roles of major groups (23-32); financial resources and mechanisms (33); transfer of environmentally sound technologies, cooperation and capacity-building (34); promoting education, public awareness and training (36); national mechanisms and international cooperation for capacity-building in developing countries (37); international institutional arrangements (38); international legal instruments and mechanisms (39); and information for decision-making (40).
The sectoral clusters for this year were protection of the atmosphere (Chapter 9) and protection of the oceans, all kinds of seas, including enclosed and semi-enclosed seas, and coastal areas and the protection, rational use and development of their living resources (17).
[Return to start of article]It used to be that stock options were reserved only for executives or members of top management. However, more and more employers are opting to offer stock options to all employees as part of their compensation package. In fact, more than 10 million American workers receive stock options as part of their compensation or as bonuses.
What Are Stock Options?
Stock options give employees the right to buy a specific number of shares of their company's stock during a time and at a price that the employer specifies. The price the company sets on the stock, also referred to as the grant or strike price, is offered to employees at a discounted price. This price is most often the market price of the stock at the time the employee is given the stock options. After a certain amount of time, an employee can elect to cash in his stock options. The idea behind this is that the stock price will have gone up during that amount of time, so the employee will be able to sell them at a higher price, thus yielding a profit.
Stock options always have an expiration date, which means employees have a limited window of time to cash in their options. They have a certain starting and end date, and if the options aren't exercised within the allotted time frame, the employee loses them.
Should You Pay Stock Options?
Stock options are becoming an increasingly popular way for employers to attract and keep valuable workers, help employees to feel like owners or partners in the business, and offering a form of compensation to employees that is more than a traditional salary. And unless the company goes out of business or loses money, it is a good way to motivate employees to accept jobs and stay on as their stock options make money, as stock options can provide a large amount of cash after a period of time.
Stock options are a particularly good idea for companies that are just starting out and would like to retain as much cash as possible. They allow starter businesses to hang onto cash while at the same time providing employees with a portion of the growth of the company. So small, growth-oriented businesses would be wise to offer their employees stock options.
Stock options aren't just for starter companies as well. For firms that have already gone public, stock options can help to include employees in ownership.
Clearly, stock options don't come without risks. For companies that don't perform well, stock options are useless and may even cause employees to lose money, which is certainly not good for morale or for employees. In addition, a number of laws are in place regarding stock options. Companies who offer stock options are required to expense stock options a the time they are granted, rather than when the employee exercises the option.
This upfront expensing of stock options is not always ideal for business owners, as it requires them to record an expense that may or may not ever come to fruition. This could jeopardize a company's chances of bringing in investors.
There are a number of benefits as well as drawbacks to offering stock options. For companies who are just starting out, stock options can be a win-win situation, as they allow companies to retain much-needed cash while still offering their employees the opportunity to share ownership in the business. Before deciding whether or not to offer stock options, it's important to take all factors into consideration.

You are not gonna believe how tiny this figure is.
I mean, comparing her size with the size of the base might give an impression,
but you really have no idea until you hold her in your hand.
She is SMALL! The details are awesome though.
She is very well sculpted and I enjoyed painting her.
I wondered a bit about those "round" straps on her thighs,
but then I decided that they were just that - straps.
Ok, so now I just looked at Buddle's version, and they are not straps,
they are armour plates. Doh!
Oh well, I don't think armour plates would fit this version of her anyway.
Except for the armour plates thing, I'm really happy about the paintjob.
It's been quite a while since I used GW's Storm Blue and it's such a nice, rich, dark colour.
The light blue (the highlights and invisible in the pics, I know) is Vivid Blue from Foundry.
It's a bit of a pain to work with, but the result is good.

Camille Grammer is in need of some serious stress relief, agreed? Acupuncture is perfect for calming the anxious breast (even those that have been augmented). Plus, there have been reports that she suffers from IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) and that is why both her children were born to a surrogate. Well, both acupuncture and Chinese Herbal formulas are very effective for getting digestive disorders under control. On the last episode of The Real Housewives
of Beverly hills, after Kelsey unceremoniously dumped his wife via a cold phone call, Camille complained of stomach pains and weight loss (hmmm, was she complaining or bragging about the weight?). Camille, my first recommendation to you (as I would suggest to many of my patients) is to drink some ginger tea. It will calm your stomachache if not your heartache.
As a member of ‘team Kyle’, I’ve certainly noticed that, not only is Camille dealing with a publicly messy divorce, but her persona on the show is unflattering beyond belief. I don’t know which herbs can fix that problem but, seeing that her settlement may be upwards of 50 million dollars, I think she will be able to afford the regular treatments she needs. Camille honey, are you listening?
Regardless, I hope she takes your advice!!Lately I've been watching quite a few movies off of DVD and VHS. It affords me the luxury of pausing, rewinding, and rewatching bits that I want to check a second time. This morning however I decided to watch one 'live' as it was broadcast on Channel 4.
This was so not the film to do that with.
Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind spends the bulk of its 103-minute running time jumping back and forth between real life and the protagonist's dreams. These dreams are also set within the individual in question's memories, ie. the past. However that's still too simple, so the whole story is even told in non-chronological order, to the point of running the 'opening credits' after a mere twenty minutes.
When, towards the end of the film, we witness some scenes from earlier on getting repeated, it's definitely time to hit rewind and check if what we're watching is consistent. Or at least pause for a cuppa. Well now I'm just whinging - Channel 4 had thoughtfully laid on ad breaks for that.
In a nutshell, the yarn revolves around a couple who break up so absolutely that they even visit a clinic to have their memories of each other wiped. With Jim Carrey as the guy, plenty of comedy ought to ensue, but it's not that kind of a Carrey vehicle.
Instead this is one of those grim, cynical SF dramas that invite us to really believe in the concept and ponder the idea of everyday life becoming so warped.
Indeed, ponder is a verb which applies to this film extremely well, as the story itself is very simple. Once Joel Barish (Carrey) realises that his memories are being deleted in reverse while he dreams, the penny also drops that there isn't much he can do about it, and for a while the whole show slows down.
Not that that's a bad thing. The blessing of a slow script is the real opportunity to explore the situation. It's a bit of a shame then, that while we continue to experience the background to Joel and Clementine's problems, the exciting potential of memory wiping is something which this movie fairly ignores.
The ramifications for everyday life of such a technology are never explored, as isn't the legal and social fragility of such a patient's new life. For example, just how was Joel going to deal with all the people who he couldn't ask to stop mentioning Clementine to him?
Instead this gap in the subject matter gets filled by the mystifying inclusion of Kirsten Dunst as the Doctor's receptionist. When she turns out to have had a memory wipe too, the revelation cannot contain any punch, partly because we already know of the procedure's existence, but mostly because she has only been presented to us as a sloppy receptionist, rather than as a human being.
A much more interesting dynamic would have been to present the scientific team as honest guys doing the job that their customer has entrusted them to do, prompting the ethical dilemma of which of Joel's contradictory wishes they should really be more loyal to.
It's all a fun ride anyway, and as I say the story's brevity gives it real room to breathe. Jim Carrey is on good form playing an introverted misfit straight, and writer/director Michel Gondry keeps the visuals interesting throughout, without ever going too grand or cartoonish.
Definitely a film to watch off of a copy that can be rewound and reexamined though. Was it day during that nighttime scene between Patrick and Clementine? I can't clearly remember. I'd check back on the VHS, but I seem to have gone over it...

Someone posted a video showing several of his sightings, it doesent mean he is less credible really it just means he looks for them more with a camera handy.
That said there is something about his film that doesent sit well with me.
The bit where they dance around looks animated to me and he does have a shifty look about him as if he is uncomfortable with what he is saying.
I was the first to doubt it in this thread and have been slated because of it but i am not a skeptic, i just dont want to fall into the same trap i have before and be let down.
I hope my suspicions are wrong and that its found to be genuine although how i dont know as i know little about cgi.
275+ flags is exceptional and we still havent seen any of the big skeptics yet.

I agree that the human race has a lot to learn, but when we discuss aliens I think we often over step our speculation based on our personal opinions of the world around us and our opinions on the collective information about ETs that could mainly be false or mainly be accurate, who knows? That's my only point "who knows", who really knows? Probably none of us. We like to talk like we know because I assume it's just human nature to be this way, but we don't really know if aliens are out there to begin with and if they are and are visiting they may not see us as "fish" at all, they may not even look upon lower beings in the same way that we do. I imagine that our intelligence, no matter how more advanced they are would make us seem more infant-like than fish-like, but again who really knows? I certainly don't.

A conservative count puts the number of match three games in the app store at above fifty. As in the other games, with a grid of different pieces in Friki Tricks, you need to move items around to match three of the same icons in a row. This causes those pieces to disappear, and new ones to fall into the playing field. But will there be enough in Friki Tricks to hold your interest in this saturated genre?
Likes
Art style: The presentation in this game is solid. Right from the intro as the title sequence changes from black and white to colour, the art style impressed me. Characters in the game are unique and colourful, with a cartoonish look. The game pieces and art in between levels are also impressive and makes it really feel like a quality title.
Bonuses: Besides the usual playing and progressing to the next level, the matching gameplay is broken up by a spinning wheel between levels. While there’s not much to do but hit to stop it from spinning and collect your prize, you can get yourself quite a few different bonuses to mix up the gameplay. It was a nice break from the matching game and I found myself looking forwards to it and the end of each level.
Dislikes
Not challenging: I didn’t find the gameplay particularly engaging. For one, this was because the genre of match three is overdone. But I also found it to be a bit too easy. Matches were always obvious and quick to do. I’d get stuck the odd time, but then by dropping a bomb it returned to being easy right away again.
While there was nothing innovative about the game itself, I thought the art style was unique and interesting. I always looked forward to the bonuses between rounds, and the easy gameplay made it ideal to pull out for quick rounds. If you haven’t tired of the genre, give Friki Tricks a try.
Friki Tricks was developed by W3 Software and is available for the introductory price of $0.99, with a price raise to $2.99 later on. I played version 1.0 on an iPod Touch 2G, going through each game mode multiple times, in different sessions. There’s also a free lite version available. This review was written with the current price point of $0.99 in mind.

Report SpamIt’s not unfair to say that Katie Price’s return to the world of music didn’t exactly get off to the best start.
Seven years on from her last foray into music, the oft-overlooked-but-still-iconic ‘Free To Love Again’, Katie gave her first live performance of ‘I Got U’ on ‘Loose Women’, which got mixed reviews, to say the least.
However, if there’s one thing The Pricey’s been known for over the past 15 years in the public eye, it’s resilience. And she’s not going to let a little thing like criticism of her new single get her down.
In fact, during one last promotional appearance on Thursday (29 June), it appeared she’d appointed herself the new queen of the UK music scene…
Now that is what you call a crown. Watch your back Adele is all we can say.
Katie, of course, is no stranger to an outrageous photo-call, whether she’s dressing up as a horse to flog her equestrian line or emerging from a giant egg to let us all know she’s been reborn (we think that’s what she was going for, anyway).
This time around, she’s promoting her new track, penned by former ‘X Factor’ competitor Craig Colton.
When her ‘Loose Women’ performance failed to wow viewers, Craig was quick to jump to Katie’s defence, while the woman herself also commented on the controversy: “’.H.
My first stop at the fest was the Bud Light World Music Stage in Sam Houston Park, an open, manicured oasis in the shadow of the Gulf Freeway. The sun was hot and bright on Saturday, but a persistent breeze turned the park's shady spots into cool, pleasant places for couples and families to stretch out on the grass.
The first act of the day that I caught turned out to be the most interesting. Bombino is a young singer and guitarist from Niger, and the spirit of his desert homeland loomed large during his afternoon performance.
The songwriter began his set on acoustic guitar accompanied by a Fender electric and traditional drums, including a djembe and a strange gourd-like bass drum I'd never seen before. Pounded with the heel of the hand, it functioned like an ancient stomp box, propelling the music along.
Bombino showed off some nifty finger-plucking on exotic tunes rife with blue notes. It was a neat illustration of just how far and wide the influence of the blues has traveled in the past 100 years or so, but you definitely won't be hearing these acoustic licks over at Shakespeare's Pub anytime soon. The crowd grew as he played, drawn in by the hypnotic rhythms of the hand drums.
After about 30 minutes of captivating acoustic Bedouin blues, Bombino turned up the volume considerably. The guitarist plugged in, and his band ditched the hide skins for more conventional rock instrumentation.
Turns out Bombino has studied his Jimi Hendrix discography as thoroughly as any American teenager, and the electrified power that exploded from his band's amps was made all the more impressive by its juxtaposition with the acoustic stuff. Maybe this guy could fit in at Shakespeare's after all.
The only problem with the breadth of music on display at iFest is the impossibility of seeing it all. I tore myself away from Bombino's electric set to catch the Carnival Guitar Duo at the HEB Cultural Stage, but they were packing up by the time I made it over there. Instead, I moseyed over to the 29-95.com stage on the steps of City Hall to take in the end of Dharma's performance.
As I walked up, Harry Sheppard was in the middle of a pretty great vibraphone solo. Cold beer and a divine breeze had the assembled music lovers in the best of moods as his four mallets danced across the keyboard.
When Sheppard's set with flautist Bob Chadwick wrapped up, I did a little wandering. On the midway set up down Walker Street, live pan flutes at one booth mixed with Caribbean hip-hop blaring from one a few tents down. As I rounded a corner, both dissolved in the thump of Chicago blues playing over a PA system. Not exactly an everyday experience, no matter where you come from.
At 4:30 I headed back over to the 29-95 stage to catch local mandolin master Rich DelGrosso. DelGrosso played a set paying tribute to Houston blues icon Lightnin' Hopkins, and he and his band had feet tapping and heads nodding as the afternoon threatened to turn into evening. The breeze blowing through was heavenly as I slouched in one of the plastic lawn chairs set up beneath the live oaks outside City Hall.
I heard "Shotgun Blues," "Mojo Hand" and "Automobile Blues" while I watched the people pass by. Guitarist Tony Vega was cookin'. DelGrosso promised to bring out Milton Hopkins, Lightnin's famous cousin who's played with B.B. King and a bunch of other greats, but I wanted to experience more of the fest -- particularly the food. I headed back over to the Bud Light stage and grabbed some curry goat from the nearby Agape Kitchen tent. You don't get that at Buzzfest.
Onstage, Chico Trujillo was making quite a ruckus. The Chilean cumbia-rock practitioner had a very nice crowd dancing to an orgy of percussion layered with brass, organ, ska guitar and even some prominent slide-whistling.
The upbeat Latin rock tunes went over real well, particularly an interesting psychedelic passage that made me wish I'd seen more of Trujillo's set. The stage's MC promised he'd be paying a visit to the Continental Club soon, so it appears I'll have another shot at it.
After sampling fried cheese on a stick (cheddar!) and hoofing it across the festival grounds, I found another shady spot near the Americas stage and settled in for a lively batch of zydeco from Lafayette's own Lil Nathan and the Zydeco Big Timers. Lil Nathan, as it turns out, plays one hell of a mean accordion -- several, actually.
A predominantly black crowd clustered under the live oaks to enjoy his nimble squeezebox runs, and it wasn't long before old folks, young folks and even younger folks were tearin' up the grass. Nathan's washboard player was so much fun to watch that he should probably have his own band.
By now, the festival seemed to be winding down a bit, and I wondered if everyone had decided to drive home for dinner. Come to find out, they'd all headed over to the Bud Light stage to catch War. The classic '70s funk-Latin-rock band drew the largest crowd of the day by far, fairly packing out Sam Houston Park.
Bandleader Lonnie Jordan might have been the only original member onstage, but the audience could have cared less. They wanted to hear "Why Can't We Be Friends," "Spill the Wine" and the rest of the band's classic radio hits, and War delivered. Jordan's band of ringers know exactly what they're doing, and the group remains as culturally and sonically diverse as ever.
The crowd for this show was mostly older -- fortysomethings mainly, some with kids in tow. They were partying it up like teenagers, though, boogieing like they hadn't danced in ages. "This Cisco Kid" had everybody on their feet, and by the time the band struck the opening notes of "Lowrider," the park had become more of a block party than a music festival.
Each member of the band took an extended solo during their introductions in the middle of "Lowrider." The harmonica player's rendition of "The Star Spangled Banner" had people high-fiving all around me. I decided to call it a day during the drum solo and heard War insert a snippet of Black Sabbath's "Iron Man" before capping off the day's music.
It was that kind of day -- you were never quite sure what you were going to hear next. I'd seen six bands representing at least six different genres, and I hadn't seen half of what was going on -- not to mention there was still more to come on Sunday.

In the end, though, iFest isn't about trying to cram as much music as possible into a single day. It's about hanging out downtown with some of your favorite people and stumbling across something you didn't know you wanted to see, eat or hear.
Judging by the easy smiles and laid-back gaits crowding the streets on Saturday, that seemed to be just fine with everybody.

The Northern Rock North East Regional Premier League side squeezed past Boldon in the Durham county final of the National Indoor Six-a-Side Championship at Chester-le-Street’s Riverside.
The Tynesiders will now face Northumberland winners Corbridge – who play in the Three Counties Northumberland League – in the regional play-off at Haydon Bridge.
However, Allan Worthy’s men endured several anxious moments before seeing off their stubborn South Tyneside opponents.
In Sunday’s semi-finals, Blaydon had beaten Chester-le-Street by 50 runs – Blaydon 115-4 from 10 overs, the Cestrians 65 all out.
Boldon enjoyed a seven-wicket success over Sunderland University.
Batting first in the 10-overs-a-side decider, Boldon amassed an impressive 136 – but Blaydon snatched a seven-wicket victory off the last ball!
Mark Drake led the way with 45 off 26 balls, Worthy chipped in with 32 off 15 balls and former Durham county spinner Graeme Bridge hit 26 off 12 balls.
Worthy said: “Boldon posted a superb total, as 100 is considered a very good score off 10 overs in this form of cricket.
“Mark and I managed to scramble the winning run off the last ball. It was tense stuff, and we were just relieved to get through.
“The competition has been much tougher this year, so it was a great feeling to be crowned Durham champions for a third successive year.
“We will not underestimate Corbridge, but we are confident we can beat them in the regional final.
“We have a lot of experience in this competition, which hopefully will hold us in good stead.”
Indeed they do, as Blaydon were national indoor six-a-side champions in 2007 and finished runners-up in last year’s tournament.
Blaydon and Corbridge will battle it out for the right to compete in the regional final, to be staged at Headingley, Leeds, on March 1.
The northern regional champions then travel to the home of cricket, Lord’s, on March 15 for the national decider.
Blaydon’s glory-chasing squad consists of Mark Drake, Allan Worthy, Steven Gale, Graeme Bridge, Geoff Stewart, Jonathan Malkin and Gary Stewart.
:: TYNEMOUTH Cricket Club are holding senior indoor nets for new and existing members, starting on Sunday, February 22 (4.30-6.30).
The sessions, at the Blue Flames Sporting Club, Whitley Park, Longbenton, will run every Sunday up to and including March 29. Contact Paul Haley on 07984 474 040.£20 Gift Voucher

My darlings have returned for yet another blaze of beauty this evening. They serve as reminders once again to: Keep focusing on things that give you pleasure, peace, and serenity. Things that make your heart jump with joy. Things that make you sigh in the best of ways. Things that make you pause, things that stir, that tug in all the right ways and meanings. This is what empowerment feels like — to be able to notice those moments, feel them, and heed.Chinese magic system, ranges from the Mughal from their primitive religion origins, to the most esoteric and high of Taoism forms. The rituals and magical practices of shamans in the Mongol tribes, are the basis of Shinto (Shinto). From China, Shinto was Japan, bringing with him a belief in spirits, mediums and the preparation of spells.
•The Supreme intelligence, which is only one.
•The celestial intelligences or Angelicales.
•The Spirits of the planets.
•The Spirits of death.
On the other hand, the magic tool popular in China is the mirror. These are essential in the fight against evil spirits. The use of mirror has a dual purpose. The first one is to reflect the true appearance of the demons. Once this has been reflected in a mirror, his power is weakened and already can not continue attacking the owner of the same. The second use is to ensure the heavenly happiness through his possession.
Chinese SpellsThe method by which a mirror becomes magical is a secret well kept by Chinese magicians. But what is known is that, the more old and large, will be more able to 'get' the evil spirits that we have within our home. The magic mirror has to be always covered, and only used to see if there are demons nearby.
Chinese witches believe in the efficacy of spells. These must be in dark red on yellow paper, or normal red. To do this, use a pencil made from peach wood, tracing a strange calligraphy which is called "Heavenly". This spells, once written on paper, often sticking above a door or hiding under the hair. They also burn them, mixing the ashes with tea or water, and then drink it. So, good luck permeates the entire body.
In terms of belief in spiritualism and mediums, everything is deeply rooted in China. Thus, for example, automatic writing is used frequently to communicate with those who are on the "other side". This is done by means of a sand box and a rod of peach, to pen mode, tools used by spirits through the medium. Those present at the meeting, ask questions by typing them in strips of paper. Then burn them, and when burn medium write responses in the sand.
The oddest thing is that pencil is placed between the two turns up the medium's hands. Thus it is impossible to control the movement and writing. It turns out that it works, and none of the people who have witnessed this know to explain how.
During this ritual, the spirit that manifests itself is treated with courtesy, and even offers a place where to sit. At the time of leaving, and after having answered the necessary questions, attendees give thanks, accompany him outside the building and fired in the middle of bow and exclamations. As it should be according to the famous oriental courtesy.

Watch our VideoMOTORISTS faced mayhem and misery today as new road changes led to snarl-ups and tailbacks.
Serious disruption was caused as diversions were set up and bus lanes cut off, causing long queues during the morning rush-hour.
The traffic controls in place for the next three years will enable work to go-ahead on the #170m revamp of Eldon Square, Haymarket Metro station and new buildings at Gallowgate in the centre of Newcastle.
The huge job involves the demolition of the southern end of Eldon Square, including the former Greenmarket, NCP car park and the old Argos store.
As traffic built up today, drivers were frustrated but welcomed the modernisation plans.
Amanda Davidson, 27, from Seaton Burn, drives to work and said the changes will cause major disruption.
The assistant manager said: “I think the traffic changes will make it horrendous for people getting in and out of the city during rush hour.
“It will be even worse during match days when thousands of people are trying to get to St James’ Park.
“The roads they have cut off are always really busy and there are bound to be major problems. I think it will take quite a while for people to get used to the changes.”
Andrew Salmond, 31, a shop worker from Gateshead added: “My main concern is not being able to use the NCP car park – and that’s the change that will cause me most problems.
“It’s good that the city centre is being developed and it’s bound to encourage people to visit Newcastle, it’s just a shame drivers are being inconvenienced.”
Peter Atherton, 65, of Wallsend, works at an office in Percy Street.
He said: “It will frustrate a lot of drivers who are travelling from the east of the city.
“I welcome the development of Newcastle but the closure of roads will inevitably cause some confusion and may in fact cause an increase in accidents.”
From yesterday until Easter 2010 car drivers are banned from turning right into Gallowgate from Percy Street, while Newgate Street will be closed to all southbound traffic from Gallowgate and the northbound route closed to cars between Clayton Street and Gallowgate.
To stop car drivers taking a short-cut through the already congested Leazes Village residential area, the council has banned through-traffic from Leazes Lane.
This closure will be monitored by a working group set up with residents and reviewed in six months.
Newgate Street has been narrowed to enable work to progress on the demolition of the NCP Greenmarket car park.
Part of St Andrew’s Street has also been closed to prevent vehicles using the area as a short-cut.
One aim of the shake-up is to keep buses moving and the plan is to ban cars turning right into Gallowgate from Percy Street.
Around 90 extra buses will be turning into Gallowgate from Percy Street each hour, on top of 100 an hour from Blackett Street.
Buses which use Newgate Street have been rerouted along Gallowgate and a no-right-turn restriction introduced to stop cars turning into Gallowgate from Percy Street.
Council chief executive Ian Stratford said: “We aim to manage these changes sensitively and well, but there will be disruption.
“That’s the price of city centre modernisation.”Join Juliet and me as we conga around the kitchen island singing Harry Belafonte’s Banana Boat Song .
Got you in the mood for a banana recipe?
The way I figure it, everyone needs a few good banana recipes. Bananas are a health food, after all. According to the LiveStrong site: “The high levels of potassium and carbohydrates in bananas make them a good source of fuel for athletes. The fiber in bananas can help to lower your risk for intestinal problems, high cholesterol, heart disease and diabetes. The fiber can help fill you up and keep you feeling full for longer, helping you keep from eating more calories than you need and gaining weight.” What’s not to love?
I figure everyone also needs a few great banana recipes to use up those unsightly overripe bananas that inevitably end up in your fruit bowl–you know, the ones that shrivel, turn black and ooze out of their skins without the least provocation. (You can, by the way, freeze those over-ripe banana bad boys and use them –right outta the freezer– in any cake recipe that calls for bananas.)
In my home, in addition to my conga-loving rescue pup, Juliet, banana obsession extends to my 27-year-old umbrella cockatoo, Moti. Woe be it to me if I don’t promptly deliver a food dish with a few banana slices to her cage early each morning. I’ve been known to make a sleepy-eyed early-morning banana run to the supermarket to keep Moti in bananas. Trust me, there is no sunshine in in anyone’s day if Moti doesn’t have her morning banana.
Moti is smart, too. Early each morning, perched on one foot next to her water bottle, she ever-so-carefully places pieces of her other foods onto the velcro-like sticky surface of her banana slices where they stay as she eats a little banana and then a little of her other foods, washing it all down with big gulps of fresh water. (What can I say? Everyone is a foodie in my house.)
Fortunately for us all, bananas have been around forever. Well, almost forever. Food historians trace the domestication of bananas to New Guinea around 8000 BCE, making them perhaps the first cultivated fruit. Later, Muslim traders spread the banana across Asia and into Europe and, in the 15th and 16th centuries, Portuguese explorers brought the plant to the new world. In today’s America, the average American consumes 27.9 pounds of bananas each year.
By the way, the plant in the photo (above) is a yellow African begonia, a Staudtil microsperma, from Nigeria by way of Andy’s Orchids in Encinitas. For my gardening friends who are reading this blog, here is the link to Andy’s website: Andy’s Orchids . Prepare to be overwhelmed by the collection Andy has put together.
This truly wonderful banana cake recipe is adapted from one that appeared in Baking: From My Home to Yours by Dorie Greenspan. Here is a link to that book: Dorie Greenspan, Baking: From My Home to Yours.
From everyone here, Day-O! to you and yours.
Serves 1 Slice
20 minPrep Time
1 hr, 5 Cook Time
1 hr, 25 Total Time
Ingredients
- 3 C. all-purpose flour
- 2 t. baking soda
- 1/2 t. salt
- 8 ounces unsalted butter (at room temperature)
- 2 C. sugar
- 2 t. vanilla extract
- 2 large eggs (room temperature)
- 5 large very ripe bananas (mashed)
- 1 C. sour cream (or plain yogurt)
Instructions
- Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Carefully grease your bundt pan.
- Whisk flour, baking soda and salt together. Set aside.
- Add butter to the bowl of a stand mixer and mix until the butter is creamy. Add the sugar and beat until the butter/sugar mixture is pale in color and fluffy in texture. Add vanilla to the butter mixture. Add eggs (one at a time) and mix thoroughly after adding each egg--about one minute after adding each egg. Lower the speed of your mixer from medium to low an add mashed bananas. Then, add one half of the flour mixture and mix. Add the sour cream and mix to combine. Add the remainder of the flour to the batter. Mix until ingredients are combined.
- Using a spatula, scrape the batter into your prepared bundt pan. Rap the bundt pan on your counter once or twice once all the batter is in the pan. This will remove any air bubbles from the batter.
- Bake on the middle rack in the center of your oven at 350 degrees F. for 65 to 75 minutes. (Cover your cake loosely with tin foil for the last 15 minutes of baking.) Your cake will be done when a toothpick or wooden skewer comes out clean when inserted into the center of the cake.
- Let cake cool on your counter and unmold onto your serving plate. Serve plain dusted with powdered sugar or drizzle a powdered sugar glaze (powdered sugar mixed with a little milk) onto the cake. You can serve this immediately or wrap it in plastic wrap and serve the next day. According to the original recipe, the texture of the cake improves when wrapped overnight and served the next day.Here you can find more picture about Pinterest Spring Art Projects For Kindergarten.

It is a sector of the child population, which is incredibly vulnerable, children who have virtually no present or future.
Sami, the education delegate of the Akaki kebele (neighbourhood), who as you know is blind, is bringing blind children, who are normally shut in their homes, to school. He also brings children with mental disability. These are children who are permanently locked up and many times tied up in their homes because their families have to go to work and don’t have any other way of avoiding that they endanger themselves.
At the Akaki Mengist school there are only two classes for these children. So we need to build more classrooms. To begin with we had thought that one day we could construct a completely new school, but Akaki Mengist has offered us land to construct more classrooms for the blind and deaf children. This option is cheaper and has the advantage that the classrooms will be in a school that is already up and running. The physically disabled will be able to work in the vegetable garden, which will be made bigger.
We also want to fulfil another dream: the creation of a kindergarten for blind babies. This will be at Abugida, at the entrance to the school.
In summary, followers of Mediterranea, we start 2011 with much motivation, and don’t want to forget to say thank you for being there and thank you all for allowing us to do what are doing. Hopefully the family of Mediterranea will continue growing and allow us to do even more.Samsung wants your Galaxy Note 7 phone Toronto, ON, Canada / (CIQB FM) 101.1 BigFM Chris Liedtke October 13, 2016 08:49 pm Orde Saunders / CC If you have a Samsung Galaxy Note 7 (you know, one of those phones that has been catching on fire), starting today you can return it to the store you purchased it at for an exchange or a full refund.

News that Heathrow is proposing not one, but two new runways in its submission to the Davies Commission on aviation expansion, is the culmination of a crafty lobbying strategy that swung into action as soon as the last election was over.
The Tories and Liberal Democrats won votes in London for their commitment to overturn New Labour's decision to go ahead with a third runway. As soon as David Cameron got his feet under the table, that policy was rolling backwards.
Corporate lobbyists told him he would eventually have to agree and suggested how to do it. Set up an enquiry, they said, shift the debate away from whether new capacity is needed at all, in light of runaway climate change, to be about where in the south-east new capacity will be.
Let everyone put forward their views – even Bonkers Boris and his hair brained island gateway plan.
Get Howard Davies, former head of the Confederation of British Industry – one of the main cheerleaders for airport expansion – to finalise his commission’s report after the next election, so it is not an issue in London. Then whichever party is in power can study it carefully – and then give Heathrow and the airline industry what it wants.
The Financial Times has called the Davies Commission a "battle of ideas", but it is no such thing. It is just underhand chicanery to circumvent popular opposition in London, including in Tory or Lib-Dem strongholds like Richmond and Kingston.
Heathrow made the astonishing claim that by adding a third, and then a fourth, runway they would be able to reduce the noise nuisance. They must think we are plane stupid.
The new runway will increase the number of flights by 54% from 480,000 to 740,000 each year. About 250,000 people are already deemed to be suffering from noise nuisance so how can more than doubling the number of flights make it quieter?
Heathrow runs at 98% capacity, unlike rivals at Paris Charles De Gaulle, Amsterdam Schiphol and Frankfurt which all have spare capacity. They want to use it to add more long-haul flights to the industrial and commercial hubs in India, China, Brazil and Russia. Heathrow does not want to be left behind.
Whilst Heathrow has proposed three possible sites for a third runway – either to the north, northwest or southwest of the existing airport – this may be no more than a trick. The southern route would put wealthy homeowners in Richmond and Twickenham under the flight path. One of the northern routes would require demolition of the village of Harmondsworth.
The second northern route is almost the same as the original proposal and would mean demolition of 2,500 homes in Harlington, Cranford Cross and Sipson and this is the one Heathrow wants.
However, they were at pains to stress that it is the government that will make the final decision, adding a figleaf of democratic accountability over the whole sordid adventure.
The government's advisory Committee on Climate Change has written to Davies, reminding him that aviation emissions are included in the UK's legally binding emissions reduction targets.
The target, which is to reduce economy-wide emissions by 80% against 1990 levels by 2050, can only be achieved if aviation emissions are reduced to 2005 levels by 2050.
This is totally incompatible with Heathrow's plans for airport expansion. Heathrow Airport Holdings Ltd, which owns Heathrow, Stansted and Aberdeen airports, is itself owned by a holding company called FGP Topco. It is in turn wholly owned by Spanish firm Ferrovial.
This year the Chinese Investment Corporation – aka the Chinese government – bought a 10% stake in Heathrow and the Qatar government sovereign wealth fund is waiting for European competition regulators to rule on whether it can buy a 20% stake.
These investments are for one purpose only – to get a return on capital that makes it a business proposition. So, in the end, neither the quality of life for Londoners nor the dangers of climate change will be deciding factor. As always, it will be business as usual.

My mother, of sturdy Midwestern stock, seemed to view meatloaf as a catch-all cloaking device for whatever bits and scraps remained in the refrigerator or pantry at the end of a given week (month? year?). I can remember watching with mounting distaste as carrots, spinach, rhubarb--was that oatmeal?--disappeared into her Pyrex mixing bowl, and wondering why a raw egg needed to be part of this process. Just observing the assembly of my mom's meatloaf had me convinced before my first bite that this was quite likely the most disgusting food ever invented. And then it came out of the oven--a craggy, rectangular meteorite from the part of space where they stare you down with unflinching meat-and-spinach eyes. I may have only been five years old, but I knew I was
NOT. GOING. TO. EAT. THAT.
Well, you can imagine what happened next. In the classic parent-child food battle maneuver, I sat at the dinner table and refused to eat a single bite. Mom, not to be outdone in battle strategy, pulled the parent checkmate of you'll-sit-there-until-you-finish-it-even-if-it-takes-all-night! I really thought I could stick to my guns on this one, but around 2 AM (okay, it was probably only about 7:30) I was getting pretty sick of banging my heels on the rattan seat of my chair while my brother played. I grudgingly accepted defeat and picked up a piece of (now cold) brown meteorite and willed myself to eat it. And it was indeed wretched.
Being the kind of kid who loved to make lists of favorites and least favorites--favorite color: pink, favorite stuffed animal: Puffalump--I quickly placed meatloaf at the very top of my LFFL, least favorite foods list. (Move over, lima beans.) For the remainder of my years at home, I gave my mom so much grief every time she cooked it that she eventually caved and stopped making it altogether. Still, over the years, meatloaf has remained the unshakeable king of my LFFL. Even as an adult, if forced to eat meatloaf under social duress, I have always made sure to spread it around my plate as much as possible to make it look like I've actually made a dent in the stuff.
The problem with meatloaf now that I am an adult, however, is that my husband loves it. So recently, motivated by wifely devotion, I decided to take a chance and try a meatloaf recipe I found in one of my favorite cookbooks, The Cleaner Plate Club, which incidentally focuses on getting your kids to eat healthy foods. How ironic. All the recipes I've tried from this cookbook have been great, so I thought I'd give it a go. Plus, it didn't call for anything revolting, which helped ease my trepidation. In fact, the ingredients actually looked appealing--parmesan cheese, fresh rosemary, garlic, homemade roasted tomatoes. I ended up using tomatoes and rosemary from our garden, some good quality ground beef, and yes, the requisite raw egg. And much to my surprise, the end result was…dare I say…delicious? I could barely believe my tastebuds. This fresh and fragrant comfort food was endangering meatloaf's long-held number one position on my LFFL. I even had seconds.
It may sound strange, but I feel like meatloaf is teaching me a lesson. Meatloaf seems to be whispering (with its meat-and-spinach mouth) that things are not always what they seem, that it is possible to change our minds about even the most white-knuckle-gripped opinions. Granted, my cookbook's recipe is drastically different from my mom's everything-but-the-kitchen-sink concoction, but if I can change my mind about meatloaf, what else can I re-think? My attitudes about people, places, things? I don't ever want my opinions to become so calcified that there is no room for change. Because how boring is that? I'd like to think I will carry the meatloaf lesson with me as I go about decision-making and opinion-forming in my daily life.
Though I do promise I will not be carrying around any actual meatloaf. No matter how good it tastes, that would just be gross.
But it you'd been forced to eat honey lentil loaf, it'd be a different story. :) I think money would have to be involved for that to pass my lips again.
I have six half-sized loaves of this recipe in my freezer:
I would like to put it on the record that I don't actually LOVE meatloaf. I enjoy meatloaf. It's tasty, but not necessarily beloved.
The new recipe, however, is really really delicious. Perhaps as close to beloved meatloaf as ever.Trail Patrol Training

Friday, June 6, 2008
On a whim I received notice of a stealth 1.5 day training camp in Andorra. I was to drive into Andorra with mechanic Tom Hopper early in the morning, ride in and around Saleu for 5 hours, stay the night in one of their classy establishments, grab the bike once more and head back to Girona. All in an effort to recon the area for a future training camp at altitude in the high, high, very high, pyrenees.
With it all said and done and the recon officially satisfied I can tell you that Andorra is a sensational locale for bike riding, training, vacationing and anything else bred for the high mountains. In 5 hours I climbed on top of the world and then a little higher. the average altitude there is around 6000 feet and each climb I did, (5), went to a different branch of the huge ski area there, Vallnord. Actually it seems that there is only one ski area in Andorra, but that ski area is made up of many stations. It would be like if in the rocky mountains all of the areas were called Steamboat. Anyway, if you ever go to Andorra, just know that it´s possibly the most spectacular places in the world. Small, but beautiful. ¿I wonder... if you flattened it out, how big would it be?: Chiffon

The Mighty Oaks came out on fire and the Patriots looked a little befuddled in the early going as the Mighty Oaks scored 5 goals in the first 12 minutes. The Patriots settled down and started to play much more effectively as the first half went on, but the halftime score was OCU 6, SCC 0.
The second half was much better for SCC as David Barrett scored a goal off a pass from Orest Arendacz and the team as whole possessed the ball and played much better at both ends. However, the damage had already been done, and the final score was OCU 7, SCC 1.• MATERNITY •
Pregnancy is a magical time, the promise of new hope, new dreams, a new life. A maternity photography shoot ensures you can preserve this special time. For friends and family awaiting your ‘new arrival’, booking you a baby bump photoshoot is a lovely idea for a baby shower gift.
When your bundle of joy arrives, you will have many opportunities to take photographs, but only one chance to capture and remember your baby bump.
You’ve all heard people tell you that you are ‘glowing’ when you’re pregnant and that’s the feeling we want to capture but for those of you who feel that’s not the case, maybe you have aches, pains and are not feeling your best, that is where I come in. You have a baby in your body, it’s fantastic and together we’ll take photographs that capture your GLOW!
I know it seems an unlikely time for a photo shoot, you’ve got a huge tummy, probably aches and pains, you feel tired and unless it’s your day job, you have probably never felt less like ‘modelling’. I get it, but you really won’t regret it, a client has never said to me “I wish I had not done that”. You will thank yourself for taking these images in the future. No need to feel awkward, I will not ask you to strike any difficult poses, if it comes to rolling on the floor, I’ll be down there first showing you exactly what to do. I will expertly direct you like a true model.
Generally, we will take photographs in your own home, where you feel comfortable, safe and relaxed. We can shoot on location if you would like some natural outdoor portraits. Lifestyle shots with your partner and other siblings, capturing those cute, precious little moments, but mostly bump shoots are about mum-to-be so we’ll use your beautiful body to make some fantastic posed images you will really cherish. It’s all about the bump, but it’s entirely up to you how much of yourself you are happy to show, but we’ll talk all this through beforehand.
I consider it a privilege every time I’m asked to do a maternity photography shoot, this really is such a precious time, you have come to me for your bump portraits and I will do everything I can to give you beautiful images and artwork. Keep these forever in an elegant coffee table book, with a lovely large canvas for the master bedroom.How Art became a victim of the Digital Age
0 been robbed of their creation thanks to the digital world we live in. Take for example, Prince, who died recently and absolutely refuse to let people use his music unless it was paid for in some way. Or for that matter, artist photographers who are routinely called photoshop hacks because nothing they do is ever good enough for an audience fed on a steady stream of fake digital photos.
What about the aging artist continue to struggle to get their work noticed, not that they are not any good but have yet to be discovered by social media. Then there are the craftsmen, who do what they do because of skill and technique and will never attain the merits of being an artist.
Photography is no different. Photographic art sells, but for that you need to be a desktop artist and not one operating a digital camera.
It's hard to justify the worth of a picture these days if it is shot in digital. I remember a time when being a photographer was a hardskill that had to be applied creatively. You need to know about the various types of film, how to develop it in a darkroom and how to print and dodge it with a enlarger. The chemicals were different, color negs, positive film, b/w and let's not forget about the type of paper used in the darkroom printing process. If a client want to blow up a picture to poster wall size, they come back to you and you have to find a good lab to do that. This was craftsmanship at its finest.
Photographers were artist in the time of analogue film. They were admired and respected. The craftsmen of the photo trade also existed of course but they were not in high demand. These were the journeymen of the industry. Photographers who mastered the art of analog photography only developed those one of a kind prints. It wasn't something you'd find off a line printer because developing it on print also took a certain kind of skill.
Today, the darkroom is a computer and the art is the digital filters you can dial in through Instagram or a camera app that works on your iPhone.
Then the Internet came Along....
Digital is the way to go. There is nothing more to learn beyond processing it on a computer, which you must own of course, and with the right software...available free online if you know where to find it. What's more mobile apps offer you the chance to dial in those enhancements to photos with minimum skill. Want a sepia effect? Just ante up on that in-app purchase if you don't already have it. Digital has leveled the playing field so anyone with a smartphone can be a photographer. Even Steve McCurry, an ambassador of sorts for photojournalism declared he is no longer a photojournalist but a visual story teller. He switched places and got a whole lot of flak for this.
Digital Photography is a non skill judging from the low expectations of both clients and photographers. If you try to explain the complex digital procedures during a shoot, they will laugh at you. Got a problem? The use Photoshop to solve it. For this, you need to be skilled in Photoshop....and talent hasn't got anything to do with it. It is a matter of skill on how you brush in or brush out a subject. You need to illuminate a certain area of a picture, you just dial in the overexposed in photoshop. You become a keyboard jockey once you learn all the hot keys needed to perform this on the fly.
Lighting is very easy to learn these days with the instant results you get from digital filters and enhancements. Got a studio with strobes? Even simpler! Shoot each frame and compare the lighting exposure. It takes a fraction of a second for a frame to be shot and if you can't get it right after 3 shots, you got to be autistic. It was different in the days of analog. Even after taking exposure readings, you had to bracket the frame (three shots) to be safe. There is no fall back if exposure is wrong.
For years, Kodak and Fujifilm had to teach people how to use their film, and even held seminars for professional photographers. I attended them in my time and that's when the manual cameras were going out of fashion. People switched to all automatic film cameras but thanks to the film stocks, you could never be sure you have a hit or miss because Kodachrome behaved differently than negative film. So it was back to manual controls. I started to appreciate photography because it was complicated and knew that if I picked it up, it would go well with my writing. Yes, I started writing for newspapers and magazines using a manual typewriter....you know the sort that had actual physical keys which hammered a thin film of ink ribbon to paper. With a film camera in my bag, I was a photojournalist as well. How times have changed now that everything you want to do can be performed from the comfort of a Starbucks cafe with free WIFI and your smartphone. Everything you write or photograph can be up in social media in a matter of minutes.
How Digital Killed the Analog Star
Did I shoot using Kodachrome? Yes I did. It was a bitch to learn to use but I picked it up after countless failures. Each time I got a package in the mail (you had to send it overseas for developing), my fingers could not contain the excitement as the postman rung the door bell to tell me I had mail.
Kodachrome was a hidden art that few photographers would learn to use in their lifetime. Casual photographers would never turn to Kodachrome as learning it was a trial by fire. You see, there are no sample shots you can look at or metadata to refer to. Each time you took a shot, you jot down the exposure data. The scene had to be remembered in your head as when your Kodachrome slides came back, you had to remember why it didn't turn out the way you remembered it. That was how difficult it was but you could pick that up if you spent time learning about film stocks and its nuances.
These days everything in photography has to do with economics and there is nothing Nikon and Canon can do to change that. First, I have been shooting for over 20 years, on film, instant and now digital, worked with some of the best photographers in the world and now seen how photography has taken on new meaning with digital thrown in.
Economics is what determines the success of any type of technology and for digital, the same is true for users who buy into those thousand dollar equipment in the hope of making it professionally.
It ain't easy making a living with digital equipment. Think of the investment, then think of the returns and you know why digital has been a difficult value point. Nikon and Canon want you to spend more money on equipment, buy more lenses, upgrade to new camera bodies every 12 to 18 months.
Rapid Growth before a Decline
Digital DSLRs saw rapid growth from 2006 onwards, before tapering off in 2011, the trend now is to headed south, thanks largely to mobile smartphones.
I must say that I don't use a DSLR to shoot anymore. There is no reason to as I don't shoot professionally for anyone. Even when I do, I try to capture everything on a mobile device. Why? Coz it's a hobby. I turn down request to shoot because the pay is far too little and I am not in the mood to compete with people who flash around hefty DSLRs. Besides, taking a good photo is not difficult. If you know how to position your camera in view of the scene before you, you'd get a picture. It is not rocket science. Digital makes it real easy for you to get an idiot proof instant result that you can share with the world on Instagram.
DSLRs are great to have. Good to use if you find paying clients but these days, the only paying clients are those in wedding, commercial events or products and news. Even photojournalism doesn't pay enough to warrant you to take up a hefty insurance tab from Lloyds of London and going out to a war zone to make money shooting images. It's much cheaper for the news agencies to hire the locals from the war zone. Pay them peanuts too.
Does the world remember the last conflict photojournalist who fell in the line of duty? No. The world at large doesn't much give two hoots about who died photographing a war because digital images are apparently worthless beyond a use by date. Those who have died in Syria, Iraq, Libya....will be forgotten.
Digital pictures are passed around like a cheap hooker and after constant use as memes, would you even pay to enter an art gallery to see the real picture from the one you find on the web?
Would I have given two hoots about a photographer who gets beheaded on a YouTube video? Nope. I really have no business to care. People die all the time and I hope it was worth your entertainment because the real pictures from a war zone isn't worth much these days.
Pictures are Sold as Royalty Free
Yes, I have sold my pictures online. All of them are royalty free. Rights managed photos don't sell well because, well, they are expensive.
These days, people rarely buy photos which are rights managed for print advertising. And I have pointed this out before when competing brands sometimes stumble on the same image and these gets used in a newspaper advert....both at the same time.
Turn to the internet, and you would be inundated with offers to royalty free stock image libraries that sell loads of photos for one flat price.
Crowd sourcing single use photos are now popular. A brand name yogurt company can now do away with a dedicated photo shoot with a commercial photography when they dangle an offer to the crowd sourcing community to produce a picture they can use online and in print. The cost? maybe in the region of 300 to 500 USD. WTF? A commercial photographer would charge 4 times as much to produce that same photo. Now you see the difference?
And if you have good skills on photoshop, you can make those royalty free images even better by removing the background brand names on the city streets and replacing them with less obvious signs. This is what you need to do to sell a five dollar royalty free stock photo.
The Future is in Limited Prints
Digital photos are retouched, it's like a model whose had a ton of plastic surgery done on her. Film photos can be digitally scanned and enhanced, but you can still buy the real thing, a print from an analog negative. That's the real deal. No hocus pocus with Photoshop.
Iconic photo prints from analog film are going to be collectables one day. Just like the ones that was used to shoot Steve Jobs for the book. Both pictures featured in the book were taken on analog film. So who gets the last laugh? Certainly not the digital photographer.
Today, people keep photo albums on Flickr and Google Photos. No one even prints photos anymore. I have a family album which I pieced together and this is for those who wish to remember me when I am gone. But for the rest of you on digital, your digital account dies with you. Forgotten as though cobwebs had obscured your digital account. I don't even have digital photos of my best friend who died seven years ago, just a memory of his email address. And if a friend had a Facebook account, his profile will be put in cold storage if left inactive for more than a year. The memory of the dead will not stay alive on Facebook.
An iconic analog print photo signed and autographed will be an investment. That is art. It increases in value over time. The other stuff shot on digital, not so.
Photography has evolved into the fast food business—and anyone can learn to make a burger from scratch at McDonalds. Make of that what you will....Meandering through Montmartre.│ Montmartre, in Paris’s 18th arrondissement, is one of the most well-known districts in this beautiful French city. It is also one of the easily recognizable. Even from across the city, on the top of the Arc de Triomphe, one can see this 130 meter high hill. At the summit, the Sacré-Cœur Basilica rising high above the Paris rooftops. Montmartre is famous not only for its remarkable church, but also for its bohemian past. The district was once home to artists such as Salvadar Dalí, Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso and Vincent van Gogh. Montmartre is perfectly picturesque! If you search out the quieter streets you will immediately feel the inherent charm that this Paris neighborhood radiates. It is therefore no surprise that it draws millions of visitors every year.
We started our exploration of this area at the Moulin Rouge on Boulevard de Clichy, and then slowly meandered up the hill. We had no definite goals, except that we would end up at the top at the hill, at the Sacré-Cœur Basilica..
Here are some highlights from our walk through Montmartre…
Here’s a great idea for those not that keen on walking:
Take a picturesque mini train ride through the alluring streets of Montmartre and look over the romantic views and sights of this vibrant neighborhood. You can hop off at Sacre Coeur for some views over the city and to explore this famous church. Stretch your legs at the Moulin Rouge, on the way down. That being said, we HIGHLY recommend walking through this area. But if that’s not your idea of fun, then grab a ride on this train!
The Petit Train de Montmatre leaves every 30 minutes in the summer, and every 45 in the winter, with guided commentary in Frech or English. The train runs later (10.00 – 21.00) in June, July and August. It departs from Place Blanche (opposite the Moulin Rouge) or at the top of the hill, Place de Tetre. More information here.
Above left, The Moulin de la Galette is a windmill and corresponding.
Artists, such as Renoir, van Gogh, and Pissarro have immortalized Le Moulin de la Galette; likely the most notable was Renoir’s festive painting, Bal du moulin de la Galette.
La Butte Montmartre
What is now referred to as la Butte Montmartre was once a small village. The small “square” which you see above, lined with ancient buildings and small cafés, is the oldest part of this village. We often noticed the off angles of buildings and streets in Paris. Here that was especially evident, and is due to the fact that some of these buildings are centuries old.
Above (middle of image), La Bonne Franquette . This is a restaurant where famous artists including Pissarro, Sisley, Cézanne, Toulouse-Lautrec, Renoir, Monet, Zola et Vincent Van Gogh gathered over a meal and good wine in the last century. This place is over 400 years old and still going strong. It stands at the intersection of Des Saules Street, of Norvins Street, and of Saint Rustique Street.
Above (on the right in the image), Le Consulat is a another very old café and bar on the Rue Norvins.
These charming small cafés quickly become packed in the late morning and late afternoons, and are wonderful places from which to savour local life and colours.
After a few quiet moments in Saint Pierre de Montmartre, we made our way over to the Sacré-Cœur Basilica. The crowds were absolutely crazy! Since we had the stroller, and the we wanted to avoid the frustrations, we split up! Mommy went off to take some pictures. Eli and daddy used this time to enjoy some time around the exterior of this famous church. Sacra-Coeur, and the park below it, offer views to the Seine and beyond.
We finished our walking tour of Montmartre by heading down from the base of the sacred hill to Rue Steinkerque. This busy little street has a certain gritty charm, with a mixture of cheap clothing stores, discount fabric merchants, and souvenir shops. It was a little too crowded for our liking on this particular day, so we didn’t stay too long!
…
*Even though the image below is at the end of this post, it was actually our starting point for this walking tour of Montmartre. We placed it here because, technically, it is not a part of Montmartre. Moulin Rouge, however, lies so close to the hill it’s often associated with it.*
Just three blocks away from the Café des 2 Moulins you’ll find the first stop on our little tour. The famous Moulin Rouge on Boulevard de Clichy. We stopped here to take a couple of pictures of this famous windmill. This is the place where cancan dancing was invented.

Of the numerous cartoon series to dominate our screens over the last couple of decades, most have several elements in common. From The Simpsons to Daria to Family Guy to lesser imitations like American Dad and King of the Hill, all feature normal-yet-dysfunctional American families, whose antics reveal the humor and irony of everyday experience.
These families are mostly middle-class, mostly white (though the Family Guy spinoff The Cleveland Show is an exception), mostly all straight and mostly suburban. The best of these cartoons are apt at parody, and can even use satire to expose and critique issues rampant in consumerist society. The two most popular of such shows, The Simpsons and Family Guy, seem to have the recipe for a long-running, broad-audience cartoon down to a fine art: an overweight working dad, a smart yet underappreciated mom, a less-than-brilliant delinquent son, an intelligent nerdy daughter and a baby everyone underestimates. Throw in a dog (talking or otherwise) and you have the template for the American cartoon family.
At first glance, it seems understandable that many would lump Fox’s Bob’s Burgers in with the rest of these shows. The cast of Bob’s is indeed white and middle-class (though closer to working-class than most), American, rather rotund and composed of a straight married couple with three children. The show is skilled at pulling off parodies of unexpected source texts like Stand By Me, Jaws, The Unbearable Lightness of Being, The Goonies and Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome.
Bob’s Burgers
The episodes explore the mundane humor of the everyday, and at the end of each episode, the characters return to their lives of school and work. Yet despite these similarities, Bob’s Burgers is unique for its sweetness.
Bob and Linda Belcher run a struggling eponymous burger restaurant in the seaside town of Wagstaff, a fictional place reminiscent of Coney Island. They live directly above the shop with their three children; 13-year-old Tina, 11-year-old Gene and 9-year-old Louise, who are also their unofficial and only employees. Though most episodes begin with a standard day at the restaurant or in the halls of Wagstaff Elementary, they soon turn charmingly hilarious. This is usually when Bob seizes on a plan to boost the restaurant’s popularity, Linda seeks out an opportunity to practice her less-than-spectacular song and dance skills, Tina finds a new way to embarrass herself in the pursuit of seeing boys’ butts, Gene takes on a new keyboard or fart-related project, or Louise hatches an evil plan to take over the world.
Unlike Daria, Bob’s Burgers is lacking in cynicism, its only adolescent character a naïve optimist. Unlike The Simpsons and Family Guy, Bob and Linda have a far more equal partnership and a sincere appreciation for one another’s work. Unlike Homer, Bob adores his children and unlike American Dad, the show does not feel derivative at all.
Bob’s Burgers gets away with more Gene-centered toilet humor than it should, and Tina’s obsession with rear ends is a joke that should have grown old by now. Yet Bob’s is consistently funny, original and endearing. Far more than any other family animation on our screens, Bob’s Burgers is amusing, unusual and full of heart.

- Bob's BurgersSuck It Up is a new endless runner mobile title from Kiseki Games, that is all blocky and cute. In this iOS-only game you are controlling a flying UFO and your main goal is to suck up farm animals and plants for research purposes. But be careful, as there are things on the field that you wouldn’t want to suck up. Play around the game and avoid all the hazards while discovering everything. Suck them all up with the help of our special Suck It Up strategy guide.
1. Master The Controls
The game has simple controls but they feel can kind of sluggish so it will take a bit of getting used to. You need to swipe the screen if you want to move the UFO around. Be careful when you swipe because you might move too fast or too far. You don’t want to accidentally suck up dangerous objects. You also want to be careful of where you swipe. If your UFO ends up outside of the floating island, it will take damage.
2. Claim Your Daily Rewards
Logging in everyday has its perks in the game. Daily rewards are given to those who play every day. Rewards can range from coins to items. If you don’t have time to play the game, you can just login for a quick second just to get those rewards. Free stuff is always good so make sure you don’t miss out!
3. To Suck Or Not To Suck?
In almost every game there will be things that can kill you. In this one, you need to be careful of some things that you can pick up. You don’t have to suck everything up. Coins, fruits, animals, and water are some of the things that are safe. There will be a green circle indicating that you can continue to the next area if you already completed objectives for that stage. Anything after that will be added to your points for a better score. If there are enemies beside an item or something hazardous it is better to leave them alone than risk sucking up unwanted things. There is more loot in the next area so don’t force it. Hazards like bombs that can blow up but the game will give you a chance to put out the fires that the bomb caused. If there is water nearby, you can pick it up to put out the flames. Be wary of characters too as they can attack you.
4. Reviving Your Character
The game can get pretty tricky but they are fair enough to give you a chance to revive yourself with the coins that you’ve been collecting. You can use those to revive. Coins are hard to come by so think first before you revive. Don’t use it when it is too early because clearly, it’s a waste. Coin revival is expensive and should be used as a last resort. You will also be given the option to watch an ad in exchange for revival. Take advantage of that instead.
Life as an extra-terrestrial has its ups and downs but it won’t be too hard just as long as you follow our Suck It Up strategy guide! We hope you’ve enjoyed our list of tips and tricks for the game. If you know additional hints for Suck it Up, be sure to let us know in the comment section!Dental Awareness Month

Great necessities are all around characterized.
We regularly hear that great necessities are testable. This implies you have some exact, unambiguous method for figuring out whether the necessity has been met or not. Obviously, you can just characterize a test for a necessity if the prerequisite is all around characterized! So we are back to ensuring that the necessity is all around characterized. You can hop on to for business process analyst responsibilities.
To make this prerequisite very much characterized, you need to characterize who is utilizing the framework, and what that sort of individual means by simple. Regularly aheadimark
of schedule in a task, the prerequisites won't be all around characterized. Furthermore, that is OK at that phase of the task. Yet, you cannot create code that meets the clients’ prerequisites if the necessities are not clear and exact.
For use cases, numerous organizations test the preconditions and post conditions and not the individual strides of the utilization case. They consider the individual strides to be rules to how the utilization case will function, not as a matter of course the genuine exact steps. Different organizations regard each progression as an exact necessity. So the level of exactness of the progressions of your utilization case will shift contingent upon how the utilization case will be tried.Warning: Creating default object from empty value in /home/joshand1/public_html/wp-content/themes/good/library/functions/core.php on line 27 Stream o' consciousness for January » January » 05 » Stream o' consciousness for January 5th Stream o' consciousness for January 5th Posted by morren on January 5, 2011 .

I was very disappointed in your recent
vignette about Jan Wahl (Collectors,
February) and her hats. She is a fascinating person who is full of knowledge about
Holly wood and the film and entertainment
industries. She teaches classes at Dominican
University and Osher Marin and is a font of
knowledge. She is also very funny and entertaining. I thoroughly enjoy her spots on TV
on Saturday mornings. Her movie reviews are
always right on, as are her predictions for the
Academy Awards. Jan is a well-known persona in Marin. Mentioning just her hats in the
article was a slight to her and to your readers.
There should have been a much more thorough rendering of Jan Wahl in your magazine.
She deserves it. We are lucky that she lives
here and shares her knowledge and experiences with us. PAMELA LUNS TEAD, NOVATO, VIA EMAIL
The human spirit in Jim Wood’s writing on
homelessness comes through to me loud and
clear (POV, March). I can feel his concern for
people without a home and the largeness of
this shameful human tragedy. As “complex
and perplexing” as the homeless condition is
presently, I believe that homelessness can be
solved. What if we changed the lens through
which we see homelessness? Just as we have
to change the magnification of eyeglass
lenses, we need to change the lens through
which we think about the issues of life. Lens
change enables us to see objects better, to
read words more clearly, see road signs better
and extend our peripheral sight. Likewise,
we need to enlarge our way of solving problems. What if the lens change allowed us to
see a home as a basic necessity of life, just as
breathing air is? Is it reasonable to separate
an individual from breathing air? What kind
of a society do we wish to have? Do we really
want to spend a large part of our collective lives dancing with the demons brought
on by the tragedy of homelessness? What
if the lens change allowed us to see that a
home is a human right for every individual
in a civilized society? What if a lens changeBoards
Bathroom dilemma!
My bathroom is in the top of the house and has a massive velux window. It has no blind because it looks upwards so like no one can see in.
My next door neighbours are having work done to their roof. The scaffolders can see straight in and are like, 2 metres away. How do i have a shower?!
being naked isn't a big deal; just shower!
i know it's not a big deal, but they are literally looking in the window!
it'd be fine if they were naked too!
wear swim shorts?
then they'll think i'm a pussy!
it's a no win situation!
put towel over the velux so they can't see in?
They are scaffolders,
so they deffinately aren't gay. They won't want to look at your penis.
they might LOL at it!
They might confuse it with one of the poles that they are supposed to 'screw in'
with sexy results.
they are listening to Cyndi Lauper
i think they might be gay
leave the Laupernator out of this
Speedos?
Just do it all confident like
strut about like a peacock as if it's no big deal.
peaCOCK
then if they look at you go
"WHAT?! WHAT? YOU WANT SOME?! WHAT?!"
swish and flick
just pin up one of those hippy wall covering things
over the skylight.
steam up the window before getting nekkid?
^best idea^
p.s i thought this was going to be a post
about the problems that transgendered people face when choosing whether to go in a male or female toilet. because "the bathroom dilemma" is something i've heard this called. lol.
use your dad's bathroom
duh.
this is my dad's bathroom!
it's the only one with a functioning shower because the other one has been a building site for the 17 years we've lived here!
ok come round
I'll run you a bath. With bubbles this time. I have bath crayons!! how can you refuse!
OKAY!
Just have a quick rinse round the vital areas
if you have nothing to cover the window
just shower at night when they won't be there.
distract them

The Boston Preservation Alliance Preservation Achievement Awards are bestowed annually to honor outstanding achievements in historic preservation and compatible new construction in Boston.
The Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital, located at Parcel 6, has been one of the more difficult sites to develop in the Charlestown Navy Yard. This northeast end of the Navy Yard, often referred to as "Yard's End" had a long life as part of the military complex dating back to 1800 when the navy bought this pastureland for ship repair, storage and as an arsenal. Over the years, and through expansion, the area had multiple uses: timber receiving dock, wharfs and dry docks, and naval hospital for injured sailors. When the Boston Redevelopment Authority acquired the property, hard-to-find century-old live and white oak found on the site were donated to the Mystic Seaport preservation shipyard to repair historic ships. A considerable amount of granite block found on site incorporated into the site landscaping of the new Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.
Spaulding undertook a challenging site with this project: hazardous waste cleanup, state open-space requirements due to its harbor adjacency, harborwalk issues, and more. Spaulding's LEED-certified building, developed by Partners Healthcare Real Estate and Facilities, incorporates cutting-edge energy efficiency and sustainability technologies in a design that integrates well with the historic waterfront site. To meet the fifty percent publicly accessible open space requirement, Spaulding developed outdoor space to cater to both patient and public populations with a therapy garden and active sports plaza for patients and dining and environmental plazas that all can enjoy. (Source: BostonPreservation.org)
GZA's involvement included condition assessment and design of repairs and reconstruction of existing waterfront structures. Additionally, GZA designed a fully accessible Harborwalk and floating dock at an adjacent property on the Little Mystic Channel. The floating dock provides water access for Spaulding's water therapy program. Access to the float was provided by a series of pile supported floats and gangways that maintain fully compliant handicap access.Swap space in performance

Mohamed Hariri, 24, appeared in Albury Local Court through a video link from Junee jail for the bail application by his solicitor Nicholas Hanna.
Hariri, another Sydney man and a woman were arrested after drugs were found in a car and at two motels on April 13.
Ronica Thong, 29, Hariri and Mahamed Omar Elabd, 29, were originally charged with possessing more than the commercial quantity of ecstasy.
But later, fresh charges relating to the hallucinogenic drug known as nexus 2cb were laid after the seized tablets were analysed.
Hariri and Elabd were arrested at the Rydges Hotel in Albury where police allege 1000 tablets were found after they heard the toilet flushing.
“It is a circumstantial case,” police prosecutor Sgt Andrew Pike conceded yesterday.
Mr Hanna said the woman was directly involved with two other quantities of drugs.
He said Hariri had no forensic link with the drugs found at the hotel and there was a strong inference they were in the woman’s possession.
Mr Hanna said the drugs could have been put in the hotel room in Hariri’s absence.
“At this stage, we know he has denied knowledge of the drugs,” Mr Hanna said.
“There is no forensic link between this accused and the drugs found at Rydges at this stage.”
Magistrate Tony Murray said it was a weak prosecution case.
Mr Murray said it was a serious drug matter, which meant a substantial surety was required.
Hariri’s family has to provide a $20,000 cash deposit, with him entering a self-bail of $20,000.
He has to report daily to the Merrylands police station in Sydney and abide by a 9pm to 7am curfew.
He is also banned from going within 15 kilometres of any international departure point and from contacting others who have been charged over the drugs.i-mate makes a move on the software space
Local mobile device vendor i-mate anounces move into the software market with its 1-view solution, which allows customers wireless access to their media anywhere.
Windows Mobile device specialist i-mate has moved into the software market, enabling users to access music, photographs, videos and files wherever they are, on whatever PC or i-mate device they own. The 1-View solution, developed by the Dubai-based company, allows people to wirelessly access files on all their PCs from any i-mate handset, upload files and data from the device to a PC and download documents, music, photos and videos from any PC to an i-mate device. “i-mate has experienced tremendous global growth in a very short time, our entry into the global software market is in-line with our business development strategy,” says Jim Morrison, CEO at i-mate. “The 1-View solution will make high-speed data a reality and allow our customer base to get the most efficiency out of their devices and allow users full access to the digital content they already own.” The software also provides small and large businesses and enterprise users with solutions to give employees anytime, anywhere access to data stored on multiple terminals. Asked why i-mate had decided to go into the software market, Morrison says: “Because nobody else was doing what we wanted to do. Everyone was talking about the next big application, but I thought why not give people what they already own. The music they have at home, photographs, and files on their computer. With 1-View they can pull down through any device and control it that way.” The company is launching the software at Gitex because, “it remains an important stage for us,” says Morrison. “My first Gitex was four years ago. There were two of us on the Microsoft stand, and now we have a huge stand of our own with 35 people on it.” i-mate's success in recent years means that the company is now exporting its technology around the world and Morrison claims it is one of the first companies born during the recent regional boom to do so.

Medium garnet color, with a nose of cherry fruit, a bit of earth, and a thread of toastiness. Palate full of dark cherry, earth, and spice from the oak aging. Definitely a food-loving, classic Italian red.

Abstract
Of the many signaling pathways found within neurons, calcium signaling is perhaps the most ubiquitous and versatile. Calcium influx through L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (L-VGCCs) is involved in numerous aspects of neuronal function: activation and regulation of gene transcription, synaptic plasticity, and regulation of neuronal excitability are all modulated by calcium. Because many calcium-related subcellular functions are implicated in the formation and storage of long-term memory, this writer investigated the role of an L-VGCC, CaV1.2, in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. Utilizing the Cre/loxP gene-targeting system, the CaV1.2 L-VGCC isoform was conditionally deleted in the forebrain of mice. This extensive deletion was confirmed by RT-PCR and Immunoblotting. To test for spatial learning and memory, a series of Morris water maze experiments were performed. Knockout mice showed no deficits in short-term (24-hr) memory trials; however, on a 30-day memory probe, knockout mice performed significantly more poorly than their littermate controls. These results indicate the importance of forebrainspecific CaV1.2 for long-term spatial memory.

2009 Privilege 495 - Never Chartered, Circumnavigation Ready
After having circumnavigated 15 years ago on another well-known make of catamaran, my wife and I felt the Privilege 495 had the perfect blend of comfort and speed to introduce our 10-year old daughter to the life of cruising.
We purchased Dragonfly from the original owners in Australia in January 2016, and planned to spend 1 year cruising the Queensland Coast, but after settling in and enjoying our time onboard Dragonfly, we decided to extend our trip and explore the waters of Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. Having stretched our sabbatical past our initial deadline, we've decided it's now time to find Dragonfly a new owner.
We are the second owners of Dragonfly, a 2009 Privilege 495. She is in very good condition and has never been chartered.
Dragonfly's layout is galley up, with a spacious master cabin with large en suite. There are three additional cabins, two with en suites.
Dragonfly is fully equipped with features including a 7kVA Onan Cummins genset, 100L/H water maker, Sovereign stainless steel BBQ, bow sprit with gennaker, 40kg/88lb Rocna Vulcan anchor, two 54hp Yanmar engines, and much, much more.
Dragonfly is solidly built (Category A / Ocean-Going - "designed for sailing, under normal conditions of use, in wind forces exceeding 8 on the Beaufort scale"), with a high attention to design and comfort, which makes passage making or at anchor relaxing and pleasurable.
Dragonfly is currently in the Phuket/Langkawi area. We are still living aboard so she is completely turn-key for anyone interested in setting sail immediately.
Serious inquiries only please.

Try searching again, or ask your own question Our expert says: Sexologist Communication is very important in this case. As your hormones are adjusting and trying to normalize, remember that your husband also has to readjust to the idea of you transforming from wife to pregnant women to mother. each of these stages are associated with different psychological connotations.

If it was and now its not, this will have to be explored more deeply either between the two of you or with professional help. People only " change" for a reason. From my own personal experience, if my wife should say I have " changed" and now I no longer touch or cuddle or kiss or anything, she would be dead right. WHY ? you may well ask. Well I''ll tell you. SHE suddenly became all puritanical and holier than thou and when I broached the subject or tried to get things going, she would respond with, " That''s disgusting" So now I console myself with DVD''s(great action) Porn Books,(Great illustrations) and masturbating and to hell with the rest. Granted I am older than you guys, but what I am saying is that there MUST be a reason and you are too young to take the route I have taken.

Having lost both of the matches till date, by sizeable margins, Sunrisers Hyderabad will face the Mumbai Indians tonight, who are also going through a bad patch, having lost two of their first three matches.
To turn things around, Sunrisers Hyderabad will have to follow greater tactical shrewdness from their captain David Warner. They should not repeat the mistakes they did before, in the last two defeats, a positive intent and clear tactical analysis of the game holds the key to their comeback.
Showing Positive Intent:
Sunrisers have to show some positive intent to be victorious over the Mumbai Indians tonight. Despite losing both of the matches they played in this season’s Indian Premier League, they will have to keep their morals high and keep searching for their first victory of this IPL. Mumbai Indians haven’t been in a great form too, more or less both the teams are in the same position so it shouldn’t be a tough task for the Sunrisers Hyderabad.
Keeping Pitch Condition in Mind:
This is the same pitch, the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, which witnessed the Kolkata Knight Riders chasing down a target of 143 with ease. Generally, this stadium provides pitches with good bounce and carry, which helps the ball to connect in a better way with the ball resulting a high scorecard on the board, it will surely have runs to offer. Though there is no rain forecast yet.
Team Selection:
The SRH do not carry one of the strongest sides of the IPL 2016, but they surely have one of the most underrated players who has unbelievably good talent within them. With Eoin Morgan also back with his firing form in the last match, Sunrisers should stick to their starting eleven combinations.
Aiming a High Score:
Eoin Morgan had a brilliant knock of 51 in 43 balls, this Saturday, against Kolkata will come as a relief and also a big boost for the hosts. Naman Ojha also fought very hard against KKR, scoring 37 important runs for his team and the wicketkeeper-batsman will also look forward to repeating the same against Mumbai. Eyes will be on David Warner, Dhawan, Moises Henriques, Morgan and new acquisition Deepak Hooda and Ojha. On a predictable high scoring pitch with good bounce and carry the batsmen are the key to any team’s win.
Bowling Well to Stop Mumbai :
Kieron Pollard’s poor run of form might get him dropped out of the squad, as Mumbai will probably replace him with Corey Anderson or Martin Guptill. If it is the latter, their batting line-up will be stronger than before and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mustafizur Rahman hold the key to SRH’s bowling attack. SRH must search for the in-form Rohit Sharma’s wicket from the beginning, else things can get nasty!Brand Label: Steiff

Art theft is an ancient and complicated mystery was resolved by the Parisian authorities. It ended up that the 30 × 21 inch painting was taken by among the museum staff members by the name of Vincenzo Peruggia, who just carried it concealed under his coat. Peruggia did not work alone. The criminal offense was thoroughly conducted. After 2 years where Peruggia did not hear from Chaudron, he tried to make the very best from his stolen good. Eventually, Peruggia was caught by the police while trying to sell sought after conceal proof. Eventually, the Norwegian cops discovered the 2 paintings on August 31, 2006 however the facts on how they were recovered are not known.Porkin’
Braising meats takes little effort, the end result is super moist and big on flavor. This recipe uses a pork shoulder and the options for using the heap of shredded meat is endless; from tacos and enchiladas to cuban sandwiches and pasta. Braising is waiting game, that’s why we have cocktails. Better set a timer!
Yields 6 cups
Ingredients
3.5 pounds boneless pork shoulder
6 chilis in adobo
1/4 cup tomato paste
1T cumin seeds
1T coriander seeds
1T dried oregano
Salt & pepper
Procedure
Preheat oven to 325F.
Cut the shoulder in half, long ways. Then cut each half in thirds. Generously season shoulder with salt and pepper. Set aside.
In a medium mixing bowl whisk together chilies, tomato paste, cumin, coriander, oregano and 1 cup water. Add another 1.5 cups of water and stir until completely incorporated.
Place pork shoulder in a dutch oven and pour chili liquid over it. Over high heat, bring the liquid to a boil. Cover and transfer to oven. Braise for 2 hours. Remove the lid and braise for another 30 minutes. (The meat should fall apart when you poke it with a fork. And don’t be worried about over cooking it – its almost impossible!)
Remove dutch oven from the oven. Transfer the pork to a shallow dish to cool. Once pork is cool, shred with 2 forks. Moisten with the cooking liquid. UseWith the passing of the Act of Union in 1801, Ireland lost its parliament which had existed in one form or another, since the 13th century. As one can imagine, many felt aggrieved by this and as the century progressed the concept of Home Rule-having a parliament in Dublin to deal with internal affairs was broached by Isaac Butt and later further developed by Charles Stewart Parnell and John Redmond.
The first and second Home Rule Bills introduced in 1886 & 1893 respectfully, were unsuccessful due to the House of Lords power of veto but in 1911 with the passing of the Parliament Act things started to look more hopeful for the Home Rule Party and Irish Nationalists. This Act was significant as it reduced the House of Lords power of veto to a delaying in power which in simple terms meant that the third HR Bill introduced in 1912 could only be delayed for two years, so it looked likely that Home Rule would become a reality by 1914.
For Nationalists this was a dream come through but for Unionists it was a nightmare! They feared that a Catholic dominated parliament in Dublin would discriminate against them as a Protestant minority but they also worried that their economic prosperity would suffer if they were no longer part of the union. Hence, they were prepared to do everything in their power to stay in the Union and set about organising resistance to the introduction of Home Rule. Their first port of call saw them drawing up the Solemn League and Covenant –a petition signed by thousands of Unionists stating that they would resist the introduction of Home Rule with physical force if necessary. To substantiate this threat they then set up the UVF-ULSTER VOLUNTEER FORCE and imported arms in the Larne Gun Running.
However, equally as determined to see the introduction of Home Rule Nationalists set up the IVF-IRISH VOLUNTEER FORCE and brought in arms in the Howth Gun Running. As the months passed, Edward Carson and John Redmond tried hard to reach a compromise over the implementation of Home Rule in
Ulster but they couldn’t agree on the fate of Fermanagh and Tyrone. As talks broke down, it looked as though Ireland was on the brink of Civil War with both sides importing arms. However, with the outbreak of World War I, civil war was averted. Home Rule was then passed into law on 18 Sept 1914 but postponed until after the duration of WWI.
To show their loyalty to England, John Redmond now encouraged the Irish Volunteer Force to fight with Britain in the hope that Britain would look favourably on the fate of Home Rule once the war had ended. Most agreed and went to fight with Britain but for the 11,000 that remained at home they grew increasingly frustrated with the hollow victory of Home Rule. Heavily infiltrated by the IRB, they now began to make plans to stage a rebellion.
The IRB military council comprised of; Padraig Pearse ,Thomas Clarke Joseph Plunkett, Eamonn Ceannt Sean MacDiarmada and later joined by James Connolly felt that now was the time to strike. They saw England’s difficulty as Ireland’s opportunity and so started to take matters into their own hands. However, it soon became clear that their planned rising had little chance of success as they had insufficient weapons and with MacNeill’s realisation that the Castle Document had been a forgery all activities for Easter Sunday were cancelled.
Nonetheless, these men were not deterred and relied on the element of surprise and advocated Pearse’s idea of blood sacrifice. They knew they wouldn’t win but were prepared to sacrifice their lives for what they believed in. Their courage saw them standing up against the British Empire but alas their actions culminated in the imposition of martial law and the subsequent executions of 16 men.
Between the 3rd and 12th May the following men were shot for their part in the Rising;
- Pádraic Pearse
- Thomas Clarke
- Thomas MacDonagh
- Joseph Plunkett
- Edward Daly
- Michael O’Hanrahan
- Willie Pearse
- John MacBride
- Eamonn Ceantt
- Michael Mallin
- Sean Heuston
- Con Colbert
- Thomas Kent
- Seán MacDiarmada
- and James Connolly while Roger Casement was hung that August.
The executions were the main reason for the turn-around in public opinion. Initially the majority of people felt that the Rebels had stabbed England in the back during her time of need. However, soon after the swift execution of the aforementioned 15, people began to change their minds.
Shocked by the actions of General Maxwell, public opinion began to change while the hundreds imprisoned after the Rising became even more determined while in prison, to finish the work of the men of Easter Week upon their release. In essence, these prisons became Schools of Republicanism. The martyrs who gave their lives for what they believed in planted the seed in the minds of the ordinary Irish man to fight for his country and his independence; to stand up and make a difference.
As we move forward in the 21st century, let us mirror the heroism of these men; standing up for what we believe in and never losing sight of the fact that we are Irish and proud of our history and our culture.You are here : Doughty Engineering

TICKED: A Medical Miracle, a Friendship, and the Weird World of Tourette Syndrome by award-winning journalist James A. Fussell and Jeffrey P. Matovic
Chicago Press / May 2013
** Please watch this short news segment about Jeff Matovic to get a brief sense of this story:
“I'm not sure whose story is more remarkable—medical pioneer Jeff Matovic, or the man he has entrusted his tale to, Jim Fussell. The duo share much more than Tourette's Syndrome. They share huge hearts, tremendous courage, and wonderful senses of humor. Whether it is writing about the sexy woman and fellow sufferer, trying to undress him at in the lobby of a Tourette’s convention, or a drill boring through Matovic's brain, Fussell finds the heartbreak, humanity, and, ultimately, the uplift, we all seek. Wonderfully written and inspiring.” – Joe Drape, author of the New York Times best-selling Our Boys
About the book: Jeffery P. Matovic, dubbed “The Miracle Man” by Oprah Winfrey, was diagnosed with Tourette Syndrome at the age of six. Tourette Syndrome is an unusual neurological disorder that causes sufferers’ bodies to move uncontrollably. Sometimes they swear, or scream, sometimes their legs, arms, heads, and whole bodies twitch and tic, and sometimes the ticing is so violent they can dislocate a joint or crack a bone. Each sufferers’ form of ticing is different. There is no cure. For Jeff, who had an extremely severe case of Tourette, his entire body would convulse constantly, making it impossible for him to drink from a normal cup, walk down stairs, or even sleep. Along with the pain and difficulty operating in daily life, comes a big dose of ridicule from those who don’t understand. For Jeff, life became unbearable around the age of 30—he could no longer take the constant pain, and his tics were so bad he couldn’t walk—but then a miracle happened. He was approved for an experimental deep brain stimulation surgery that hadn’t worked on Tourette sufferers in the past. And against all odds it worked on Jeff, making medical history and landing him in the global spotlight. But as Matovic reached his highest point, Jim Fussell hit his lowest. After surviving his own Tourette’s for 40 years, the veteran feature writer for The Kansas City Star couldn’t take it anymore. Exhausted, on deadline and shaking so hard he could hear the “thud” his brain made when it slammed into his skull, he sank under his desk and began to sob. But when he met the “Miracle Man,” his whole life changed. This inspirational story of friendship, hope, and overcoming incredible odds, takes readers into the often strange world of Tourette and into the hearts of two amazing men.
About the authors: Jim Fussell is an award-winning journalist who has worked for The Kansas City Star for more than a quarter century. His stories appear regularly in the paper’s FYI section, where his work is seen by a million readers per week. His articles also appears online at Kansas City.com, and are sent around the world on the nation’s news wires. He began his career with The Miami Herald in 1984 after receiving a political science degree from the University of Nebraska, and doing graduate work in journalism. His latest award came when he won first place for general feature in the national 2009 Excellence-in-Feature-Writing Contest sponsored by the American Association of Sunday and Feature Editors. He lives in Lenexa, Kan. with his wife, Susan. They have two children.
Jeff Matovic is a medical pioneer and motivational speaker whose groundbreaking miracle has inspired people from Seattle to Saudi Arabia. News of his dramatic recovery was carried on The Oprah Winfrey Show and programs around the globe. For his courage in defeating Tourette Syndrome through deep brain stimulation he won the Campion Shield for Heroism from his alma matter, John Carroll University, and the national Shining Star of Perseverance award from Assurant Employee Benefits. Jeff lives in Cleveland with his wife, Debra, and their four children where he still receives telephone calls and e-mails from people from around the world.All will be revealed next week according to Gowfers’ manager Alan McSkimming, but until then, he’s keeping mum.
He said: “The club is adamant they are not going to release the names of the new signings until Monday. They want to release the names all at the same time because two of the guys’ contracts don’t expire until June 30.
“As much as I can say is that six players are coming into the club, two of whom are Highland League players and the rest play at the top level of junior football.”
What he can talk about is pre-season and the club has just arranged their final friendly. Alan said: “The last friendly has been arranged for August 3 against an East of Scotland side called Edinburgh City.
“A bit like the Highland League they play at a slightly higher level than junior which is a great opportunity to test ourselves before our league campaign starts.”ds of soldiers positioned round region local authority or authorities, The little princess or queen survived outside of the composite level in sentry, Intensively covered.

SOURCE Texas Instrumentsbut I do! It is amazing. You think your huge early in your pregnancy and then you realize you really weren't that big and it is all relative. I am 36 weeks along right now, and am wondering when the baby will decide to make an appearance. This week I'm going to pack my bag, and put the car seat in the car. I have people lined up to take care of Selena. However I hope the baby decides to come during the middle of the day, and come quickly, so Selena could just hang out in the lobby at the Birthing Inn and be able to come see the baby right after its born.
Heartburn has really been my nemesis the past few days and my feet hurt at the end of the day. Selena is super busy and it is getting hard to keep up with her. The fact that everything is physically hard and I've grown out of almost all my maternity tops has been making me kind of grumpy. I really just feel like laying in bed all day reading a book, but unfortunately that isn't an option. The good thing is I can still squat or sit down and stand up without any help and in the mornings I usually feel fine. Unfortunately as uncomfortable as I am now I kinda remember post-partum being even more so. Nature sure makes it tough to have a baby.
My last appointment went great. Baby's heartbeat was at 150bpm, my blood pressure was nice and low. I did have some protein in my urine again, but the lab work came back fine. I am negative for Group B Strep, so no antibiotics for me. The baby was in a close to optimal position with it's back along my left side. Except I think it's still moving, and at the moment it's back is just to the right of my belly button. I am so thankful the baby doesn't seem to be chilling posterior anymore. I really didn't want to have to deal with back labor, especially when I've been so diligent about my posture and where I sit. That would be really unfair. My Hypnobabies practice is going good and I'm doing a good job of practicing at least 5 times a week.
Here is a poll if you want to guess the baby's birth date, sex, and weight.
And here are some belly pictures.

you look fab! Congrats on your new one..Im almost willing to bet you may be in labor as I write this comment to you!! Oh! Thanks for the serger post, boy did that help out alot!
Congrats on your baby! We thought about having our (now 15 mo old) son at the Birthing Inn but my former job (I'm now a SAHM) switched insurance in the middle of my pregnancy so we couldn't. I ended up having to have a c-section anyway.
The Birthing Inn is a beautiful place, and I hope you have a short and easy labor!X-urbanconcepts.co.uk

Read about BALTIC's historyWell, I wasn't planning on having a blog, because I didn't want to use English. But then I decided I'd be using it less with a blog than if I was telling individual people what I was up to. So, I finally gave in and made this blog for everyone to follow my year in Finland. Hopefully I'm on here enough to keep everyone satisfied... But probably not. I apologize ahead of time.
It's down to twenty one days now until I leave, and I couldn't be more excited! I had been really stressed about packing... until last night. Packing EVERYTHING I think I'm going to need for an entire year seemed impossible. But, Mom helped me to narrow down the clothes I will take, and when I was freaking out than it wouldn't fit in my suitcase, and if it did, it would be over the 50 pound weight limit, she packed everything up in my suitcase. To my surprise, everything fit, and it was only 35 pounds! So, of course, I added a few things to the pile. Now, I'm really not worried or stressed about anything, just anxious to receive my visa and flight information to make everything official! :)Gent™ logo vector

×ARTIST / BAND: Today The Moon, Tomorrow The Sun
MP3: We Were Wild
ALBUM: WILDFIRE
FILE UNDER: Electro / Indie / Rock
LABEL: Greyday Records
INFO: I’ve always been a bit ambivalent about Today the Moon, Tomorrow the Sun. On the one hand, their dance-infused electro rock tunes have always been well-constructed and easy on the ears. On the other, their music has always had an air of timidity about it, lacking in bite and urgency. But all that may change with the release of their upcoming full-length, Wildfire, due out May 7th. The band recently posted the album’s opening track and lead single, “We Were Wild,” to their Soundcloud page and while all the familiar elements remain — the pulsating synths, the punchy percussion, the fuzz-ridden bass and effects-laden guitars — there is a tenacity to the track, both in the music and in Lauren Gibson’s vocals, that has been lacking in prior efforts. There’s also an aura of bigness to the song, a swelling grandiosity that feels neither forced nor overbearing. It remains to be seen what the rest of Wildfirehas in store for us, but if the rest of the album can measure close to “We Were Wild,” you can count me among the believers.

“Janet Todd has combed the archives, explored all the possible options, and made connections based on probabilities in such a way that a credible picture emerges of the life and personality of this fascinating, talented woman.”
‘Aphra Behn was a woman who wore masks’. So says Janet Todd at the beginning of this monumental, newly revised biography of Behn, who was a prolific dramatist, poet, novelist and translator, and ‘the first
English woman to earn her living solely by her pen’. Born sometime between 1637 and 1643, Behn never spoke or wrote of her childhood and upbringing. Much of her adult life, too, though a little better documented, is shrouded in mystery. Janet Todd has combed the archives, explored all the possible options, and made connections based on probabilities in such a way that a credible picture emerges of the life and personality of this fascinating, talented woman.
Behn was probably born in Kent, to a lower middle class family. Nothing is known of her education or upbringing, or indeed of her marriage, which doesn’t seem to have lasted very long for whatever reason. In her 1688 novella Oroonoko: or, The Royal Slave, she depicts herself as travelling as young woman to the colony of Surinam, where she met the captured African on whom the story is based. There’s no evidence at all that this story is true, but one of the facts that is definitely known is that Behn was recruited as a political spy in 1666 and spent some time in the Netherlands on behalf of King Charles II. It’s therefore possible that if she did go to Surinam, it was as a spy.
In any case, spying in Holland turned out to be less than remunerative for Behn: she had to pawn her jewellery to survive, was forced to borrow money to return to England, and then spent a year petitioning the King for payment, which she may never have received. You’d expect that this would make her an anti-royalist but she was far from that – she was a tremendous admirer of Charles II and indeed of his brother, the generally unpopular Catholic James II.
In any case, the whole Dutch experience obviously made her realise she needed another way of supporting herself, and, having already published some poetry, she now turned to the primary focus of her career, that of writing plays. The theatre, banned under the Puritans, was enjoying a huge wave of popularity in the Restoration period, and Behn became an extremely productive playwright. She also wrote novels, including the fascinating Love Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister (1684-7), a number of short stories, and a couple of collections of poetry. She did translations and adaptations, and collaborated with other writers on various works in all genres. Her health deteriorated badly in the last few years of her life, and she died in 1689.
Behn’s reputation has varied tremendously over the years, and indeed did so even in her own day. Although some of her works were extremely popular, she was considered by many as being a bawdy author, something that, though acceptable for a man, was not so for a woman. However, the women dramatists of the next generation paid tribute to her for making it possible to succeed in a career that was previously open only to men. But her reputation declined considerably in the eighteenth century, when Restoration frankness came to seem crude and immoral. By the nineteenth century, she was more or less forgotten, or if not, decried as coarse and indecent. Virginia Woolf was really breaking new ground when she wrote in A Room of One’s Own (1929) that:
“All women together ought to let flowers fall on the tomb of Aphra Behn….For it was she who earned them the right to speak their minds”.
Today, though, her work is much studied in universities, and Oroonoko, in particular, is seen as a text ahead of its time in promoting radical views of class, race and gender. Todd argues, however, that some of these views have been imposed on the work by contemporary theorists, as Behn was far from a progressive or liberal thinker in quite the way that postcolonialist or feminist theorists would like. She seems to have had little time or respect for the lower classes, nor to have had a problem with slavery, though she clearly responded to the idea of the noble savage.
There’s no doubt that Todd has done a fine job in filling in the context of Behn’s life and the wider social and political background of the period. Her close analysis of the work – plays, novels and poems – is also impressive. Although Behn seems to have liked a drink and the company of hard-living, rakeish friends, her life doesn’t appear to have been a particularly happy one. Apart from her short-lived marriage, the one relatively enduring love affair that can be more or less confirmed was with the bisexual Jack Hoyle, who may have kept her as his mistress for a period, but who seems to have had problems in consummating the relationship. This at least Todd deduces from the frequent appearance in Behn’s poetry of male impotence, especially in the case of strong, demanding women. There’s also a suggestion that Behn was not averse to relations with other women; her poem ‘To the Fair Clarinda, Who made love to me, Imagin’d more than woman’ may be read in that light, and often has been. But of course we really have no idea what she was up to most of the time. What does seem clear is that her final years were spent in poverty and increasing ill-health – a sad end for a woman who succeeded remarkably well in supporting herself through her own efforts in a male dominated world.

Chairman of the Azerbaijan Delegation to the EURONEST PA
Presiden ACSDA ,MP from Shamakhy.
Thus, Mr. James Warlick has recently visited the region together with other Co-Chairs of Minsk Group. They visited Azerbaijani territories occupied by Armenia and met “head” of the separatist regime formed by the aggressor state. Mr. Warlick again preferred to get distinguished from his colleagues and shared his “genius” idea on social network. He placed the photo of Sarsang reservoir in his account and wrote: “This is Sarsang reservoir. It would be a positive step if the parties were able to use the resources of water.” Thus, the opinion of the American co-chair is clear: he calls on the aggressor and Azerbaijan, subject to occupation, to commonly use Sarsang reservoir.
I would like to remind that 20% of our territories, including Nagorno Karabakh and 7 surrounding regions, have been occupied by Armenia for about 25 years. Several buildings of strategic importance are in the occupied territories. One of them is Sarsang reservoir.
The technical equipments are in an emergency condition due to lack of maintenance as a result of occupation of Sarsang reservoir. Thus, Sarsang reservoir is very likely to collapse due to natural disaster, technical and deliberate diversion. Any diversion, technogeneous or natural disaster is much likely to lead to ecological crisis, as well as mass casualties of 400 000 civilians living in frontier regions, and a new humanitarian catastrophe; this threat gradually becomes real.
Moreover, the aggressor opens the water from Sarsang reservoir in winter; thus, the lands are flooded, and roads erode. And in summer when people and agriculture mostly need water, they stop the water. Consequently, agriculture of frontier regions was seriously hampered, problems arose in the irrigation of farmlands, greenery dried, persistent processes occurred in biological structure of the land, and serious ecological tension emerged in the region.
Therefore, the Association for Civil Society Development (ACSDA) launched a wide-scale project on Sarsang reservoir since May of 2013. The organization made critical efforts to bring to the agenda of different international organizations the fact that Sarsang reservoir becomes a source of threat and that the aggressor uses the reservoir as a means of threat. Finally, a rapporteur on Sarsang reservoir was appointed in PACE Social Committee.
Are the opinions of American co-chair of Minsk Group on joint usage of Sarsang water reservoir concidence on the eve of such an important event? I believe that Warlick’s opinions serve specific purposes and deliberately aim at influencing the investigations of rapporteur on Sarsang reservoir. By doing this, Mr. Warlick sends message to the rapporteur and PACE members that this is an American position, behave yourself! Thus, Mr. Warlick should know as a diplomat that according to the imperative principles of the international law, the armed occupation of the territory of the other state can not be considered legal in any case and any activity of the aggressor in the occupied territories is illegal. In other words, American co-chair should know that any activity of Armenia and its separatist regime in the occupied Azerbaijani territories is illegal. Then why does Mr. Warlick make such a proposal, which is contrary to the main principles of international law?
Interestingly, when the issue of Sarsang reservoir became a subject of discussion on the international level, Artur Agabekyan, so-called “deputy prime minister” of separatist regime made the same proposal in August of 2013. Is it coincidence that the proposals of the American co-chair and “officials” of separatist regime are fully the same or are taken from one source? I believe that this can not be a coincidence and the main purpose here is to kill two birds with one stone, thus, to achieve two purposes – to defend Armenia and insure it from international sanctions claiming that Azerbaijan is not interested in cooperation.
Surely, Mr. Warlick and other defenders of Armenia understand that Azerbaijan will cooperate neither with the aggressor state nor with the separatist regime formed by it until the occupation is stopped. Thus, the enemy and its defenders will get a chance to express their opinions on the readiness of Armenia to constructive cooperation towards the elimination of the occupation. And they will try to demonstrate to the international community that Armenia is ready for cooperation and that Armenians are peaceful, however, Azerbaijan doesn’t cooperate and doesn’t want to establish peace in the region. So, on the one hand, the proposal of American co-chair James Warlick aims at undermining the international image of Azerbaijan and to convince the world community that as if Azerbaijan is a non-constructive state, on the other hand, this proposal messages to international organizations on the fact the aggressor Armenia is under umbrella of immunity and it’s not advisable to apply sanctions against it. Therefore, this proposal can’t be a coincidence. It is directed against Azerbaijan and supports the aggressive policy of Armenia.

Hedge Funds And The Economic Cycle
By: Jeffrey Erickson
It’s not enough simply to decide to use hedge funds and expect absolute returns. Investors must assess the economic cycle and find hedge products which are best-suited to those conditions. Jeffrey Erickson, of Mirabaud Group, looks at which strategies work best under different conditions.
Three years into the financial bear market, institutional investors are increasingly considering allocations to hedge funds. Generally speaking, hedge funds are supposed to be absolute return investments and should, at least in theory, produce positive returns regardless of where we are in the economic cycle.
The fact of the matter is, however, that many hedge funds have not been able to perform in the current bear market. The HFR Composite Weighted Index ended 2002 down 1.5 per cent, its first annual loss in 12 years. Returns in different styles ranged from +8.98 per cent in convertible arbitrage and +7.46 in global macro to - 4.75 per cent for long/short equity.
The question to ask is whether a strategic allocation to different hedge fund strategies in different stages of the economic cycle adds any value to a portfolio of hedge funds.
One of the first challenges encountered is the economic cycle itself. Where are we in the cycle right now?
As you might recall at the end of 2000, six months into the current bear market, most specialists were talking about a Vshaped recovery. At the end of 2001, consensus was for a U-shaped recovery. Today it looks more like an L-shape and no one can predict when that recovery may occur.
A second challenge is the correlation of a hedge fund style to the equity and fixed income markets and, more specifically, the stability of the correlation over time. Ideally the correlation should be as close to zero as possible and remain stable over time.
Unfortunately, if we look back over the last 10 years, we notice that this is not the case. Of different strategies, equity hedge has the most stable correlations to equity markets over time ranging from 0.4 to 0.8 over the period with an average correlation of around 0.6. Other strategies show little stability. Event driven and relative value strategies show correlations swinging from a negative 0.1 to 0.8 over the same period.
In addition to correlation to the equity markets, it is important to consider other financial and macro-economic factors and look at how they influence different hedge fund styles. This brings a better understanding of which strategy works best in a specific macro economic environment. Different studies have been made in this area and some of the factors used in different models are:
- Slope of the yield curve – the difference between the YTM of the 30-year Treasury bond and the three-month T-bill rate as well as their current yield
- Volatility measurements, such as the intra-month standard deviation of the S&P 500, implied volatility of the index for equity options (S&P100), and the intra-month volatility of bond returns
By taking into account these different macro economic factors, we will have some additional tools to explain performance in different hedge fund styles that are not ‘equity dependent’ and where volatility impacts as well as potential arbitrage and the main credit risk factors.
From a relatively simplistic perspective, the following observations can be made:
- Long/short equity works best in the recovery phase of the cycle
- In the boom phase/top of the cycle, merger arbitrage should be favoured
- In the slowdown phase, distressed securities work best
- Market neutral and different arbitrage strategies should, at least in theory, work in any part of the cycle but are difficult to disassociate completely with interest rates.
So let us look at four different hedge fund strategies:
- long-short equity
- global macro
- convertible arbitrage
- fixed income arbitrage and see how they perform during different periods of the economic cycle taking into account not only the influence of the equity market but also including the macro-economic factors mentioned.
Equity Long/Short
This strategy is, in reality, a multitude of different strategies. It includes long-biased managers, market neutral managers, and short sellers.
Over the long term, the universe of long/short equity managers tends to be on average 20 to 25 per cent net long. Correlations, although more stable than for other strategies, tend to be higher versus different equity indices.
The strategy tends to perform best when the equity markets perform well. A moderately upward sloping yield curve, indicating a growing economy with low inflation – coupled with declining volatility and declining risk premiums on equities – are factors that should indicate performance above historical averages.
This is a general guideline for long/short equity managers with a long bias. Market neutral and short sellers would not perform in the same way indicating that a general hedge fund classification has to be disaggregated and made as ‘strategy pure’ as possible before any analytical work is done.
Global Macro
The global macro managers have some similarities to the equity long/short strategy although, in general, they have a higher exposure to the bond market and use systematic trading of forwards, futures, and options in currencies and commodities.
This strategy performs well when short-term rates are at a low level and are not increasing.
The strategy is less sensitive to the direction of equity markets as interest rates tend to be negatively correlated.
This strategy generally performs less well, however, when the intra-month volatility of the S&P500 and the implied volatility index are high or are increasing.
Convertible Arbitrage
Managers in this strategy are long the convertible bond and short the underlying equity security. It’s a strategy that likes moderate volatility but not low interest rates.
A negative for convertible arbitrage strategies is raising short-term interest rates as well as high and rising long-term bond rates.
Fixed Income Arbitrage
A steep positive yield curve with high long term rates is the ideal market for fixed income arbitrageurs giving them the possibility to be long the long end of the curve and short the short end of the market.
Further, the strategy performs well when credit risk premiums are high or when they are decreasing.
The strategy does not like moderate short-term rates that are decreasing or high yields on large cap stocks.
Graph 1 shows the performance of the five different strategies from 1988 to 2002 including two years of a momentum driven bull market followed by the three years of an equity bear market.
Given this information, is it possible to execute successfully a strategic style allocation over time? Many hedge fund of funds use a two-tier system where 40 to 50 per cent of assets are allocated to a portfolio of core managers that are supposed to perform under all circumstances and then make strategic investments according to the prevailing market conditions. Others try to build their portfolios as a ‘pool of talent’ by investing with outstanding managers and not trying to follow any specific guidelines as to allocation between styles.
There are, however, a few factors that will make it very difficult to execute the strategic style allocation.
One is liquidity. Some funds have quarterly or yearly liquidity in their funds and other funds can have long lock-up periods or early redemption fees making it impossible to quickly react and change a manager in a fund of funds format.
Furthermore, when you have fund of funds with a long track record, you will eventually end up with a large portion of your best managers being closed to new money. These managers are typically the most successful and it would be unthinkable to redeem your best performing managers because of a short-term strategic allocation decision.
Market timing and assessment is critical as failure to identify significant turning points in the cycle would render dynamic allocation irrelevant or even counter-productive.
The last reason, that has already been mentioned, is that the different sub-strategies are not style pure. Managers within the same strategy invest differently and their performance will not always be correlated to their peers. As a matter of fact, from a diversification standpoint, finding uncorrelated managers, working differently within the same style, is beneficial in limiting the volatility of the overall portfolio.
It is important to understand different macro-economic factors determining the performance of individual hedge funds, but building fund of funds portfolios can be rather simple. By investing in strategies that you understand well, taking a longterm view, and investing with managers who have shown the capability of making money no matter what the market conditions, this kind of portfolio can be built.
Even more important, however, is the investment in people. Long-term performance is a direct result of talent, methodology, and discipline. By striving to fully understand fund manager discipline and adding value by combining various skills and ‘edge’ together, consistent absolute performance over time can be achieved.

To our great joy, we can inform you that the tremendous spirit of goodwill experienced in Abugida has now touched the Birhan school.
The older teachers retired at the beginning of this academic year and have given way to the new, highly motivated young generation of teachers who are excited, active and "raring to go", singing, dancing and playing with the children.
The generation gap has been closed, replacing old-school teaching through bullying and punishment ( not only the children but also the younger staff, a situation we witnessed during our visits, creating an oppressive atmosphere) and has been replaced by the same spirit of happiness felt in Abugida. The older staff now work in the evenings on our adult reading and writing initiatives.
Both parts are benefitting from this change and the older generation of staff are much more content being in charge of the adult education.
We had a wonderful reception, singing, dancing from children and staff. The teachers were beautifully turned out in traditional dress and looked a treat.
This year the children wear the same uniform as the pupils in Albugida.
After the ceremony we had a meeting with the headmistress.
This lady had replaced the former headteacher and at that moment we still did not know why.
We spoke on an individual basis with all of the teachers who informed us that it was a clear case of nepotism. The new headteacher is a member of the Edir's family. They told us that she is a lovely lady but unqualified for the job and lacking the experience recquired.
We decided to call all of the teachers to vote for who they considered to be the best qualified for the position but that it would be a secret ballot.
They were all keen to vote but became frightened of how the Edir would react when the result vote supported Genet, a membr of the teaching staff.
We told them not to worry and that we would deal with everything. We would have a meeting with the Edir.
We organised the meeting with the Edir and at first there was a lot of tension in the air but through clear, honest talking we managed to bring the Edir around to our way of thinking. At the end of the day , our aims are the same and both sides are genuinely concerned about the welfare of the boys and girls who attend the centre and of course the future of the Birhan school.
The Edir is struggling to obtain official accreditation for the school. Bureaucrocy is slow and complicated in this country.
Despite all of these difficulties the school is flourishing and looking beautifully decorated thanks to the teachers and pupils.
Most importantly, the children are very happy.
Personal files are being drawn up about every individual child including their family background and health.
The same as in Abugida,the teachers in Birhan will be attending a 3 month computer course.
The reading and writing course in Birhan is a great success.
We are financing one of these groups and the Kebele is using our instalations for two other reading and writing groups.
Barry has completed a construction project for when the school finally receives accreditation. The estimate for this buliding works out to 30,000 euros.
Unfortunately, our attempts to have a meeting with the parents of our schoolchildren was frustrated by the intervention of some mafia-type characters who are trying to upset all of our plans and the future of the families and children in our care.
We hope that the authorities will help us with this matter and that the culprits will be dealt with.

Several. is studying with Japanese for Busy People Book 2 (currently Unit 3). Also, I give handouts to increase vocab and simple sentences with use of the vocab for practical language learning for travelling or staying in Japan with use of other relevant books. With use of Japanese magazines, e.g. Nichigo Press, we read and understood some ads or articles. That included a Japanese movie magazine, “Shinema-junpoo” (Aug. ’15), its 2 page ad of a film, “Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation”. The phrases shown there were very interesting.
The students of the above class are now able to write and express some story or event for essay writing. For homework, they did very well for such tasks. One student wrote a beautiful story (fiction) about adapting a puppy at a home and hectic thing having occurred at night. Other student wrote/word-processed and also used an article about Sydney/Australia in relation to tourism and historical heritage of Sydney. Each of such essay or dialogue writings were read out in class and be understood by everyone in class. That practice was very useful and fun. I like to continue that activity whenever possible in future too. One of the very desirable teaching methods.
As for my students for weekly tutorials, one of them, who is a company executive, is studying with Unit 3, Japanese for Everyone now. He is happy with the textbook. As mentioned in my Blog before, he is taking a 2 weeks’ Japanese course in Tokyo in a month’s time, so he is excited about that plan too.
Another tutorial student (who is knowledgeable about goo/great Japanese restaurants in Sydney) is currently studying with Unit 6, Genki Book 1, very vigorously.
In the coming week, I plan to teach Japanese, traditional “bon-dance” with its cd (many well-known and beautiful songs for bon-dance are in it). In Japan, it’s bon-dance and its festivals season. Bon festivals in the summer are a big and positive part of Japanese community, public enjoyment of sharing, cultural and communal identity, peace etc throughout the land. (Recently I used the cd and taught the dance forms that I know to a few children somewhere else. They “loved” that. It was so positive-ness, relaxing, peacefulness and enjoyment creating to one another.)
As for the culture/society and news reported from Japan in the recent month/weeks, some of the things I spoke about (NHK TV News, 13.7.15, on SBS TV) are:
Seven-Eleven, Japan began using fast cash register system for customers, who are from overseas, to buy products without paying the tax, “menzei”. The new speedy system at its register for transaction, the shop assistant just presses the key of “menzei” and face the bar code of the product to the little screen of the register. Then, “menzei” management is fixed for the customer’s purchase. It is so speedy and many foreign tourists are impressed with the convenience and efficiency.
By next February, the company intends to have that system at its 3000 stores in Japan. Likewise, other internationally operated Lawson, Inc. has the services for customers that if the customer, who does not speak Japanese, faces an i-phone to the screen given in the store, immediately the screen will have the translation from Japanese to other, required language and up to 11 languages will be covered for such translation. – Fantastic!

Part 2: Speaking tips for OET Nursing Students
In Part 1 we went through the importance of context when introducing yourself to the role player/patient giving some examples. In Part 2 we will cover two more tips that will help you to achieve the best results you can in the speaking section.
1. Refer to the role play notes as often as you like! The actor opposite you is not your assessor.
Your role play will be recorded, it will not be videotaped – therefore you are only being assessed on what you say and not your body language. You do NOT have to memorise and act out the role play. Instead, refer to the notes as much as you like to make sure you are covering everything.
2. Mentally tick off each dot point as you go – if it’s easier for you, try to follow the dot points in sequential order
In the role player card you are given they will outline the context and what you are required to discuss/explain in dot points. Try to follow these in order to make sure you cover everything and since you are only being assessed on what you say, make sure you speak clearly and empathetically.
3. Acknowledge the feelings of the role player/patient when required to show you are empathetic and caring in your work as a nurse
a. If the patient in the role play is agitated/angry for example:
“Mrs Barnes I understand that you are frustrated with what has happened but I can assure you that myself and Dr X are doing the best we can to ensure that your care is optimal” etc
b. If a patient is scared for example:
“Johnny I know you’re afraid of needles as are a lot of other people and I understand that completely. However, you have nothing to be worried about as the pain is very minimal and with practice you will feel a lot more comfortable with using your insulin injections
Good luck! I hope this two part series has helped you feel more confident in your abilities to conquer the speaking section of the OET exam.

Part 1: Speaking tips for OET Nursing Students
Having tutored many nursing students in the speaking test I have noticed a number of common areas in which improvement can be easily made. In this blog (Part 1) I will explain the importance of context in shaping how you begin your role play, giving examples of appropriate introductions.
1. Introduce yourself according to the context of the role play.
*Do not use the same introduction blindly each time (eg “Hi my name is Sarah, I am the nurse) as it may be inappropriate for the context.*
a. Sometimes you may be a nurse in the emergency department and you can simply introduce yourself by name, position and by asking what has brought the patient in today:
“Hi my name is Sarah I am the nurse here today. May I know your name? What has brought you in today? etc
b. Other times your role play may require you to make a house visit – in which case it is inappropriate to introduce yourself in the same manner as you would if a patient had come to the hospital. In this second scenario it would be more appropriate to introduce yourself by name and position (eg community nurse) and explain to the patient why you have come by to visit them:
“Hi Robert, my name is Sarah and I am the community nurse. I have been sent here by your GP to show you how to administer your insulin injections. How are you today?” etc.
c. In another scenario you might be relaying a message from the doctor in a hospital to a patient who is agitated at having to wait. In this case you will already know the name of the patient, and should communicate empathetically by acknowledging their frustration/anger and try to defuse the situation:
“Hi Mr Smith? My name is Sarah and I am one of the nurses here at the hospital. I have been sent here by Dr X to let you know that she is still attending to an emergency call and will be another ten minutes. I understand you must be frustrated but she is doing all she can to attend to you as quickly as possible.” etc
Good Luck!

Reading Part B – Simple Tips to Improve your Approach to Answering Questions
Reading Part B can seem particularly daunting after the quick pace of Part A. Many students do well in Part A because they can quickly match the relevant word(s) to fill in each gap. However, many of these same students struggle to complete Part B as it requires a much deeper level of reading comprehension.
Here I will provide two tips to improve your ability to pick the correct answers in Part B, and hone your approach to answering each question.
- Read the questions before the text. Most of the multiple choice questions in Part B refer to one particular paragraph in which the answer is located. For this reason it is better to get straight to reading the questions and then reading the relevant paragraph only. This way you are not wasting time by reading the entire piece provided, then having to go back and re-read each paragraph as dictated by each question
- Once you have read the relevant paragraph look at the multiple choice answers to pick the correct answer. Many students make the mistake of reading the question and then reading the multiple choice answers immediately BEFORE reading the relevant paragraph. This is problematic sometimes because you may end up putting your own bias into the interpretation of the paragraph because your own prior knowledge or opinion on the topic has led you to have a pre-formed notion about which answer that you have read is most correct.
Hope this was helpful! Good luck!

Don’t forget to register for our free event this Saturday, July 30th.Recently, technical and operational specifications of the Scorpene class submarine that India is buying from DCNS — a naval shipbuilder two-thirds owned by the French government — were leaked to The Australian newspaper. The incident follows the Modi administration’s launch of an AU$150 billion (US$113 billion) program to modernise the armed forces. It is a timely reminder of a basic flaw in India’s weapons acquisition and digitisation: a lack of expertise in cyber security and data encryption.
DCNS recently won the AU$50 billion (US$37 billion) contract to build the next generation of twelve submarines for Australia. Though the United States remained publicly neutral during the bidding process, privately it advised Australia against France because, as was widely reported, France was not careful enough with its military secrets.
The initial reaction of the Indian Defence Minister, Manohar Parrikar, was that the leak was ‘not a big worry’. He added that India was not the source of the leak, implying there was nothing to worry about. The following day Parrikar blamed The Australian for causing embarrassment by breaking the story.
Articles and commentaries eventually forced the defence establishment to admit that the leak was a serious matter and that the effectiveness of Scorpene class submarines has been severely compromised. The enormity of the damage done by this leak is dawning on New Delhi: on 4 September, Parrikar cancelled the proposed purchase of a further three submarines.
However, this is not the first such cybersecurity breach in India. In March 2010, Minister of State for Communications and IT, Sachin Pilot, told reporters that government networks had been attacked by China but that ‘not one attempt has been successful’. For nearly a year prior to Pilot’s assertion, a US–Canada team of cyber spy-hunters had been tracking the activities of a southern China-based cyber espionage gang that comprar viagra was mainly targeting India.
The gang, most likely from China’s prestigious University of Electronic Science and Technology, had in fact accessed the Ministry of Defence’s vast array of computers and stole the design and other technical details of several Indian missile systems. They accessed documents relating to the security outlook of Nagaland, Assam, Tripura, Manipur, and other Indian states. The gang also targeted organisations including the Ministry of External Affairs, India’s United States embassy, and even companies like Tata Group, DLF, and YKK India. New Delhi only learnt of this theft when the US–Canada cyber spy-hunters informed it.
The US–Canada team published their findings in a report in 2010. The report reinforced that weak security in one group can result in the theft of data from another organisation. This is why experts find it so hard to pinpoint the original source of cyber spying and why countries active in cyber espionage are able to refute such accusations.
Cyber security is not achieved merely by installing firewall and anti-virus software. It is a work in progress, and so the security architecture of an organisation’s computers must be monitored constantly. Yet it seems that no serious effort has been made by India to remedy the situation since the report was published.
Last year, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) published a report on the cyber maturity of the Asia Pacific region. In the ASPI report, India scores 4 out of 10 on each of four critical aspects of cyber security, well below the scores of China, Japan and Singapore. These include the organisational structure of cyber matters, the accessibility of cyber security assistance, the existence of a cybercrime centre and financial cybercrime laws and, finally, the extent of the military’s role in cyber security.
India’s overall weighted cyber maturity ranking was 50 — well below countries like Australia (79.9), New Zealand (72.8), Japan (85.1), China (64) and even Brunei (51).
The monitoring of social media is another weak spot in India’s cyber security architecture. For example, in the case of Mehdi Masroor Biswas, an Islamic State sympathiser and Bangalore’s most prolific jihadi tweeter, India only knew of his existence after British journalists tracked him down and informed Indian authorities that he had been arrested.
India suffers from a skills shortage in cyber security. According to a secret paper prepared by the National Security Council Secretariat in 2013, India employed only 556 cybersecurity experts in all organisations in the government domain. By comparison, China employed 125,000 and the United States 91,080.
Cyber security is not merely a technical or software problem. Besides knowledge of information technology, it requires appreciation of a range of disciplines including engineering and sociology. When dealing with state-sponsored cyber hackers, experts need an understanding of a range of factors including that country’s psychology, motives, political decision-making processes and the depth of its expertise and resources.
India has close defence and economic ties with both Israel and the United States. They are leaders in cybersecurity. The Indian government should actively encourage cyber security firms from these countries to bid for business in India, pass on their expertise to indigenous firms, and help set up start-up firms in this rapidly growing field.
India aspires to be a global power, a superpower in computer software and hardware developments, a hub for advanced manufacturing systems and an E-commerce specialist. To realise all these aspirations, India must first tackle its skills gap and adopt a more long-term strategy.

And, now in this ‘online world’, there are a large number of work opportunities available for the writers who like to work from their home.
Today, there are millions of websites and blogs on the internet and all of them need quality content to stay ahead in this competitive age. So, if you have good writing skills, then you can really make money very easily.
Article Writing –
There are a lot of people who are writing articles to make money on the internet. It has become an easy way to earn quick cash. These people write articles for different kinds of websites that provide them the required information – subject of the article, keyword (with density) etc-etc.
Article Material – The work of writing articles requires you to write about different subjects. Now, it is obvious that no one has the knowledge about each & everything that is part of this world. When you have to write about a subject that you know nothing about, you can take help from the internet and get a vast material.
Niche – As I told you that there a vast number of subjects on which articles are written, so you can choose that interests you. If you think that you would be able to write articles on few subjects much better than the rest, then you can choose those subjects as you ‘niche’. Of course, you can take help from the internet to write about the unfamiliar subjects, but you will get the hang of these subjects much faster as you already know so much about them and they also interests you. And, getting expertise on the unfamiliar topics can take a long time. And, the sooner you become an expert, the faster you will be able to make money online.
Money – Initially, you can ask for a rate of $2 – $3 for one article of 500 words. With time, when you gain more knowledge and experience, you can ask for more money.
Article writing is a great idea to make money on the internet. You can also write article and earn good money if you a passion for writing.

I always had a flair for writing, actually since a very long time. I decided to make a research about the work opportunities available on the internet and I was surprised to find that there were many kinds of work opportunities available for the writers like content writing, copywriting etc-etc. Now, I write regularly and earn a handsome amount of money through writing on the internet. If you know how to write well, then you can also earn great money like me on the internet

I was in need of a lunch catch up with a friend and as we were walking we chanced upon this cafe at the end of Elizabeth Street Arcade. The cafe was stylishly decorated and sophisticated with fur floor throws and leather upholstery. The space was airy and light, thanks to the large glass windows from floor to ceiling on two sides of the place.In my mind, the perfect little coffee house!
Atmosphere: 5/5
We went straight to the counter and ordered. The menu was extensive, although thankfully not overwhelming, and had numerous delicious sounding gluten-free and vegetarian items available. The highlight for me was being able to order the crumbed calamari with salad and chips - all gluten-free! I have never been able to order this gluten-free at a cafe before. What's more, when it came out, it looked and tasted delicious. The calamari was light and crunchy and the chips had this addictive chicken salt seasoning on them. The latte I ordered was lovely too but not exceptional as far as coffee goes.
Food:19/20
The staff were welcoming and friendly. Nothing was a problem, plus the service was prompt.
Staff: 10/10
Amazingly priced meals - the calamari was only $14 and as it was a generous serving, plus came with chips and salad, I was full!
Value:10/10
Cleanliness: 5/5
TOTAL SCORE: 49/50 or 98%

For today's post, we thought we'd take a closer look at the characteristics and content of shipments across a range of industries and business types. With major forces like e-commerce, globalization, or lean / just-in-time inventory driving change, it seems intuitive that we'd be shipping more often and to more places. What do the numbers show?
Shipping to More and More Varied Destinations
Whether you ship to businesses or consumers, your ship-to destinations both inside and outside the U.S. have changed quite a bit in the last two decades. Over the last 20 years the U.S. population has grown 25% to 312 million people and households are up 27% to 119 million. During the same period, businesses are up 19% to 7.4 million while government units increased 53% to 89,000. Overall GDP has increased 68% in real / inflation-adjusted terms over the last 20 years and foreign trade has doubled.
Average Shipment Ranges from 20 to 1,345 Miles
Average miles per shipment varies widely depending on the manufacturing (700 miles in an average shipment) or distribution (386 miles in an average shipment) orientation of business but there is also significant variation by type of product. Apparel manufacturing tops the list with an average of 1,345 miles per shipment. Computer and electronic product manufacturing comes in at second place with an average of 1,175 miles per shipment. Flip the rankings upside down and you see that commodities such as fuel (20 miles), beer and wine (44 miles), mining (46 miles), lumber (99 miles), and grocery (122 miles) dominate the short distance shipments.
Balance of Wholesale Trade and Manufacturing
Interestingly enough wholesale trade (NAICS 42) and manufacturing (NAICS 31-33) categories are fairly balanced with roughly $5.7 Trillion in shipment value for each. At the top of the value list for the 4-digit SAIC level includes petroleum products, chemical manufacturing, transportation, and food manufacturing. Flip the ranking upside down for lower-value of goods and you find leather, apparel, textile, and fuel right below newspapers and furniture.
Smaller Shipments, Higher Value, More Frequency
Start comparing value, miles, and product types and patterns we've been debating over the last few decades hold up in the numbers. Shipments 500 lbs or less grew 56% since 1993 and increased in value. Large shipments of 50,000 lbs or more continued to represent the largest ton-miles across the transportation network, but smaller, higher-value, faster shipments continued to grow the fastest. As businesses pursue lean inventory and production strategies that reduce carrying costs and consumers demand high-speed e-commerce fulfillment, we can expect these trends to continue in the near future.
Shippers Need Choice More Than Ever
With businesses and consumers alike continuing to press for smaller shipments, delivered faster, but only just-in-time, business shippers need carrier and service choice more than ever. Strategic carrier relationships are certainly key to maintain service levels and ensure available capacity, but establishing new carrier relationships, trying out new services, and comparing alternatives will be key to maintaining profit margins as overall shipping cost per weight increases. Now might not be the time to try out drone-delivery of shipments, but in the face of long-term shipping trends it could be a good year to try out some new carrier and service options to improve your bottom line.

Cohen of Cohen, Salk and Huvard, P.C., as a special guest blogger. Please read on for the third installment of Bennett’s seven-part blog series on Purchase Money Security Interest in Equipment and Inventory.
Frequently Asked Question # 4: Does a Holder of a PMSI in Inventory Prime an Earlier Perfected Security Interest in Accounts?
First, it is important to recognize a basic Code priority rule involving accounts and inventory. As noted in the examples below, a security interest in accounts can be perfected not only by a blanket filing on accounts, but also by a blanket filing on inventory alone (since the secured party, in such case, would also automatically pick up accounts as “proceeds” of the inventory). Thus, the first secured party to file against all accounts or all inventory will have priority in the accounts.
Under former Article 9, a secured party who qualified for a purchase-money security interest in inventory obtained a priority in the inventory financed and in identifiable cash proceeds received on or before the delivery of the inventory to the buyer. Section 9-324(b) of the Code expands such rights by giving a qualifying secured party a priority in the inventory financed, in identifiable cash proceeds received on or before the delivery of the inventory to the buyer, and in certain cases, in the proceeds of the inventory constituting chattel paper, instruments, and proceeds of chattel paper.
Like former Article 9, the purchase-money priority in inventory under the Code clearly does not carry over into proceeds consisting of accounts. This means that a prior secured party holding a prior perfected security interest in a debtor’s present and future accounts cannot be primed as to accounts constituting proceeds of inventory financed by a qualifying purchase-money lender.
Be sure to check back next week when Bennett L. Cohen discusses the application of priority rules in three detailed examples from the Uniform Commercial Code official comments!

June has been a very busy month for our brothers and sisters in Christ in Haiti. It has also been a time of tremendous blessings from God and filled with promise for new sources of Gospel outreach to the people of Marin and all of Haiti. Please read these brief articles concerning some of the exciting things that the Lord is doing through Reformation Hope, Souls Winning Ministries, and all of you!
Academie Theologique de la Reforme Begins First Class!
On Monday, June 16, 2014 20 eager Bible college students began their first class at our new Reformed Theological Academy in Marin, Haiti. The first class was taught by Jim Carmichael, a long-time friend of the Reformation Hope ministry and an experienced theology instructor who spent many years teaching part time at a Bible college in the Ukraine. Jim laid the foundation of biblical theology and covenants for these promising students. Over the course of the remainder of the year, these students will study further courses in the inspiration and authority of Scripture, church leadership, sacraments, Reformed theology, God and man, and also Christ and salvation. These students will receive a Bachelor of Divinity degree upon successful completion of the more than 100 credit hour curriculum. Opportunities to help sponsor these students will be made available to our ministry partners in the weeks ahead.
Medical Clinic Official Opening Set for June 29th
As part of the annual earthquake rebuilding celebration this year on June 29th, Souls Winning Ministries and Reformation Hope will formally cut the ribbon on the new medical clinic (Clinique Medicale de la Reforme) largely funded by the Invisible Hand Foundation and furnished with support from John Crow. We also want to express our gratitude to Dr. Wiley Smith and to Dr. Richard Kennedy for their tireless service as our medical consultants on this project. Thanks to our partners, the Marin–La Plaine community will now have affordable, high-quality medical care.
Work Begins on New Orphanage — Help Us Turn Blocks into a Home
The new compound in Marin is a beehive of activity this month as the young men in our block-making, start-up business are producing concrete blocks as fast as the machine and the process of curing will allow. They are making some 20,000 blocks for the construction of our new orphanage. But in order to turn a huge pile of construction blocks into a wonderful home for our children we need your help. For as little as $50, you can fund the placement of one of these blocks into the walls of our new facility. And in doing so you will be investing in a better future for once hopeless children in our community. Every ministry partner making a construction gift of $50 or more will have their name included in a series of plaques mounted in the hallways of the orphanage to remind the children of those who care for them in the love of Jesus Christ.
Fourth Annual Earthquake Rebuilding Celebration Coming Soon!
Our Haitian brothers and sisters are eagerly preparing for the huge annual celebration and service of thanksgiving to God this year on June 29th. This year promises to be an even bigger event for not only the people involved with Souls Winning Ministries, but also the entire community, as the celebration will include the opening of our new medical clinic and the Bible college. Our July issue of the Ref Hope E-report will include news and photographs from this important community life event.

Nilsson doesn’t deny that he was on property that was off-limits to the public, or that he applied paint to a structure at the abandoned lime plant near Interstate 84. He contends he didn’t know he was trespassing, but he acknowledges that he was familiar with the site and with the considerable amount of graffiti there.
At best he showed poor judgment in entering the property, with paint, without obtaining permission.
Nilsson told the Herald that he would like to see the property used in a positive way, and we don’t question his sincerity. He volunteers to serve on the Baker City Public Arts Commission.
But simply walking onto the property, which led to Nilsson’s being cited for criminal trespassing, is not the right or the responsible way to advance his agenda.
Nilsson has attended both City Council meetings since he was cited. Councilors didn’t discuss his situation at either meeting, and Nilsson has not indicated he intends to resign.
Nilsson is scheduled to be in court later this month. If he is convicted of either criminal trespassing or criminal mischief, he should step down from the position to which he was appointed — he was not elected by voters — in February.

Many Thoughts
Many abnormalities going on in my life presently. I'm unsure where this post is heading. I doubt it will be one of my funnier ones. One never knows though, does one? Keeping our heads above water to see where the folly of life takes us, is about all the commoners can hope for I reckon!!! (DAMN DON'T YA GET TIRED OF IT SOMETIMES???) My one and only, my first computer of my own, died on me Monday of this week! I'm coming to you from another computer, that seems foreign! Like I'm going behind my first's back. The touch is unusual, everything is off. Monitor too large, too bright, too new! I have thought A LOT about why it choose to go down when it did. Defies any logic my brain can reason out. You see, protection was being installed, to keep it safe. That's where I cannot wrap my feeble brain into this equation??? Is not safeuards NORMAL? I'm asking, because I have been in this computer world for only two years! I thought it to be like insurance against craziness on whomever's part! You know like uninsured motorist or a lightning bolt. The installation of the safeguard gave it a heart attack! Yep!!! That's when it went... ca-put... died on ol' Glen! It be the same protection as the previous two years. It plum fried my Compy's brain! My Compy's in the Computer Hospital undergoing a brain transplant. It makes no sense to a common man how such a thing could happen at that moment. Compy had been hitting on all cylinders. I feel like a twelve year old with a new bicycle that chained his bicycle to one of them old fashion bicycle racks. Anticipating total safety while going into the movie theatre to see Pink Panther, upon coming out of the theatre my new bicycle is gone it's gone along with the whole fricking bicycle rack. I sure never saw that coming! Them Virus things you hear about, being careful not to open up anything you don't trust. DAMN!!! I dare say, my opening up of anything is about as simple as one can get in this techno, gizmo, marvel world we live in! I be as simple as the old checkers game in the world of computering! Yes I am! Reminds me of a healthy 'as a horse' athlete receiving an injection of 'protect you' vaccine then dying from the vaccine!

But even still, we spent the evening with Ryan's parents and that was fun. We've never done that before. Our ward did their trunk or treat Saturday, and Rick and Kim's did their on Halloween. They invited us up and since we didn't have any other plans, we went. I picked Emma and Elizabeth up from school, where we quickly did as much of their costuming as possible: Emma's makeup, braiding Emma's hair, and Elizabeth's makeup. We discovered that just using a hairnet under the pink wig wasn't enough to take care of the bulge that is Emma's thick hair. So I did a couple of french braids with the ends bobby pinned out of the way, and that worked a lot better. Then we made sure we had candy, the rest of the costumes, and headed out to pick up Annie and Maddie from school. Once we captured them, we drove down to Ryan's school and picked him up before hitting the road to Royal City.
Once we arrived at Rick and Kim's, it was time to put on the twins costumes, help Emma into her wig and freshen her makeup, paint Annie's nose black and we were ready to go. our resumes. Random trivia, google it. What time is it in Tazmania? Got it! Meet someone new, look ‘em up!

July 26, 2012 - WASHINGTON—Commuters will notice scientific equipment and researchers with electronic monitoring devices throughout the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) subway system and nearby urban areas of Boston and Cambridge from July 29 through August 5, while the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) continues a scientific study of airflow throughout the underground subway system and surrounding urban areas.
Led by the DHS Science and Technology Directorate (S&T), this continuing study will gather data on the behavior of airborne contaminants if they were to be released into the subway system. This study is part of the Department’s ongoing commitment to preparedness and the shared responsibility to protect our nation’s critical infrastructure.
“Previous phases of this study focused on the behavior of airborne contaminants within the subway system. This follow-on study will help us better understand how airborne contaminants released into the subway impact surrounding urban areas.” said S&T program manager Teresa Lustig. “With a clear understanding of how contaminants from the subway may spread to above-ground city centers we can use that information to enhance emergency planning and coordination across multiple jurisdictions in the response to emergency events.”
“Our customers and employees should know that the MBTA is working closely with our federal partners in order to make the transit system as safe as possible,” MBTA Transit Police Chief Paul MacMillan added.
The study. While the deliberate release of chemical or biological agents is of primary concern, the study will also help researchers understand airflow characteristics for smoke or unintentional spills of chemicals or fuels—providing information for MBTA to develop evacuation, ventilation, and other incident response strategies. The information will also aid in the design of next generation chemical and biological agent detection systems.
Although the equipment will be visible, the study will not disrupt normal activities or present any inconvenience to the public. Commuters may notice a variety of electronic equipment positioned in subway stations, aboveground in Boston and Cambridge, or being carried by researchers.
The study will be conducted by researchers from Argonne National Laboratory, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, FLIR Systems Inc., and an international team from Defence Science and Technology Laboratory of the United Kingdom. The tests will use sulfur hexafluoride and perfluorocarbon gas tracers, both innocuous, non-toxic, inert gases that have been used in dispersion experiments since the 1960s. Sulfur hexafluoride is a harmless, common tracer gas used for indoor and outdoor air testing. Perfluorocarbons are used in eye surgery and other medical applications. Inert particle tracers, tagged with rare earth elements and a common optical brightener, will also be used. The optical brightener is used in many laundry detergents and in paper manufacturing. These tests will not use any biological materials, only inert particle tracers.

A general, or “plain language” summary is a valuable way to support wider public engagement with research and its successful dissemination.
The plain language summary for the PTBi-CA Community Advisory Board (CAB) is intended to explain why the research is being proposed, what the researchers aim to achieve, and how the study may impact prematurity risk and birth outcome disparities in the PTBi-CA communities and geographies of focus.
What to include in your plain language summary
- Project Background & History of the Work: Introduce the research, and provide context for the proposal. Why is this work important?
- Project Summary: Describe the proposed project. This section should provide answers to the essential questions Who, What, Where, When, Why, and How?
- Community Engagement & Dissemination Plan:.
Tips for success
A successful summary tells a clear story and provides a strong message about why the work is important. Consider what it would be like to develop a 2-minute "elevator pitch" about your proposed project. Identify the key points, define terms, and avoid complex language, scientific jargon, or technical acronyms. Please define any scientific or technical terms that may be unfamiliar to the general public.
A compelling summary is memorable, and tailor-made to appeal to and make the summary relatable to your audience.
After reading the summary, reviewers should be able to articulate what the project is, why it is important, and how you are pursing the topic, as well as understand the study well enough to provide constructive feedback or recommendations about its design and implementation. It might be helpful to share your summary with colleagues in a different research field, and with at least one non-specialist prior to submission.
Examples
See below for examples of high-scoring plain language summaries from recently funded proposals:
- Identifying biological drivers of preterm birth among women with insomnia
- Drug use and pregnancy policy study (D-APPS)
Please note:the maximum allowable length of the plain language summaries is subject to change with each call for applications. While the examples above may be longer, the Fall 2017 RFA will be requesting a one-page summary.

Soon the universe will be rocked by war… A war between three angelic brothers… A war fought for the greatest prize in the universe… The war for the race of men.
Throughout eternity, Lucifer has been Heaven’s favored prince. Gifted, ardent, devoted. Until the fateful moment when he is informed about Yehovah’s new innovation. The creation of a new race that is not angelic in nature.
A race created of a three-hundred-billion-base DNA sequence that will constitute the human genome code — The Race of Men.
Lucifer’s horror intensifies with the appalling discovery that Yehovah is duplicating cialis 24 hr His own gene in matter. In the new race.
Lucifer’s envy of the Race of Men becomes obsessive: The Chronicles follow his swift and unrelenting decline and subsequent rebellion. He is banished from the First Heaven with a third of his renegade angelic host.
Incensed and determined to wreak revenge against the Race of Men, he meticulously strategizes their demise. He secures Eve’s allegiance by deceit. The Race of Men are eternally bound to the consequences of Eve’s defection. She has switched masters and now the title deeds to the Earth and solar systems once bequeathed to the Race of Men by Yehovah now legally pass over to Lucifer’s jurisdiction.
He launches a second invidious scheme to mutate the DNA of the race of men by his fallen host co-habiting with the daughters of men. The Nephilim. He is successful… but unknown to him, one bloodline of the Race of Men remains untainted. He has failed. The fallen who did his bidding are banished to Tartarus, the molten core.
The lineage of the Race of Men is saved.
Enraged, Lucifer as King of Perdition, lodges a claim against the Race of Men in the courts of heaven and demands judgement.
His goal – to annihilate the entire race in the lake of fire.
Judgement is passed on the Race of Men by Yehovah. Lucifer cannot be judged to damnation for his rebellion and the Race of Men go free. Eternal law demands they suffer the same fate.
According to Eternal Law, one born of the Race of Men with undefiled blood – free from the inherent mutation of The Fall of Man – is legally entitled to exchange his soul for the souls of the Race of Men.
Lucifer gloats. Triumphant in the knowledge that each and every man’s DNA is mutated by The Fall of Man.
There is only one who can stop Lucifer’s malevolent plans.
One that will be born from the First Heaven.
Lucifer’s Arch Adversary
The Nazarene.Ok, so it definitely wasn’t the first thought that came to my mind when I found out we were having a baby, but it might have been in the top 5. Yes, I’m talking about designing the nursery. For years, I’ve thought about this space and for the past couple months, I’ve been day dreaming about a particular feature that I’ve always envied in other houses… board & batten. It just makes a room feel so clean and soothing while also adding some nice architectural interest to boring drywall. So after collecting some inspiration and convincing my wingman that Dylan just won’t be the same without it, we successfully tackled our very first board & batten project and are absolutely 100% in love with the outcome:
No clue why, but I honestly thought this project would only take 2 days max to finish… haha boy was I wrong. Although we didn’t spend full weekends working on it, it took about 4 days to complete BUT I am soooooooo very pleased with how it looks. It’s clean, it’s soothing and it’s going to make the most perfect nursery for our sweet baby boy.
Here’s what we used and how we did it:
- Supplies:
- – 1 gallon semi-gloss ultra bright white paint, for bottom of wall (we used every last drop!)
- – 1 gallon satin paint for top of wall (we used “Silver Dusk” by Valspar)
- – Paint supplies: The works… (tape, rollers, brushes, etc.)
- – 12, 12′ x 1/2” boards for battens (aka the vertical strips)
- – 4, 12′ pieces of molding (we chose a style that would make a nice ledge)
- – Miter saw
- – Caulk gun
- – 2 tubes of construction adhesive
- – 1 tube of window/door caulk
- – Air compressor & brad nailer (You could totally use a plain ol’ hammer & nail too, but it’ll take longer!)
- – Level
- – Tape measure & pencil
Step 1: Measure & Outline Height
Start by determining how high you want the board & batten. In my Crushing on Board & Batten post, you can see how the height can really make a difference. We decided to take ours just below the light switch to meet in the middle.
Using a tape measure, mark your preferred height and then just connect the dots, drawing an even line around the room.
Step 2: Paint OR Install Panel
Although I think it’s totally optional, you could install a smooth white panel along the bottom half of the wall. Personally, I think you can get a very very similar effect by using a semi gloss bright white paint, so that’s the route we took. Below you can see that we painted to just above the desired height of the top molding.
Step 3: Paint Top Half of the Wall & Ceiling (if you haven’t already)
Don’t worry about the paint lines where the top & bottom meet, as the top molding covers this perfectly.
Step 4: Cut & Install Top Molding
Ok… before I explain this step, yes… I’m totally busted as our 1/2 finished bonus room in the background is still under crazy construction but hey, we’ve gotta baby to prepare for, so it’s on a temporary hold.
Using a miter saw, cut the molding the length of your wall, angling the ends as needed.
Generously apply the construction adhesive to the back of the molding…
And then using a level, assemble it to the wall evenly.
Using a brad nailer, nail the molding to the wall every 12 inches or so. It will leave a pretty significant hole, but it’s nothing a little caulk can’t easily fill.
Step 5: Cut & Install Battens
This is by far the most time consuming part of the project because every batten must be individually measured, cut and assembled. We ended up using all 12 boards and cut each 42” inches tall using the miter saw. Although it’s totally a personal preference most battens are placed between 12-16” apart. We placed our 16 inches apart, following the same process as above (1. Measure, 2. Cut, 3. Apply adhesive, 4. Assemble using level & brad nailer)
- Tip:
- – Paint the battens beforehand! You will definitely have to touch up the edges and nail holes once they are assembled but it’s so much easier to get a majority of the painting done first.
- – So that you can reuse your current baseboards, select a board for the batten that’s the same or very close to the width of your baseboards.
Step 6: Apply Caulk to Gaps
No matter how even your walls are, there will likely be gaps between the wall & the top molding, the bottom of the battens and definitely in the corners where the top molding meets.
Since the caulk is white, it also makes a great filler for those ugly nails holes!
Step 7: Paint Touch Ups
We tried to be super clean with our caulk lines but that’s umm… impossible, so just have fun, make a mess and then touch up the paint with another coat. After the caulk in the nail holes was dry, I painted the molding and each batten again. Once that was dry, I also taped off the molding and touched up the blue paint too, to ensure super crisp, clean lines.
TADA! We’re so happy with how it looks and can’t wait to bring our little guy home to this super soothing nursery. The furniture won’t be here for another couple weeks, but check back then to see the finished product, including what I’m doing with those super cute letters I recently got from Home Goods.

It looks really great!
I just stumbled upon your blog via Pinterest. Love how your nursery turned out! I would love to do the same in my sons room. Question for you- is your baseboard the same thickness top and bottom? Mine is thinner at the top making it hard to match wood for the batten pieces. Is tour chair rail the same thickness as the batten as well. Sorry for all the questions! After viewing lots of tutorials – yours was the easiest to follow! Thanks for inspiring!
Thanks Kelli! Sorry for not getting back to you sooner, I’m still adjusting to being a working mama and wanna-be blogger. Yes, my baseboard was the same thickness and it isn’t a perfect fit for the batten pieces but as long as your batten isn’t thicker than your baseboard, i think it works! Let me know how it goes, would love to see pictures of it!Peabody winners announced

June 16, 2015
Book: Super Fly: The World's Smallest Superhero!
Author: Todd H. Doodler
Pages: 128
Age Range: 7-10
Todd Doodler is the author of one of my daughter's favorite (once upon a time)
board books: Animal Soup. We also enjoyed his more recent board book The Bus Driver. He has written and illustrated numerous other titles for the youngest of readers. Super Fly: The World's Smallest Superhero! seems to be his first chapter book, and I was intrigued to read it.
Super Fly is a heavily illustrated early chapter book with plenty of white space and a breezy, over-the-top attitude, perfect for newer readers. Eugene Flystein is a somewhat geeky young fly who prefers reading and inventing to typical fly activities (like, oh, flying). When Eugene starts a new school in fourth grade, he finds himself the target of a bullying Crazy Cockroach. Fortunately, he also finds a best friend in Fred Flea. Well, a "pest friend", anyway.
When one of Eugene's inventions goes awry, giving Crazy Cockroach increased strength and intelligence, there's only one thing to do - Eugene has to test out the invention himself, becoming Super Fly. What follows is a comic book style adventure (albeit mainly in prose) in which Super Fly, after overcoming some hurdles, and helped by Fred Flea, saves the day.
Several things make Super Fly kid-friendly:
- A classic "underdog becoming a hero" storyline.
- Disgusting, insect-specific details, like the school being "a brown pile of yuck floating in a broken toilet in the center of town" and Super Fly being paralyzed by an excess of smell from flowers. Or the invention of the "Poop-A-Rama", which makes "everyday objects smell like, well,you know."(Page 2)
- Gentle spoofing of superhero stories. For example, when Fred Flea becomes Super Fly's sidekick, he starts talking like this: "Sweet chipmunk coffee-covered corn cobs, Super Fly!". Eugene's town is called Stinkopolis.
- Clear, amusing, comic book-like illustrations on nearly every page.
Super Fly also has hints of humor for parents reading with their kids, like the fact that the bully calls Eugene "McFly" (shades of Back to the Future). The marching band for the high school plays "We Are the Champ Bugs" by Queen Bee (Page 104). And so on.
Despite this humor, Super Fly wasn't quite my personal cup of tea. (The Poop-A-Rama got things off to a bad start for me.) But I think that seven year old kids will find it hilarious. Unlike in the Fly Guy stories by Tedd Arnold, in which Fly Guy basically lives in the human world, Doodler has created a whole sub-culture for insects, who live beneath the notice of humans. There are flea circuses and parades, houses and gym class.
I felt like Super Fly could have been written as a full graphic novel - the story has a similar feel, and I think that Doodler would have been up to creating more illustrations. The fact that it's a chapter book instead makes Super Fly an excellent bridge book for kids who have the reading skills for early chapter books, but may be lacking in interest. Give this to kids who have devoured the Squish or Lunch Lady books, and watch them eat up Super Fly, too. Super Fly would also make a nice, humorous summer reading title for older elementary school kids looking for something different.

A wedding blog’s purpose is to provide stylistic inspiration. Martha Stewart has set the precedence for creating such art through more staged, editorial styled shoots, much in the manner that the fashion and food industry presents their products through photoshoots. I don’t see anything wrong with this, they show off incredible talent.
However, some photogs and blogs use material from such shoots and call it “real” or make it look like it was part of a real wedding portfolio. I’m lucky that I’ve had enough work such that all the photos you see on myportfolio came from real weddings and engagements. However, when I first began, I too struggled with a tiny portfolio. I understand the desire to show everything that one is capable of, but not always having all the opportunities upfront… it’s life, we all have to start somewhere.
Every day I still hope to keep working hard, remain humble, and not take anything for granted. Weddings big and small, in the end, it’s all about the love, and that is universal.
I loved this contest that Michael Norwood Photography put together – “If you’re a photographer I want you to blog an entire wedding with no portraits, no details and no staged or directed shots. I don’t care if you’ve already blogged the wedding. Go through and pick out the best moments and show me what you’ve got“. For that, I have chosen to feature Nicole and Lino’s wedding that I photographed last year in Puerto Rico. These are true photojournalistic moments – moments that require a photographer anticipating and being in the right place at the right time, while keeping in mind all the technical challenges of photography itself, with split seconds to make such decisions. I’m also showing these photographs without captions, as I hope the images speak for themselves. A couple images here came from the ever-fabulous Emily Ku, a Las Vegas wedding photographer and my second shooter for that day. Hope you enjoy this recap!

Two actions target Fannie Mae
Four years after Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were put under federal conservatorship, actions tomorrow and next Monday are targeting the agencies for blocking principal reduction in mortgage refinances.
On Wednesday, September 5, Occupy Chicago will rally at 5 p.m. at Fannie Mae’s office at 1 S. Wacker, where families facing eviction will speak out, and then march to President Obama’s campaign headquarters, 130 E. Randolph, where protestors will be chained together with balls representing mortgage debt.
It’s part of three days of actions targeting “Obama’s failures as president” and “how both Obama and Romney fail to represent the interests of the 99 Percent,” according to a Facebook announcement.
On Monday, September 10, local community groups joined by Occupy Our Homes groups from Minneapolis and Detroit will march from Daley Plaza at noon and rally in front of Fannie Mae (1 S. Wacker) at 1 p.m. and Freddie Mac (333 W. Wacker) at 2.
That protest is part of a national day of action against Fannie and Freddie by community groups working to stop foreclosures in several cities, said Stuart Schussler of Centro Autonomo of Albany Park. Chicago Anti-Eviction Campaign is also participating.
Centro Autonomo protests at bank branches to support families in foreclosure who are seeking loan modifications. Principal reduction is a vital component of affordable loan mods, Schussler said.
“Sometimes we get a favorable response from the bank” that’s servicing the mortgage, but but if Fannie or Freddie holds the morgage – as they do in a large proportion of cases – “they’ll say it’s out of our hands,” he said.
Housing groups have been calling on Obama to replace Federal Home Financing Agency interim director Edward DeMarco, who has refused to allow Fannie or Freddie to do principal reduction – even after the Treasury Department belatedly embraced the idea.
“In the bigger picture we need some really profound changes in order to make good on housing as a human right, but in the short and medium term, DeMarco and the FHFA are in the way of getting help for a lot of people who are in trouble,” Schussler said.
The center does “community building” through popular education, health programs, and workers cooperatives, Schussler said.
Occupy groups have protested at the Republican and Democratic conventions, seeking to divert attention from the “horserace” to “the issues that matter to people,” said David Orlikoff of Occupy Chicago.
He points out that while the FBI estimates that financial institutions committed fraud in a large proportion of subprime loans, financial fraud prosecutions have dropped steadily under the Obama administration and are now at a 20-year low.

Now it is the Sabermetric measure WAR (Wins Above Replacement), or each organization’s version of it through their various expanding analytic departments.
It’s greatly changed how players are evaluated. The Tigers’ Nick Castellanos is a prime example.
He won’t turn 26 until March and is coming off a year in which he hit .272 with 26 home runs, 101 RBI and an American League-leading 10 triples. He was 10th in the AL in total bases, ninth in RBI and sixth in extra base hits. The last two seasons, Castellanos’ OPS has been 827 and .811.
Yet, his WAR has been terrible. Castellanos, metrically, has been among the worst defensive players in MLB. It, along with subpar baserunning and a propensity to hit into double plays, has put his career WAR (Baseball-Reference.com version) at just 1.3 in 580 MLB games.
The Tigers moved Castellanos from third base to right field late last season. He was even worse in right field than at third base - minus 7 runs saved in 21 games compared to minus 14 in 129 games at third base.
Yet, Castellanos’ promise with his bat is undeniable. Now he’s also at the stage where he is starting to be paid big money. Castellanos made $3 million last season during his first season of salary arbitration, and will likely double it, at minimum, because of his excellent hitting line in ’17.
He is not eligible for free agency until 2020, so it’s not as likely he will traded this season as shortstop Jose Iglesias, who general manager Al Avila has said likely will, because Iglesias is a potential unrestricted free agent following ‘17.
Castellanos is also a former Tigers’ first-round draft choice. He is on the borderline of being part of the franchise’s rebuild. Much will depend on how he adjusts to right field. His trade value, which currently is low because of bad metrics, depends on whether he can improve defensively or become such a great hitter his defensive shortcomings will largely be ignored - like former teammate J.D. Martinez.
“We have a good feel that he can make the transition,” Avila said. “If he does, his stock will go up.”
One thing Castellanos has on his side is work ethic. It’s exceptional. He never became a good third baseman, but it wasn’t for lack of effort. Will right field be different?
“He is working his rear end off right now because wants to be a great MLB player, an All Star,” Avila said. “He’s got that determination and very well could be.”
Avila said the Tigers still have time to determine whether to sign Castellanos to a long-term contract or trade him.
“He’s one of those guys we have to go with year-by-year and see how it turns out,” Avila said.
Either way, it should be the one of the more interesting developments for the Tigers in 2018.SportDog Stubborn Field Trainer

By filling basic need, it puts people on track to self-sufficiency
Updated 5:26 pm, Monday, November 30, 2015
Caption
After 20 years of marriage, Angela Sanchez’s life suddenly shattered. A stay-at-home mom for two decades, she filed for divorce when her husband became abusive. She left to start a new life with her five children.
“What kind of example would I have been if I had stayed in that kind of relationship?” Sanchez said. “There were days that I had to choose between paying electricity or buying food — you’re faced with necessity over necessity.”
As the struggles began to mount, she found help. For 6 months, she received groceries at St. Vincent dePaul-Resurrection of the Lord food pantry, sponsored by the San Antonio Food Bank. She receives food stamps, but with assistance from the pantry, she’s starting to require less help. And as the holiday season approaches, she’s set to graduate with a bachelor’s degree.
Sanchez said she’s on the cusp of self sufficiency with help from the organization whose mission is to “fight hunger through food distribution, programs, education and advocacy.”
Located at 5200 W. Old Highway 90, the food bank is a flurry of activity each day with workers unloading trucks and distributing donated food and fresh produce stored at a mammoth warehouse. Adjacent to the two-story, 104,000-square-foot building is a 25-acre community garden where volunteers harvest crops that are distributed to pantries, such as the one that helped Sanchez. and CEO Eric Cooper said the mother of five is one of the thousands that the food bank strives to serve.
“When a divorce hits a family and the wife is left to raise a family and her world seems turned upside down, her first concern is for her kids,” Cooper said. “But as she steps forward to rebuild her life and take care of family, she might lean on the food bank.”
In the past year, agency partners, including growers, distributors, restaurants and numerous food bank drive organizers, donated more than $100 million in food and grocery products to the nonprofit organization. The donations, totaling upwards of 62 million pounds, were delivered to 535 partner agencies, many church food pantries, across 16 counties throughout Southwest Texas. Other partners include group homes, shelters and soup kitchens.
Funding for the food bank comes from civic groups, churches, local businesses, foundations, the government and individuals.
Sister Mary Helen Sullivan of the Catholic Archdioceses Human Development Office is credited with founding the food bank in 1980. The organization is the oldest of the Lone Star state’s 19 America’s Second Harvest Food Banks and one of the biggest food banks in America’s Second Harvest network.
Cooper said the organization continues to gain support as it fights hunger.
“As people learn more about our ‘feed the line’ strategies and ‘shorten the line’ strategies, we’re privileged to have people join us in the effort,” he said.
During the holidays, the agency ramps up with Food4SanAntonio to collect 1 million pounds of food. Residents can fill a bag and drop it off at an H-E-B or Security Service Federal Credit Union location. Participants in the annual Great Turkey Challenge 5K, scheduled for Thanksgiving morning, raise funds to help those in need have a turkey dinner during the holidays.

The food bank has several programs throughout the year to help its clients.
Farm Fresh Fridays features weekly deliveries of fresh produce for the weekend to families in local programs. Project Hope distributes supplemental groceries to senior centers. Kids Cafe provides hot meals to children across the city who might not receive their third meal of the day.
The Summer Food Service program provides nutritional meals to low-income children when school is out. And there’s the DaisyCares Pet Program that offers pet food aid for clients’ pets.
“It doesn’t happen without a tremendous community,” Cooper said of the food bank’s outreach efforts.

I signed up for this race in early fall when I was racing every weekend and noticed that the early sign up discount was very significant. Apparently the race used to be called the Nation's Half, but was bought by the Rock 'n' Roll group a few years ago. There was a marathon option, but I'm not yet ready to go there.
They switched up the course this year so that the start and finish were at different places. Lucky for me the start was an easy walk from my apartment. Even so my friend Becky, who had stayed over, and I had a difficult time getting up and ready at 6 am. We ended up arriving at the starting area less than ten minutes from gun time and still needed to check our bags. I was in corral 7 so was a little worried about missing my start, luckily my friend agreed to check my bag for me as her corral was in the 20s.
I got in place just as they were singing the National Anthem and soon we were moving up towards the start as they counted down for each corral's start.
This was just my second Half Marathon so I was filled with nervous energy. With my first Half my main goal was to run the entire race and finish and my stretch goal was to finish under 2 hours. Since I achieved both goals this time I made some tougher ones. Above all I wanted to beat my previous time so anything under 1:59. My second goal was under 1:50 and that is where I decided to corral myself at the start. My crazy goal was 1:45.
There was 70% chance of rain from 7 to 9am and a smaller chance of rain all day. Needless to say this had me in a slight panic with deciding what to wear. I settled on spandex shorts and a long sleeve shirt for warmth and minimal attire to soak up rain and a hat to keep the rain off my face. Spoiler alert: It didn't rain at all during the race. It was overcast, but no rain. In fact it barely rained all day.
My group started about 10 minutes after the official start of 7:30. Even with the corral start the course was pretty crowded. The weird up and over we did in mile one didn't help with the crowds. The first 6 miles felt great and were run along my normal running routes. Mile 2.5 was especially fun running around the round about at the end of the Arlington Memorial Bridge. There were people cheering the entire way around. Somewhere around mile 5 I ran into the 3:40 marathon pace group and decided to stay with them for awhile. The leaders kept yelling motivating things and giving some strategy advice. As we approached Calvert Hill (about a 100 ft gain straight up) they suggest to not look up till we got to the top, I tried but the hill really slowed me down. Mile 7 was my slowest mile of the race, not only because of that hill, but there were two more tough hills in that mile.
After mile 9 I was in unrun territory. In fact miles 9-12 were in areas of DC that I rarely visit, which means I didn't know how many hills there were (a lot), but there were also several down hills that I tried to take advantage of.
There were several friends that had told me they may be at certain points along the course, but I hadn't seen any of them (mostly because I was earlier than they expected), but at mile 10 I saw my friend Hannah and got pretty excited. The sighting along with a small downhill propelled me for the next half mile.
Mile 12 was a tough one for me. We ran along H street which had lots of people cheering, but it just seemed really long and then we turned for some hills. Around mile 12.5 the marathoners split off from the half marathoners, I had passed the 3:40 pace group by this point, so there weren't that many people splitting off for the full.
Soon after we could see RFK stadium and I got my finishing boost, only we couldn't see the finish line. We had to loop back around for a blind finish, which may of lead me to kick it up a little early, but I wish we could of seen it from further out.
I finished in 1:49:14! I didn't get my crazy goal, but I beat my old record by almost 10 minutes and finished under 1:50.
As you can tell by my mile splits below I was a little all over the place. Some of it I contribute to the hills (Mile 7!) other to crowds (Mile1) and probably some due to my stops to get water and what not.
The finish line goodies were fantastic. I didn't have enough hands so I started stuffing my pockets. I got a bagel, a banana, power bars, jamba juice smoothie, water, Gatorade, applesauce, and finally at the end they gave us a reusable shopping bag. I even passed over the apples and chips.
Up until this point the race seemed pretty well organized, but then I went to bag check. The lines were still short at this point, but each bus only had two people trying to find bags, and they were moving very slowly. I waited over 30 minutes and then found out my friend checked my bag under a different spelling of my last name, haha. Luckily as soon as I got to the right line they found my bag pretty quickly and I changed into some warmer clothes.
I wandered around the area for awhile and listened to the bands a little. I watched the awards for the full marathon. The guy that won the entire race was in his 40s and has only been running a few years oh and he is also a NASA scientist. Apparently winning a marathon was on his bucket list, so he was pretty thrilled to get to check that off.
I guess I hung around a little too long because as I headed to the Metro the line was backed up at least two blocks outside of the station. I decided I couldn't deal with the crowds and decided to walk a mile to another Metro station on a different line. The walk was a nice cool down, but I was happy when I finally got home and was able to shower and rest a full three hours after I finished the race.
Great job! Looking good in the photos. I'm totally afraid your going to catch up to me.
Congratulations. Nice write-up like I was there. MOM
You look pretty happy at the end there with your fastest mile.It looks like you're using an Ad Blocker.

Swift Boat Veterans Oppose Kerry
In that thread, only one member of the group was shown to have actually served on the same boat with Kerry. Some of the others served on other swift boats while Kerry was in Viet Nam. The leader of the group, John O'Neill, who also wrote the book that the group has published, arrived in Viet Nam two months after Kerry left Viet Nam. John O'Neill has no first-hand knowledge of Kerry's service in Viet Nam.
But that hasn't stopped O'Neill from dogging Kerry for 30 years, trying to discredit him. This guy appeared on a TV debate with Kerry during, and with the approval of, the Nixon administration. He has been after Kerry ever since. He claims to be non-partisan, but it seems obvious to me that he is a Republican operative, and that his group is being funded with Republican money.

Don,
Your story sounds plausible, in so far as the timelines and the events match up pretty well. It is, however, difficult for me to understand that you would be so vague about things like unit designations and MOS.
Also, your referral to Recruit Training (or more, commonly, Boot Camp) as basic training, infantry training, rather than ITR, guerilla warfare training at Camp Pendleton, rather than Staging Bn.,
It is true that 35 years is a long time. But, there are things that stay with Marines, not the least of which is the language. This is especially true when speaking to another Marine.
One thing that I wonder about is your schooling. You said you completed RTR and ITR and then awaited OCS, opting out finally to serve out your enlistment. Were you trained as data processor?
If you served,
I am grateful for that, but I have to wonder how you can reconcile Kerry's behavior upon returning to the US. John Kerry turned coat and sided with the communists.
He lied about the actions of the military in Vietnam.
But, that is not what counts. Kerry betrayed his country and took sides with the enemy.
That's all any loyal American needs to know. Anyone who supports him is siding with the enemy, because John Kerry is the enemy.

I was in Iraq, with the Army, during the initial invasion of Iraq (G.W., not his Dad). I speak out against the occupation every chance I get. Am I betraying my country? I'm I not a loyal American? I think people like Kerry, or myself, have a unique perspective about the conflicts we were in, and have an obligation, as loyal Americans, to tell fellow Americans, what an atrocity we were in involved in.
The last poll I saw, Bush led Kerry in support among veterans by 56-40. That means 40% of veterans think Kerry will be a better President than George Bush.
Veterans prefer Bush as Commander-in-Chief by a 60% to 33% margin. Fifty-four percent (54%) of veterans give the President good or excellent ratings for handling the situation in Iraq. Overall, just 43% of voters give the President such positive ratings on Iraq.

I stand by my statement. The tide has turned. America's enemies are in our midst and they are hell-bent-for-leather to destroy us and our way of life. If these conditions are not enough to cause you to put aside your petty wrangling and stand up proudly as a loyal American, willing to risk all for our preservation, then you are the enemy.
To paraphrase GW Bush, you are either with us or you are against us.

All this does is highlight the fact that GW Bush is a Chicken pussy who couldn't even be bothered to show up for bogus duty in Alabama. He was AWOL and a DESERTER.
"The documents released on Friday by the Pentagon included two faded computerized payroll sheets showing Bush was not paid during the latter part of 1972 and offer no evidence to place Bush in Alabama during the latter part of 1972."...
He wasn't paid because he wasnt there. period.

My decorations, medals, and badges included Rifle Expert Badge, National Defense Medal, and Vietnam Service Medal. The Navy Achievement Medal with Combat "V", which I previously mentioned, was awarded after my release from active duty. The Marine Corps invited me to attend an awards ceremony at MCAS, Yuma, Arizona, but I declined.
Is that good enough?
I guess it is true that there are those who were in the Marine Corps, but never became Marines.

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA--(Marketwired - April 12, 2016) - True North Gems Inc. (TSX VENTURE:TGX) ("True North", "TNG", or the "Company") is pleased to provide a construction update for the Aappaluttoq Ruby Mine, SW Greenland. Since the last update on February 18th, 2016, the company and our joint venture partners (LNS Group, "LNSG") have continued to make steady progress with development of the Aappaluttoq mine infrastructure.
Processing Plant Milestones:
Ground Infrastructure:
The remaining ground infrastructure required to be built by LNSG as part of their earn-in to the project are expected to be completed over the summer months when the ground is dry and final construction will be both cheaper and easier to complete. Specifically, this covers the remaining work to upgrade the site roads and the installation of the concrete pier to replace the current floating barge landing at the outer port.
Mine Operations Pit:
The 2016 pit operations and extraction are currently in the planning stages for summer activity. Mining activity completed through to the end of February 2016 provided an ore stockpile feed for the primary crusher of sufficient volume to complete the upcoming wet commissioning of the processing plant. Sufficient waste-rock has been removed from the pit to provide near-immediate access to the orebody upon resumption of mining activity once the processing plant has been fully commissioned;

"It's been crazy," said Townsend Police Chief Erving Marshall. "We've been inundated with people coming in for licenses to carry and so forth."
The influx has been so great, in fact, that the computer systems hooked up to the Firearms Records Bureau has crashed several times. The administrative assistant has had to put in additional hours to keep up with the demand.
In the last two weeks, over 50 residents have come into the station to pick up applications for weapons licenses. Last Tuesday, 14 residents, some waiting for two hours, came in to pick up applications.
"Generally we have maybe three or four people coming in. Usually with hunting season, November is our busiest time," said Marshall. "We've been having upwards of 10 to 15 people coming in. We've actually had to start turning people away because there were too many."
In the first three weeks of January, the department processed 34 applications, 17 of which were new applicants. In the entire month of December, the department processed a total of 18 applications, seven of them new.
Pepperell has also noticed a surge of applications.
"Over the last month or so, it's increased sharply," said Police Chief David Scott.
In December, 23 total applications were processed by the Pepperell Police Department, a number consistent with the months leading up to it.
The increase has been so dramatic that the department has posted a notice both in the building and online that due to the high volume, effective immediately, all firearms license applications are by appointment only.
Marshall speculated that the recent trend aligns with the Sandy Hook shooting in Newtown, Conn. and social commentary surrounding second amendment rights.
"Since Sandy Hook, people are really getting paranoid about the federal government cracking down on firearms. I think that's what's driving this whole thing," said Marshall.
The departments aren't the only places noticing the spike. Massachusetts firearms safety courses have been seeing the same trend.
Steve Hathaway, director of the Massachusetts Firearms Safety School, said he has seen a doubling of the number of students coming in for the training classes in the last month, spiking from approximately 50 students per day to about 100. Mike Zenga, director of Massachusetts Gun Safety School, said he has likewise noticed the increase. A week after the Newtown incident, he said, he noticed about a 50 percent increase in students.
"It's all related, without question, to recent events," said Hathaway.
What's more, said Hathaway, is that because those applying for license renewals are not required to take the course again, nearly all of the students he sees are new applicants.
"People are making the (choice) and paying $100 to take the class, paying $100 to get the license, taking a day class which means taking time off of work. They're putting an inordinate amount of effort into this decision," said Hathaway. "This portion of the populace is basically saying they've made their choice and they're putting resources and significant effort behind that choice."
Hathaway echoed Marshall's speculation on the driving force behind the surge.
"Based on my interactions with some of our students, I get the idea that what's driving these things isn't so much people saying 'I need to do this because bad events like this can happen anywhere and I need to be prepped.' I think what's happened is politicians are scaring people," said Hathaway. "The politicians scrambling to ban guns come off as so aggressive, it makes people believe if they don't get a license now, they will never be able to own a gun. It's ironic because there's probably no one that's more disgusted, if I could use such powerful word, (by this surge) than anti-gun politicians. It's not their intention. They don't want it, but they are cause of it, not anyone in the gun industry."
There are three varieties of licenses that residents are able to apply for: Firearms identification cards (FID cards), class A license to carry, and Class B license to carry. Class A is the only license that allows for carrying a concealed weapon. FID cards permit purchasing and carrying only non-large capacity weapons.
New license to carry applicants must by 21 or older. FID applicants must be 18 or older, or 15-17 with parental approval.
Residents are also able to apply to carry chemical sprays such as mace.
Applicants are required to submit three letters of recommendation and to show proof of residency. Anyone that applies for a first time license to carry must undergo a mandatory training course by an approved instructor. As long as the applicant is a legal resident, anyone can apply.
But not all applicants are accepted. The departments fingerprint every applicant and run criminal history reports through the Federal Records Bureau. Certain things in criminal history result in automatic denials. Convictions for operating under the influence or convictions for any violent crimes, including assault and battery, are disqualifiers.
Additionally, the police departments can deny an applicant for suitability.
"Say they don't have a criminal record, but a resident comes in with a past history domestic violence, though they've never been charged ... I can deny him based on suitability to carry firearms," said Marshall.
Every applicant is also run through the Department of Mental Health, said Scott.May 10, 2009
First week of our summer is DONE!!
This week has been pretty crazy as I (Matt) have started working for the summer for AMP Alarm installing home security. Chelsea has kept herself busy getting our apartment all set up and getting ready for some online classes that she's taking this summer. Getting back into the swing of things with alarms has been interesting but good. Baltimore has proven to be quite a bit more ghetto than virginia was. Saturday night I was sent to a house to install an alarm, the last one of the night, but the office sent me to "907 princeton ct" instead of "907 princeton terr" which was around the corner. However there was a really pissed off guy at 907 princeton ct. I knocked on his door once and he didn't answer, then I knocked again and as I was walking back to my car the guy came to the door cussin up a storm, yelling at me, and waving a rather large firearm. Needless to say I was shocked, and immediately reached for the sky, and yelled WOAH WOAH WOAH! After he realized I wasn't there to do anything bad he hid the gun behind his back and pretty much gave me to the count of ten. It only took me to the count of 2 though and I was out of there! Thats been the most exciting experience so far. Chelsea came with me on a couple of jobs earlier in the week and was a great assistant. This week has been good to get settled and actually start our life together. Hopefully I don't have anymore gun experiences, but I'm sure there will be some more stories from the summer that we will be able to post here. Until next time...

PUBLISHED: 14:43 01 November 2017 | UPDATED: 15:39 01 November 2017
Hornsey police station in Tottenham Lane is set to close as the Mayor's Office looks to make £400m of budget cuts by 2021. Picture: Google Maps
Archant
The Met has confirmed Hornsey police station will close as part of London mayor Sadiq Khan’s plan to raise £165million by selling off front counter buildings across the capital.
Supt Nigel Brookes said the date of the closure has yet to be confirmed but “it is likely to be by the end of the year” with some officers remaining at the Tottenham Lane site until the Met finds alternative accommodation, or “hubs”, for wards in the west of the borough.
Options include buildings used by other emergency services or by the council.
The closure follows police reports of a drop in visits to station front counters at a time when the force has to make a further £400m worth of budget cuts by 2021.
Sadiq Khan said: “Government cuts to policing budgets,” he added.
Hornsey and Wood Green MP Catherine West said: “‘Hornsey Police Station is a beacon of security in our community that is being put out by increasing government cuts. The local community prizes the police station - and for good reason. It provides an everyday link between the people of Hornsey and Wood Green and the police, helping the Met carry out their community policing effectively.
“I have strongly opposed the closure of the police station at every stage, writing to Home Secretary Amber Rudd and securing a debate in Parliament on police cuts, but unfortunately the government has ignored the pleas of our community.
“I will continue to campaign at every opportunity for proper funding for the Metropolitan Police in Parliament,” she added.
Supt Brookes said Haringey now has two officers dedicated to each of the borough’s 19 wards with a police community support officer (PCSO) in each.
The Met hopes officers will be able to remain in their wards for longer after getting laptops and tablets to carry around with them rather than being forced to return to a police station to complete paperwork.
Supt Brookes added: “These officers will only be abstracted from their wards in exceptional circumstances.”
Haringey’s 24-hour front counter will stay in Tottenham either in a new building or in the existing High Road station.
Under the savings plans released today Sadiq Khan aims to raise £165m by selling off station buildings across London “to invest in ensuring frontline police are properly equipped”.
Commenting, Crouch End resident David Winskill said: “Hornsey police station has been a local landmark for well over a hundred years. I hope whoever the new owners are they will respect itscontribution to the area and the building will remain for future generations.”
Anyone who wants to get in touch with the police is now encouraged to do so through social media or via the met.police.uk website or by telephone with plans to improve the 101 service, criticised for long waiting times.
A minimum of a one hour meeting would be held each week during which people would have a further opportunity to speak to an officer..120000profits booked today F&O. enjoy the money friends. what a great profits!!!!

Religious groups after the Revolution were not legally recognized, so they could not own property, accept gifts and endowments and administer their finances. So, in Fr. Dujarié's view, the priests would serve this purpose. But nothing was done to implement his idea.
Moreau, however, had a different idea as you can see.
On June 19, 1835, Fr. Moreau wrote to Bishop Bouvier as follows: "Am I to found a house of diocesan missionaries, which can a the same time serve as a house of retirement for infirm or retired priests, as well as for retreats for the laity at certain times of the year?" In the margin Bishop Bouvier wrote, Yes. This was the approval Fr. Moreau needed and so just before accepting the Brothers of St. Joseph, he was on retreat with two priests and two seminarians in the Trappist Monastery of Notre Dame Port-du-Salut seen in the photo below.
Here
Fr. Moreau, Abbés Cottereau and Nourry, and two seminarians Abbés
Veron and Moriceau decided on the spiritual life they were to lead. They adopted
the name "Auxiliary Priests" indicating that besides the preaching
of retreats and missions they would also engaged in parochial ministry when
needed.
Since Fr. Moreau was still assistant superior at St. Vincent's Seminary, they would temporarily reside there. In 1836 they began preaching in different parishes. In all these parishes they enlivened the faith of the people by erecting the Way of the Cross. They found this devotion most helpful in engendering the human heart faith, contrition and hope.

You're the essential 1 and you can have the same outcomes that we received by using the same all natural supplements that we did.
My wife and I had been not overweight or overweight by most individuals's requirements, but we both wanted to shed about 10 pounds so that we could appear and really feel better and younger. About that "younger" stuff, we are each in our sixth decade of life and are extremely energetic and we particularly adore to perform tennis and snow ski and we don't want to appear "fat" (Okay, sorry, I stated the dread F phrase) on the courtroom or on the slopes or much more importantly for each other.
Garcinia Cambogia QChromium picolinate has been promoted to increase lean mass and reduce body fat. Individuals who consume 200 to four hundred micrograms of chromium picolinate every day, might outcome in about a two.five-pounds of misplaced excess weight, per 7 days.
Phentermine is an additional prescription drug that suppresses urge for food. To me, that sends up a crimson flag correct away. If you want to eat correctly, you need to be able to inform when you're hungry. If you consider a drug that interferes with your capability to figure out how much to eat, how good is that? Also, even though people shed excess weight on this drug (the research don't inform us whether that weight is lean muscle mass or fat; I'd wager on lean muscle mass mostly), they nearly usually acquire it all back again.
Numerous of us truly do not understand what the garcinia cambogia fruit is. This is because this fruit is not truly that popular as those fruits that we would usually see in the supermarkets or the ones we would generally eat. Nevertheless this type of fruit, via the Garcinia Cambogia attract out, is the type that would truly offer us the health advantages that we would wish to have that are totally checked and confirmed more than the hundreds of years.
Nutrigold Garcinia CambogiaChromium Polynicotinate was lately researched, at an additional top university middle, and published in the journal, Diabetic issues Technology & Therapeutics, and the results had been amazing (at minimum to me). They found that providing women, who enrolled in their research, one gram of this form of chromium considerably decreased their appetites, starvation levels and body fat cravings by an average of 25%twenty five. Imagine that! Using chromium Polynicotinate will reduce the quantity of food you eat by twenty five%twenty five! That's awesome! But hey, that's exactly what happened to Linda and me. Did I mention, Linda is my wife?
As you can see, weight loss is possible for anyone, but it is tough. Anything worth it generally is. If you are prepared to consider the excess weight off, and aren't frightened of a small difficult function and some alter, you will see the excess weight drop off in no time.
Some hoodia gordonii diet plan tablets would declare that they are the best because their product is one hundred percent hoodia gordonii with no other components integrated and since Hoodia Plus (as the phrase Furthermore suggests) is mixed with other historical Chinese herbs it can't do the occupation. Yes, hoodia gordonii has the P57 molecules that send untrue indicators to the brain that the stomach is full hence; the body will quit inquiring for food. It can suppress the urge for food but it can't effectively battle the undesirable weight by by itself. There are two essential variables that will assist hasten the weight reduction process and they are: low calorie intake and metabolic process price.
Wow Garcinia Cambogia ResultsThis is a all-natural weight reduction product that is produced from the extract of the tamarind fruit, which is a small pumpkin-searching fruit that is grown in particular parts of India. This fruit is very high in anti-oxidants, which we all know are fantastic for your body, assist to slow down the aging process, fight illness, and even inhibit the storage of fat.
While on the hoodia complement, she followed an easy diet plan and physical check here exercise plan recommended by an additional unique toning abdominal muscles program. Soon her stomach body fat shrunk. In 1.five months, she reduced her waistline by 1.five inches, and goal to reduce another one inches within the next 7 days. Her last target was to get a toned abs so that she could significantly cut the risk of coronary heart illness. That means she must have a waistline of 31.five inches or much less. Auntie Annie's premature death was a massive blow to her and remained etched on her thoughts. She would not let it happen on herself.
Garcinia Cambogia Herbs DietBoth had been administrative employees who invested huge part of their time at their desk. It didn't come as a shock that most of their fat ended up on the bellies.
Wu-Yi tea has 3 independent actions that help you lose excess weight, and enhance your well being. First, it contains a harmonious mix of ingredients that work together to assist you achieve your objectives. These consist of garcinia cambogia, green tea, chromium polynicotinate, gymnema sylvestre, niacin-bound chromium, and hydroxycitric acid. It also uses the powers of eco-friendly tea, and its potent anti-oxidants, as well as acai berry. These last two are well known for their well being and excess weight reduction benefits.
Nutralife Garcinia Cambogia ReviewsWow! That's fairly a list. Sure it is, and the genuine secret is that you don't have to consider them all (unless you truly want to). I will clarify. First, allow me tell you, 1 by one, a small bit about every one of these all natural herbs.
Essentially, it's a cactus. But, it's a cactus with some fantastic properties that make it excellent for excess weight reduction. Why is this? Well, hoodia has a naturally happening component known as P57. In a nutshell, this helps to increase ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate - don't be concerned, you don't have to know what that is!) levels.
Don't be fooled into considering that lengthy term weight loss can be accomplished via supplementation on your own. Nevertheless, when taken with a good diet and exercise regime, hoodia gordonii tablets can be massively advantageous. As a certified PT and nutrition expert, I can attest to this. So, eat right, physical exercise, and consider the complement to assist you along. It's really very simple when you look at it that way.Customer Experience

We've been scouring books and the internet for reference information and managed to get details of almost all the boxes along the line. Using this we've tried to re-create as accurately as possible the various versions of signal boxes in use. What this means in practise is that TC3 will come with 50 new signal box models to choose from when you want to build your own route.

,
This week, I'd like to take the time to recognize an outstanding figure in the field of listening and spoken language. Last Thursday,
Jane Madell, PhD, LSLS Cert AVT
, was awarded the
Marion Downs Award for Pediatric Excellence
by the American Academy of Audiology, in recognition of her outstanding commitment to ensuring that every child with hearing loss has the opportunity to learn to listen, speak and participate in society. Jane is a giant in pediatric audiology and has established standards of practice that we can all look to as a model for serving children with hearing loss
.
If I were to pick one word to describe Jane, it would be "determined." Once she sets herself upon a goal, she will achieve it. Jane's determination is best seen in her absolute commitment to providing a solid foundation in listening and spoken language to every child she serves no matter their age or hearing loss. She understands, and incorporates in her work, that parents are vital to the success of children learning to listen and speak, and she honors them through her activity with their child
.
What sets Jane apart is her unwavering and rigorous standards for success. Jane insists that not only should her patients be able to speak and hear, but also that they should be able to do so on a par with their hearing peers. These pioneering standards have allowed for a more effective progression of speech outcomes, and Jane firmly believes that nearly every child with hearing loss can learn to speak and join in mainstream education. It is a testament to her that so many of her patients have done just that (and if you benefited from working with Jane, we hope you'll
share your story with us
.) Working with Jane isn't easy; she is strong-willed and has high expectations. But the impact of her work - whether you are her patient, student or colleague - is immensely rewarding.
Jane has left a remarkable footprint in our field far beyond her direct impact on her patients. Drawing from her wealth of experience, Jane co-authored the text
Pediatric Audiology: Diagnosis, Technology and Management
to help other professionals better serve the community. She is a prolific writer who has contributed to Volta Voices and writes a robust blog,
Hearing & Kids
.
I'd like to take this opportunity to congratulate Jane and thank her for her years of work in service to people who are deaf and hard of hearing. She is truly an ideal model for our community. I am honored to work closely with Jane on the AG Bell Academy Board of Directors. Seeing her dedication to the craft of listening and spoken language in practice is a gift. Individuals of such passion and extraordinary initiative are exceptional. But I am most grateful for Jane's generosity in sharing her knowledge, her experiences and her commitment to excellence
.
With Jane at the Volta Bureau
Jane travels around the world to spread the mission of listening and spoken language and its best practices. This year, she will present at our
International Symposium
in Buenos Aires held jointly with Instituto Oral Modelo, as well as the
AG Bell Listening and Spoken Language Symposium
here in Washington, D.C
.
If you see Jane at any of these events, I encourage you to congratulate her on her award and to take the time to ask questions of her. You will never forget her passion for our field and for the impact that AG Bell and listening and spoken language has made on a great many families around the world
.
I am always available to you at
info@agbell.org
and at 202-337-5220.
Until next week,
Emilio Alonso-Mendoza
P.S. The
AG Bell AVEd Scholarship
and
Doreen Pollack Scholarship
for AVT candidates will close this Friday, April 14. Get your applications in ASAP!
Every great dream begins with a dreamer. Always remember, you have within you the strength, the patience, and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world

Sonic Bowing DVD Playback in Future Wii Console13 Nov, 2006 By: Erik Gruenwedel
Nintendo's next-generation Wii game console doesn't launch until Nov. 19, but that hasn't stopped DVD copying-product manufacturer Sonic Solutions Nov. 13 from announcing that its DVD playback software will be included in a future edition of the much-anticipated game console.
Novato, Calif.-based Sonic's CinePlayer CE DVD Navigator software enables CD and DVD playback, in addition to DVD recording and authoring functionality.
The $250 Wii does not feature a DVD drive or playback option. By comparison, Sony Corp.'s PlayStation 3, which streets Nov. 17 in both $500 and $600 models, will include a next-generation Blu-ray Disc drive.
“To be involved in Nintendo's ground-breaking gaming console is extremely gratifying,” said Jim Taylor, SVP and GM of Sonic's advanced technology group. “Game consoles represent a fresh market and platform where we can introduce a new audience of potentially millions to the quality of our brand and the power of our digital media applications.”
A Nintendo spokesperson said plans call for inclusion of a standard (non-high-definition) DVD drive in the second edition Wii (slated for late 2007 release). A Sonic spokesperson said the company's DVD software could accommodate either HD DVD or Blu-ray playback option.Fr ‘execution-style.’ The victims were believed ‘to ‘are.”

Once viewed as “ New-age alternatives,” massage, acupuncture, and the Alexander techniques are gaining ground as conservative approaches to preventing and alleviating the painful and sometimes debilitating symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome.Director: David Cronenberg
Cast: Oliver Reed, Samantha Eggar, Art Hindle
The Brood is one of the most disturbing horror films ever made. David Cronenberg's fascination with the fears of the flesh, manifest themselves onscreen in some of the most repellent and interesting scenes in cinematic terror. Cronenberg was undoubtably the most original and least homage obsessed of his generation of horror filmmakers and always produced some of the more intelligent pictures in the genre. Like most of his work, The Brood will likely not be for everybody, but for those who can stomach it's graphic violence, it's a rewarding and captivating experience.
The story follows the work of a brilliant psychologist's unconventional therapy techniques. Dr. Hal Raglan(Oliver Reed) has developed a way to channel a person's psyche and make them manifest their inner demons. This is taken to literal extremes, however, when his star patient, Nola Carveth(Samantha Eggar) begins to form child-sized demons from within her that go and murder those she feels antagonism towards, including her parents and the teacher of her young daughter, Candice(Cindy Hinds), whom she believes is hooking up with her husband, Frank(Art Hindle). Frank is determined to see her, but is granted no admission. As the murders mount and the police become involved, Frank and the police discover one of the things and a creepy diagnosis confirms that it was never born. After the teacher is killed, in a shocking scene in front of all her students, Candice is taken captive by them and brought to her mother, who is staying in a remote cabin, where Raglan has kept her. Frank follows and runs into Raglan, who begins to realize that his experiment has gone too far and offers to help Frank, convincing him to make Nola believe that he wants to stay with her. The couple have been seperated, since Nola's madness has been increasing and she has become more violent, so it proves difficult for Frank. Raglan, armed with a revolver, goes into the cabin to extract Candice from the Brood, but Nola's anger towards Frank, incites them and Raglan is murdered by the Brood. Nola reveals to Frank a womb-sack on her stomach which she tears open, licking the blood clean from her "child." Disgusted by the act, Nola directs her anger through the brood to kill they're child, but Frank manages to strangle Nola, killing the Brood and saving his daughter. As the film ends, lesions are seen on the daughter's arm that may indicate she might inherit the same power from her mother.
The Brood is an acquired taste for sure, but for those that can take it, one of the most brilliantly handled of the 70s terror pictures. Taking in a Cronenberg picture, one can realize what set them apart from the rest of the gore crowd. His films often feature some remarkably gruesome and stomch churning moments, but the true terror is in the psychological and emotional edge that he gives his pictures. The Brood is a genuinely terrifying film and a very bitter one as well, Cronenberg reflecting on a custody battle he was having with his divorced wife at the time. In some ways, this film becomes almost like a splatter movie version of Kramer vs. Kramer.
The performances are all first rate, though Eggar and Reed deserve the lion share of attention here. Eggar, who has portrayed quite a few weirdos, was never better than she is here, even managing to bring some sympathy to her genuinely insane character. While she is the villain of the piece, she also becomes alternately, the victim of her own fragile mindset, exploited by Raglan, who has pushed her to the breaking point.
Reed is a perfect mad scientist-type, coming across as both radical and mad, yet fashionable and charming, exuding a calm exterior, that hides genuine intensity, a trademark of the actor's work. His character also, as in many Cronenberg pictures, is still not painted in black and white, realizing his error and attempting to redeem himself by trying to save Candice, which ultimately costs him his life, being destroyed by his own creation. Oliver Reed has a slew of excellent screen portrayals, but i'd have to rank this among his best and more complex. Study the opening few minutes for how subtly effective he can be, as he has a "session" with one of his patients, and notice how both disturbing and poignant it is. It's a tribute to bother actor and director.
Croneberg is also aided by Howard Shore's terrific, moody score, the first of many classic scores that the great composer would create for the director(this was actually his first for a motion picture). The effects team really outdid themselves here as well, creating some truly disturbing images, expecially the birth scene towards the end, that has to be one of the grossest moments of any horror movie ever made.
David Cronenberg is one of my favorite directors and his explorations into the deepest and most complex fears have always made his films rewatchable and fun probing for the film enthusiast. The Brood is one of his best works, being both disturbing and though provoking, while employing some wonderful characters and memorably horrifying scenes. In a year that was ripe with great horror(Alien, Dawn of the Dead), The Brood stands apart as being unique and creepy. This is rightfully deserving of it's cult following and has a place on my list of the 125 greatest horror movies.Send us your Minocqua photos:

called Fox Software who developed an extremely efficient data access and
retrieval technology called Rushmore which runs queries hundreds or even
thousands of times faster
and which FoxPro was and still is based on.
Microsoft had failed miserably to
produce a successful database application to compete with Borland who at
the time had 75% of the PC database market share that Microsoft wanted to
dominate so in 1992 Microsoft bought Fox
Software for $173 Million, kept
some of their best developers and of
course the superior technology which they then renamed Visual FoxPro or VFP.
Microsoft then dissolved Fox Software to
become the 3rd of the now hundreds of X-Companies collectively known as
Microsoft roadkill.
The last version of VFP was version 9.0,
released in 2004 and last updated in 2007, official Microsoft
support for VFP 9 ended at the end of 2015.
There are dozens of
VFP books available, many excellent VFP support forums like
foxite.com and VFP developers like myself are available for hire on
the Web or if you live in Christchurch New Zealand then I can come to you and
provide on-going hourly-based VFP development and maintenance for your
small business.
In terms of compatibility with existing
databases, just remember that Microsoft Visual FoxPro (VFP)
natively
supports Microsoft Excel and believe it or not, it can happily read
Microsoft SQL databases so because most database applications are compatible
with either Excel or SQL or both, then there shouldn't be any great problems with
database compatibility.
If you still have any doubts then
please read the following eye-opening
"verbatim" article from Les Pinter's Database Journal
November 1998:
Years ago, Chrysler built a kit that
could be used to modify the carburettors of its diesel engines, so that
trucks got better gas mileage. It cost over 500 dollars and involved a
hefty mechanic bill as well. Mechanics loved to sell and install it, so
everyone was happy. Except the users.
The military were especially interested
in using computer technology to save money, so they had Chrysler design
and build a computer based module that cost twenty dollars and did the
same thing that the five hundred dollar kit that took a day to install
did. But they weren't required to sell it to the public so they didn't.
Finally, their largest fleet customers
approached them with a proposition: Make a little modification to the
circuit board so that it would boot up in such a way as to pass the EPA
DOT pollution tests. Then , gradually, over the next hour, have it
reconfigure itself to minimize fuel consumption and pollute like a
chimney. They did so, and the trucking industry bought tens of thousands
of them and laughed at the American people.
Chrysler just settled with DOT for a
billion dollars. Chrysler's pricing policy wasn't illegal. It's perfectly
legal to have two products, one of which is far better, faster and cheaper
than the other, and not tell your customers about it. What was illegal was
the way that they went about it. It wasn't until their trade practices
hurt American consumers that the government stepped in. Chrysler didn't
give a damn how much more it cost their customers, or how much it cost the
American people. They just wanted to increase their share price.
Microsoft sells two database
technologies. One - FoxPro - is cheap and fast, and has no incremental
cost. You pay for it one time. The other - VB with SQL server - costs by
the seat and runs considerably slower. FoxPro users can also use SQL, but
FoxPro users don't migrate to SQL Server - not even when they should. They
don't perceive the need to do so, and often can't even be talked into it.
But give users no alternative and they'll go along.
Give them a language that chokes when
their local tables reach fifty thousand records, and offer them SQL as the
only way to salvage their development investment. They'll come over.
They'll have to. I don't know whether it's illegal or not to talk your own
customers into spending twenty thousand dollars for capabilities that they
could have gotten for five hundred. I don't know if it's illegal to
recommend a technology that represents massive over-kill for most database
projects. Caveat emptor. But it seems wrong. Having higher costs isn't
necessarily a bad thing for a company. Your competitors simply have to
bear the same costs. Being forced to move from a less expensive technology
to a more expensive one falls equally on all businesses. If your
programmers decide to use MS SQL, it only produces economic disadvantage
if your competitors figure out that there's something better and cheaper.
If they do as you do, then your costs and those of your competitors go up
by the same amount, and no one in your industry can sell their product
more cheaply due to lower costs. No one loses. Except the American
consumer.
What does it feel like to be the only
programmer in a corporate IT department who recommends FoxPro? Re-member
not being part of the popular crowd in high school? Remember the power of
slander by innuendo?
"If it's so good, why doesn't Microsoft
advertise it? They must be ashamed of it." Nothing could be further from
the truth. Microsoft knows full well how good FoxPro is. MS SQL sales
stand to be reduced by billions of dollars. And now you know the rest of
the story.
We're the key to this strategy of benign
neglect. With the Justice Department looking on, Microsoft can't kill
FoxPro. But we can. If we buckle to innuendo and the campaign of silence,
Microsoft wins. We, and our customers, and their customers, are the
losers. By bowing our heads and accepting defeat, we allow might to make
right. I know it's hard to stand up to the in-crowd. I've been asked not
to raise this issue, but I intend to stand up and be counted. I hope that
you will, too.
Since Microsoft stopped advertising
FoxPro, I've had a standing offer to compete publicly against anyone they
can name in building a sample application. No takers. So try it yourself.
Take any application, write it in both languages and compare the
development effort; that's one. Then dump in a hundred thousand records
and run them both, comparing performance. That's two. Now, figure out how
much it will cost to deploy your application on a network using SQL Server
- the only cure for the glacially slow performance of large MDB files -
paying by the seat for MS SQL. And add in the cost of a Database
Administrator, unless SQL 7.0 saves you that $100,000/ year hidden cost.
And there are others.
It's not a contest; it's an IQ test.

Looking at the future trends of the road traffic, one will recognize that the commercial vehicle participation will not decrease, although it is required from the environmental and social viewpoints. The reason is that the other means of freight transport (water, railway, air) do not provide the same flexibility as the road transport, and direct business interest of those companies, who are using this transport form is larger than the eventual loss caused by the penalties to be paid (taxes, compensation of higher axle load). This conflict is hard to solve, but the effect can be minimized. The commercial vehicle industry attempts to introduce systems to the vehicles, which are targeting on reduction of the environmental impacts caused by heavy vehicles. These systems, which are named generally as “intelligent chassis systems”, electronically control the operation of the chassis subsystems (engine, transmission, brake, suspension) and co-ordinate their operation on a higher level (vehicle controller, intelligent control systems, such as adaptive cruise control, video camera based lane change recognition system, etc.). This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of the commercial vehicle chassis systems, and tries to project their future development.

Anne Crozier Seltzer was born December 18, 1932, in Davenport, Iowa, daughter of Bruce and Esther (Bartholomew) Crozier. She was raised in the Davenport and Clinton areas where she was a member of the Girl Scouts of America. She won a prize for collecting the most newspapers during World War II in a Scout drive. Anne was an avid canoeist and taught canoeing and swimming for the Clinton Red Cross during high school.
Following graduation from high school, Anne attended Carleton College in Northfield, MN where her interests were Spanish and Math. During summers, she worked in the research lab at Clinton Corn Processing which later became part of ADM. She met David Seltzer in the Carletonian office on campus and they had their first date at the Carleton Tea Room. The couple married on November 17, 1956, in the bride’s home in Clinton. Anne and David spent all of their married life in Waterloo where she worked for the Boy Scouts of America office and he worked for the Waterloo Courier. The Courier’s policy at the time was, “newswriters are not newsmakers” meaning they were not permitted to participate in community activities, so they chose to support school activities and the YMCA. Through the years, Anne enjoyed canoeing, cooking, sewing, gardening, reading, and above all, loving her family.
Anne passed away at home on Friday, June 9, 2017, at the age of 84 years. She was preceded in death by her parents; her husband; her sister, Patricia; and her brother, George. Anne is survived by her daughter, Barbara (Daniel) Tako of Hugo, MN; and two granddaughters, Emily and Sarah Tako.
Anne blessed her family with her love and patience and will be deeply missed. Special thanks to her physical trainer Suzan Egan and the folks at The Homestead of Maplewood.

Illyria in Marks Hall Gardens
30.06.13
On this "hot midsummer night", the five actors of Illyria set up their red pageant stage in the leafy grounds of Marks Hall Estate for Shakespeare's ever-popular pastoral comedy..
Just five for the score or more characters of As You Like It ? They certainly "prove busy actors" – We see Celia as Old Adam before we meet her for real; her Rosalind as an Igor-esque Dennis. There's much fun to be had with this quick-change mayhem, and with some of the comedy ideas that enliven this production – the sheep, the shearing and the "surgery". But it's slow to get started, and the characters struggle to establish themselves. The luvvie Jaques – Jakes in this text – was an exception [though his big speech failed to impress]; so was the pantomime Audrey, who dashed through the audience at the end of the interval in search of chocolate brownies.
The latter part of the play was much livelier, with a wailing love quartet, plenty of slapstick and the "springtime" Lover and His Lass.
But this was a three hour production – too long for the open air – and we had to wait 45 minutes before we had any music, and another 2 hours before the fiddle made its appearance. 50 minutes before anyone's buskins touched the grass. And Orlando's poems never went anywhere near any of the real live trees surrounding the action.
The masque, with Hymen perched high above the happy couples, worked well, and the raucous finale sent us all home happy.
This was my second al fresco As You Like It this month, and again the weather was perfect. Unaccountably I missed The Lord Chamberlain's Men at Hylands in the rain ...Quicksort is an efficient sorting algorithm, serving as a systematic method for placing the elements of an array in order. It is an algorithm that is based on the divide-and-conquer technique and is one of the fastest and efficient sorting algorithms in practical scenarios. Unlike merge sort, which divides its input’s element according to their position in the array, quicksort divides the elements according to their value. The quicksort sorting algorithm is an in place sorting algorithm, requiring small additional amounts of memory to perform the sorting.
Quicksort rearranges elements of a given array A[0..n-1] to achieve its partition. Partition is a situation where all the elements before some position s are smaller than or equal to A[s] (the so-called pivot) and all elements after position s are greater than or equal to A[s].
Obviously, after a partition has been achieved, A[s] will be in its final position in the sorted array, and we can continue sorting the two sub-arrays of the elements preceding and following A[s] independently.To be an entrepreneur, you must be…? How do you think that sentence should end? “Brave”? “Determined”? “Innovative”?
Truthfully an entrepreneur must be many things; more adjectives than five are required in order to call yourself a true and successful entrepreneur. However, we’ve selected five of the most common and essential traits required to either become or sustain yourself as an entrepreneur.
Risk-Taking
We often think of risk as a dirty word — in fact, isn’t it better to avoid risk altogether? This might be true in some areas of life, but in others the phrase “go big or go home” is one hundred percent true. Just like in gambling, sometimes a big risk results in a giant loss. Other times it means you get a big pay day.
Without that risk, no matter the outcome, there would be no chance for that huge success. The risk doesn’t have to be monetary, either. Sometimes taking a chance on the little things can pay off in a big way.
Hungry
No, not in the way that means you want to go out to lunch. This kind of hunger is for success, for knowledge and for recognition — maybe you’d prefer to call it “drive.”
A good entrepreneur knows that they have to keep learning, but a great entrepreneur is one that truly wants to. This kind of hunger is one that drives them to better themselves and take those risks.
Adaptable
Not everything will go your way all the time, and that’s not just a lesson for entrepreneurs to learn. However, it might be a lesson that entrepreneurs benefit from more than most. Sometimes plans fall through and an entrepreneur has to adapt to the sudden changes. Not every scheme will be executed perfectly, not every vision will be clearly seen and sometimes a completely foreign scenario works its way into the mix.
A great entrepreneur doesn’t give in to this uncertainty — they embrace it.
Responsible
Gone are the days of laying around on the couch and brainstorming about your big business idea — you’re going to be an entrepreneur, which means your life is going to drastically change if you want to make all of your visions realities.
Even though you’ll be your own boss, you’ll still have all the responsibilities that come with that position. It also means you’ll have to handle money, and hopefully lots of it, in a fiscally responsible way.
Gregarious
Sure there are ways to become a great entrepreneur as an introvert, but the more outgoing and personable you are? The better you’ll be at networking and selling your brand. Creating relationships among your peers and in the business community will be vital to getting your business recognized, and you can’t do that on a concept alone.
Businesspeople are usually outspoken, self-assured and promoting. They know how to charm and talk to people in a convincing yet personable way. This kind of attitude also lends itself to sales — without being gregarious, the sales funnel becomes a lot more narrow.
It takes a lot to become an entrepreneur. How many of these attributes do you have yourself?

This afternoon I noticed that my laptop was infected with a few viruses/spyware etc..... and not just a little infected but a lot infected.
I found:
- vundo
- virtumonde
- pandex
- goldun
- smitfraud
- and a handful of other rogue cleaners and trojans
Well, plenty. Unfortunately I didn't follow my own advice and downloaded and ran half a dozen [useless] patches before realising the obvious -- my computer was infected.
Now, to get to the point of this little story.... none of my stinking antivirus/antispam programs work! I tried clamwin, kaspersky labs, panda, Spyware Doctor (endorsed by Google), virtumundobegone, vundofix.... none of them worked. period. Sure, they were great at detecting the malware, but they all seemed to be lacking in the removal of the malware.
After numerous scans and restarts I came across a program called SUPERantispyware (). It's AMAZING. It doesn't do your taxes or anything, but it actually does what is advertised: detection AND removal of malware. wonderful, A+++.Client Testimonials

Reina : She is impatient.
Gaki-san : I'm very impatient. I will normally turn up earlier than the appointed time. However, out of the 9 members, the other 8 are loose with their time, including this girl (Reina).
Reina : Eh?
Gaki-san : So I thought I should get watches for them as well as Tanakacchi.
Fujii : You don't have a watch?
Reina : I don't have one. I think I will forget to wear the watch.
Fujii : Are you usually late for appointments?
Reina : Some times...
Gaki-san : Even though I'm their senior, they will just walk in with a "Sorry ~" with a smile thinking that they will be able to get away with that.
Fujii : That's unforgivable isn't it?
Gaki-san: Exactly.
Reina : But I don't really need one...
Gaki-san: You can't not get one.
Fujii : These are cheap!
Gaki-san : Indeed!
Reina : With this price, we can go to a restaurant to eat steak.
Gaki-san : No way you're going to a restaurant and enjoy such luxury.
Fujii : The reason behind getting it is so that you can follow your senior's role model and be time concious.
Gaki-san : That's right. Steak is just a 1-time-luxury while this...
Reina : It's okay!! I'm fine with a 1-time-satisfaction.
Gaki-san : You can't.
Fujii : You can't.
Gaki-san : Lets get these.
Reina : Ehh!?
Fujii : It looks pretty good.
Gaki-san : I want to get the members watches too.
Fujii : You want to get them watches too? That means...?
Reina : That means it'll be 9 watches.
Fujii : You're going to buy 9?
Gaki-san : (Looks at Reina) Buy it yourself!! I'm going to buy only 8.
Fujii : Eh? You're going to buy 8?
Gaki-san : Yes.
Fujii : Eh?
Gaki-san : Yes, 8.
Fujii : That means you are buying for everyone except Tanaka-san?
Gaki-san : Yes.
Reina : (lol)
Gaki-san : If you ask why, if she buys it herself, there's more significance behind it.
Fujii : I don't really understand the concept...
Reina : Look! (lol)
Fujii : ...but isn't it weird?
Gaki-san : Why?
Reina : Look look! She's mean ~
Fujii : You buying 8 and not going 1 more? Just because today both of you are on the show together?
Reina : (lol)
Gaki-san : Because she is here, she is going to buy it herself.
Reina : Why?
Gaki-san : What colour should I get for them...?
Reina : I'm going with pink.
Gaki-san : No way!
Reina : Since I'm buying it myself.
Gaki-san : Okay, fair enough then.
Fujii : Wait a second...you mean you accepted the fact that you have to buy it yourself?
Reina : If I don't go with the flow, it'll look like I can't read the atmosphere so...
Gaki-san : All right, I'll buy you one.
Fujii : Look!
Reina : Woah! YAY! Gaki-san is great!
Gaki-san : You're loud!
Fujii : Ah, looks like it's fun to be in a group!!
Gaki-san : I'll get a white one for our leader, Takahashi Ai.
Reina : Oh ~
Gaki-san : As for Kamei Eri, her fellow Rokkie member, I'll buy the orange one.
Reina : Mitsui Aika from the 8th generation likes purple.
Gaki-san : I'll go with purple for her then. What about Sayumin?
Reina : Why not get something that's not common? Like brown?
Fujii : Em, excuse me...
Gaki-san : Brown!?
Fujii : There is some evil intention behind it eh?
Gaki-san : Yes, she had the bullying-expression on her face just now.
Reina : (lol)
Gaki-san : I'll get the green watch for her. Who else?
Reina : Linlin and Koharu.
Gaki-san : Red for Koharu.
Reina : Yes.
Gaki-san : As for Linlin...how about yellow? All right, I'm done. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...eh?
Reina : Who's the other girl?
Gaki-san : Wait wait...
Reina : Who is the remaining member?
Gaki-san : Give me a minute...this isn't good...
Reina : Who who? Junjun? Junjun!
Gaki-san : Oh yes, it's Junjun. (Looks at Reina and smiles)
Reina : (Returns the smile)
Gaki-san : Sorry Junjun. What should I choose?
Reina : It's kind of difficult to get 1 for her out of the remaining colours...
Gaki-san : Which should I take?
Fujii : All the remaining colours are pretty dull...
Gaki-san : I think Junjun won't like this one (Eliminates the light blue watch)
Reina : Black then?
Gaki-san : Black? Let's go with black? Junjun is one of the oldest members and since she an adult...black should be suitable.
Reina was incredibly cute on this show. Apart from the watches segment, when Reina went to get herself a paper shredder, Fujii picked up a cheap one which is like a scissors and is used manually. Even before she takes a 2nd look, Reina said "I want one that doesn't need strength to shred." Gaki-san was great too with the Gaki-Reina interaction which reminded me a little of Gaki-Kame with Reina in Eri's role but she wasn't as foolish as our little turtle. Recommended watching!

This center is located at La Pasion, La Paz, Baja California Sur, Mexico. Most of the student’s parents are day laborers who earn less than $8 USD per day. Many of the fathers are addicted to drugs and alcohol, so they do not take care of their families. Their houses are like rough wooden shanties at best. The children were grateful to receive even blankets and thrilled about becoming educated at this Center of HoPE.

Hello, I am a team member that is recently going to start sharing the PI Sound Technology to a group of kids in Mexico. I noticed that few days ago you guys updated some sections of your website (tripurafoundation.org) and i would like to have some of the previous content if possible for reference and to share the key materials to the newly integrated kids down here in Mexico. The material i am referring to was under the hope centers learning center tab, there was an out line of the program and the 12 month schedule for the Personal training program. Last was an image that was under the sounds of HoPE tab.The image has bullets describing the benefits of the Sounds along with images of kids, activated brain and some colorful sound waves, would really help if the material was made available, thanks! Blessings, Marvelous work.The Royal Courts of Justice
This morning I decided to follow one of the walks suggested in Rick Steves' travel guide. I started in front of The Savoy Hotel on The Strand and walked down four or five blocks to St. Paul's Cathedral.
The first sight I passed was the gorgeous, Gothic Royal Courts of Justice where all these importantly busy, proper English barristers and solicitors were scurrying around in their 2000 pound hand tailored suits. The building was so beautiful that I didn't even realize it has a fancy court house. It looked more like a college campus.
Twining's Tea store! It's in the oldest part of The City. It's also the part of the town that was burned down in the Great Fire of London in 1666. Most of the shops and houses were lost, but when they rebuilt the town, they used the same medieval street plan they already had. The shops were long and impossibly narrow, sort of like stacked rows of shotgun houses. There were all these little hidden court yards and winding back streets that aren't really on any map. It was in one of those little court yards that I found the Temple Church. It is the oldest church in London and was founded by the Knights Templar. Dan Brown writes about this church in Angels and Demons. I would have missed it if I hadn't been looking very carefully. Unfortunately, it wasn't open yet! I may can go back this afternoon.
About four shops over from Temple Church there was a plaque that said that this particular building was where Samuel Pepys lived. I remember that in college we were assigned to read Pepys famous diary. I was dreading it because I don't usually like reading nonfiction, and nonfiction written in Shakespeare's convoluted English just seemed like cruel and unusual torture. Boy, was I wrong! Pepys was funny! He made London a real town, not just a historical artifact. He also showed me that people, even Shakespeare, didn't run around talking in Shakespeare to each other. They really talked pretty much the way we do today; well, they did use a few "thees" and "thous" for the people they didn't like too much.
What I wonder is how the people of London live with all this beauty? Everywhere you turn there is another little piece of gorgeousness! I'll be walking along thinking about how my feet hurt or how I would like some barbecue or wondering how the man next door can snore so loudly and not wake himself up, when suddenly I turn a corner and there is an incredible old church or yet another fantastic monument or something famous like London Bridge that I sang songs about as a kid. Londoners seem to live so casually with things that make my jaw drop. It makes me wonder what I'm taking for granted at home that someone with fresh eyes would find amazing. It would probably be our violent thunderstorms or our tornadoes or our massive grocery stores!
Anyway, St. Paul's is where Charles and Lady Diana were married. It much more appropriate for wedding than Westminster, "don't cha fink, darlin'?" Behind the nave was a beautiful chapel built to honor the American soldiers who died during WWII. It was very touching. There are memorials all over town to Americans and American soldiers. I think the British were glad that we joined the war.
One last thing. For lunch I stopped at a chain restaurant called Pret A Manager. It carries nicer than average sandwiches, salads, soups, and some yummy "puddings." Because I have had my fill of sandwiches, I was thrilled when I spied a chicken, jalapeno wrap. I thought, "Hooray! A little taste of home." Well there were peppers in the wrap -- broiled RED PEPPERS! If there was a jalapeno anywhere in that wrap, I sure didn't see it or taste it! The British don't know what hot is, not in food, not in weather!

Hey, Jill don’t judge Riley for his life choices, judge him for his complete lack of morals and horrible personality. I hate Riley but I will fight to the death for his right to love an anthropomorphic dog in exchange for the promise of vague super powers.
I would judge him by his stupidity. His attempts to say something different to the dog and to Jill is laughable considering both obviously hear both.
If this page were to have one more panel in it I think it would show Jill putting that sword to go use.
…oops, I meant to say “good use” not “go use.”
Can someone please put him out of everyone’s misery already?
Well we all know what happened to the last dog champion soooooo.
I concur. Death by king seems the most likely resolution here.
The drama is still being televised all over the tower, right?
This Midori-chan is intriguing. I must have her phone number..
Don’t know if that was an overly wink-y joke that went over my head or not, but the thing she’s half-wearing over there is a sleeve. She’s a guy’s right hand. She’d be hard pressed to hold a phone even with both hands. And even if she picked one up, Seiji would be the one to talk.
P.S. Anime is Midori Days
Ohhh my god I remember that now!
Oh I get the joke now. Hahaha yes, that’s all you’ve got.. your hand.. haaa.. oh it’s true..
… Riley, give it up. Jill ain’t buying what you’re selling.I

oh, YEAH!! Moringa oleifera, and the ONLY time i've ever seen this WONDER of all miraculous trees, itself, was in So. India-Mysore city!! however; i DO see the see pod at least twice/month because i am able to use ONE of its very wonderful edible products which is called "Drumstick." pickle and/or i make a wonderful dinner called drumstick sambhar {preferably i prefer the canned OR fresh drumstick to the pickled one, cuz that way
i can season it to MY liking rather than Patak--an Indian based company which makes 'pickle'd goodies from green mangoes, Moringa seed pods, lemons, limes}. but ANY way i can use this wonderful seed pod, i use it!!! i even use them in "americas" type food.
i heard a rumour that there is a Moringa tree growing at the UNH @ Durham, NH conservatory.. that warms my heart!!
i truly believe that the DFW area of texas is in desperate need of Moringa oleifera trees as they have been suffering a terrible long epic of drought, in MY personal opinion, like Australia, they are experiencing a terrible drought because they'd clear-cut ALL their trees believing they needed the space to plant crops, such as sugar cane, wheat, corn, etc. NOT an equal exchange for trees which ensure RAIN and/or snow!! therefore, once the "rain forest" had been clear-cut... guess what happened?? c'mon... guess!! and now, they must "import" water to give moisture for those crops. do YOU think it was an equal xchange?? but planting a bunch of MORINGAs would truly help the land!!
sorry to make my 'post' so long-but i'm a VERY opinionated person!!I am sure there are mysteries surrounding every War, but the disappearance of the Confederate Treasury is a most interesting conundrum. Maybe some of you blog readers have your own theories about what happened to it, and I would love your comments. Lets go for the gold!
It seems the bulk of the Confederate funds traveled with Confederate President Jefferson Davis in the last days of the War when he left Richmond for Georgia. One account I read said almost all the assets were dispersed to pay soldiers returning home. Whether that is true or not, we know Davis was captured in Irvinville, Georgia, so where was the rest of the money?
The Brantley County Historical and Preservation Society in Nahunta, Georgia has published an interesting article “Whatever Happened to Confederate Gold?“. In this article the case is made that Sylvester Mumford of Waynesville, Georgia was the recipient of much of the gold after Davis’s capture. The article mentions a book by Martha Mizell Puckett entitled “White Sands” in which she tells the following tale about Davis’s last cabinet meeting in the home of Robert Tooms in Washington, Georgia. “All the Gold of the Confederacy was divided among the members of the meeting, and each one would fend for himself and would use the money as he felt it should be used”. Mumford was at that meeting.
After the War Mumford built an industrial home for orphans and also gave a great deal of help to the Presbyterian home for orphans at Clinton, SC.. We know for sure a lot of money passed through his hands. His daughter too, later invested and reaped well, and it is reported in the article that her personal lawyer was asked by her about what she should do with the “remainder of the Confederate Gold”.
Again, tell me what you think? My good friend and historian Richard has already told me he thought the money went with Judah Benjamin. There is a good case for that for sure!One of my favourite films as a teenager was The Mummy and its increasingly ridiculous sequels. The films were over the top fun that never disappointed in their epic over the top action sequences, with quippy one liners and an absurd plot. The films are a testament to their time and turned Brendan Fraser into an action movie star and introduced the world to Dwayne Johnson “The Rock” (who could ever forget that horrible CGI!) Now Universal want to cash in on the cinematic universe trend and have officially started their Dark Universe (look out Warner Bros. are coming for you!) with the first film in the franchise The Mummy.
This time around Tom Cruise is cast as the lead Nick Morton, a treasure hunter profiting off Isis destroying ancient artifacts. When he steals a map from a one night encounter, he accidentally uncovers a hidden tomb belonging to Princess Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella), who was cursed for her crimes in a bloody flashback scene. Once set free she sets across the land sucking the life out of others and creating zombie servants. She chases Nick to London to unite a jewel and dagger that were separated in the Crusades as she believes that the God of Death will come to life through Nick and rage war upon the Earth.
The first half of the movie works, it has the silliness that the Mummy movies demands but with some beefed up CGI and action sequences it moves along quite well. That is until Universal step in and demand the establishing of their Dark Universe and the rest of the movie turns to rubbish. In walks Russell Crowe as Dr Henry Jekyll (yes that one!) and introduces Nick and his guide Jenny (Annabelle Wallis) to his Monster-arium in which he captures, studies and imprisons Gods and Monsters to save the world from evil. It sounds cool on paper, but the change of pace that it introduced to the movie that was meant to be The Mummy irritated me a lot.
This didn’t add anything to the story of The Mummy, it didn’t help or enhance the story, it instead veered away from it and brought about a mediocre second half and ending that stopped this from being a great action movie. The whole thing could have been introduced in the Jekyll and Hyde film that we are no doubt going to see. Crowe was great as the iconic character, however the whole premise did not fit in with the Mummy movie and was a waste.
Visually the film delivered, the updated CGI effects are a massive step forward from the Scorpion King from The Mummy Returns. Ahmunet herself had a lot of make up and costume effects that helped her character look real and less CGI (especially that double pupil CGI thing that looked odd) Cruise is not at his best her, this film required comedic timing, and while he has shown that he can do this previously in films like Tropic Thunder, it fell flat in this film and makes you realise the comedic genius that Brendan Fraser was.
Overall this film disappointed me, it was set to launch a shared universe and whole it tried, I can’t help but think studio interference forced the story to crash half way through and become a world building film instead of a great stand alone. I fear if it was the Invisible Man or even Frankenstein you could probably get away with it, but The Mummy has had the most recent remake and had a service to its fanbase that it did not deliver.
Is it too late to re-cast Tom Cruise? Please Universal? PLEASE
The Mummy is in cinemas now.
Review by Alaisdair LeithOne evening browsing the internets, I came across a t-shirt printed with a slogan: Zero is Not a Size. It was a quote from a TV show a while back, and has since grown some legs, judging by the number of results my quick Google search returned.
On the surface, this may seem like a good thing. To say that pop culture promotes an impossibly narrow (pun intended) standard of female attractiveness is to completely understate the issues women face with regards to body image. So, to counter all those negative feelings, I can totally get on board with an empowering, body-positive statement that tells pop culture to stuff it.
This is not it. "Zero is not a size" misses the point. If zero isn't a size, then what is the person wearing that size? Nothing? No one? Zero?
Imagine a slogan like "3XL is not a size," for people concerned with the current obesity epidemic in this country. For sure, obesity is a problem (as are eating disorders), but shaming an entire group of people because you disapprove of their body type is condescending and unproductive.
"Zero is not a size" also implies that if a person is currently wearing this size, they must be following some dreadful starvation diet in order to maintain it. Size is just a number; it is not an accurate indicator of health. I'm sure whoever created this slogan was well-meaning, but unfortunately it's stuff like this that keeps those old narrow standards of attractiveness alive.The race to become lead the party is now shaping up to be a tilt between Barrie MP Patrick Brown and Deputy Leader Christine Elliott. Some see that as a contest between an outsider candidate to the Ontario PCs in Brown and the establishment candidate in Elliott.
McNaughton threw his support behind Brown, but it is Elliott, the widow of former finance minister Jim Flaherty, who has the majority of support with sitting MPPs.
McNaughton was a distant third in membership sales and fundraising. He says Brown has "the energy and ability" to reform the Tories, who lost the last four Ontario elections.
Brown quickly took a shot at Elliott as the favoured candidate of the PC establishment, saying the race is now "a choice between the same old, same old, and a fresh start to rebuild the party."
Brown surprised everyone by selling some 41,000 PC memberships, but the Elliott campaign says their support is much broader and based across the entire province.
Elliott fired back at Brown, calling him untested.
"Progressive Conservatives can choose my positive, pragmatic and truly progressive conservative vision that will resonate with all Ontarians and win the next election," she says. "Or they can choose Patrick Brown, an untested candidate with nothing more to offer than a life lived as a career politician."
Elliott did not stop there, going on to say Brown has done nothing as a politician. "Worse yet, over the course of his time spent in office he has done little of significance and has no substantive record," she says.
All PC party members are eligible to vote for the new leader on May 3 and 7, with the results to be announced at a convention in Toronto on May 9.Tag Archives: counselling Taunton anxiety help

In less than 2 months, the Town Shop will be celebrating its 40th birthday! A rather remarkable milestone (particularly under the same leadership). Back in early 1971, the prediction was “this will last two, maybe three years, tops”. Not that it’s been easy. Economic tides, funding ebbs and flows, changes in leadership in public and elected office, all of these factors and more leave a backdrop of subtle insecurity. Last year offers a current example as the nation’s economic struggles, funding streams and every level of government are propelled towards austerity, and many young people find personal and family resources dwindling. It’s a tribute to the Camillus community that somehow, some way, a path forward has always been blazed. The merit and value of this endeavor is easily observed by anyone willing to spend thirty minutes perusing photos in the dozens of galleries on here and on our Facebook page.
Here are some highlights:
- Seva (Samaritan Center) Wednesdays 3pm
- Seva (Sunshine Horse Rescue) Saturdays 9am
- Open Mic 1/16 7pm
- Showcase Concert A Weekend Romance 1/30 7pm
- Cross Country Ski/Snowshoe (Beaver Lake) 1/17 4pm
- Cross Country Ski/Snowshoe (Highland Forest) 1/31 10am
- Eating Our Way Around The World Eva’s European Sweets (Poland) 1/8 12pm

8 thoughts on “Twitter Trends”
I am gonna have to disagree with Twitter trends being more relevant then Google. Are there actually more people on Twitter then there are searching on Google? I would be surprised if that was a yes.
With Twitter searches you can see real time data of how many are talking about what, but even at that Trends updates every hour. Sure Trends isn’t exactly what people are talking about per say but it is what they are searching. Which is basically the same thing if you ask me.
Jarret, I don’t recall saying they were more relevant?
I said more indicative.
And “what topics are being talked about”, not what topics are being searched.
I just looked, maybe you are right, #1 in Google Trends is “antinori wines” and #1 on Twitter is “Obama”, lol
I just love how you can make a point across in less than 100 words when typically it would take me 1000.
Excellent point David. I am have been having tons of fun using Twitter Search and it has been very entertaining to see what people talk about on Twitter. And indeed, what people talk about on Twitter is much different than what people search for at the moment on Google.
So many random elements can affect Google Trends such as people wanting to look up a particular show time, or see the results for the UFC Fight.
With Twitter, people talk about things going on in their lives or at their job, etc…
There is quite a bit of traffic that can be scored from Twitter and more importantly quite a bit of really nice friends that you can make. I am really starting to see how Twitter can be a very effective place for multiple aspects of business as well as leisure.
All the hype about Twitter being a useless time waster comes from people who really don’t know how to harness its quick and aggressive growth. One can’t question why certain things are the way they are. It’s really simple math. Twitter has traffic and there are very obvious and simply ways to capitalize on it.
Hey, do you mind installing the Subscribe To Comments plugin so that I can get an email when someone else comments on your posts?
I’m loving this! To be honest, I never thought to use Twitter for this purpose but it makes so much sense. I mean, much higher potential for dependable, organic information that’s not over-calculated or gathered through madly complex algorithms. Great article- thank you.
@Garry, I added the Comment Subscription plugin, not sure it is the one you recommend, but I am sure you will let me know.
We may have to start a Twitter Anonymous club for us Twitter junkies, lol
@BrilliantJeni, Thanks, I agree, nothing like unfiltered organic information!
Yes! You got the right plugin… That is just very handy to have. I always check the box on places I comment on… I’ll get an email if someone adds to the discussion in a future comment. Thanks for installing. 😉

Canada mocked its own greenhouse-gas reduction targets before, and it’s mocking them again. The Harper government has a target of a 17-per-cent reduction from 2005 by 2020. The Environment Department’s own figures, released in July, showed that emissions have risen by 7 per cent since the Conservatives took office.
No one – not senior civil servants, not foreign diplomats, not academics, not even people in the oil and gas industry – believes Canada will bring down its emissions by 24 per cent (17 per cent plus 7 per cent) in the next eight years. Canada struts on the world stage, naked as a newt, and can’t fool those who know what’s really going on.
It’s easy to mock Kyoto. It failed to halt the upward surge in emissions for many reasons, the most important being that global warming represents the classic example of the tragedy of the commons. That tragedy – well-known to students of human psychology, international relations and economics – means that, when all degrade something held in common, the temptation exists for none to accept responsibility. Every contributor to the degradation finds reasons for inaction.
It’s said, for example, that since Canada “only”, “Sorry,?
To put the argument this way is to see how false it rings against our traditions of responsible international participation..”
The argument that Canada’s oil comes from a more virtuous place than Libya under Moammar Gadhafi or Venezuela under Hugo Chavez would be like saying Canada’s human-rights records is “ethical” because it is better than North Korea’s, or our economy is “ethical” because it’s fairer and more productive than Zimbabwe’s.
The 2-per-cent and “ethical” oil arguments, therefore, represent perversions of principles on which to base international participation. They insult Canada’s history and traditions, but they play exceptionally well with a certain segment of the Canadian public.. They read the anti-global-warming newspapers and commentators, and they rely on the handful of academics who debunk global warming.
The poll numbers suggest that about half of Stephen Harper’s supporters are climate-change deniers and skeptics. His government pays heed to this core, the world and its climate be damned.

In the new draft-in-production, the bubble is either square or circular to denote containment or reference. This distinction could easily be made. If we imagine the document icons on the right, then a triangle/arrow takes you to a refeenced document, whereas a bubble takes you to a contained document. It is possible that we should not even have both contained and referenced documents in Release 1.0; it is possible we should only have referenced documents. Thinking in terms of exemplars, if we can only do one, it should be contained documents. Thus, our frontend demonstrates a feature that none else can do, and one that we want our developers to understand. However, I would like to have a clear upgrade path to contained documents, since we will surely want the distinction either in a later release or in a power-user's version (InfoFactory Professional?). We need to discuss containment vs. reference. I would expect 'professional' users to be far more likely than 'amateurs' to use the reference model, so again, the baseline should be containment. The bottom line on this is that we will eventually need an icon the size of the original bubble icon, somewhere on the screen. What we eliminate by moving the open-document operation to the dot is NOT the bubble, but rather the dot, which was pretty inoffensive anyway. You're almost right. The main thing we did was disassociate the icon from the outline structure. In retrospect, that was the primary thing that bothered me about it. We also "fix" it so that, when you single-click to put a check-mark in the icon spot, you wipe out the indicator of whether the document is contained or referenced--a minor inelegance. You also lose the indicator of whether the document is empty or not--another minor inelegance. But a lot of little inelegances add up to a considerable inelegance. This was one of the exercises for the reader. Forget checkmarks. We just represent selection in the obvious way of reversing the icon (or outlining it, or...). This is the BEST case; we still have to deal with other parent-only operations besides open-document. I came up with some other ways of dealing with this. I still don't know what you want this for. Until I do, I can't integrate it nicely with the rest of the design. On the opposing side, we can observe that no existing outliners have parent-only operations. Being merely as good as everything else in the world would be a big comedown :-) Another reasonable observation is that parent-only operations are not frequent. However, when you want one, you want it really bad. This won't be true if we have the right set of other operations. Many many people out there really hate outliners (roger is our best local example). How much of that hatred is caused by the following sensation? On those rare occasions when you DO want a parent-only operation, it provokes surprisingly fierce anger, because you can SEE what you want to do, it's RIGHT THERE staring at you, but YOU CAN'T DO IT. Instead of just grabbing the parent and yanking it to the right place, you must first select all the children, drag them up to the adjacent parent, and THEN move the sucker. Needless to say, people make frequent errors--they grab the parent, then remember that the children are coming along for the ride. So they then reposition the parent, and THEN follow the "legal" sequence. This still happens to me, anyway. How often are these operations in which you want to promote/demote items without changes the veritcal location of any of their children/siblings? If that's not sufficient, then we still have an advatnage by being able to easily select sets of children. You move the entire family, then select all the children (a quick click and drag) and move them back to the parent or sibling with which you wan them associated. This has the advantage that we don't make policy decisions about wehre the orphaned shildren should be placed. Outliners earned their reputation for being too rigid with just such clever behavior. I am desperate to make our system more flexible than basic outliners, for this among other reasons. The outline metaphor should add capabilities, not constraints. Good philosophy. I would still like a specific example. 3) Assuming we will do single-header movement, how do we represent it? a) Use a command-selection to get the parent alone. This brings up a philosophical point: I do not believe that command-selection works under hardly any circumstances. It is possible that More HAS such a command selection to manipulate the header, I wouldn't know, because I gave up trying to use the sucker without trying this invisible possibility. Making it a command selection is marginally different from not implementing it. I disagree. You have a particularly strong aversion to shift keys. If the documentation is adequate, then it should be easy to find. If we use such extra selection bits sparingly, they should be easy to find. I'm not advocating such practices, but for infrequent or specialixzaed operations, they don't seem so abhorrent. b) Expand the parent's triangle icon when there are children, making 2 regions, one region for the family handle, one region for the parent-only handle. I like some characteristics of the concept--the parent-only distinction only appears when there is a family there to drive a distinction. I am uncomfortable with it in some way, but I can't articulate the issue at the moment; I'll need to think on it. Anyway, using this approach, combining it with the earlier discussion, our net reduction in visual complexity with the new approach is that we got rid of the column of small dots and now have occasional oversize icons here and there in the view. There are many measures of complexity. A major source of complexity in the first design was having the triangle and the bubble in the same location. I could never keep straight which was for which, and there were no layout hints with which to figure it out. The rearrangement saves us a lot more than a single icon. With the above proposal, the shape remains the same , but it's real clear what selecting each icon should do (if it's not obvious, then it's certainly mnemonic). 4) Looking at the new approach from a meta-view, it appears to me that the main focus of this current proposal is a desperate effort to reduce the triangle-plus-bubble next to the headline to one icon, no matter what the consequences are for the rest of the screen. This pair of icons obviously bothers everyone else more than it bothers me. In my own mind's eye, the triangle and bubble DO merge together, only to be resolved when needed. Not quite. The set of distinction made visible by the two icons are not quite right. I am really inclined to believe the best solution is to find a pair of icons that will seem to blend together in normal human vision much as this pair blends together in mine. I will put together a couple of proposals. I'll believe it when I see it. I don't think they exist in general. 5) for making documents, we could just have a menu with items that make links of some type to documents of some type. It might be possible to make this extensible externally.mxwebsites™ logo vector

Separately, BCA also announced a revised Green and Gracious Builder Scheme for larger firms.
Straits Construction, which is developing a residential project in Kovan, has put up natural and high tech sound barriers to minimise the noise generated. It has also put up special netting to minimise dust from reaching the surrounding neighbourhood.
The company also sends its staff around the neighbourhood on a regular basis to get residents’ feedback on issues ranging from trucks blocking the streets to dust.
Beyond that, it also looks inwards to focus on the welfare of its 350 or so workers. This includes building a gym, reading area and even a vegetable garden where workers can grow produce.
For its efforts, the company has been awarded the “Star” rating at this year’s Green and Gracious Builder Award. It is one of 21 builders recognised for its efforts, and will receive its award on May 22.
The features at this construction site are some of the ways BCA said larger firms can implement the human resource touch into their gracious practices. In fact, it is an enhanced feature in the revised scheme.
The revised Green and Gracious Builder Scheme will become mandatory progressively from 2015 onwards.
Larger construction firms wanting to take on public sector projects will need to be certified under the scheme in order to register or renew their registration. BCA expects some 400 firms to be certified under this scheme by 2016.
However, BCA acknowledges some of the criteria under this scheme may not be relevant to smaller firms, hence the need for a separate scheme.
Dr John Keung, CEO of the BCA, said: “Take for example, a site office. When you are working on a big construction project, you need a site office. But if you’re just building one bungalow or two terrace houses, you don’t need a big site office. So there is no issue of using energy-efficient lighting or air-conditioning for your site office.”
As for challenges faced by smaller firms in implementing features to mitigate noise and dust, it is all about planning ahead. Tan Soon Kian, managing director of Unison Construction, said: “You need to price this into the tender so that at least during the construction, you don’t say (you’re) out of budget because you’ve already provisioned for this measure.”
Residents said having a good working relationship benefits all parties.
Pok Chye Heng, a Kovan resident, said: “They will be here for at least two to three years. So the relationship is just like (one with) a neighbour. If you have a bad neighbour, every day you will face problems and more problems (will be introduced). If the relationship is not good, you will try to pinpoint issues and it’ll take more time to solve the problems.”
Mr Pok said it is less time consuming when there is an open channel of discussion with those involved.

FILM REVIEW: GEORGIA RULE
By Michael Wilmington
Chicago Tribune Movie Critic
2 stars
In "Georgia Rule," director Garry Marshall and writer Mark Andrus introduce us to three generations of women thrown together in a small, largely Mormon, Idaho town. In descending order, they are feisty grandma Georgia Randall (Jane Fonda), ex-alcoholic San Francisco-based Lilly (Felicity Huffman) and Lilly's rebellious, hell-raising daughter Rachel (Lindsay Lohan) - who has become such a troublemaker that Lilly sends her to live with Grandma Georgia in Hull (rhymes with "dull") for a while.
Georgia's home is a place of unbendable rules (hence the title) and unshakable proprieties. You swear, and your mouth is immediately washed out with soap. And you cross Georgia or do dirt by her daughter and granddaughter, and you get creamed with a baseball bat.
Eventually Lilly shows up, too, after a shocking revelation. So does Rachel's slick stepfather, Arnold (Cary Elwes), and the emotional fireworks keep exploding, with all three ladies scoring some touching or amusing moments. Those three roles are certainly well enough played by the movie's all-star trio. Unfortunately I couldn't buy any of them.
Maybe that's because writer Andrus, who grew up in a small Idaho town himself, often uses his characters for social points (sex and four-letter words aren't so bad, but cruelty and hypocrisy are) rather than to plumb real human traits and eccentricities. He's a blue-state guy paying homage to his old red-state roots, trying with Marshall to turn the show into a melange of red, white and blue sentimentality. I wish they'd succeeded.
The moviemakers do manage to give their stars a lot of big, actress-y moments where they can scream, cry, laugh or make startling confessions. The movie starts in high emotional gear and stays there, with Rachel and Lilly blasting away verbally at each other on the road before Rachel hitchhikes alone to Hull. In Idaho, Rachel, amazingly (and unknowingly) gets a ride from her mother's old beau, Simon the brooding, sexy veterinarian-doctor (Dermot Mulroney).
She also immediately meets Harlan, a hunky Mormon teen (Garrett Hedlund). Harlan will become her only friend in Hull, where the teenage girls are priggish snoops and the teenage boys, including Harlan, are apparently virgins. Nevertheless, the sexually active Rachel, who arrives with full makeup, a batch of novels, a knowledge of Ezra Pound and Bob Dylan, and a wardrobe that looks like, well, Lindsay Lohan's (at least as we imagine it), starts making waves. Everybody tends to gawk and gape at Rachel's duds, as if they'd never seen anything similar on TV.
Yet, no sooner does the Frisco rebel get into an argument with Georgia than the old lady scorches her with our most common four-letter sexual cuss word. It struck me as madly out of character, and this tendency to go for shocks and too-quick laughs often undermines the picture's more serious intent.
I didn't like the movie much, but I've got to admit that Marshall has a knack for this kind of thing. He knows how to play with audiences, even with a script that stretches everything too far. When Lohan's Rachel blurts out the secret that sets off most of the melodrama, it's in a confab with Simon, whom she barely knows. When she introduces Harlan to decidedly non-religious activities in his boat, she barely knows him either. But what's there to know?
Fonda smartly continues her recent comeback; she and Huffman are crafty actresses who hurl themselves into the emotional hurly-burly and make something of it. Lohan (who got bad press on this shoot) is less lucky in her teen femme fatale/emotional victim part, which seems to have been designed to let her run wild on screen and still gain our sympathy.
Maybe "Georgia Rule" should be required viewing for Paris Hilton during her term in the slammer. But not for us.

Production Information
"What do you think the rules were?
Why would I waste my time on someone I didn't care about?"
-Georgia, Mean Girls, A Prairie Home Companion) screams, swears, drinks, says whatever is on her mind and is just generally uncontrollable. With her latest car crash, Rachel has broken the final rule in mom Lilly's (Golden Globe winner FELICITY HUFFMAN, Transamerica, television's Desperate Housewives) San Francisco home. With nowhere else to take the impulsive and rambunctious girl, Lilly hauls her daughter to the one place she swore she'd never return...her own mother's Idaho home.
Matriarch Georgia (two-time Oscar® winner JANE FONDA, Monster-in-Law, 9 to 5) (The Family Stone, The Wedding Date) as Lilly's old flame, Simon; CARY ELWES (Saw, The Princess Bride) as Lilly's husband and Rachel's stepfather, Arnold; and GARRETT HEDLUND (Four Brothers, Friday Night Lights) as the simple country boy who catches Rachel's eye, Harlan.
The creative team bringing Georgia Rule to the screen includes frequent Marshall collaborators: cinematographer KARL WALTER LINDENLAUB (The Princess Diaries, Maid in Manhattan); editors BRUCE GREEN (Runaway Bride, Just Like Heaven) and TARA TIMPONE (Raising Helen, Blonde Ambition); production designer ALBERT BRENNER (Beaches, The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement); costume designer GARY JONES (Raising Helen, Spider-Man 2); and composer JOHN DEBNEY (The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement, Evan Almighty).
Georgia Rule is written by MARK ANDRUS (Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, As Good as It Gets) and produced by JAMES G. ROBINSON (The Good Shepherd, Man of the Year) and DAVID ROBINSON (The Good Shepherd, Two For the Money). The film's executive producers are GUY MCELWAINE (The Good Shepherd), MICHAEL BESMAN (About Schmidt) and KEVIN REIDY (Ever After).
ABOUT THE PRODUCTION
Creating the Rules:
Georgia is Born
"Everyone's savable. That's the rule."
-Georgia
Screenwriter Mark Andrus wanted to craft a script that told the tale of a place and a people he knew intimately: rural Idaho. The co-writer of James Brooks' As Good as It Gets, Andrus grew up in a Mormon family, and he hoped to realistically portray that world of deep spiritual devotion, hard work and close family...and the humor that comes from the interplay. Georgia Rule was that story.
Morgan Creek CEO and one of the film's producers, James G. Robinson, was interested in developing a project that wasn't cookie cutter in its approach; he responded to the dynamics among the strong personalities of Andrus' screenplay. "Anyone who's been married or raised daughters understands what goes on between these women, particularly if the girl is a teenager. I thought it would be a lot of fun to produce this, and everything fell into place. Mark wrote a great script. We had Jane Fonda, Felicity Huffman and Lindsay Lohan to star, and Garry Marshall to direct. All three bases were covered: good story, good director, good cast."
Garry Marshall recalls that he was curious to work on a movie that explored forgiveness and "trusting what your child says." Marshall says, "Usually, I do comedy/drama. Georgia Rule is drama/comedy, so it was a new switch for me." His interest in the material was not selfless, however. As he admits, "It's nice to work with beautiful women who can act and have talent."
Marshall says that he has always felt a knack at eliciting solid performances from actors of a younger generation, and he felt this project would be no exception. "From Julia who was 22 in Pretty Woman to Anne who was 18 in Princess Diaries-and here's Lindsay, 20, right in the middle of my picture-I seem to understand them."
The story arc of the main protagonist, Rachel Wilcox, intrigued the director. Andrus had written a hot-headed wild child who was out of control in her San Francisco home. Her disruptions had finally led her mother to drag her kicking and screaming to a tiny, boring town in Idaho for some much needed grandmotherly discipline. Marshall liked the fact that this 18-year-old granddaughter would test everyone.
"Rachel goes to this small town in Idaho called Hull," the director notes. "I made up the town name, because Hull rhymes with dull, and that's what she's looking forward to in this place."
Fictional town, shooting script and financing in place, it was time to cast three women who could give performances that would draw laughs and tears from the audience. Enter Jane Fonda, Lindsay Lohan and Felicity Huffman.
Casting the Film
"You don't look evil."
-Rachel
"Makeup helps."
-Georgia
First attached to the project was Lindsay Lohan. The actor had made her mark in a string of successful comedies over the past decade, but she began widening her range with key roles in 2006's Bobby and A Prairie Home Companion. Recalls Lohan of her attraction to the part of Rachel: "The script reminded me of Ann-Margret's character in one of my favorite films, Kitten With a Whip. She was very Lolita-esque as well."
Lohan was curious to understand Rachel's choices and what landed her in Hull- friendless, desperately hurt and seething mad. "Rachel doesn't understand the difference between love and sex in a lot of ways," she reflects. "I think it's important to play a character so any girl or boy that has ever gone through a situation like this can hopefully learn from."
Lohan had actually worked on a Garry Marshall film before, but in the case of The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement, she lent her vocal talents to the soundtrack, singing "I Decide" for the comedy.
Of the chance to work with Oscar® winner Fonda, Lohan was a bit starstruck. The actor laughs, "I dressed as her in Barbarella for Halloween one year...it's a very small world. I just feel very lucky to work with people I've always admired."
After Lohan signed on, Robinson convinced Marshall to become attached to Georgia Rule. Soon, the director, producers and the casting director would choose the other players, starting with Jane Fonda and Felicity Huffman. Robinson relates, "I feel that part of the reason the chemistry was right was because each of the three women understand and play their characters so well."
Jane Fonda (oddly enough, a Georgia resident) chose the role of the title character as a chance to work with Marshall and bring writer Andrus' words to the screen. With her hit Monster-in-Law recently under her belt, the actor was certainly back and at the top of her game. Producer Robinson believes, "Jane came onboard because she believed in the role, she liked Garry Marshall and she liked the challenge of working on this movie."
Fonda notes, "Mark observes characters beautifully, and this is a character-driven story about three generations of women who are all multidimensional. They have humor as well as pathos and depth."
She appreciated the fact that though Georgia "didn't know how to be a mother to her daughter, she's ready to be a better grandmother. I'm a grandmother now, and I know how very often as parents we can find it easier to be intimate with other people than with our own children. Sometimes grandchildren provide us with a second chance.
"Georgia's been pretty happy for 13 years," Fonda continues. "So there she is, quite happy with her rules and, suddenly everything falls apart. The two other generations of women intrude on her life, and the ghosts of the past come back to be healed."
Fonda was also impressed by the caliber of talent that came with her on-screen granddaughter. She compliments, "Lindsay's raw and has an ability to access her emotions that's very beautiful. She's made me cry several times when I gave her the offstage lines; she's very moving."
The role of Lilly, Rachel's alcoholic mother and Georgia's distant daughter, went to Felicity Huffman. It was a challenge for the actor, who was simultaneously filming her television show Desperate Housewives during the weekdays. Notes Huffman, "I thought the characters were rich and true and three-dimensional and funny and heartbreaking."
She found working with the women who played her daughter and mother especially moving. Of Fonda's acting camaraderie, Huffman commends, "Here's a woman that has a resume as long as my body and two Academy Awards® and she comes in and asks me, `What do you think?'"
Lindsay Lohan would also strike her as powerful. The actor remarks, "Lindsay moves from being dangerous to wounded. You're always waiting to see where it's going to come from. That's a great game to play when it almost turns into emotional improv."
The theater-trained performer had fans of her own on set. Cary Elwes, who plays Lilly's odious husband and Rachel's nemesis, Arnold, remembers, "Felicity is an extraordinary actor. She always manages to bring a wonderful level of strength and fragility to her roles. She is also fearless, and that is always fun to play off."
For the character of Simon, the filmmakers cast actor Dermot Mulroney, (a fellow Northwestern University alum of director Marshall). The director notes, "We were looking for a Sam Shepard-type, and Dermot fell into this role. Simon becomes in Rachel's life what her father who ran away didn't become."
Simon plays veterinarian to the wounded animals and family physician to the sick citizens of Hull, Idaho. To prepare for the part, Mulroney was actually given a brief tutoring lesson on basic medicine. The actor offers, "I received a `how to fake doing the stitches' lesson, so I'm pretty good on that."
Veteran actor Cary Elwes was brought in to play Arnold. Of casting a performer to play a distasteful character, Marshall admits, "It is a tough role, so a number of actors avoided it. And lo and behold, Cary Elwes came and was quite good. He wasn't afraid of it. He said, `Let me try it,' and he made contributions to the script I thought were excellent."
Elwes was interested in the script because he felt the "main themes of this story are really secrets and lies. And it is common knowledge that families that harbor these inevitably provide a breeding ground for dysfunction. Arnold is a perfect example of someone who, being weak himself, exploits weakness in others."
Finally, newcomer Garrett Hedlund was cast as Harlan, the naive boy who doesn't know what to make of Rachel and her charms. Hedlund hails from the region of the country where George Rule is set and could easily relate to the farm boy. Of his character's growing relationship with Rachel, Hedlund comments: "It's the red zone for Harlan...he can't go there. He's got a girl, and he's about to be married. This is out-ofbounds territory."
Casting completed with such favorites as longtime Marshall friends Hector Elizondo and Laurie Metcalf in key supporting roles, it was time to start filming. Marshall dryly jokes, "When in doubt, you bring in friends and relatives; you can always pick on relatives. Nepotism is a part of my work."
Jane Fonda best synopsizes the cast and crew's strong draw to the story. She explains: "Imagine this quiet, sleepy town in Idaho-a town where everybody knows everybody. The boys are all virgins until they get married, and they go away to do their mission work for the Mormon Church. Suddenly, this creature from outer space appears. Nobody's seen anything like her, and it's hard to know what to make of her because she's also smart and funny and provocative and outrageous."
120 Degrees in the Shade: Filming Georgia
"And then it dawned on me, just a while ago, that the only weapon I have left- I've used every other-is my love for you."
-Lilly
Georgia Rule was filmed on location throughout Southern California. From the foothills of Monrovia in the San Gabriel Valley and Santa Paula in Ventura County to Stage 7 at the Sunset and Gower Studios in Hollywood and the city of Chatsworth in the San Fernando Valley outside of Los Angeles, key locales were selected to create the fictitious city of Hull.
While scheduling requirements for the actors necessitated that the shoot remain close to Los Angeles, Marshall and his production crew needed a place with lakes and mountains that could mirror the beauty of a simple hometown in the Midwest. They found that in Mount Wilson in the San Gabriel Valley and Franklin Canyon Lake, in the heart of the city of Los Angeles.
Dermot Mulroney offers, "Once you're an hour outside of the city, some of these countrysides are really rugged and remote. With the mountains in the background, they look as much like a country road as the country roads in Idaho do."
Much of the action of the film takes place in Simon's veterinary-human doctor's office, where Rachel's grandmother puts her to work. Country and simple in scope, Simon's office reflects the types of patients he serves, with pictures of hunting dogs, children's artwork and school trophies littered about.
Simon's bachelor pad is as simple as his office, yet indicative of his life as a widower. With cheap impressionist reprints, unfinished jigsaw puzzles on the tables and well-worn remembrances of his dead wife and child allowing him to hold on to the past, the second-floor condo is lifeless...until Rachel arrives.
Rachel and Lilly find themselves temporarily housed at 247 Hillview Street, Georgia Randall's home that Lilly left 13 years earlier. Georgia's well-tended garden, porch-complete with rustic swing-and lush ferns serve as exterior to her two-story bungalow.
As the younger women walk into the interior of Georgia's house, they see little has changed in her world since the time Lilly left. Records from Glen Campbell to The Four Lads are played nightly. Georgia still showcases her vases and Bluebirds of Happiness collection, and the same mosaic-print table runners fill her living and dining rooms. The kitchen is simple and plain, complete with placards reminding us to "Count Your Blessings" and plants, including mother-in-law's tongues (irony intended), lining the shelves.
Rachel will spend much of this summer of renewal in her mom's room. Just as she has in the rest of her cottage, Georgia hasn't changed much since Lilly left home all those years ago. From the Janis Joplin and Doors posters on the wall to the clown figurines Lilly collected as a girl, the room remains a quiet memorial to the child who once lived there.
Fonda remarks, "One of the stars of the show is small-town America. Some people might feel claustrophobic in it, but I think it works magic on this young girl who's so lost."
One unwelcome star was the overpowering heat that became another cast member during the shoot. Lindsay Lohan laughs of the scene that opens the film: "It was 120 degrees outside! I'm walking barefoot outside on really hot pavement in a desert, and Felicity is in the scene in a Mercedes with the air conditioning on."
Felicity Huffman agrees with her on-screen daughter about the outrageous temperature. "It was 120 degrees! We were way up in the Sierras, and everyone was dying. Then there's Garry, with his Popsicle, moving around for 15-hour days and directing brilliantly."
The temperatures would prove unbearable at times, but the director felt it added to the camaraderie on set...though he drops the mercury by a few degrees. "A 110-degree heat! Even the most temperamental people tend to gather together in the shade. It was a shade-related melding of this cast, because they were so hot they would stand under anything that gave them relief."
With no on-set casualties from a 2006 summer shoot in sunny Southern California, the production would wrap with crew and cast temperatures sufficiently cooled. Marshall took it all in stride. "I like to be the kind of person who stands at the edge of the cliff," he comments, "and I let them all try things. If they're going to fall off the cliff, then I say, `No, don't go there.'"
****
Three generations of women came together to film this story, and it is fitting that the senior member of their group concludes our notes with her reflections on her character: "I've been around long enough so that I can see through the faade, and I can see in this wild granddaughter of mine something that's worth saving," Fonda says. "She's basically a good girl, but she's just lost it. And I feel the way her mother intuitively does."
Of his hopes for his picture, director Marshall concludes: "I did a picture years ago called Nothing in Common, with Jackie Gleason and Tom Hanks; it was about a father-son relationship. And wherever I traveled people said, `You know, after I saw that, I called my father. I haven't talked to him in 10 years, but I called up my father.' I hope Georgia Rule will bring families a little closer together. Call the grandma. Call the mother. Call the daughter. She's not really the worst child in the history of the world."

Morgan Creek Records' debut album, the original motion picture soundtrack from Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, sold in excess of three million units worldwide. The Bryan Adams single from the soundtrack, "(Everything I Do) I Do It For You," became a phenomenon, reaching No. year's highest-grossing comedies and made Carrey an overnight star. The following year, Carrey reprised his role in the hit sequel, Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls, which opened to a record weekend of $41 million.
In 2004, Morgan Creek entered into a multiyear.
Robinson was honored as Producer of the Year at the 1996 National Association of Theatre Owners' ShoWest Awards.

<img src="" height="1" width="1" border="0" alt="" />ARCHIVED - Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2015: Part 1 applications posted on 31 October 2014
Ottawa, 8 July 2015
Cogeco Diffusion inc. and RNC MEDIA Inc.
Gatineau, Quebec
Applications 2014-0774-2, 2014-0773-4 and 2014-0985-5
CKOF-FM and CHLX-FM Gatineau - Local sales agreements
The Commission approves the joint applications by Cogeco Diffusion inc. and RNC MEDIA Inc. to amend their respective licences to add a condition of licence authorizing them to operate their French-language commercial radio stations CKOF-FM and CHLX-FM Gatineau in accordance with a local sales agreement.
Listeners will benefit from the continued presence of the two stations and of their positive impact on the diversity of voices in the bilingual market of Ottawa-Gatineau.
A dissenting opinion by Commissioner Raj Shoan is attached to this decision.
Applications
- Cogeco Diffusion inc. (Cogeco) and RNC MEDIA Inc. (RNC) filed applications to amend the licences for their respective French-language commercial radio stations, CKOF-FM and CHLX-FM Gatineau, to operate the stations in accordance with a local sales agreement (LSA).
- Cogeco and RNC indicated that these applications are necessary to improve the financial situation of these two stations. Currently, Cogeco owns one station in the Ottawa-Gatineau market, namely CKOF-FM, while RNC owns CHLX-FM and CFTX-FM in that market. In 2014, CHLX-FM converted to the Rythme FM network.
- Cogeco and RNC are experienced radio broadcasters. Cogeco and RNC respectively operate 13 and 14 stations in Quebec, including successful stations in the Montréal and Québec markets.
Regulatory framework
- In the policy on local management agreements (Broadcasting Public Notice 2005-10), the Commission determined that LSAs fall within the definition of a local management agreement (LMA). This definition is set out in the Radio Regulations, 1986 (the Regulations) and reads as follows:
Arrangement, contract, understanding or agreement between two or more licensees or their associates that relates, directly or indirectly, to any aspect of the management, administration or operation of two or more stations, at least two of which
- broadcast in the same market; or
- broadcast in adjacent markets, with each station’s A.M. 5 mV/m contour, F.M. 0.5 mV/m contour or digital service area, as the case may be, overlapping the A.M. 15 mV/m contour, F.M. 3 mV/m contour or digital service area of the other station.
- In the 2006 Commercial radio policy (Broadcasting Public Notice 2006-158), the Commission expanded the definition of LMA so that it applies to stations that operate in adjacent markets but whose contours overlap, in light of the possible negative consequences of LMAs over time and the potential impact they might have on the diversity of voices that exists in a given market.
- In Public Notice 1999-176, the Commission announced an amendment to the Regulations to include a clause whereby the use of a LMA would require prior approval by way of a condition of licence. This amendment was in response to the Commission’s new common ownership policy that allows one owner to hold or control several stations in the same language and frequency band in a given market.Footnote 1 The Commission was concerned about the possibility that LMAs would be used to circumvent the rules of the Common Ownership Policy.
- Since then, the Commission has evaluated LMAs on a case-by-case basis to ensure that they do not have a significant negative impact on the diversity, dynamics or competitive forces in any given market. In Public Notice 1999-176, the Commission set out guiding principles for the approval of LMAs by way of a condition of licence.
- An LMA must not constitute a change in the effective control of the undertaking. Such a change of control would require the prior approval of the Commission under section 11 of the Regulations:
- parties to an LMA must ensure that distinct and separate programming and news services are maintained, and that their management remains under the respective responsibility of each licensee. This includes the program director and the news director, as well as any other related staff assigned to programming and/or news activities; and
- all assets of the undertakings involved in an LMA must remain in the ownership of each respective licensee.
- The Commission will be generally inclined to approve LMAs that:
- include unprofitable stations;
- include a number of stations that does not exceed the number of undertakings that may be commonly owned under the ownership policy; and
- are limited to a specific term and represent a temporary alternative business model that will allow the broadcasters to improve their performance.
- The Commission will evaluate LMAs on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all the relevant circumstances.
- Thus, as set out in Broadcasting Public Notice 2005-10, the following elements should be examined when evaluating the appropriateness of an LMA:
- the profitability of the stations involved;
- the number of stations owned by the parties in the market concerned;
- the potential impact on competitors;
- the potential impact on new entry;
- the possible reduction in the diversity of editorial voices, in the overall diversity and in the quality of programming; and
- the potential impact on the ability of radio stations to better compete with other media.
Interventions
- Four interventions in support of the applications were filed, as well as joint supporting interventions filed by RNC and Cogeco. In addition, one comment and one opposing intervention were filed by Rogers Media Inc. (Rogers) and Bell Media Inc. (Bell), respectively. The public record for this proceeding can be found on the Commission’s website at or by using the application numbers provided above.
- In its intervention, Rogers questioned the current environment in which commercial stations are operated and the challenges they face, particularly in the Ottawa-Gatineau market. Rogers would like certain regulatory restrictions to be removed, such as restrictions regarding LSAs and the policy regarding the broadcast of hits by English-language stations set out in Broadcasting Regulatory Policy 2009-61. Rogers was of the view that if the Commission were to approve the applications by Cogeco and RNC, which would improve their competitive position in the Ottawa-Gatineau market, it should eliminate the restrictions imposed on English-language stations with respect to the broadcast of hits.
- For its part, Bell opposed the applications by RNC and Cogeco. It indicated that the Commission does not always support LSAs and pointed out that several changes have taken place in the market, which will provide the applicants with solutions based on market forces and will significantly improve the profitability of their stations. It also indicated that the applicants have not filed financial projections that take these changes into account. Bell was of the view that RNC’s proposal does not comply with the Commission’s Common Ownership Policy or the policy on LSAs.
Reply by RNC and Cogeco
- In their reponse to the statements made by Rogers, RNC and Cogeco pointed out that they support the regulatory measures that aim to enable radio stations to remain competitive in the face of the numerous content options available to consumers. They argued that if the Commission wishes to reconsider the policy on hits in bilingual markets, as requested by Rogers, the review would need to be done in a larger context, encompassing minimum levels of French-language vocal music and Canadian musical selections. They put forth that English-language radio stations have a greater appeal for francophone listeners in the Ottawa-Gatineau market.
- In reply to Bell’s intervention, RNC and Cogeco indicated that LSAs are not prohibited and are a tool set out in the regulations to help stations experiencing financial difficulties. They argued that their applications meet the criteria and that the unique circumstances found in the bilingual market in Ottawa-Gatineau justifies an LSA. They indicated that their stations are unprofitable, that the LSA does not involve a change in the effective control of the undertakings, that the number of stations involved complies with the criteria for the Common Ownership Policy and that the requested amendment to the stations’ conditions of licence would apply until the end of the stations’ current licence terms.
- The applicants were of the view that Bell’s strategy to oppose the applications seeks to maintain its dominant position in the francophone market provided by its network stations NRJ and Rouge FM. They indicated that CHLX-FM’s gains in converting to a station under the Rythme FM banner will take time and investment. In their view, the LSA will create conditions to foster sales growth for each station, while helping the stations save on operating costs.
Commission’s analysis and decisions
- Based on its examination of the applications in light of applicable regulations and policies, the Commission must determine, among other things, whether the applications meet the LSA evaluation criteria set out in Broadcasting Public Notice 2005-10. Thus, in this decision, the Commission must consider the following:
- the impact on the diversity of voices;
- the profitability of CKOF-FM and CHLX-FM;
- the impact on competing stations in the market;
- the impact on potential new stations;
- compliance with the Common Ownership Policy as well as effective control of the stations; and
- the term length for the LSA.
Impact on the diversity of voices
- The Ottawa-Gatineau market is currently served by 21 commercial stations. Of those stations, 15 are English-language stations, 5 are French-language stations and 1 is a third-language station.
- When CHLX-FM was granted its initial licence in 2001, the station operated under a specialty format (Classical and jazz). In Broadcasting Decision 2008-221, the Commission approved a change in the station’s music format, which switched to a popular music format with a condition of licence requiring the station to devote 20% of its musical selections to content subcategory 34 (Jazz and blues).
- Rythme FM’s programming was not offered in the market before CHLX-FM started to broadcast it in August 2014. The applicants indicated in their supplementary brief that [translation]:
[…] RNC MEDIA has concluded that an affiliation with Rythme FM, whose formula has been very successful in other French-language markets, and the addition to CHLX-FM’s programming schedule of programs hosted by stars who are known and loved by the public would not only enrich the programming offered to the francophone radio market in Ottawa-Gatineau, but would also benefit the station’s revitalization.
- Notwithstanding this affiliation, CHLX-FM’s licence requires that it devote 20% of its musical selections to selections drawn from subcategory 34. In addition, according to the programming schedule on the record of this proceeding, CHLX-FM devotes to local programming 96.5 of the 126 hours of programming broadcast each broadcast week.
- In terms of the diversity of editorial voices, based on the terms of the proposed LSA, each licensee would remain responsible for managing the other activity sectors unrelated to sales, including programming.
- In that regard, RNC specified that CHLX-FM would be keeping its programming director, who would participate in weekly telephone conferences with the programming directors from various Rythme FM stations. The director would also be responsible for aligning local and network programming on the radio waves, as well as managing the length of commercial breaks. Further, the programming director is responsible for hiring local hosts, participating in their development and ensuring they are supervised.
- The applicants stated that denial of these applications would have a major impact on the capacity of the two licensees to resolve the financial situation of their respective stations, which could result in the shutdown of one or both stations. These shutdowns would have a significant negative impact on the diversity of French-language programming in the Ottawa-Gatineau market.
- In light of the foregoing, the Commission finds that approval of these applications would only have a minimal impact on the diversity of programming and editorial voices in the market.
Profitability of CKOF-FM and CHLX-FM
- CKOF-FM has posted financial losses since its acquisition by Cogeco in 2010 and has posted significant cumulative losses over the last three years.
- As for CHLX-FM, the station has been unprofitable for at least five years. While it affiliated with the Rythme FM network on 25 August 2014, its financial results do not yet reflect the impact of this affiliation.
- RNC and Cogeco stated that they wish to operate CHLX-FM and CKOF-FM, which have both posted losses in recent years, under an LSA to help resolve the two stations’ precarious financial situation. Both licensees stated that it is difficult to compete with Bell to generate advertising revenue given that Bell operates two French-language stations and four English-language stations in the market. They therefore wish to combine their local sales forces, which would enable them to provide advertisers with a combined advertising offer and target the audiences of both stations in a complementary manner, while saving on sales costs. According to the applicants, the two stations would benefit from an increase in revenue and a decrease in their financial losses, but would still not be profitable.
- In addition, the bilingual market of Ottawa-Gatineau has a unique dynamic with respect to competition, particularly for the French-language stations. In fact, almost 40% of tuning by the francophone audience is to English-language stations. In addition, the French-language stations only generate 20% of the total revenues for the market. These two factors distinguish the Ottawa-Gatineau market from another bilingual market, Montréal, where the tuning transfer of commercial stations by the francophone audience to English-language stations is only 15% and where the French-language stations generate more than 70% of the total market revenues.
- In light of the above, the Commission finds that the stations in question are not profitable and considers that approving the applications could contribute to improving the stations’ ability to compete in the market and their financial situations.
Impact on competing stations in the market
- As mentioned above, the Ottawa-Gatineau market is currently served by 15 English-language, 5 French-language and 1 third-language radio stations, held by various licensees. Of these stations, approval of the applications would mainly have an impact on Bell, which is the only other licensee that operates French-language commercial radio stations in the market. None of the licensees exclusively operating English-language stations intervened to oppose the applications.
- Bell currently operates six radio stations in the Ottawa-Gatineau market, namely two French-language and four English-language stations. This situation gives it a favourable competitive position in the market and allows it to benefit from synergies, which, in return, would mitigate any impact the proposed LSA could have.
- Finally, the financial projections under an LSA indicate that the additional anticipated revenue for the two stations, should the Commission approve the applications, would be limited and represent a small percentage of the total revenues generated in the French-language market, which were approximately $16 million in 2014.
- In light of the foregoing, the Commission finds that approval of these applications would not have any undue financial burden on the stations operating in the market and would have a positive impact on the ability of the two stations to improve their financial situation.
Impact on potential new stations
- Available frequencies on the FM band in the Ottawa-Gatineau market are scarce. Following the 13 May 2008 public hearing for new stations to serve Ottawa-Gatineau, almost all viable frequencies in the region were assigned. However, four frequencies on the AM band remain available: 540 kHz, 920 kHz, 1250 kHz and 1440 kHz.
- With the exception of a low-power, French-language commercial specialty radio station in Ottawa and a new English-language station in Clarence-Rockland,Footnote 2 the Commission has not received any applications for new stations in the Ottawa-Gatineau market in recent years. It would be possible for an applicant to propose a low-power unprotected station, as long as protection requirements for existing stations in the market are met.
- In light of the above, the Commission finds that approval of these applications would not have a significant impact on the Ottawa-Gatineau market to support the introduction of new radio stations.
Compliance with the Common Ownership Policy and effective control of the stations
- As set out in 2006 Commercial Radio Policy, the Commission is generally inclined to approve LSAs that include a number of stations that does not exceed the number of undertakings prescribed by the Common Ownership Policy. In the French-language market of Ottawa-Gatineau, the Common Ownership Policy allows for the ownership of three stations operating in the same language, two of which may be on the same frequency band.
- As mentioned above, Cogeco owns only one station in the Ottawa-Gatineau market, while RNC owns two. In their applications, Cogeco and RNC stated that CFTX-FM, the second station owned by RNC, would be excluded from the LSA and in so doing would be in compliance with the principles established by the Commission regarding common ownership.
- In its intervention, Bell stated that there is no operational logic or rationale for excluding CFTX-FM from the LSA and that despite this exclusion, the applications would not comply with the Commission’s guiding principles, given that the parties own three FM stations in the market.
- To that effect, since only two FM stations would be part of the LSA, the principles established by the Commission regarding common ownership would be met. However, although CFTX-FM would be excluded from the LSA and would carry out its local sales activities separately, it.
- In Broadcasting Information Bulletin 2010-341, the Commission reiterated that the first objective of the Common Ownership Policy is to ensure a plurality of ownership within the private commercial broadcasting sector, and that Canadians thus have access to a variety of editorial voices. The Commission also stated that a secondary objective of the policy is to maintain a balance of competition between broadcasters in each market.
- The LSA between RNC and Cogeco is structured in such a way to give the latter solely the responsibility of selling available commercial inventory on the CHLX-FM air waves and website to local clients on behalf of RNC. To fulfil this mandate, Cogeco would only have access to the station’s radio and Internet commercial inventory.
- According to the applicants, the LSA has been established solely for the purpose of local representation and would have no impact on programming and news activities, which at all times would remain under the responsibility and control of each party for their respective stations. Further, to maintain discretionary authority over the on-air content, RNC would reserve the right to refuse the broadcast of any commercial messages that would not meet its own standards.
- The Commission is therefore satisfied that, according to the terms of the LSA, the programming and news activities of the stations in question would remain under the licensees’ respective control at all times. In addition, it considers that the LSA would not affect the effective control of the undertakings in any way, as its scope is strictly limited to commercial inventory sales activities.
- In light of the foregoing, the Commission finds that approval of the LSA would not have a negative impact on the diversity of programming and editorial voices, and that it would not have an undue impact on the balance of competition in the market.
Term length for the LSA
- As stated above, the Commission is generally inclined to approve LSAs of a limited duration and that are a temporary alternative business model that will enable broadcasters to improve their performance.
- In this case, the applicants indicated that the amendments to the conditions of licence would be in effect only until the current licences are renewed. However, they confirmed that they would likely request renewal because the expected advantages cannot have a significant impact in such a short time.
- Moreover, the LSA between the parties was set up so that the terms of the agreement would be in effect for five years, with an automatic renewal clause, unless expressly indicated otherwise by one of the parties. The agreement also states that the absence or removal of the regulatory authorizations required would cause the agreement to be terminated.
- The licences for CHLX-FM and CKOF-FM do not expire at the same time, but on 31 August 2015 and 31 August 2016, respectively. The Commission therefore finds it appropriate to impose a condition of licence authorizing the LSA until 31 August 2019. The Commission considers that this is a reasonable period and that it will be sufficient to evaluate the impact of the LSA on the stations’ financial results. The licensees will be required to obtain Commission approval if they wish to extend the validity of the condition of licence after that date.
Conclusion
- In light of all of the foregoing, and given that the LSA does not represent a change to the effective control of the stations in question, the Commission approves the joint applications by Cogeco Diffusion inc. and RNC MEDIA Inc. to operate the French-language commercial radio programming undertakings CHLX-FM and CKOF-FM Gatineau in accordance with a local sales agreement.
- Accordingly, the Commission amends the licences for CHLX-FM and CKOF-FM to add the following condition of licence:
The licensee is authorized to operate its station in accordance with a local sales agreement until 31 August 2019.
Other issues
Intervention by Rogers
- The issue raised by Rogers in its intervention regarding the broadcast of hits by English-language stations in the Ottawa-Gatineau market is not related to the LSA policy or the applications in question, but rather falls under the issue of amending the Commission’s policy on the broadcast of hits. In the bilingual markets of Montréal and Ottawa-Gatineau, this policy is in place to protect French-language broadcasters and to promote linguistic duality.
Renewal of the licence for CHLX-FM
- RNC currently has an application under review with the Commission to renew the broadcasting licence for CHLX-FM, which expires 31 August 2015. While the Commission questioned RNC regarding certain instances of apparent non-compliance as part of this proceeding, these will be considered as part of the licence renewal for CHLX-FM.

*This decision is to be appended to each licence.
Dissenting Opinion of Commissioner Raj Shoan
With due respect to my colleagues, I do not agree that these joint applications justify the introduction of a local sales agreement (LSA) arrangement to the Ottawa-Gatineau market. This decision will have the effect of unjustifiably and unnecessarily distorting the Ottawa-Gatineau radio marketplace and arguably rewards two radio services with subpar programming offerings with a competitive advantage. In my view, the size and scale of Ottawa-Gatineau provides ample opportunity for a French-language radio service to not only survive but thrive. Furthermore, the lack of success of these operators is a reflection of their imperfect efforts to serve this French-language community and is not, in my view, reflective of any existing competitive imbalance in Ottawa-Gatineau as a market. Accordingly, I am of the view that these applications should properly have been denied.
This dissenting opinion is based on the following arguments:
- The market size of Ottawa-Gatineau is sufficient to support its current number of radio licensees. As such, the issuance of an approval for an LSA is not warranted; and
- Approval of an LSA violates the spirit of the Commission’s common ownership policy.
Lastly, from a legal perspective, the condition of licence granted to the applicants is overly broad and does not restrict the licensees to an LSA strictly between the two stations in question.
Background
According to the Canada 2011 Census, with a population of 1,236,324 residents, Ottawa-Gatineau is the fourth largest census metropolitan area in Canada. As noted at paragraph 16 of the majority decision, Ottawa-Gatineau is home to 21 commercial radio stations, of which 5 operate in the French language. 53.4% of Ottawa-Gatineau residents speak French only or both English and French.Footnote 3 Factoring in fluency, proficiency and general comfort level with the French language, it is likely, in my view, that the Ottawa-Gatineau market for French language services comprises between 300,000 and 500,000 residents. In this marketplace, then, five services have been licensed to serve a potential audience of between 300,000 and 500,000 consumers.
By way of comparison, according to the Canada 2011 Census:
- The city of Montréal has a population of 1,649,519 of which 886,080Footnote 4 speak French most often at home. To serve these approximately 880,000 potential listeners, the Commission has licensed 14 French language commercial radio stations;
- Quebec City has a population of 516,622 of which almost 95% speak French as their mother tongue. To serve these approximately 500,000 potential listeners, the Commission has licensed nine French-language commercial stations as well as a variety of campus, community and religious radio stations that also operate in the French language; and
- The city of Sherbrooke has a population of 154,601 of which almost 90% speak French as their mother tongue. To serve these approximately 150,000 potential listeners, the Commission has licensed four French-language commercial stations as well as a variety of campus and community radio stations that also operate in the French language.
While recent public information respecting the profitability of radio stations serving the Ottawa-Gatineau francophone market is limited, the Commission’s published financial summaries for commercial radio stations indicate an aggregate profit before interest and tax (PBIT) margin of 18.2% for these five stations and a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.2% for the Ottawa-Gatineau francophone market over the five-year period from 2008 to 2012. This CAGR percentage exceeds or matches the growth rate for every other francophone market in Canada with the notable exception of Quebec City (5.3%). In other words, this market is healthy and growing modestly.
Analysis
At paragraph 27 of the majority decision, the Commission argues that there is a “unique dynamic” in the Ottawa-Gatineau market such that approval of an LSA is justified. I disagree.
In my view, a macro analysis of the Ottawa-Gatineau francophone marketplace indicates there is ample opportunity for a French-language radio station to succeed in the present circumstances. Ottawa-Gatineau’s growth rate is higher than most francophone markets and the ratio of licensed services per person is extremely favourable.
In my view, the lack of success of the applicants in this process is not due to any specific competitive impediment in the marketplace; instead, it is purely a function of business decisions that did not resonate with listeners. Rather than distorting the market with regulatory intervention, the appropriate solution was to implement a new market strategy. In the case of CHLX-FM, RNC MEDIA Inc. (RNC) has taken this very approach. As noted above, RNC has applied for a format change and, more recently, re-branded the station under the ‘Rythme FM’ banner. This re-branding has been in place for less than a year. The Ottawa-Gatineau francophone market would have been better served by allowing RNC to continue to experiment with new approaches to increasing listenership instead of allowing Cogeco to appropriate CHLX-FM’s local advertising inventory.
Secondly, in its intervention, Bell Media noted as follows: [TRANSLATION] “RNC owns two FM stations in this market. The exclusion of one of these FM stations from the proposed LSA does not change the fact that it does not comply with the Commission’s common ownership policy and, consequently, with its policy on LMAs.”
I share this concern. The Commission’s common ownership policy prohibits the ownership of three stations operating in the same language on the same frequency band in a given market. While, strictly speaking, the ownership of the stations in question is not changing, an LSA raises serious questions respecting the effective control of an undertaking. In order to alleviate these concerns, as noted in the majority decision, the applicants have provided assurances that RNC’s CFTX-FM is not party to the LSA and will not benefit from the new sales structure arising from it. I have difficulty accepting this argument.
The onus was on the applicants to demonstrate irrefutably that the proposed sales structure will not create an entity whose operations are not in line with the Commission’s common ownership policy. In my view, they have not discharged this burden. The assurances of the applicants aside, there is every incentive to include CFTX-FM advertising inventory in the sales strategy created under the LSA and the Commission has little direct ability to prevent its inclusion after the fact. The likely result of this approval will be, in some fashion, a three FM combination of sales and operations.
Moreover, it appears that my colleagues share my skepticism in spite of their approval of the applications. At paragraph 39 of the majority decision, the Commission acknowledges that CFTX-FM .” This was a situation to be assiduously avoided in order to preserve the spirit of the common ownership policy.
Lastly, I have concerns with the language of the approved condition of licence. The condition is as follows: “The licensee is authorized to operate its station in accordance with a LSA until 31 August 2019.”
This condition is inappropriate insofar as it does not limit the licensees in question to an LSA solely between themselves. In fact, there is no restriction at all on the ability of the licensees to create new LSAs with other broadcasters in the marketplace. It is disappointing that the Commission did not insist upon a more suitable condition given the above-noted concerns respecting effective control.
Conclusion
Through this decision, the Commission has opened the door to LSA applications for stations operating in Canada’s top ten markets in terms of size and revenues. In my view, this is the wrong direction for radio regulation in Canada. In an industry that has seen unprecedented consolidation over the past decade, allowing for the increased use of LSAs by radio stations will only further exacerbate at this time the competitive challenges facing radio as a result of said consolidation. In large urban markets, LSAs do not preserve diversity of ownership or programming; they protect services that, in all likelihood, are presently poorly operated or programmed.
In my respectful view, these joint applications should have been denied.

A. Introduction
The President’s Challenge is an annual series of community–based activities
initiated by President S R Nathan in 2000. The aims of President’s Challenge are
two–fold; firstly, to increase awareness of how the community can get involved in
helping the less fortunate and secondly, to raise funds for the social service sector.
It is hoped that by doing so, a more cohesive society will be created. The Challenge
also aims to convey that the more able in society have a special responsibility to
help the rest of society and that all Singaporeans can make a difference in our
community. The Challenge thus highlights the role of the public, people and private
sectors in meeting these aims through their participation in the events organised.
2 Prior to the President’s Challenge, there were several charity events carrying
the President's name organised at different points during the year. President Nathan
decided to consolidate all these events under a single President's Challenge
platform and make this the premier annual project for the social services sector to
rally the public towards helping those in need.
3 President’s Challenge raised just over $12 million for 40 beneficiaries and the
Community Chest in 2008, and over $70 million for more than 400 beneficiaries
since 2000.
Organisers
4 Every year, various agencies will come forward to be involved in organising a
variety of events under President’s Challenge. These agencies include schools,
institutions of higher learning, private corporations and public service organisations.
5 The President’s Challenge Steering Committee, chaired by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS),
oversees the administration of President’s Challenge. The Steering Committee comprises representatives from major partners that are involved in organising the
events for President’s Challenge as well as representatives from the National
Council of Social Service and the President’s Office.
1
Beneficiaries
6 Each year, the President selects a list of charitable organisations that are in
need of funds or have problems raising funds on their own as beneficiaries of
President’s Challenge.
7 Organisations who wish to be considered for nomination as a President’s
Challenge beneficiary may fill out the nomination form which can be found at the
President’s Challenge website at. The minimum criterion for eligibility is that organisations must have Institute of Public Character (or IPC) status.
President’s Challenge 2009
8 President’s Challenge 2009 will be held from April to October 2009. However,
PC events may be held outside this period though it is best to hold your event by
end October 2009 at the latest so that the proceeds may be submitted before the
end of the year.
9 This year, we are renewing our focus to reach out to the community to raise
awareness of the beneficiaries and their causes. We are therefore encouraging
community–based events, although we continue to welcome all efforts, big or small.

3 Guidelines on Fundraising
3.1 Funding of fund-raising costs for PC events
? Funding for an event/project is subject to a limit of the total expenditure for
the event/project or 5% of the proceeds from the event, whichever is lower.
? For funding exceeding such limit, the fund-raisers have to seek prior
approval from President’s Office c/o PC Secretariat at least one month
before the event. Approval will be on a case-by-case basis.
? Fund-raisers should not net off expenses from the funds raised, as PC
had all along operated on the publicly-declared basis of every dollar raised
going to the beneficiaries. Where special situations make it impractical
for the gross proceeds to be given to PC (for eg, where a fund-raiser
allocates only part of amount raised to PC), fund-raisers should obtain the
PC Secretariat’s prior agreement before proceeding to organise events
and raise funds under the PC banner. Fund-raisers are not allowed to
claim any funding for expenses if they have deducted expenses from their
collections, i.e. they remit only collections (net of expenses) to PC.
? When claiming funding for expenses, fund-raisers should submit the final
consolidated Income and Expenditure statement of their event to the
Secretariat and, where practicable, supporting documents to substantiate
the figures. See Annex B for the format for submission of Income and
Expenditure statement.
3.2 Donations Collected
3
Organisers are strongly encouraged to donate all proceeds of your
fundraising event towards PC. Costs incurred during fundraising may be
covered either by sponsors, the organiser or reimbursement from MCYS
(refer to 3.1).
3.3 Beneficiaries Designated by Fund-raisers
Fund-raisers may designate not more than one-third of the funds raised by
their proposed PC event to non-PC beneficiaries. Fund-raisers are to seek
prior approval from PC Secretariat before the event.
Also, where an organiser wishes to donate funds to a specific PC beneficiary,
the total amount donated to that beneficiary should not exceed the final
amount that the President’s Office will allocate to the said beneficiary (which
takes into account its budgetary deficit). Funds raised over and above the
allocated amount may be directed to other PC beneficiaries.
4 Public Fundraising
If you wish to solicit donations from the public, you need to obtain a public
fundraising permit from the Singapore Police Force (SPF). This can only be applied 1 Public fundraising for online at.
mainly refers to street and house–to–house collections such as flag days and solicitation of donations from strangers. PC Secretariat will assist in providing a letter
of confirmation or memorandum of agreement (MOA) for you to expedite your permit application. Take note that the normal processing time for SPF to process this
permit is 10 working days. Detailed guidelines are below:
4.1 Requirements for License
4.1.1 A House-to-House & Street Collections (fund raising) license is
required if:
? The proceeds for the fund raising appeal are for charitable causes;
? Public participation is required in the fund-raising.
4.1.2 Applicant must fulfil the following criteria before applying for the
License:
? He must be a fit and proper person, e.g. free from criminal records;
? If he is a foreigner, he must hold a valid work permit or employment
pass; and
? He must represent a registered business, company, society or
organization that is promoting the collection.
? He also needs to obtain his SingPass (Singapore Personal Access)
from the nearest CPF office or apply online at in order to apply
for licence.
4.2 The application should be submitted not later than 14 days (or 10 working
days) before the proposed date of commencement of the collection.
1 FAQs and contact information for SPF are available at the top right hand corner of the website.
4
4.3 A memorandum of agreement from the intended beneficiary (in this case,
President’s Challenge) acknowledging the fund raising activity to be held in its name
must be submitted within 5 working days from the date of submission of the
application. The letter must be faxed or posted together with the acknowledgement
slip generated by PLUS (Police Licensing CompUterised System) to the following
address:
Police Licensing Division
391 New Bridge Road #02-701
Police Cantonment Complex
Singapore 088762
4.4 For any enquiries, please contact the Licensing Division, Tel: 6835 0000
4.4.1 For events that are to be held at shopping centres, housing estates
and along the road (if booth is to be set up), letters of support are
required, where applicable, from the management/owner of buildings,
Town Councils and the Land Transport Authority respectively.
4.4.2 A person below 16 years of age is not allowed to act as a collector.
4.4.3 A license holder has to submit a statement of accounts to the
Licensing Division one-month after the completion of the collection.
All accounts furnished must be certified by external auditors who are
members of the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Singapore.
4.4.4 In planning for a cost-effective event, as a rule of thumb, the cost
relating to the organizing of any event should not exceed 30% of the
proceeds of the collection.
5 Tax Deduction. To allow your donors to receive double tax deduction for their donation, you would
need to obtain their personal information such as their full name, NRIC, address and
contact details. To expedite the issuing of these tax deductible receipts to your
donors, we need your kind assistance to fill in their personal information in the
spreadsheet found in Annex C.
5.1 Individual donors do not need to claim deduction for donations in their income
tax form if they have given their NRIC No. or FIN No. at the point of donation. The
donation details will be provided to IRAS by the approved IPC and the donation

C. Frequently Asked Questions
Q1. Can I direct the funds that I have raised to specific beneficiaries on the
President’s Challenge Beneficiary List?
A1. Yes. Do inform us beforehand, as we may be able to advise you on the
amounts you wish to designate based on the needs of the beneficiaries.
However, as the President’s Office will usually decide on the sum to be
allocated to the beneficiaries based on the amount they need, there may be
instances whereby the funds raised by your organisation for a specific
beneficiary exceeds the amount allocated for it. For such cases, we seek your
understanding that any amount over and above that allocated be redirected to
other PC beneficiaries.
Q2. Can I channel some of my proceeds to other charitable causes besides
President’s Challenge?
A2. You may direct not more than a third of the funds raised to non-PC
beneficiaries. Please seek prior approval from PC Secretariat before the
event. However reimbursement limit for expenses will only take into account
the portion of funds going towards PC, as it is difficult to justify the
reimbursement of a large portion of your expenses in this case.
Q3. Does my organisation qualify for tax deduction or can we get a tax
deductible receipt for the funds donated?
A3. If the money had come from your organisation, then you may receive a tax
deductible receipt. If it had come from fundraising from individual donors, then
these donors are the ones that qualify for tax deduction. Your organisation will
still receive a receipt (normal) to acknowledge the funds transfer.
Q4. I am not sure who to turn to for help with my queries – is it NCSS or
MCYS?
A4. NCSS handles all matters relating to donations and the submission of
proceeds. MCYS handles all other matters relating to PC. You may also liaise
with the President’s Office directly if you are inviting President to your event.

"She reached into her center console for her purse," Banks said. "Her 9-millimeter handgun was under her purse. When she took the gun out to check the safety, she pointed it down and it went off."

A few months ago we found a good deal on a pair of bedside tables at Ikea. Since then we've been keeping our eyes open for a pair of lamps to complete the room. I wanted something slim and somewhat tall with a shade that wouldn't be in the way. Most of the lamps that attracted me were too expensive to consider, or if the price was ok, there was only one lamp left.
But we found these just before Christmas at our local Bricomarché. We both liked the look and the price was right. So we brought them home. The color of the lampshade in this picture is not quite right. I tried adjusting it with Photoshop, but I just couldn't get it to look like it should. The shade is actually brown, pretty much the same color as the lamp base, but the photo makes it look purple. It must be the energy-saving fluorescent bulb that's messing up the image.
I could probably adjust the settings on the camera to compensate for fluorescent light and re-take the photo, but I'm too lazy. You'll just have to use your imagination.

I really like the purple !!
Zoiks! I love them!!!!
I like the purple too. It's just a little punch of color. I would like to see it in brown though. Work on that!
m.
I was surprised that you had chosen this color! It looks good here on your blog with the blue, plus the table it's sitting on looks orangish so the colors are lively for an overcast day early in the year 2011...
Love Collette's photo- good one Sue!
I kind of like the purple - so I think I won't use my imagination. ;)
No matter the color, I love it!
Well done for braving IKEA! Was it horribly crowded, or did you manage to catch a quiet period. We've got to go and get some more Billy and a couple of Benbos.... our books seem to have reproduced frantically in the barn!
WV is "Comer"... the state you are in on leaving Ikea!
Purple or brown, it's a gorgeous lamp!
BettyAnn
Luv it!!!
Quite striking. I agree that the colors in the photo are both vivid and exciting. Using my imagination as suggested, I get something more simple and understated but still with a touch of whimsy and fun.
jean, it does make a pretty picture, doesn't it?
bl, zoiks? So THAT's how it's spelled.
mark, I'll make it my highest priority.
evelyn, :)
ksam, if it were actually purple, I probably wouldn't have bought it. But now that you mention it... it's not bad!
alewis, you're so easy to please!
tim, if I recall, we had a very good experience with very few people. When it's crowded I really can't stand the place.
bettyann, thanks!
cubby, hehe.
will, are you channeling Martha Stewart there? ;)
The purple lamp did seem a bit out of character (only from my interpretation of you two from your blogs, of course) but I thought, well, purple has been a fashion statement this past fall and home dec follows fashion.
I like the shade details but I think brown would be terrific.
I LOVE the new lamp!
Love those cute lamps, but would love them even more if the shades really WERE purple. :-)
This comment has been removed by the author.
mary, the brown is good. I discovered when I was trying to adjust the color in Photoshop that I could make the shade just about any color I wanted. Except brown.
starman, and there are 2 of them!

Abstract
Social presence is a critical influence on learners’ online social interaction in an online learning environment via computer-mediated communication (CMC) systems. This study examines how three CMC systems, e-mail, bulletin board, and real-time discussion, influence the level of online social presence and privacy. Mixed methods were applied to examine the relationships of three CMC systems with social presence and privacy. The results indicate (a) E-mail is perceived to possess the highest level of social presence, followed by the real-time discussion and bulletin board; (b) one-to-one e-mail was perceived to have a higher level of privacy while one-to-many was perceived less privacy; and (c) in addition to the attributes of CMC systems, learners’ perceptions of CMC systems impacted level of privacy as well. This study suggested that the format of CMC systems, e-mail and real-time discussion should be examined in two different formats: one-to-one e-mail, one-to-many e-mail, one-to-one real-time discussion, and many-to-many real-time discussion.One-to-One Guitar Tuition Leeds

Drug: ED Trial Pack
Why Choose An.
The ED Trial Pack allows you to give each impotence treatment a real good try, before determining which drug suits your lifestyle and relationships best. You can find the following medications in the ED Trial Pack.
- Levitra 20mg
- Viagra 100mg
- Cialis 20mg
Each one of these drugs in an ED Trial Pack works similarly, but contains a different active ingredient. For instance, you may feel more comfortable using Viagra than Levitra because one drug treats your medical condition perfectly, while the other appears to be less effective. This gives you an opportunity to check out all the benefits and side effects of all three medications, so that you can determine which drug to continue with over for long term treatment..
What Are The Benefits Of The ED Trial Pack? and must be taken half an hour before sexual activity.
ED Trial Pack Dosage And Recommendation
Each of these drugs in the ED Trial Pack should be taken half an hour before sexual intercourse. Individuals can take these drugs with food or without. However, keep in mind that consuming fatty food whilst on one of these medications can lessen its overall effectiveness. The recommended dosage is one pill within a period of 24 hours - and in the case of Cialis, individuals must wait another 36 hours before popping another second pill.
Common Side Effects Of The ED Trial Pack Tablets
Not all users of the ED Trial Pack will experience any side effects. Some of the common side effects include nausea, facial flushing, headaches, upset stomach, blurry vision and nasal congestion. If you experience uncomfortable with any of the ED Trial Pack tablets side effects, it is best to immediately seek for medical attention or seek the advice of your health care provider. devices for the first year.

The 1973 OPEC oil embargo brought with it more stringent contamination laws and the desire for fuel-efficiency. This was likewise the very first time in vehicle history that the Big 3 were needing to compete with imports. The new Mustang II was smaller than the first variation but, due to the extra equipment required to fulfill brand-new US emission and safety policies, was heavier than the very first model. Performance was decreased and in the first year just 385,993 cars were sold. 2nd generation Mustangs were offered between 1974 and 1978 and offered in a coupe and hatchback version. 1979 the Mustang was upgraded a third time.

Teacher Patricia Valdivieso talks with students about the different end-of-the-year traditions in different Spanish-speaking countries at the end of the fall semester at the Spanish Language Program En Nuestra Lengua. Images credit: Peter Matthews, Michigan Photography
ANN ARBOR—"Ojos aquí," calls teacher Patricia Valdivieso, a command that translates to "eyes on me." At this, 19 second graders in a Michigan elementary school slowly quiet down.
"Does anyone know in what country people celebrate Three Kings' Day?" she asks, still in Spanish as hands shoot up as the anxious answers come.
Venezuela? Argentina? Come the answers, also in Spanish
The teacher shakes her head: "No, it's in Spain and Mexico, when children get to open their presents in January."
En Nuestra Lengua students line up as they make their way through the Bach Elementary cafeteria during the program’s annual fundraiser that includes sales of traditional foods from Spanish-speaking countries.
Home for the holidays
It's the last Saturday of the fall semester and, as they do every Saturday, 200 students pre-K to 4th grade spend most of the day at En Nuestra Lengua. help them become not only bilingual but bicultural and biliterate.
Founded seven years ago by University of Michigan Professors Teresa Satterfield and José Benkí, the program is based at Bach Elementary School in Ann Arbor and consists of a Spanish-language curriculum in math, science and language arts that mirrors the district's English-based curriculum. To ensure the opportunity is available to those who need it most, there is no tuition charge for enrollment in this educational program that has been highlighted by the Center of Applied Linguistics in Washington, D.C. as a model program worthy of replication.
The program, Satterfield says, is so successful that 80 percent of students perform at grade level in standardized Spanish language and literacy assessments, and 90 percent meet or exceed standardized English measures. Progress exams take place every 10 weeks in the program, and formal end-of-year assessments are carried out. The program also has an educational component for parents—98 percent of whom participate in the program, which has a waiting list as long as the list of students currently enrolled.
The program also collaborates with local and national universities and internship programs, allowing it to receive graduate student interns who provide cutting-edge techniques and information for continual new research components.
Santa pays a visit to second graders at the Spanish Language Program En Nuestra Lengua before the end of the semester.
Finding community
Satterfield says she wishes a program like En Nuestra Lengua existed when her family immigrated to the United States from Panama. Upon arriving in the U.S., she was placed in a special education program she did not need.
"For me, this is a very personal journey as well as professional journey," Satterfield said. "I came to the States when I was six. It was very traumatic. It affected me, and not very positively. I ended up mirroring some of the behaviors that I observed in the other children, who were there for legitimate reasons. I ended up not speaking any language for about a year. I just stopped speaking."
Eventually, Satterfield learned to fit in but it wasn't until high school that she rediscovered her native language, Spanish, and also picked up French. Thus began her fascination with learning new languages and opening doors into other cultures. Today, Satterfield is a linguist specializing in language acquisition in the context of U.S. (Afro-) Latino identity and culture.
"I definitely see myself in the children at En Nuestra Lengua," she said. "I understand the parents' experience as well of them needing support that they are not necessarily finding in the schools that will help them navigate a new country and the educational system and help them support their children in the way they need to.
"A lot of those parents are intimidated by English. Maybe they don't understand the things their children are being asked to do in the classroom. It's something new. The program is filing in that gap so not only the children have success and maintain their language but also the parents understand what the American school system is all about and how they, as Spanish speakers, can model the language and still support their children's education here in the U.S."
Helping parents raise bilingual children
Satterfield says the Spanish program is unique in its approach to cultivating Latino parental involvement. Concurrent with the children's Saturday classes, parents and caregivers also participate in weekly information sessions. The workshops, carried out in Spanish, increase parental interactions by helping parents understand the demands of the U.S. classroom, and provide guidance on home practices to encourage classroom learning.
At the beginning and the end of the school year, adults are interviewed and also complete questionnaires concerning family literacy behaviors and attitudes toward education. In assessments, parents report to be at least 50 percent more visible and proactive in their interactions with the local elementary schools, and also engage in at least 50 percent more sound educational practices in the home, according to research co-authored by Viktorija Tijunelis, Satterfield and Benkí.
For parents like Wendy Tashian, the program is invaluable. Originally from Peru and a lecturer at U-M, Tashian said her daughter, Nikki, joined the program at age 5. Nikki is now in "El Club Lectores," a book club for teenagers to continue practicing their Spanish.
"There are few people in my community who speak Spanish and who have children the same age as my children," Tashian said. "With this program, we meet other families, we come to the program, we go to the park, we have dinner together. We've been able to form a beautiful community. And my 12-year-old reads books, analyzes them, critiques them, in Spanish, and I love it."
Victor Kareh also is a fan. His oldest son just started attending the program this year.
"It's very important for me that he learns Spanish, first to be able to communicate with his grandma, with the uncles and aunts, and with everyone who speaks Spanish," said Kareh, who is from Puerto Rico and has lived in the area for over a decade. "And I think it's important to be bilingual. It's part of my culture. We're bilingual by tradition and to be able to maintain that bilingualism is important."
Parents and community members participate in En Nuestra Lengua’s annual fundraiser featuring traditional foods from Spanish Speaking countries. The funds will go to pay in part for the program, which is free of charge to parents.
Finals and food
On finals day in the En Nuestra Lengua program at Bach Elementary, the students are settling in for their tests. Down the hall, their parents prepare for the annual fundraiser in the school's cafeteria. Up for sale will be the homemade dishes prepared by the parents themselves, arranged by country of origin: arepas from Colombia, merengues and alfajores from Argentina, coffee from Nicaragua, tea from Guatemala.
And while the main objective of the event is to raise funds for the Spanish program, the activity will soon morph into a community gathering. Parents talk about the differences and similarities between the dishes and exchange phone numbers as the children arrive, fresh from their test.
"That's from Argentina," says one girl, in Spanish. She recognized the flag in front of the table. At another table, a teacher points out dishes from Mexico, and how they differ from those in Colombia.
"I love that my children are in this program, learning about the culture and getting to know immigrants from all different countries," said Cristina Arriaga, originally from Spain, whose three children are ages 5, 7 and 10.
"It has been amazing for my son's development not only academically but socially to be able to integrate himself in the Latino community," said Catalina Ormsby, assistant director for the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program at U-M.
Ormsby is originally from Colombia, and her son Anthony has been in the program for three years.
"It's amazing to be able to have this program in Ann Arbor and be able to share it with Latino families in the community," she said.

That's why I'm taking myself with weird faces on the mirror. I just can't help myself, I had to do some silly faces, excuse me, hihi. I really like this outfit. As you probably know, I'm a huge fan of marinières, I have like 10 or 15 in my closet. So I wear them basically all the time. And this one, that I bought in Monoprix a long time ago (it was the first thing that I bought ALONE, I was like 12 and it was way too big for me. Hopefully now it fits perfectly on me!) was perfect for my new skirt that I showed you in my HAUL sales (clothes) post! :) I'm wearing a little headband with flowers from H&M as well. I made my makeup, even though I'm not really good at this. So I kept it simple. I hope you like this outfit, and I hope the quality of the pictures is good. I'm not a good photographer (yet) but I'll be better next time, don't worry!
Tomorrow, I'll probably go to Paris with my dad. I'm so excited! Because he promised me that we would take a breakfast at Angelina. I don't know if you know this place? It's like... the best restaurant/tearoom EVER. It makes hot chocolat like anybody else. If you go to Paris one day, you totally have to go there. It's like heaven, but better. Maybe I'll take some pictures? I don't know yet. I have to sell some clothes that I don't want anymore, so it will be a busy day. But I'll post something for sure!

Big Beat/Atlantic recording group Hercules & Love Affair announces highly anticipated North American tour, a first in many years. The dates -- which celebrate the dance music icons' acclaimed new album, "THE FEAST OF THE BROKEN HEART" out now -- begin September 24th at Dallas' Club Dada and then continue through mid-October (see itinerary above). Presale packages, with extras including limited edition color vinyl, will be available to fans beginning July 15th at; all remaining tickets will go on sale to the general public on July 18th, available via herculesandloveaffair.net/live-dates.
"THE FEAST OF THE BROKEN HEART" includes the new single, "My Offence (feat. Krystle Warren)," which premiered alongside an interview from Andy Butler detailing the mini-documentary about the re-appropriation of the word "C*NT" exclusively on V Magazine, and can be heard now on the band's YouTube (). "Do You Feel The Same?" highlight a remarkable roll call of diverse vocal talents, including critically acclaimed singer/songwriters Krystle Warren and John Grant as well as new discoveries Gustaph and Rouge Mary. album -- which also features the breathtaking hit single, "I Try To Talk To You (Feat. John Grant)" -- is unquestionably among the year's most acclaimed, with Pitchfork noting, "Hercules & Love Affair tap into an essential part of house music's history that's far more profound than just the music." "Andy Butler and cohorts engage with LGBT club culture in a complicated and meaningful way that isn't about slogans, stylists, and stardom," wrote SPIN's Barry Walters in an 8 of 10 rated rave. "Instead, Butler curates a living art exhibit about what it means to dance and dream at the sexual margins. Where others obfuscate and dumb down, Hercules aestheticize and elevate." AV Club declared "THE FEAST OF THE BROKEN HEART" to be "the most adventurous record yet from Hercules & Love Affair. The house and techno elements are immediate and occasionally aggressive, but there's great warmth and intimacy here as well." "Butler's troupe have always been unique," noted Resident Advisor, "a dance floor-friendly manifestation of the dissenting, politicized queer underground -- but now they're making transcendent music again, too." "THE FEAST OF THE BROKEN HEART" is "a taut and focused piece of work, full of ridiculously propulsive and catchy anthems, and there's not a bad song on it," decreed Stereogum, adding," If you have any love in your heart for old-school house music, you should hear it at least once."."
Long hailed as a transcendent live act, Hercules & Love Affair is currently rocking the house on a major European tour encompassing headline dates, festival appearances, and a number of exclusive Andy Butler DJ sets.

View Image: S M LAbout a month and a half back when I went to my salon for a session of hair pampering, the therapist suggested that I do a L'oreal Mythic Oil treatment to give some relief to my dry tresses. Ever ready to try out something new I agreed and was transported to a world of hair pampering bliss for an hour. I really liked how soft, shiny and manageable my hair looked after the Mythic Oil treatment and since I was looking to buy a serum, decided to give the Rich Oil in the Mythic Oil range a shot.
The oil is called a 'Controlling' oil for unruly hair. Never heard that term being used for an oil, but in short what it does is that it reduces frizz and tames hair to make it more manageable. Here's what L'Oreal has to say about the. My therapist told me that this oil can be used as a traditional oil, that is massaged into the scalp and then washed off, as a serum to be applied after washing hair and as a styling product to be used before or after blow drying. Till date, I've only been using it as a serum so that's what Ill talk about.
The oil is inside a gold tinted plastic bottle with a pump dispenser. The bottle has an exotic look to it which is attractive and it has a sturdy cap, so no tension of spillage if you are taking this while travelling. The oil has a warm amber fragrance which is very pleasant. The dispenser is easy to control so no fear of accidentally getting a lot of product on your hands.
Now there is a way of using the oil. What I do is I take the product in my hands (about a couple of pumps), rub my palms to warm it up and then start applying it first to the ends of the hair and then slowly move upward. I don't apply it to the scalp but only to the hair and then comb it through. The texture of the oil is incredibly light so it gets absorbed within seconds. The hair neither feels oily nor weighed down. I just let my hair airdry after applying the oil and within some time it gets smooth, silky and manageable . Surprisingly, my hair dries a lot faster after I've used this product!
The Rich Oil majorly targets taming unruly hair so if you are looking at this as the solution to treat dryness, you will not get the result you are looking for. In that way, I'm slightly disappointed coz I thought this would do wonders to my dry tresses and solve the problem considerably. I won't say that it does not. It does but not to the extent that I want. Another word of caution. It does not treat split ends, if that is another of your concern. What the oil does do well is that it makes hair more manageable by smoothing out frizz and it definitely looks more shiny and feels soft. Its great as a styling product as well. I've used it a couple of times before blowdrying and after and the results were good.
I don't have oily hair so I don't know if it will make oily hair greasy. But since the oil is pretty light, don't think oily hair beauties will have any problem. I bought the Rich Oil from the salon at Rs 900 and this is a 125 ml bottle so I see this lasting me for another 3 months easily. This range also has a shampoo and a masque that you can try along with the Rich Oil to deeply nourish hair. I intend to buy those two too to see if it makes a difference to the dryness. If your main purpose is to use a styling product cum serum that tames frizz, the Mythic Oil Rich Oil can be a good choice.
Have you tried anything from the Mythic Oil range?Related Searches: ebony and iv, Cute and Cuddly and FREE, Plastic and Glass Bottle and Jars, bumble and bumble shampoo and conditioner

Challenges of Complexity:
Information and Computational Dynamics in Nature and Society
Klaus Mainzer, University of Augsburg
12:05 pm, 817R Cathedral of Learning
Abstract: The theory of nonlinear complex
systems has become a proven problem-solving approach in natural
and computer science. It is now recognized that many of our social,
ecological, economic, and political problems are also of a global,
complex, and nonlinear nature. The human brain is governed largely
by the nonlinear dynamics of complex systems. And the complexity
of information and computational systems is analyzed for global
networking. What is the common methodological framework behind these
endeavors? Are there degrees of complexity indicating thresholds
for the emergence of chaos and randomness? In the age of globalization,
our understanding and managing of complex systems in nature and
society is an interdisciplinary challenge of computer science, natural
and social sciences, and last but not least, humanities and philosophy.Property ID ： P78

Once one knows how to journey, Shamanic Counseling sessions can be continued at the clients discretion to practice journeying with assistance from the practitioner in their journey question forming and method. Also reviewing journeys for full integration, manifestation and retrospection also takes place.

Schedule Class NowWe’ve been going to Crossing Border for several years now and always enjoyed ourselves immensely! This year the festival will be on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th of November and there are so many great authors coming, you probably don’t know which ones to see. To help you out, we created our mission guide with the authors we’re most excited about seeing. Be sure to get your tickets in time and maybe we’ll meet you there!
Friday
There are a lot of duo interviews at Crossing Border this year, making it less hard to choose who to see. Our first recommendation is Lesley Nneka Aarimah, author of the short story collection What it Means When a Man Falls From the Sky. It’s a debut collection, but already gets compared to Helen Oyeyemi and I’ve read somewhere that it was the best short story collection of 2017, but I can’t find the source anymore. However, if you like magical realism, this is one you can’t miss. Lesley Nneka Aarimah will be sharing the stage with Belgium author Annelies Verbeke.
Omar Hamilton is a movie maker as well as an author. The Egyptian artist wrote the novel The City Always Wins, which tells the story of the Egyptian Revolution in 2011. It’s based on his own experiences. His cousin was captured and sentenced for illegal protesting, and the main character in his book does anything in his power to continue the protests. Omar Hamilton will be interviews with Iraqi writer Ali Bader.
English writer Claire-Louise Bennet wrote the much-lauded novel Pond, a book that is more about atmosphere than it is about story. In her writing, she wants to capture life, not produce it. Claire-Louise Bennet will be sharing the stage with two other Dutch writers, Persis Bekkering and Hanna Bervoets, who were also very excited to see.
Masande Ntshanga is a young writer from South-Afrika whose debut novel The Reactive uses HIV as a metaphor to showcase the political and social problems in his country. Not a small feat for a debut novel. He’ll be on stage on his own on Friday, but will share the stage with Dutch poet Lieke Marsman on Saturday, just in case you want to see him twice.
Saturday
You must have heard the term mansplaining. Well, Rebecca Solnit is the one who introduced it into our modern day vocabulary with her essays Men Explain Things to Me. She’s an activist and one of the biggest names in feminism today. There’s a special sign in for Rebecca Solnit because they’re expecting this to be very busy. Make sure you sign up for her interview with Persis Bekkering.
Another big literary star in Max Porter. The British author just won the European Literature Prize (which will be awarded to him on Friday at Crossing Border) for the novella Grief is the Thing with Feathers. It’s a very powerful story of a young family that loses the mother, written in magical prose that will have you confused and emotional in no time. He’ll be sharing the stage with Mike McCormack.
Margo Jefferson is the second author that you need to sign up for if you want to see her. No wonder, because the professor and author won the National Book Critics Circle Award for her book Negroland. She writes about race in America, and in her memoir, she shares what it was like to grow up in the elite of the black community in Chicago. Her writing is honest, daring and a must for anyone interested in learning about modern-day racial issues. She’ll be interviewed by Liesbeth Staats.
Sharing the stage with Max Porter, Mike McCormack is another experimental author. He’s from Ireland and has been writing books for over twenty years. His latest work, Solar Bones, is written as one long sentence. Now, that might not sound appealing, but all the reviews say that the book is highly readable and very good. It’s also nominated for the Man Booker Prize, so maybe that will convince you to give it a try. The duo-interview will be done by Jasper Henderson.
I’m excited to see Sally Rooney, not just because of her novel Conversations with Friends, but also because of her brief career as a university debater. Her novel is about two friends who perform spoken-word poetry together. One of them gets drawn into the orbit of a strange older couple and their lives start to unravel. Sally Rooney shares the stage with Dutch writer Franca Treur.
And finally, we’ll mention Ross Raisin, a British author that wrote a novel about football. And before you click away because sports novels aren’t really your thing, A Natural is about a soccer player who tries to ignore the fact that he is gay. The book delves into the macho world of sports and the unacceptance of gay players. He’ll be interviewed by Menno Pot.
These are just some of the author’s we’re interested in seeing, but Crossing Border has much more to offer. Take a look at the entire program here and let us know in the comments what other authors and musicians we should check out!UN Team Arrives in Iran to Investigate Nuclear Weapon Claims
A team of UN nuclear weapons inspectors has arrived in Iran to investigate claims the country is building an atomic bomb.
The visit is the second in a month and comes just days after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad boasted of new developments in Iran's nuclear enrichment program.
Inspectors are expected to spend two days starting Monday in the country, but with tensions running high between Iran and Israel, Western diplomats have played down any hopes of a major breakthrough at the meeting.
Herman Nackaerts, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) team, said: We hope to have a couple of good and constructive days in Tehran.
The highest priority remains of course the possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear program, he told reporters, making clear he wanted to see concrete results in the discussions with Iranian officials.
The outcome, after an inconclusive first round of discussions last month, could determine whether the international stand-off.

and two propellers
Confrontation initially takes place in the interval ranging between the habitats then directly on the territory of the assaulted and the fortifications appear. Strengths involved in the neolithic in the Middle East are comparable to the troops fighting on the majority of the battlefields of the Middle Age, that is 5 to 10 000 men, but they are often used in reduced groups of individuals hundreds.
One found rupestral paintings describing warriors' line, shooting on order or walking in column, behind their leader who is dressed specifically. The tactics is not absent and a double enveloppement is even observable. One cannot speak of battle but rather of raid or of devastation of the territory. The combat is justified by the control of the invaluable resources (foods, water, raw materials)...
As at the end the territory of the loser is taken, the prehistoric fight is wild. A cemetery was found in Egypt, near Assouan. It dates from the period included between - 12 000 and - 4 500. Half of the skeletons carry traces of violent death caused by small sharp stony brightness, sometimes in great number on the same body. The fracture of certain bones is caused by gestures to avoid the blows. Comparable cemeteries were found in Russia and in Rumania, they date from the 5th millennium.
The oldest known weapons are wooden spears, already for the hunting, we found to Schoeningen ( in Germany), spears which we were able to date 360 000 years!. In Paleolithic final already, they were equipped with points of flint, bone, wood of reindeers (for example in Kesslerloch, Swiss). The lance arose from the projection of these spears.
Africans bowmen (Cattle period 4th millenium)
At the
Neolithic era axes are made in stone and the daggers in flint,
exceptionally in copper. These objects were probably in the same
moment, tools, weapons and a mark of prestige.
The abundance of food allows the appearance of the crafts and so the
barter between human groups. In these exchanges, tools and
weapons are going to spread.

Unfortunately in this video Joe gets "2.6°" and "2.7°" and doesn't talk about the face at all. He basically does the Trackman calculations and arrives at what should be the same number (2.6). That's not "zeroing anything out" - that's simply explaining how Trackman gets the numbers it gets.!

She looks very lovely in her new scarf!
Nice job.
I wish I could knit. Have you seen this one?
Karen L.
Oh, Karen, I hadn't seen that one, but I must admit I'm tempted to try it. After seeing Rebecca wrap her scarf around her neck, it looked so cozy I wanted one for myself. Maybe I'll give the purl one a try for some variety.
Happy birthday Rebecca, You are one of a kind!
I have a cat named "Beanie" He's not as pretty as Rebecca by any-means. Just wanted to thank you, Linzee, for the great write up I found on Etsy about thanking a Beekeeper.I thanked one, by forwarding your article to her on her blog, I know she will enjoy it.

Ali #86General Motors, it says, is the “First Company to Use Mass-Production Methods for Autonomous Vehicles.”
In a society that had either the rudiments of a sane attitude toward transportation or actual journalism, this shameless howler would be getting rightly trashed. Instead, of course, GM’s ridiculous PR claim is generating the usual straight reprints of its press release, under the desired, predictable headlines:
General Motors: We can mass-produce self-driving cars now
Notice the slip from GM’s “mass-production methods” to the corporate news outlet’s “mass produce.” (Need we again mention the nature of the “electric vehicle” deception?)
Meanwhile, the vehicles in question — all 130 of them — are certainly not “self-driving,” as is demonstrated by this picture from GM’s own press release packet:
And, say, what do you imagine would happen to this contraption’s “self-driving” capacities upon the slightest ding to that rather extravangant roof rack? And how much would it cost to fix such problems? Nobody is mentioning such matters, of course. There’s much more loss-leading business to be done here, after all.To start off: I am 19 and a virgin.

So, I get laser hair removal obviously down there also, and I had an appointment about two weeks ago.
Anyways, all went normal, no razor bumps that I can recall or anything unusual and then abut four days ago I noticed this weird, not tough, bump in my crotch-lower butt area.
I am extremely worried that it could be like a tumor or something bad, I know nothing tbh but I am an extreme hypochondriac over anything.
The bump is not sore, nor is it tough or anything. Just a bump, flesh colored, nothing suspicious looking from what I saw... And not an ingrown hair either- my mom said it looks like a new mole or something.
I definitely will not be going to the doctor's office just due to my awful anxiety attacks.
Could it be a cancerous tumor? Could it be an std or something?!

Confessions Of An Auteur: Francois Truffaut’s Une Belle Fille Comme Moi (1972) – Blu-ray review
Truffaut always meant to demolish the wall between highbrow and low culture, so should we really be surprised that he made a sex farce?
Une Belle Fille Comme Moi
(Francois Truffaut, 1972)
By 1970, French cinema had reflected – and even caused – major changes in culture and society. But after the tumult of 1968, where next for the movement’s troubadours? For Jean-Luc Godard, it meant becoming even more radical and uncompromising in his fusion of film and politics. As for Francois Truffaut…
It’s fair to say that Une Belle Fille Comme Moi – a bawdy farce about a very bad girl – is not the kind of film you’d have expected when the Nouvelle Vague broke through. As the indiscretions and infidelities of the brilliantly named Camille Bliss mount up, it feels like a French version of the sex comedies so beloved of the Brits, the Carry Ons and Confessions of the world.
It doesn’t help that Truffaut shoots this with the least possible interest in being serious. His style is nonchalance itself, his roving camera dancing around cheeky, “well-stacked” (as the film puts it) star Bernadette Lafont. The tone is set the moment Camille’s abusive father kicks her up the arse and she literally flies – powered by the illusion of cinema – into a bale of hay.
This is Truffaut in playful mood, switching gears as rapidly as he did in Shoot The Pianist and Jules Et Jim: there’s even one of the director’s trademark freeze-frames. Yet the most compelling experiment in with chronology. The film begins with a short, never-returned to framing device in the present in which a woman can’t find the book she wants, and then flashes back a year to reveal the reason for the book’s absence. Even then, the film becomes the parallel narrative of how Camille ended up in prison, and her manipulation of the naive sociology professor determined to clear her reputation as a tramp.
What follows is a satirical juxtaposition of two poles of French intelligence: book-smart and street-smart. Not that there’s any contest. Camille might be in the lineage of femme fatales but her expert manipulation of approximately half a dozen different men isn’t feared but celebrated by Truffaut. Somehow, material that is utterly cynical in content is insouciance itself on screen. Far from being misogynistic, Truffaut finds a kindred spirit in Camille: she’s a female version of Antoine Doinel in The 400 Blows, a connection cemented when she escapes from juvenile detention.
But mostly Une Belle Fille Comme Moi is about the power of cinema to help life take flight, like young Camille in the hay. An audaciously messy final act sees the professor enlist a budding filmmaker to achieve an unlikely redemption for Camille. In contrast, TV is shown to deal the killer blow of cold, hard fact. Who needs reality when Camille can roam free on the daydream of celluloid?
Une Belle Fille Comme Moi is released on Blu-ray and DVD on Monday 15th September. Artifical Eye’s ongoing Truffaut revival continues to do the business, with the main extra here being the director’s early short (and Bernadette Lafont’s debut) Les Mistons (1957).

Wonderful book…the excerpt takes me back to my childhood. Dee
Dru Ann,
Thanks so much for this! I look forward to being able to give away an eBook of Horse Country – A World of Horses!
Oh my would love to read this book. Have two horses of my own. They are the best!!!!!!
This is a lovely book with a well drawn character, I’d love to read it.
This sounds very interesting. One of my bucket list is to ride a horse.
When I was a teen, I rode all the time, and my life was horses for a number of years. My book report in 8th grade was on Horses, and I did all the art work myself for that report which was about 50 pages long, about 45 pages longer than any other student’s report!! 🙂 My favorite riding experience was on the beach in Hawaii and up the sides of a mountain there too. Love the sounds of your book and would love it for my granddaughter who is going to horse camp this summer.
Hey Christine!
This is the first piece I have actually seen from the book. It sounds absolutely wonderful. I can’t wait to read it. Any book about horses has my interest instantly, but this one sounds exceptional. I can’t tell Pie about it, he will want me to read it to him! lol!
This sounds like a book both my daughter and I would enjoy reading. Horses are so much a part of our lives. 🙂
Thanks Christine for the excerpt + giveaway on your latest book.

Published 4:00 am, Saturday, January 10, 2004
Caption
Frederick M. Hoar, a well-known Silicon Valley public relations and marketing executive, has died after a three-year bout with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. He was 77.
Mr. Hoar, who died Jan. 2, helped scores of prominent technology companies develop and promote their brands -- among them RCA, Fairchild Semiconductor and Genentech. From 1980 to 1984, he served as vice president of communications for Apple Computer, where he was involved with the company's initial public offerings and product launches. Among other jobs, he also served as chairman of Miller/Shandwick Technologies, an international public relations agency, until
"Fred was a Silicon Valley phenomenon who brought a joie de vivre to each one of his endeavors," said Wilf Corrigan, chairman and chief executive officer of LSI Logic. "He will be impossible to replace."
In 1999, Mr. Hoar was named one of the "Top 100 Most Influential Public Relations People of the 20th Century" by PR Week, a trade publication. He was a founding member of the Band of Angels, a Silicon Valley private investment group, and, over the years, served as director on the boards of dozens of Silicon Valley startup companies.
He was a tireless public speaker, addressing groups such as the Semiconductor Industry Association and the Software Development Forum, and he also was an avid writer. He was in the final stage of completing his memoirs on the birth of Silicon Valley.
Educated as a journalist, Mr. Hoar loved the English language, said Mike Markkula, a longtime friend.
"It was not just happenstance that his address was on Chaucer Street in Palo Alto," said Markkula, chairman of the board of trustees at Santa Clara University, where Mr. Hoar taught marketing to undergraduate and graduate students. Last month, he was awarded with the Extra-Ordinary Faculty Award, the highest honor bestowed upon a faculty member at the university's Leavey School of Business. He continued to teach until six weeks before his death.
Born and raised in Beverly, Mass., Mr. Hoar served in the Navy from 1944 to 1946. He studied American history and literature, and graduated cum laude from Harvard University. He later received a master's degree in editorial journalism from the University of Iowa.
He is survived by his wife, Sheila, of Palo Alto; and daughters Cheryl of Mockville, N.C., Deborah of Los Angeles, Donna of Inverness, and Jocelyn of Palo Alto.
A memorial service has been held.

Everything had a solid routine, learning golem craft from her mother and helping her father sell parfums. And then she was shipped off to the maze of Chel and she learned very quickly the arts of her parent's clan the Qin'dalasque. She learned from observation and maneuvered through the maze with cunning. Eventually she slipped into the role of the socialite and gossiper. She spent her time between her studies she played the gossiping merchant girl, with little in her head beyond the latest rumor and where the next party will be.
For 25 years her life passed like this and while she didn't really make a dent on the social scale enough to count, she was something. She just wasn't worthy of being called the "annoying busy body" girl even within her own circles. Still she managed to sort news and spread to those who would listen. It became a routine, right up in till she was dragged back home. Not literally thank goodness, but her parents pleaded money issues and there was just no keeping her in Orthorbbae. Upon her return, she sent back out due to her clan tradition though not as a girl from a fine merchant family. No she was simple another face in the crowd. A commoner.
It was a struggle. A serious struggle. It differed so greatly from her time in Orthorbbae that she would constant have to catch herself from reveling who she was. Yet, it was the same. The same need to survive, except this time she wasn't merely playing a role to avoid the fighting, killing, and feuds. No, she had different worries. Such as food, clothing, and those desperate or greedy enough to see her as food. Things that she had passed by in a carriage or had ignored as she walked down the street. Now she was one of them, slumped against the side of building her belly growling. Yet not all her studies were wasted. She quickly learned to the streets wicked games, petty cons and gambling. How to cheat well and how to know when you've been cheated. Most important, where information flows and the understanding that rumors, whispers, and lies were a nation life blood and the right words could send a group into ruins.
For years she wondered the streets of Val'Raveran, and then just before her Fall from Grace was complete the tainted scare began. The scary echo of the Nidraa'chal war ran through the marketplace and left Sik scarred with nightmares for months. A terrifying time, yet it cemented not just her place in her the clan, though what that place is has yet to be seen, but also her ideals on tainting. Given her range of talents, many have called upon her, but for the most part she works the casino as a "public" member using all her gained skills to not just gleam information from their patrons, but "aid" the house. When she isn't doing that, she is often in Velkyn gathering information from other agents elsewhere.
Description:
Height: 5'4"
Weight: 125 lbs
Eye Color: Burnt yellow
Hair Color: Mostly white, with the ends dyed rustic red to black.
General Appearance:
She carries to no visible scars, at least in her regular persona. She wears her wavy, waist length hair in a ponytail held at the nape of her neck with a black leather tie, with shoulder length bangs framing her sharp face (think fox tail).

Dir. David O. Russell
Writer/ director David O. Russell (I Heart Huckabees, Three Kings) releases his fourth film over six years (five if you count his uncredited work for Accidental Love) with a biopic following inventor/ mogul Joy Mangano in Joy. Russell’s go-to muse Jennifer Lawrence (The Hunger Games, X-Men: Days of Future Past) stars as Mangano to mark her third collaboration in four years with the filmmaker. Look for this duo to factor heavily into the Oscar race yet again. The plot spans four generations of her family with Robert De Niro, Bradley Cooper, Isabella Rossellini, Virginia Madsen, and Édgar Ramírez co-starring.The Collier County Sheriff’s Office teamed up with Meadow Lakes Apartments in East Naples for a safety day on Saturday. McGruff the Crime Dog, deputies and representatives from the East Naples Fire Department hung out at the community’s pool to answer safety questions from the residents.

A short time later David and Sarah were blessed with a beautiful baby girl and this week I was more than honored to be able to capture a few photos of this new chapter in their lives. David is a soldier of the U.S. Army so the family currently resides in Kansas. He recently returned safely from serving a tour and they are celebrating with a vacation visiting their families in California.

Here are 30 craft show tips for first timers:
- The very first suggestion is to do your analysis and just take part in shows that are really well promoted by people organizing it. You can easily identify craft shows within your location by checking web sites like Festival, Craft Fairs Online, National Craft Shows, however you need to look into them first. Take a look at last show sellers to get an understanding of the price range of exactly what these people provide so as to check out if your products will match in the price range of the other sellers.
- Print off a craft show checklist to use as a guide for your next craft show.
- Bring a close friend that can help you!
- Bring loads of calling cards!
- Reserve ahead of time due to the fact that not all great shows just allow duplicate sellers.
- Practice putting together your craft show booth before you arrive. Make the effort in your home and put together everything the way you like it. Make use of tape so as to gauge off precisely just how much space you will get. Take loads of pictures as well and this will certainly make putting together a lot simpler.
- Install an iPad or a smart TV/monitor along with a slide show of products you have actually created previously. If there are no iPad or electrical power, use a 3 ring binder with huge quality pictures in sheet protectors.
- Make a Facebook event for your Facebook Business Page providing the date, the time as well as location of the craft fair. Beginning two weeks ahead of time, update your social media with photos of what you are going to be offering once daily to provide your followers with a nice sneak peak.
- Spend for or borrow a tent that is going to cover on all of the sides. You need to cover the sides in order to safeguard your products if there is an upcoming strong wind or rainfall, and also in some cases you might need a divider between you and the other booths.
- Don’t forget tables & chairs. Cover the tables with high quality table cloths and use the space below to have product storage space.
- Make your area/booth a small retail shop by thinking about comfort, preparing the ambiance with rugs, lamps, plants, etc., add price tags on those products as well, presenting your products using multi-levels so as to bring eye up, preparing the products you are really offering using additional store acquired things like pumpkins, scarecrows, and ornaments, etc, and getting towers or displays that show up of the tent and make use of each sides of the tent so as to dangle products.
- And so you learn exactly how you need to create a great deal of products when it comes to the show right? Effectively, why not save yourself some time simply by making one product of your preferred products to show and after that take customized orders!
- In addition save yourself some time on products by creating a number of easy styles, certainly not every single design has to be over the top.
- Cover sold products in cellophane bags with raffia and fasten a business card to ensure that whenever shoppers bring it out, some other could inquire exactly where they bought it. CUSTOMERS PROMOTE FOR YOU!
- Fill up your craft show space along with products! You need to provide a bunch of products and your booth must be complete however not so complete that your eye does not know where to look. And so you need to see to it to carry enough things in order to restock as required but keep them unseen up until you need them.
- Put your very most costly products at eye level.
- Offer products of different price points. And so if you’re in the home decor business, provide centerpieces, lantern swags, bows, smaller wreaths, etc. In addition, try organizing products all together for a more costly price point (i.e, bracelet sets, 5 bows, a wreath and matching mailbox topper, etc.).
- Email message your contact list so as to let these people find out exactly where you will be as well as where to locate your booth.
- Make an Etsy Local Event. That allows known Etsy customers find craft fairs close to them. This also reveals good examples of exactly what these people can purchase during the course of the craft show.
- Sell your project materials! As an example, if in the home décor industry, offer brand-new unused accessories, complete unopened rolls of mesh, ribbon by rolls, holiday picks, signs, monograms, etc. You know you possess a lot of supplies in your stock and now is really a wonderful chance to try to sell of a few of them. Certainly price this to where you earn a profit, not just what you spent for it.
- Think about offering a set for buyers to create their very own pieces when they get home. You know you constantly hear, “I can make that.” Explain to them why your products cost more and so be truly prepped and provide them a kit. Offering your understanding always satisfies.
- Make use of the Sell On Etsy App and try to have the customer to take an e-mail receipt because the moment they get the receipt, it will certainly possess your branding and business link information.
- Catch buyers e-mails simply by holding a drawing of a premium item. You can easily make use of a QR code making it that a lot easier for you since the buyer types all of their information in for you. You can even ask for that they need to do 2 things, Like you on Facebook and provide their e-mail address.

Over the past decade, their region has seen an explosion of capital investment from huge corporations erecting sprawling megaplants, thanks to the area’s easy access to deep-water ports and abundant pipelines supplying cheap natural gas.
Two companies alone, Cheniere Energy and Cameron LNG, are collectively investing $29 billion in Cameron Parish into new facilities that process and export liquefied natural gas. Chenier Energy alone is spending about $20 billion, the equivalent of building the 10 costliest NFL stadiums.

But despite the investment, locals are unable to reap property taxes from the business for 10 years because of the industrial tax exemption.Advocate staff photo by LESLIE WESTBROOK
Theoretically, at least, the crush of new construction should be generating hundreds of millions of dollars in property tax revenue each year. Such a windfall would be transformative for a sprawling but rural community of less than 7,000 people that is still recovering from the twin blows of hurricanes Rita in 2005 and Ike in 2008, each of which deluged the parish with 12-foot storm surges.
But the truth is, even amid such a remarkable building boom, Cameron Parish's government is still limping along, short of money for basic needs like a new school and more sheriff's deputies.
The disconnect between the lack of resources for basic public services and the unprecedented capital investment in Cameron Parish can be traced to Louisiana’s Industrial Tax Exemption Program, which allows manufacturing facilities to be exempt from paying property taxes on new facilities for 10 years. By year 11, when their owners would be expected to start paying property taxes, the value of the industrial plants and machinery usually has depreciated so dramatically that local governments can hope to receive only a modest bump in collections.
That conundrum, and others around the state, explains why the Industrial Tax Exemption Program has come under fire in recent years. Even in a state that prides itself for a welcoming attitude toward industry -- even dirty industries that many other states discourage -- experts and some politicians have begun to question whether it makes sense to give away so much for so little.
Nowhere in the state do the consequences of the program play out more spectacularly than they do here, in a place that is simultaneously one of Louisiana's largest and least populous parishes. Cameron Parish has no local sales tax. And though local government operations are almost entirely dependent on property taxes, there are few businesses outside of the industrial plants that bring in tax revenue.
From 2011 to 2016, Cameron Parish's forgone property taxes amounted to $4.2 billion -- an average of $700 million a year. Incredibly, that works out to more than $100,000 for every man, woman and child in the parish, each year. The parish exempts about 10 times the amount of property taxes it collects, far and away the highest such ratio in the state.
Right next door, Calcasieu Parish, home to Lake Charles, was No. 2 among Louisiana’s 64 parishes in industrial tax exemptions, with $2.8 billion given away over that same span. Between them, those two parishes accounted for more forgone property taxes through the Industrial Tax Exemption Program than the other 62 parishes combined..
In part, that's because those parishes are home to relatively few people and thus have fewer other taxpayers to draw on. For example, East Baton Rouge Parish, the state's most populous, is No. 7 in the amount given away, forgoing $388 million over six years. But because of its large tax base, the parish still collects six times in total property taxes what it exempts for industry.
Cameron Parish’s administrator and schools superintendent say they have a list of $2 billion in infrastructure needs, including plans to replace a new school that's still in use despite being damaged by Hurricane Ike.
Because parish officials have had their hands tied by the industrial tax exemption, which is granted by a state board that typically rubber-stamps applications, they have attempted to broker deals that go around the program. These have involved getting companies to agree to pony up some property tax payments during the first decade in exchange for a lower tax burden over the long term. At least one of these deals has been controversial locally, riling up taxpayers and requiring court intervention.
Cameron Parish’s efforts to work around the tax exemption may offer a glimpse into Louisiana’s future, as government and corporate officials nervous about recent changes to the program implemented last year could seek similar arrangements. Although the effect of the program is most obvious in Cameron Parish, the diversion of property tax dollars through the program happens across the state, affecting budgets for police protection, pothole filling, pay for public school teachers and other government services.
It’s an especially pressing issue in Louisiana’s industrial core, which, along with Cameron and Calcasieu, includes the string of parishes along the Mississippi River between Baton Rouge and New Orleans.
The revamp of the program, made through a 2016 executive order signed by Gov. John Bel Edwards, aimed to change the approval process from a fait accompli in which nearly every project is accepted to one where local governmental bodies, like the Cameron Parish Police Jury, decide whether they can afford a particular exemption.

Over the past 20 years, Exxon Mobil has been exempted from paying almost $700 million in property taxes that would have otherwise helped pay f…
The tax exemption had other weaknesses in the view of the governor and his appointees at Louisiana Economic Development. Unlike similar programs in other states, Louisiana's industrial incentive lacked job requirements, was given even for routine capital investments and was awarded to every eligible company for a full 10 years at 100 percent forgiveness without consideration of the merits of the project.
"Four out of every five states have a property tax exemption for manufacturers, but Louisiana was the only state to approve those exemptions without formal input from the local taxing bodies that provide the exemption," Edwards said by way of explaining the new process. "I thought it was time to change that."
A tax swap
After 2005’s Hurricane Rita, Cheniere Energy found itself in a tough spot. It was building its regasification facility -- where liquified natural gas is converted back to gas -- in Cameron Parish, but the damaged roads and spotty infrastructure of the decimated parish couldn't support the needs of the growing industrial campus.
The parish didn't have the tax revenue to make improvements quickly, and the tax exemption the company enjoyed was only going to further delay progress. So Cheniere and the Police Jury struck a deal to have the company pay $25 million in property taxes over its first 10 years, rather than being totally exempt. The deal would work like a loan, with the company getting a dollar-for-dollar credit over its second decade for those early payments.
Those dollars have generated an extra $361,000 a year for the Police Jury, which was used for road improvements and to rebuild government buildings. The school system received $812,000 a year and was able to issue bonds to rebuild two schools damaged by Rita.
Last year, Cameron LNG officials tried to negotiate a similar deal. But their version was going to give the parish much more money up front in exchange for a smaller tax burden for the company over the long run.
The proposed deal called for Cameron LNG to pay $24.5 million a year for 20 years, amounting to almost $500 million. In its first year, the deal would have boosted Cameron Parish’s property tax revenues by almost two-thirds. Even so, the parish assessor projected that the deal ultimately would cost the parish $1.5 billion it otherwise would have collected.
Local officials called the assessor's projections of lost revenue too high, saying he didn’t appropriately account for the rapid depreciation of industrial equipment. They also said he failed to consider that tax rates likely would be reduced as more money came in, limiting the company’s future tax liability.
But many residents sided with the assessor. They were worried about giving up so much future tax revenue, money that ultimately could mean dramatically lower bills for themselves, as well as better schools and infrastructure.
Ultimately, the deal was deemed unconstitutional by a district court judge and then an appellate court, both of which found that property taxes, by law, have to be tied to fair market values and cannot be arbitrarily assigned. The deal that parish officials had confected with Cameron LNG did not meet that test.
Margaret Jones, who retired after working for Cameron Parish schools for 30 years, was a leader of the fight against the bargain. She said it was frustrating to watch a huge corporation get a pass on hundreds of millions of dollars she felt the parish badly needed.
"The School Board and the rest of the parish are very dependent on property tax income," Jones said. "It's not like LNGs are really fantastic neighbors to have, so when you encourage businesses to come to your town, you expect them to hire local people and pay their taxes. That's why you want them here."
Ironically, perhaps, opponents and advocates of the Cameron LNG deal all wanted the same thing: financial security for a struggling parish. The question was how to achieve it. Police Jury and School Board officials said there was major value in getting around the 10-year waiting period and building predictability into their budget.
Ryan Bourriaque, the parish’s administrator, also said he believes the rapid depreciation schedule for industrial machinery means assumptions about revenues in the second decade are iffy. Manufacturing and industrial equipment loses most of its taxable value in the first 10 years -- usually more than 90 percent of it, according to Jay Delafield, a tax attorney in Lake Charles who helped negotiate the Cameron LNG deal for the parish.
"When industrial tax exemptions of those facilities finally come on the tax rolls, what percent do you think we get from the original contract?" Bourriaque asked rhetorically. "The answer is: hardly nothing. And that's a fact."
But Brian Eddington, general counsel to the Louisiana Assessors' Association, said that's a bit of an exaggeration. He said industrial improvements typically depreciate by about 60 percent or more by the time the manufacturers are required to pay taxes again.
It's not an entirely settled question, though it's an important one, especially when considering the effects of a 10-year break. According to the state's suggested depreciation schedule, petroleum industry machinery has depreciation schedules ranging from 10 to 25 years -- meaning at least some of the equipment could have no value after 10 years.
"We looked at it like: What is the value of certainty in having a dedicated revenue stream that would not fluctuate, that would allow us to issue bonds, that would allow us to budget accordingly, that would allow us the infrastructure improvements that we don't have now," Bourriaque said.
Although they’re at odds over whether the deal was good for the parish, Bourriaque and Jones generally see eye to eye on what the parish needs.
On a recent day, Jones sat in her car for 30 minutes at the Calcasieu Ship Channel, waiting for a 60-year-old ferry to arrive to haul her across the narrow waterway, which is only a few hundred yards wide. The north-south strait, which flows to the Gulf, divides the parish. The unreliable ferry is the only way across — other than a two-hour detour north to go around it.

Both Jones and Bourriaque separately complained that either the ferry needs to be replaced or a bridge built to take its place. They also both cited the need for coastal restoration projects, like a seawall, to protect the low-lying parish from Gulf storms.
Last year, the Cheniere agreement expired, and its impact on tax rolls is already being felt. The Police Jury and the Sheriff's Office are both short an extra $360,000 a year they had been receiving for 10 years.
Schools Superintendent Charles Atkins says his system is operating at a deficit, quickly burning through a reserve account after voters rejected a property tax renewal a few years ago.
Even the narrow roads that surround some of the new industrial construction are in lousy condition, Jones said. And she said she thinks the companies are to blame — directly and indirectly.
“The roads are in bad shape; they've put terrible stress on our waterworks, and these are the types of things that taxes pay for," Jones said. "If they don't want to foot the bill, then what's the point?"
Absent the deal, Cameron LNG's operations will take the industrial tax exemption.
"It was unfortunate that the proposed cooperative endeavor agreement was denied as we strive to contribute to the growth of the economy," said spokeswoman Anya McInnis in a statement on behalf of the company. "However, we remain committed to being a good corporate partner in Cameron Parish."
A new workaround?
After the Cameron LNG deal was killed by the courts, it was given a second chance by the Louisiana Legislature.
Dubbed the "PILOT" bill, for "payments in lieu of taxes," it was sponsored by state Rep. Alan Seabaugh, R-Shreveport, who said it was a direct outgrowth of the implosion of the Cameron LNG deal.
The bill was approved by the House and had the governor’s backing. But it was killed in a Senate committee.
"There was a perception that big national companies were going to dupe these poor, uninformed police juries into bad deals," Seabaugh said of the bill’s critics. "I think the police juries and school boards are sophisticated enough to make their own decisions."
Parish tax assessors and Together Louisiana, a faith-based advocacy organization, joined forces to kill the bill. Seabaugh said assessors were motivated by self-interest: A small percentage of property tax valuations go to fund the assessors’ retirement system, and the bill would have allowed some massive projects to be taken off the tax rolls.
Eddington, of the assessors group, called the accusation "asinine," adding that assessors' individual retirement payments are based on years of service, not how much is in the fund.
"It's ridiculous," he said. "The reason we're opposed to it is because it wrecks the tax code. Everything is based on the simple premise that everybody is taxed in the same way."
Seabaugh said he’s certain the bill will get another hearing. Fiscal bills can be filed only every other year, so he said the bill will either be filed in a special session next year or the regular session in 2019.
Cameron Parish officials said they're hopeful the law will be changed so they can resume negotiations with Cameron LNG.
Worth it?
Despite the challenges the industrial tax exemption has created, local officials say they are still largely supportive of the program. And although they're struggling to come up with money, they still trust the state government officials who gave away their tax dollars in the first place.
"I'm sure those economic development professionals are well-versed on those programs and have an understanding of why they're needed," Bourriaque said.
And they recognize that they’ve gotten some economic benefits from their new megaplants — even if they haven’t taken the form of tax receipts.
In 2016, Cameron Parish had the lowest annual unemployment rate in the state at 4.4 percent, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Its average weekly wage last year was $1,471, good for No. 1 in Louisiana and above the national average.
Although Cameron Parish actually lost 42 manufacturing jobs between 2011 and 2016, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the total number of jobs in the parish quadrupled over the same period. That number, which includes temporary construction jobs, jumped from 2,700 jobs to more than 11,000 -- 1½ jobs for every man, woman and child in the parish.
"We, the Police Jury, have never given away one single dollar. The state did that," Bourriaque said. "But let's say the industrial tax exemption never existed ... can we guarantee these companies would have located here otherwise?"
Jones has a different take.
Around town, there are lots filled with dingy white campers and mobile homes where temporary construction workers live, transients who will leave once the construction boom is over.
Cameron LNG and the other plants say they'll create hundreds of permanent jobs, but Jones wondered aloud if the cost to taxpayers is worth the billions in lost property taxes.

Absent the PILOT deal, Cameron LNG can rest on its industrial tax exemptions, which from 2003 to 2017 amounted to $3.1 billion in relief. Cameron LNG said it expects to employ about 275 people; however, 50 of those people will work in Houston. So far, each Louisiana job created by Cameron LNG is costing taxpayers roughly $13.7 million in lost revenue.
In a visit to a couple of the plants, Jones frowned as she pointed out dozens of cars with Texas license plates going in and coming out. She wondered what Louisiana is getting out of the bargain.

And for 30 years, my salary was paid for at the school system from property taxes,” she said. “I just feel like everyone should pay what they owe.”From 2005 to 2010, McPhee was dean of the School of Social Work at Barry University in Miami Shores, Fla., where she had also served as associate dean and a faculty member.

We are, by all historical accounts, NOT a peaceful race. Our entire evolutionary existence is derived from us fighting each other in order to survive -- fighting for the best places to live, the best hunting grounds for food, the best mates for passing on the most successful genes, etc. We use violence and violence in competition as means to test ourselves, guage ourselves with our fellow social members.

Hence why I argue, that violence is a huge part of who we are as a species.

Being "banned for children" has now made this game the "coolest" ever. Those in the child's world who have played it will be legends, those who own a copy will become royalty. To the point where other children will falsely befriend them, for just the chance at that one opportunity for a play.

Ottawa, 1 August 2014
Coast Broadcasting Ltd.
St. John’s and Bluff Point, Newfoundland and Labrador
Application 2013‑0554‑0
CKSJ-FM St. John’s – Addition of a transmitter at Bluff Point
The Commission approves the application by Coast Broadcasting Ltd. to amend the broadcasting licence for the English-language commercial radio station CKSJ-FM St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador, to add a rebroadcasting transmitter at Bluff Point.
As a result, listeners in the Clarenville area will be able to receive CKSJ‑FM’s signal.
Application
- Coast Broadcasting Ltd. (Coast Broadcasting) filed an application to amend the broadcasting licence for the English-language commercial radio station CKSJ-FM St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador, to add a rebroadcasting transmitter at Bluff Point. The Commission received interventions in support of this application.
- The new transmitter would operate at 107.5 MHz (channel 298B) with an average effective radiated power (ERP) of 11,630 watts (maximum ERP of 25,500 watts with an effective height of antenna above average terrain (EHAAT) of 126.3 metres).Footnote 1
Commission’s analysis and decisions
- The Commission generally assesses the merits of applications for technical changes on the basis of demonstrated economic need or technical evidence that a station’s existing technical parameters are not adequate to provide the service as originally proposed. In this case, while the applicant did cite a technical need, the Commission is of the view that the application primarily reflects the applicant’s desire to level the playing field in the St. John’s/Clarenville area. Accordingly, as an exception the Commission does not consider it appropriate to assess the present application on the basis of economic or technical need.
- Rather, after examining the public record for this application in light of applicable regulations and policies, the Commission considers that the issues it must address are the following:
- the potential impact of the addition of the transmitter on listeners in adjacent communities;
- whether the proposed change makes appropriate use of spectrum; and
- whether the addition of a new transmitter would have an undue negative impact on other radio stations serving the market.
Impact on listeners in adjacent communities
- Coast Broadcasting submitted that the proposed transmitter was necessary to alleviate reception problems for CKSJ-FM in communities on the western side of Conception Bay North and on the Trans Canada Highway between St. John’s and Clarenville. Further, the applicant argued that the new transmitter was necessary to level the playing field with other St. John’s stations whose signals reach Clarenville (through the use of rebroadcasting transmitters). With regard to its actual limited coverage, Coast Broadcasting indicated that in its original application for a licence, it had proposed an ERP of 100,000 watts.Footnote 2 However, the Department of Industry approved an ERP of only 20,000 watts due to a potential to overload the locator beacon at the St. John’s airport.
- Further, Coast Broadcasting submitted a map with its application showing the combined coverage areas of CKSJ-FM’s existing transmitter and its proposed rebroadcasting transmitter. The map indicates that the new transmitter will produce a primary contour that encompasses the Clarenville area, thereby increasing CKSJ-FM’s overall coverage. The transmitter will also serve to fill in gaps toward the west of St. John, although coverage in those areas will only be at the 0.5 mV/m service level.
- The Commission considers that while the new transmitter would correct signal deficiencies in the St. John’s/Clarenville area, it would primarily serve to make the station more competitive with other St. John’s stations broadcasting into Clarenville. Accordingly, the Commission finds that approval of the application would provide an alternate signal to the listeners on the western side of Conception Bay North and on the Trans Canada Highway from St. John’s to Clarenville.
Use of spectrum
- The Commission considers that the technical parameters chosen would provide adequate service to Clarenville. While the proposed frequency is the last allotted frequency available for assignment in Clarenville, the Commission considers that there are other drop-in frequencies available that could be used to serve the area.
- In light of the above, the Commission finds that Coast Broadcasting’s proposal makes appropriate use of spectrum.
Impact on other stations
- Coast Broadcasting indicated that it expects to draw only a modest amount of incremental revenues, mostly from national advertising, if the application is approved. It further stated that it does not intend to solicit local advertising in Clarenville. As well, the Commission notes that no operators of radio stations serving St. John’s and Clarenville intervened in opposition to the application.
- In addition, the Commission notes that the classic hits format that CKSJ-FM provides is not currently available to listeners in Clarenville from incumbent stations serving the market.
- Accordingly, the Commission finds that approval of the application would not have an undue negative financial impact on other stations in the market and that approval would increase the diversity of programming available in the Clarenville area.
Conclusion
- In light of all of the above, the Commission approves the application by Coast Broadcasting Ltd. to amend the broadcasting licence for the English-language commercial radio programming undertaking CKSJ-FM St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador, to add a rebroadcasting transmitter at Bluff Point.
- The new transmitter will operate at 107.5 MHz (channel 298B) with an average ERP of 11,630 watts (maximum ERP of 25,500 watts with an EHAAT of 126.3 metres).
- 1 August 2016. In order to ensure that such a request is processed in a timely manner, it should be submitted in writing at least 60 days before that date.
Expectation
- In light of its stated intention to not solicit local advertising in Clarenville, the Commission expects that the licensee will not solicit local advertising in Clarenville.

Law is concerned with human behaviour. Although different societies encourage different forms of behaviour all human beings have the capacity to behave in any way prescribed, on the condition we do understand what the law requires us to do. The same applies to legal translation, which in order to be successful in terms of communication must incorporate target language-oriented text-normative equivalents.
Legal translators are usually ‘left to their own devices’ in making their decisions as to the right stylistics and tone to be adopted in translation. These decisions are usually based on comparative analysis of random parallel texts, which may prove to be a time-consuming and tiresome activity.
This ‘introduction’ aims to offer practical information regarding the conventions and norms which are characteristic of legislative texts. It is also designed to aid translators in their work by offering a practical comparative manual of the Polish and English drafting styles and other useful information on legal translation.
Legal norm.
A legal norm can be defined to contain a normative statement that produces some legal effects. Any legal norm must convey information in order to fulfil its function of communicating standards of behaviour. Consequently, a norm serves as a scheme of interpretation. The problem of the legal norm has also been discussed in terms of ‘legislative sentences’ which consist of the following elements:
– fact-situation (Tatbestand) which specifies the conditions under which the particular rule operates – in other words, it gives conditions of application of a given norm
– statement of law (Tatfolge) which prescribes the action to be taken and by whom in the event the conditions constituting the fact-situation are met
Fact-situation in English legislative sentences.
The statement of law, which specifies its modality, is always in the main clause (or clauses), whereas the elements pertaining to the fact-situation are more flexible, being formulated as adverbial modifiers in a subordinate ‘if’ or ‘where’ clause. The clauses which express fact-situation can be introduced in English by conjunctions such as ‘if’ (jeżeli, jeśli), ‘on condition that’ (pod warunkiem, że...), ‘provided that’ (pod warunkiem, że..., o ile...), ‘providing that’ (pod warunkiem, że..., o ile...), ‘so / as long as’ (dopóki..., tak długo jak..., pod warunkiem, że...) and ‘unless’ (jeżeli nie..., jeśli nie..., o ile nie..., chyba że...). In the case of English legislative texts, however, legal rules are being formulated mostly as conditional sentences, with ‘if’ – clauses and ‘where’– clauses introducing the fact-situation.
Fact-situation in Polish legislative sentences
The clauses which express fact-situation can be introduced in Polish by conjunctions such as jeżeli, jeśli, w przypadku gdy, w wypadku gdy, pod warunkiem, chyba że, o ile, w razie. See the following examples:
jeżeli = ‘where’ / ‘if’ / ‘embedded fact situation’
Jeżeli wspólnik nie uiścił dopłaty w określonym terminie, obowiązany jest do zapłaty odsetek ustawowych... . (KSH Art. 178 § 2)
Where a shareholder fails to make an additional payment by the specified date, he shall be obliged to pay statutory interest... . (CCC1)
If a shareholder does not pay the additional contribution within a specified deadline, he shall pay statutory interest... . (PCCC)
w wypadku gdy = ‘when’
Przepis powyższy stosuje się odpowiednio w wypadku, gdy umowa została zawarta w imieniu osoby prawnej, która nie istnieje. (KC Art. 39 § 2)
The above provision shall correspondingly apply when a contract has been concluded in the name of a legal person which is non-existent. (PCC)
pod warunkiem = ‘on condition that’
Stosowanie niebezpiecznych substancji i niebezpiecznych preparatów chemicznych jest dopuszczalne pod warunkiem zastosowania środków zapewniających pracownikom ochronę ich zdrowia i życia. (KP Art. 221 § 3)
Hazardous chemical substances and preparations may be used on condition that measures are taken to protect the health and life of employees. (PLC)
chyba że = ‘unless’ / ‘save as’
Jeżeli akcjonariusz nie dokonał wpłaty w terminie określonym w §1, jest on obowiązany do zapłacenia odsetek ustawowych za opóźnienie lub odszkodowania, chyba że statut stanowi inaczej. (KSH Art. 330 § 5)
If the shareholder fails to make the payment on the date specified in §1, the shareholder shall pay statutory interest on delay or damages, unless the statutes provide otherwise. (PCCC)
Save as otherwise provided in the company articles, a shareholder who has failed to make payment by the date referred to in paragraph 1 shall be liable to pay statutory interest for the default, or damages. (PCOCPAC)

This actually used to be standard practice for a long time; the crude diagram below shows how this worked.
When the combustion air duct is connected directly to the return plenum for a furnace, the blower fan on the furnace pulls outdoor air in to the return plenum. To supply this air to the furnace room, a supply register is added at the ductwork in the same room, typically right above the furnace. This is an undesirable setup, for a number of reasons.
Waste of Energy
During the winter, this setup pulls cold outdoor air in to the house, directly in to the return plenum for the furnace. While a combustion air duct that terminates at the floor will allow cold air to come in to the house, it's not nearly as much air compared to the duct connected to the furnace return plenum. When it's very cold outside outside, that's a ridiculous amount of cold air being pumped in to the house, but because it gets tempered by the furnace, nobody feels it. This is a big waste of energy.
During the summer, the opposite happens. This setup pulls warm, moist outdoor air in to the house just before the air conditioner's evaporator coil, as shown below. Again, this is a waste of energy.
Pressurizes the House
When a combustion air duct is connected directly to the return plenum on a furnace, the house becomes pressurized when the furnace blower fan starts running. How does this air leave the house? Any way it can; plenty of these household air leaks were covered in this post about why houses need combustion air ducts.
The air leaks that really cause problems are the air leaks found in the attic. Attic air leaks lead to frost in the attic as well as ice dams, and the effect is magnified when a combustion air duct is connected to a furnace return plenum.
Code Violation
As a home inspector I don't get hung up on code requirements, but as long as I'm blogging about this topic, it's worth mentioning that the Minnesota State Mechanical Code no longer allows the combustion air duct to be connected to the return plenum. Section 708.1, #3 says:
[Combustion air ducts shall:] Terminate in an unobstructed space allowing free movement of combustion air to the appliances.
Frequently Disabled
While it's common for home inspectors to find combustion air ducts stuffed shut with clothing inside the house, it's actually even more common for the combustion air duct to be disabled when it's connected to the return plenum.
Remember, that register above the furnace is what supplies combustion air to the furnace room. Because this register is located right above the furnace, it's also the most powerful register in the house, which makes the furnace room very warm during the winter. When well-intentioned homeowners don't understand how their combustion air is connected, they assume that the register above the furnace is only there to supply heat to the room, so they block it off to get more heat to the areas that matter. This prevents combustion air from getting to the appliances that need it.
Note the cardboard blocking this opening in the photo below, despite the stern warning from the HVAC contractor.
What To Do
If the connection from the combustion air duct to the return plenum is visible inside the house, the fix for this situation is simple: have the combustion air duct disconnected from the furnace return plenum, and have the duct dropped down in to the room. Also, have the old hole in the return plenum blocked off.
Any HVAC contractor should be able to help make this simple change, which is something we've recommended to countless home inspection clients.

…Body Armor
Do you have a favorite??…

AmicalementArmand
Well, the Russians have gone with a 9.3mm version of their classic SVD Dragunov for busting heavy body armor, but that's a specialty weapon.
As long as we're talking about a limited-production option, my most-likely winner would be something like the HK M110A1, issued one or two to every squad.
If this 'need' still exists after the LSAT rifles are rolled out, my money would be on a scaled-up LSAT (like the AR10 to the AR15), probably equivalent to a .338 Lapua.
Meh…..just use a 40mm grenade, don't need to penetrate, just remove all the bits peeking out from behind the armour!
Unless the 40mm grenade has been radically designed since the last time I used one, the bursting charge is about the size of the tip of your pinky and the fragments consist entirely of pieces of an over-designed and not very dependable fusing system. Given the very real possibility that a direct hit at close range wouldn't detonate, I think I'd rather have a rifle with decent armor-piercing capabilities.
Of course, I've been saying that since DoD inflicted that worthless piece of plastic and aluminum garbage on armed forces that deserved a weapon that actually worked.
LT
From the article it appears that they are looking for something better than the 5.56 at penetration that won't be too cumbersome and still allow the trooper to carry a 210 round ammo load.
Something for more general issue rather than a specialty limited issue weapon.
Seems to call for something in 7.62 to my mind, which at least appears to be the interim solution the Army is looking to.
FN-FAL modernised with lighter furniture? Effective at a longer range, capable of semi, burst and auto fire… proven in combat… cheap and readily available…
WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.
Artillery is the big killer in modern war. I don't think you can make a bit of body armor proof against splinters from a 155mm shell. Stop trying to play the newspaper game of "fairness."
What isn't so clear to me is how this is really distinguished from having a designated marksman with an M14 in every fireteam… is it seeking a potential replacement, seeking to increase the density of weapons with similar capabilities, or?
Read an interesting paper arguing that the next generation of military small arms will use a general purpose round between 6 and 6.8mm with some form of advanced cartridge technology – telescoped polymer or telescoped caseless rounds – to reduce further the weight carried by soldiers. Not sure about its effectiveness re level IV body armour but then again that is, I guess, what machine guns, 40mm grenades and support weapons are for.

THE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE SEASICK IN TIE AIR November I, 1917, Evening. You know November in France. I've been here almost two weeks now and am still a l'entrainment; that is, I haven't started in to do any regular work yet. Only five times have I been able to fly in two weeks. But I've got my own machine and mechanic, everything is in order, and I've been assigned to a patrol the last two mornings when it rained. Tomorrow again at 8.50 with four others-patrol for one hour and fifty minutes at about 15,000 feet, back and forth over our sector, sometimes over our own lines, sometimes in Bochie. I'm getting very impatient to get started. In what few flights I've had, I've been work ing on acrobacy a bit and am gradually learning a few simple things; twice I stayed up a little too.long and had to lie down a few hours afterward, almost sea sick. I like Spa 84 very much indeed. The Frenchmen there are regular fellahs. Wertheimer, a sergeant, is a sort of in formal and unadmitted chief of the sous officiers. It is he that speaks English and has helped us a lot in getting settled, etc. Very much of a gentleman he is and understands a bit of Anglo-Saxon customs and eccentricities, always gay and an in defatigable worker. We have all been arranging the one big room of our barracks-dining room, reading-room, and probably eventually American bar. The walls are covered with green cloth, green paper (of two different shades and neither quite the same as the cloth), red cloth (on top as a sort of frieze), and red paper.

FED AMAZINGLY FOR FOUR FRANCS A DAY Wertem (as Wertheimer is called) and Deborte have done most of the work. Deborte is also chef de popote, which means housekeeper, and a very efficient man. For four francs per day we are fed amazingly well, especially when one realizes that we are near the front in a country which has had three years of war. Deborte hasn't the pleasantest man ner in the world at times, but usually is very agreeable, willing to tell me things about flying or the escadrille, always ready to work, and a dependable man in the air. And Verber, who rooms with Wer tem, he speaks a little English; has a great deal of trouble understanding it, but is picking up; wears a monocle all the time, because he's got a bum eye; carries a stick, and has an extremely ec centric appearance, but withal is very agreeable and a very valuable man. He has the habit of taking long trips all alone, far into Germany, just to see what is going on. Pinot is the name of the little roly poly chap everybody calls Bul-Bul, who used to be a mechanic and now is a very good, merry pilot. He has a great pen chant towards Pinard, is violently but not at all objectionably non-aristocratic, is forever laughing or kidding some one, walks on his hands to amuse people, and is the delight of all the mecanos. Demeuldre is a very quiet sort of school-boy type, who has been a pilot of biplanes and reconnaissance machines for a long time. He came to the escadrille recently with a record of two Boches as pilot of a biplane (that is, his machine gun man did the shooting and they both get credit), and a few days ago brought down a German in flames, his first as pilot de chasse. There are two others away on permission, whom I don't know yet. ESCAPING DESTRUCTION BY A MIRACLE Somewhere in France, November 13, 1917. DEAR FATHER: Campbell was in the Lafayette Escadrille and they are a mem ber of the same group as Spa 84, so I have asked them about him. He was on a patrol with another chap; they attacked some Boches and when it was over the other chap was alone. Campbell was brought down in German territory and so reported missing. I believe that the chap he was with has seen and talked to Campbell's father or some close relative since. 101

Callie Green turns 107 years old today, with the grace of God, and will have her cake and eat it, too, said her grand-niece, Marilyn Guillory.
As expected for someone born a century ago, Green tires more easily. This past year, she was hospitalized for cardiac care related to her pacemaker, but emerged from it and went home.
Now there's a baby in the house, Benjamin Guillory, born about six months ago.
"Bring me my baby," Marilyn Guillory said her great-aunt likes to say.
When they greet one another, she coos. He coos.
"She's passing along the wisdom," Marilyn Guillory said. "Only they know about it."
A year ago, The Enterprise reported that Green might be Beaumont's oldest person. Although it's difficult to prove, Green is certainly a contender.
She was born on Dec. 1, 1909, and raised on Plum Avenue. She lived most of her life in the Magnolia Park area and always has lived in Beaumont.
Green worked all her life to support an extended family. She never got the chance to raise her own child, who died of whooping cough as a newborn.
Instead, Green dedicated her life to business, operating three blues clubs in Beaumont in the 1970s and a boarding house.
"She was a business person," Guillory said. "She was good at making money."
When Guillory was about 7, she and her brother frequently visited their great aunt's home, where they noticed a lot of people coming and going.
"I finally asked, 'Why are so many people over?'" she said. Green told her she turned the home into a boarding house.
These days, Green is mostly in bed, Guillory said.
"We don't take her to church anymore," she said, though Green is still a member of St. Peter Missionary Baptist Church on South Fourth Street.
Guillory said her great aunt helped raise Guillory's mother and cared for her in the last years of her life.
Now, she's got her baby Benjamin, who is her great-great-grand nephew.

Dead mystery child dumped in suitcase in Australia
The skeletal remains of a young child have been found dumped in bushland in southern Australia, with police Thursday looking for an elderly man seen carrying a suitcase in the area.
Superintendent Des Bray told reporters the dead child, whose sex has not been determined and is believed to have been aged between two and seven, was likely killed elsewhere.
He said the body was stuffed in a suitcase and left alongside the Karoonda Highway, 130 kilometres (81 miles) east of Adelaide, some four to six weeks ago.
By the time it was found by a passing motorist on Tuesday, the remains were about two metres away from the bag.
“The child was originally in the suitcase and at some point, somebody has, we believe removed the child from the suitcase,” he said.
“It’s hard to say what happened, and why, but we know for certain that somebody has come, found the suitcase, opened it to have a look what was in there, tipped out the contents and at that stage become aware that it was most likely human remains.”
Police said it appeared that someone had pulled the suitcase from where it had originally been dumped and placed it in full view of the road.
“It was right in the open and easily able to be seen,” Bray said.
Other items were found but police have not revealed what they were as they searched the area and door knocked homes in the nearby small town of Wynarka.
Bray said they were looking for a neatly-dressed man, aged about 60, who was seen at Wynarka walking towards the highway some weeks ago carrying a suitcase early one morning.
“We have no description of the clothes he was wearing but he was carrying a dark-coloured suitcase in one hand… he was not a local,” he added in comments carried by the ABC.
“There would not be many people walking around Wynarka carrying a suitcase at 7:30am in the morning.”
A post-mortem was being conducted on the body as authorities appealed for information.
“Somebody must know somebody where a child has disappeared in suspicious circumstances,” Bray said.
“So we would encourage people to have a think about family, friends, acquaintances, people who live near them, perhaps somebody who has had concerns about children who live nearby and how they might be treated, and all of sudden a child’s gone missing.
“It’s impossible for someone not to know.”Services

I have a canon ixus digital camera. i just kept for charging the cam. after that it didn't work.
Answers :
I don't understand your description of the problem. If you are trying to charge the camera battery in the camera (using USB lead?) then this won't work. The battery for this camera must be removed from the camera and charged in the separate battery charger that was supplied with the camera. If you bought the camera second-hand and didn't get the charger, you must buy a replacement. They can be bought on Amazon.

June 12, 2011
Unlike what many analysts thought, the United States is making serious efforts to depose the government of Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh.This change of strategy first became apparent in U.S. President Barack Obama’s speech on May 19, 2011, in which he said that some regional allies were not responding to the U.S. calls for change and this was now the case in Yemen. He asked Saleh to fulfill his commitments and asked him to resign.
This 180-degree reversal of strategy on recent developments in the Middle East and North Africa is not so strange and unexpected. In fact, after months of daily protests, of course the U.S. and Saudi Arabia welcome regime change in Yemen. However, the U.S. is trying to control the situation in order to better serve its interests.
The collapse of Saleh’s regime is inevitable, whether he returns to the country or not, and his time as president is finally over, even for the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, which supported the Yemeni dictator until a few months ago, even long after the protests began.
The question is whether the U.S. stopped supporting dictators like Tunisia’s Ben Ali, Egypt’s Mubarak, and Yemen’s Saleh because they did not respond to the popular demands for change or because they stopped obeying the U.S. and stopped following its policies.
Now, almost everywhere, Saleh is called a dictator who led his country to despotism and corruption. However, until several months ago, the West regarded him as a friend. Ben Ali and Mubarak were in a similar situation. They were all regarded as the most important allies of the U.S. over the past few decades, and thus Washington remained silent and did nothing to hinder these authoritarian regimes.
Issues such as human rights, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, civil and political liberties (such as the right to establish non-governmental organizations, political groups, parties, etc.), and minority and women's rights have been the main pretexts for interventions by the U.S. and Europe in various countries. In fact, these issues are frequently used as tools to interfere in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern states. The method used by the U.S. and its allies in dealing with the Arab uprising provides an example of this approach.
For example, many Arab countries that have a bad record in the area of human rights and related issues have been supported by Washington for decades, but all of a sudden, when there is no longer any chance for the Westerners to continue their support, they resort to the issue of human rights to justify their interference.
On the one hand, the West’s support for despotic regimes always created anti-Western sentiment in the region. Thus, by helping popular movements, the U.S. is trying to prevent more Islamic extremist ideologies and groups like Al-Qaeda from arising in the region.
On the other hand, the governments of the region are all facing a domestic and international crisis of legitimacy. The U.S. policy is to support change in order to respond to these crises and to better serve its interests.
To summarize all this, it can be said that the U.S. and its allies are only pursuing their national, regional, and international interests, and issues such as human rights and political and civil liberties are only used as pretexts to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. And thus, the United States is encouraging the popular movements of the Arab world, even though they are anti-U.S. in nature, in order to manipulate the situation in its favor so that it will be able to install new rulers who also will be subservient to the U.S. and follow its policies. This is the most efficient way to promote U.S. cultural and political hegemony in the future.I also started playing the game Assassin's Creed

Woohoo! The Scavanger Hunt finally ends!
My friend (and redoubtable accountant) Larry Hancock just tipped me off that, at long last, Season One of one of my all-time favourite TV series, The Paper Chase, is coming out on DVD. Details about the release are here.
YouTube has long had a grainy video of the opening credits, including the terrific Seals and Crofts theme song.
And — how’s this for a nice coincidence! — the release date for The Paper Chase Season One is the same date as for my next novel, Wake: April 7, 2009.
There were a handful of TV shows that meant a lot to me when I was growing up, but most of them were science fiction: Fireball XL5, Star Trek, Search, The Six Million Dollar Man. But The Paper Chase, which came out when I was 18, and is based on John Jay Osborn Jr.’s novel of the same name, and the earlier motion picture adaptation which also starred John Houseman, wasn’t. But it was about rationalism, about prizing the intellect, about ethical conundrums — about all the things that I try to infuse into my SF writing.
YouTube also has an iconic scene from the first episode right here:

The 7D Mark II was released a few years after the 70D, coming with a few features that are a little more advanced. When it comes to the battle between canon 70d vs canon 7d mark ii, both cameras still have some similar features. It is the reason as to why both are still so popular among photographers. Some of the similarities for the cameras are explained below.
Similarities between Canon 70D vs. Canon 7D Mark
Megapixels
When it come doing what they do best, both cameras have a 20-megapixel camera that using the APS-C size CMOS sensor. The size of the megapixels gives both cameras the ability to capture images that are bigger and have high resolution. The maximum resolution for video is 1920 x 1080.
Screen size
Canon 70D and Canon 7D Mark II both have a screen of size 3 inches. The type of screen in both units is an LCD with practically the same resoluton the screen resolution. The screens allow for live view, which means that you can take images or shoot videos using the screen. They are also used to display the settings screen and can be utilized for playback as well.
Built-in and external flash
The two cameras have in-built flashes, which makes them very great at taking pictures in low light conditions. They are also compatible with external flashes, which is usually preferred if better control of light is desired. They allow capturing of very great shots even at night.
Autofocus tracking
This was a cool feature in the Canon 70D and made its way to the Canon 7D Mark II as well. It allows you to track any movement. Combined with continuous autofocus in both, the features make the two cameras an excellent choice for focusing on moving objects. You are likely to see these cameras with sports photographers.
Environmental sealing
Environmental sealing is a common feature in Canon cameras, with these two not being an exception. They are designed to remain intact and function correctly even in the toughest environmental conditions. That means that you can always take them outdoors for great photo sessions, irrespective of the weather outside.
GPS enabled
You can go on a picture-shooting spree without having to note down the location that you took the picture in after every shot. The GPS can log all the picture locations for you. Wildlife photographers have found this quite a useful feature.910 Eagle Crest Ct, Riverside, CA 92506

He had surgery in 2003, just after Mom’s 2nd surgery for cancer. (She ended up having 6 surgeries, radiation and chemo.) The tumour affected all of Dad's critical thinking skills, as well as language processing. It was difficult. A friend suggested that all you can do is to look for the diamonds every day. A diamond was a small moment when you feel great joy, love or a special moment of bonding, when that father-daughter relationship manages to shine. There were many such moments in all the chaos. Eventually, I became clinically depressed, had to quit work, and focus only on Dad. It was all I could cope with. I begin going in and feeding Dad dinner, as he couldn’t manage eating utensils. This was well after he lost his ability to use the phone, had lost his hearing aids, and could not figure out the TV clicker. He died on February 16, 2007, in Leisureworld; I was there with him.
Dad was in the kitchen preparing a snack. Dad was fixing it since as Mom is still weak and tired and they had just come home from her surgery. I should describe the house. It is built on a rock, as the pink, gray, white, and black of the Precambrian shield rises up out of the ground, a perfectly solid foundation. The second floor is a large bedroom, 16 x 24 feet, with an ensuite bathroom. The sliding glass doors look out over the lake. Or they could, if the overgrown trees were not there. The main floor is open concept. Perfect to call to someone, or bellow orders across the living room, dining room and into the kitchen. The woodstove, the main heat in the house, sits in the one mini-wall of the living room. Off the living room in the TV room, down the wee hall is a bathroom and what should have been a bedroom. Mom and Dad decided, since it was their retirement home that they do not need another bedroom and this is Dad ’s office, with sliding glass doors that go out to the driveway. The house is on a small lake in Bala, the self-proclaimed Cranberry Capital of Canada.
Mom rested on the couch on the main floor, as she was unable to make her way up the steep stairs to her bedroom. She was sore and was told to limit her activity- as if that would stop her! Her incisions became infected and she needed antibiotics later. Dad had his seizure in the kitchen, falling to the floor on the hard linoleum. Mom phoned 911 and the ambulance attendants had to wend their way into the house through the office, a back door, the only doorway with decent enough access. They would come to use that doorway a lot! I cannot imagine the stress and fear she faced.
Dad went by ambulance to the hospital in Bracebridge. Mom stayed alone at the house. They decide that tests are warranted, including an MRI and a Catscan. She told me, “I know in that instant that our lives will never be the same again.” If only she will come to understand this and make changes. Mom is still recovering from her surgery. She has to ensure that her stitches do not become infected, She has sitz baths, and uses the blow dryer after every visit to the toilet, and must continue this perineal care for months. Even so, she contracts an infection and requires antibiotics. Thankfully the homecare nurse helps her. They only qualify for a few nursing hours a day at home. I did not realize how much they needed help at the time. Neighbours began to pitch.I received notice about tonight's daily specials from Cavo's chef and wanted to share them with you:

New restaurant open? I like it from what street?
laby[fashion suits]By Author Interviews / Source: NPR
It’s a cool August morning as I ride in Magnus Hansen’s dented pickup truck through the verdant hills of south Greenland. We’re in search of his flock of 500 sheep grazing on the slopes. Soon we encounter three animals grazing by the gravel on the dirt road. The two ewes and a lamb first eye us warily from the bushes, then scurry across the road. Nearby is a shimmering fjord, but less than 10 miles away, though we can’t see it, lies Greenland’s mighty ice cap, a mile thick in the center of the island.
Hansen’s sheep farm, called Tasilikulooq, sits amid glassy lakes and sloping hills. When I first arrive here, his red tractor sits next to a dusty snowmobile, a reminder of the punishing cold he and his family brave each winter. But it’s not the brutality of the coming winter that concerns Hansen right now. He’s worried about the travails of the summer.
That’s because it has been horribly dry here for months. Hansen fears that his flock of sheep might be malnourished if the pastures don’t soon recover from a hot, dry summer so he can harvest the grass for winter hay feeding.
“The seasons here have been very difficult lately,” says Hansen. The average animal in his flock in the summer of 2015 was 2 to 4 pounds lighter than normal. Hot summers over the past decade have cost him thousands of dollars in losses, he says.
Greenland is an Arctic nation, but along the fringe of the island, between the ice and sea, lies land. And in the south portion of the country, this land is arable. The fields and shrubbery of Tasilikulooq are among the verdant rolling hills that inspired the Vikings to call this place Greenland. They arrived around 985 A.D. and began raising livestock, beginning a tradition that a few dozen Inuit sheep farms continue in this region today, providing meat, primarily, for a tiny portion of the population.
Since Greenland’s 60,000 citizens rely almost entirely on food imports from Denmark and other European countries, farmers and officials have hoped that steadily rising temperatures, and shorter winters, would spur a growth in agriculture here. (Summer temperatures have risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit in southern Greenland since 1975, increasing the growing season by two weeks.) And media stories about Arctic gardening in greenhouses or the warming temperatures have hyped the possibilities.
Instead, says Aqalooraq Frederiksen, a third-generation farmer who works at a regional farmer assistance bureau, the dry summers are diminishing the prospects for Greenlandic farming.
Recent summers have been both warm and dry, causing drought in south Greenland, says John Cappelen, a climatologist at Danish Meteorological Institute, which maintains climate data for the island.
“In 2015, for example, we didn’t have spring,” said Greenlandic agricultural consultant Henrik Motzfeldt Egede. “It just went from a very cold winter to a hot, dry summer.” He says growth in pastures for livestock was “very bad as a result.” Meanwhile, the number of sheep farmers in Greenland has fallen from 74 in 1983 to about 37 farms today, says Frederiksen.
To compensate, farmers try to irrigate their pastures and hayfields, and they purchase animal feed to supplement the hay in the winter time. On an August morning by a dock near Tasilikulooq I watched a loader moving giant plastic bags of fertilizer and sheep fodder, 1,850 tons in all, from a small ship onto shore. Such shipments are a lifeline for sheep farmer Miki Egede, whose nearby farm, one of the largest on the island, boasts 600 sheep and 31 cattle.
“Our incomes just haven’t been able to keep up with the overall increase of our expenses,” says the farmer, who is no relation to the consultant. “Expenses in the form of fertilizers, fodder for the animals, and everyday items. Looks like it is the sheep farmers with the fewest sheep that were hit the hardest.”
Government subsidies, meant to support Greenland’s farms, now stand at $1.8 million per year. There are persistent rumors that the government could cut those subsidies, however, to save costs given that the sector is shrinking and provides relatively little food to Greenlandic citizens.
“This year we also had drought throughout most of the early summer, but limited rainfall late in the summer made the harvest better than last year,” says Egede. But severe drought has struck Greenland in two of the past five years and recently published research suggests the trend may continue because of large scale changes in Arctic weather systems.
A trip to the government’s testing farm near the southern tip of the island underscores some of the challenges farmers face here. Efa Poulsen, the gardener, tests different varieties of carrots, turnips, potatoes and feed crops like barley. Inside two greenhouses he is growing other vegetables, including tomatoes and cucumbers.
Poulsen removes plastic sheeting from a set of turnip plants and pulls up a turnip and cuts off its greens. After wiping off the dirt with a towel, he cuts me a slice; it’s crisp and sweet in my mouth. The farm grows tasty vegetables and trains a few sheep farmers a year, says Frederiksen. But the farm can’t produce enough food to cover the costs of the operation.
A handful of farmers have tried to grow vegetables for human consumption in gardens or fields, but almost all have found it unprofitable since yields are low and there’s limited availability of farm labor. So the few dozen experiments with growing vegetables here, including a few greenhouses, only serve to feed the families that maintain the gardens.
But there may be one solution to the woes facing Greenland’s farms — bees, says Ole Guldager, a commercial beekeeper who has been maintaining beehives in Narsarsuaq, a small airport town near the southern tip of the island. The part-time beekeeper produces between 550 and 650 pounds of honey annually for sale in groceries and tourist shops.
The hives thrive during hot summers when southern Greenland’s plentiful wildflowers are in bloom. Guldager is convinced that beekeeping would allow farmers to “make a living without being subsidized.” But beekeeping hasn’t caught on. He is the only commercial beekeeper on the island.I'm excited, but at the same time there's just so much to think about!! So cross stitching is a good relaxation-maker. I started Iris in Bloom on Monday. . .it's going to be a biggie! I don't have most of the threads yet (totally my fault, they don't come when you don't order them) but I have enough in stash to make a start.
I'm enjoying seeing it come together already. I think that's partly because it's got so much purple, which also happens to be the wedding colour. So any three month out advice for this bride-to-be?
Sarah
How exciting. So close to wedding time! Opening up my old blog and wanted to say hi!
Have fun Sarah - exciting times for you :)
Lovely progress on Iris. Good luck with the wedding preparations such an exciting time.
Although I didn't do much for our own wedding (37 years ago) I did make my own dress and a friend made our cake.
But when my daughter got married in 2008 I went to town (I had just retired) - save the dates, invites, info packs, table seating plan, post box (for cards on the day), table decorations, prettyed up the silk flowers she'd bought for the occasion, cross stitched a wedding sampler, assembled a ready-made cake with flowers etc, as well as actuslly decorating the room on the morning of the wedding and making 3 wedding scrapbooks after the event! I was exhausted before the actual wedding started! So don't go doing TOO much and take time to relax with Iris!
Good luck with everything. I'm looking forward to seeing all your handmade touches. I pretty much started planning my wedding about 4 months before the day itself so my advice is... don't do that!The first time William Christenberry took a serious look through a camera he was already an accomplished painter and sculptor.

* '1080p24*' means that the video is recorded at an actual 24 frames per second, rather than the more common 23.976 (precisely 24/1001). first thing to notice is that there is a marked difference in framing of the two versions. The Blu-ray (top) shows significantly more of the right side of the frame than the DVD (bottom), but also shows rather less of the left side:
According to IMDB, this movie was shot on Eastman Plus-X 5231 black and white film. According to Kodak, its 'characteristics provide an excellent balance between the maximum desirable speed for general production work and a fine-grain negative for that speed. The speed of this panchromatic film permits the use of small apertures, thus allowing good depth of field.' Which suggests that the result ought to look pretty sharply focused on Blu-ray. But as we see here, the Blu-ray is cleaner and a little more detailed than the DVD, but not exactly sharp:
This scene offers a more significant difference:
Here the Blu-ray offers a sharper outline on the dog, without the slight sense of edge enhancement that accompanies the DVD, and at the same time the detail and light differentiation of the ground gives a far more convincing sense of a wet surface:
Once again, it seems that razor sharp focus was not a goal of the cinematography in this picture. Even so, the Blu-ray reveals the ribbing on the cap far better than the DVD:
This character looks far cleaner and more natural in the Blu-ray, thanks to the relative lack of compression noise. Compare also the embroidery on her bodice and the pattern on the curtains, just to the left of her hair:
On Blu-ray, thanks to more detail, poor Mr Merrick seems even more horrific:quote:Dick, no such thing as "towd". As per Wikopedia:

We were searching for Scala Vinoteca; winery as the name suggestions, and restaurant of spectacular promise, as the rumours have gone.
All we had found was a kiosk standing where the restaurant should have been, and no other possibilities immediately next to it.
Then we thought, “what if it’s…” ah yes, “up”.
We were overwhelmed as soon as we entered Scala, not too visible from the flight of street-steps that lead up to it, the light installation that leads you there is as subtle as the exuberant understatement found in the interior. One wall is plain. To the right is the entrance with outdoor seating; the wall opposite it is made up entirely of empty glass bottles aligned in row after row of the green and yellow hues set by the glass, the last wall beholds a floor length mirror giving the room the effect of double its size. I genuinely thought for 15 minutes flat, that there was another set of 8 tables beyond us. It was only when I recognised the sheepish grin on a girl’s face, four tables down across the room, that I realised I was staring at my own reflection, and had been nosing on our neighbours table, squinting to identify what they had ordered, when I really didn’t need to look that far after all. Smart, Joanna, very smart.
We were greeted by Panos Nikiforou, the restaurant manager and Dimitris Kontopolos, the mastermind Chef behind Scala, who I instantly appreciate is not much of a talker, as made evident by his perplexed reaction to my nonstop chatter. They run through their top picks of the dishes with us, and set us up for the meal ahead. I can barely wait. We started off with the sweet potato and truffle oil which was sweet and homely. The truffle oil scents and perfumes it well, is not overbearing or powerful, and just warm enough. Accompanied with a glass of prosecco as an appetiser, it is the perfect setting to start off the meal. The lit walls with the used wine bottles and the architecture of the interior is edgy and comfortable – simple and relaxed.
Too early to label it as such, but pretty certain it would be come my favourite dish, was the avocado roll with white and red quinoa. I was so pleased as at Scala, they are perhaps the first people to pronounce it as I do, so I exclaimed, “yes, I will absolutely try the kin-oh-ah” and nodded my head in appreciation that those who pronounce foods differently, must taste them differently too, and to a superior level of appreciation at that. I was not disappointed. With a slice of grapefruit laid atop the expertly sliced and curled, cool, soft, avocado, accompanied with minced crab and tuna, and a tangerine paste accompanying the “kin-oh-ah” this is a sweet, succulent, creative chilled dish, which harmonised so well in my mouth, that in my voice notes of the meal there is about a 45-second silence during which I think I was whisked into an other worldly experience whilst savouring this dish. I am as much a fan of mushy guac-resembling-avocado as the next person, however this is ripe, and tough enough to form the perfect roll for the crab and tuna. I wanted more sir, please! But just as I was about to make a passive joke suggesting this, they uttered the word: croquettes. Panos introduced it as “the best seller” the Chef later called it “not so pretty, but very good” which sounded sort of how a father would present his least attractive but favourite daughter. These langoustine croquettes could certainly be my favourite daughter any day. To quote my dining companion: this was one of those dishes you bite into, you taste, it tastes great, and then… it gets better! Served on a bed of sour cream and yoghurt, these crab croquettes are far from simple, with a creamy, powerful taste that hits the spot.
The clock had struck twelve, and most diners had begun to wrap up their meals. Testament to how much you will not want to leave this place is the fact that a lady on the table behind us had unfortunately chocked on something quite early on in her meal (which I had interpreted at my cue to calm down and eat slowly, as tempting as it was to devour everything all at once). After much attentiveness and care from the staff at Scala however, they had continued with their meal, and were the second last table to leave the restaurant after close. We were the last. We didn’t only leave after close; we left two hours after close. The restaurant manager Panos, and Chef Dimitris, pulled up some chairs and sat with us to tell us of their dreams and aspirations for their wonderful little haven which they’ve built of Scala. Unchatty genius Dimitris, even opened up a little, I like to think, as he spoke to my dining companion, and Architect about his dreams for the design of the place, whilst chatterboxes Panos and I covered their plans for expansion. I left with that buzz that you feel after an annual family Christmas dinner; it is packed, it is hearty, it is unique, yet saddening all at once as you tell yourself you wish you could do this every day. This is how you will feel on leaving Scala Vinoteca; you will wish you could be there, every day.

"I think one must think of a solution to the whole problem versus punishing today's or yesterday's culprits. The apparent 'root': the corporate benefactors that profit off of wars, which create financial incentives to lure in people in general. Then of course, to portray war as an enhanced "Call of Duty" video game, one may lure in certain types of people who join the forces merely to get that "enhanced" experience.
*It is not guaranteed that anyone would join for solely one of these reasons, but I am sure they exist. *
So who really is to blame here? Who has the power to stop these type of campaigns for luring in certain type of people, with little to no empathy?

Abstract
Objective To evaluate the impact of intravenous administration of rhBNP on coronary and renal artery haemodynamics in York pigs model of AMI-ADHF.
Methods Fourteen York pigs were included in this study. After the AMI-ADHF models were established, pigs were randomised into saline group and rhBNP group. Coronary pressure (Pc), the average peak velocity (APV), coronary vascular resistance (CR), coronary flow reserve (CFR) and coronary diameter were recorded simultaneously at baseline, instant after the model established, 60 min after continuous infusion of 0.01 μg·kg−1·min−1 rhBNP and the time point of LVEDP<12 mm Hg. The blood flow of the coronary were measured at rest and maximal hyperaemia. Renal angiography was performed by 4F catheter and quantitative measurement of diameter was recorded by the computer assisting system. The average peak rate of renal artery (APVra) was recorded, determination of quantitative angiography of renal artery diameter, renal vascular resistance. LVEDP and LVEF was measured.
Results 1. Coronary artery diameter increased after rhBNP administration. APV and CBF were significantly increased and CR decreased after rhBNP administration. CFR was significant rebound after continuous infusion of 0.01 μg·kg−1·min−1 rhBNP for 30min. APV and CBF significantly increased and CR significantly decreased at the stage of infusion 0.010 μg kg−1 min−1 rhBNP in rhBNP Group. 2. Renal artery pressure was significantly lower after rhBNP administration. RhBNP exerts renal vasodilator effects in a dose related relationship. RBF increased gradually after administration of rhBNP and was significantly higher than control group. RVR decreased after administration of rhBNP. LVEF was lower than baseline after the models established and tended to increase after administration of rhBNP.
Conclusion It could increase blood flow of injury coronary artery, improve CFR and improve the coronary and renal haemodynamics after intravenous administration of rhBNP in pigs with AMI-AD.Obituary Search Advanced Search

Most of the issues survived, and over the last couple of weeks we’ve scanned them so that they are available on this Web site. The project provided a heartening reminiscence of a bygone era: each issue included a regional folk calendar listing which included the Folkway and Deacon Brodie’s Tavern, as well as an impressive roster of MFS performers including Jean Redpath, George Winston, Alex de Grassi, the Battlefield Band, and many more. Each issue also contained articles and editorials – topics included musicians profiles (Allan Block, Chris Pearne), a foreboding about the demise of contra dancing (When the Set Gets Shorter), a history of Cape Breton music, and more. We were privileged to have Irish novelist Morgan Llywelyn contribute several pieces on Celtic lore. The February 1983 issue gave extensive coverage to the Folkway in celebration of its 8th anniversary. Whether you were an active part of the local folk scene and want to reminisce, or you are more recently tuned in, we think you’ll enjoy browsing these issues).
The transition to the New Year gives us an excuse to review the more immediate past of the last year: MFS produced several well-attended concerts, giving audiences enriching experiences while demonstrating some of the breadth of the genre of “folk music”. It was a phenomenal year for dancing; during the summer the Monday night dance drew record crowds of young people (there is now a Facebook community for the Nelson Dance with 45 members), and experienced dancers have done a good job of being welcoming to newcomers. The Peterborough First Saturday dance is thriving, and there is now a Second Saturday dance in Nelson. Matthew Christian, the recipient of the 2007 Johnny Trombley Scholarship, give a great performance at the opening of the Winter Solstice Party on December 22, doing sets on highland pipes, fiddle, and whistle. This marks the sixth year of the scholarship program.
Looking ahead, in addition to continuing concerts and dances, this Website enables us to more effectively deliver information about events. Many of the pages for events contain music snippets, so you can get a little preview of what’s in store (see the PR page for the Nelson dance with Don Primrose and Heathen Creek, as an example). We are also including calendar information for non-MFS folk music events in the area; while there might be some occassions where there are competing events, it makes this a more useful Web site for those who want to scope out what’s going on.
We now have a way to present articles, profiles of recordings and musicians, and more. For example, we just came across an article about contra dancing in Nelson, published in the Boston Globe in 1969! Fun stuff.
It also provides an additional means of participation for those who are so inclined. Most articles contain a “comments” option which allows users of the Web site to respond to a particular topic with their own insights and observations (you must register on the site to comment, but we won’t sell your email address or turn it over to Homeland Security). We also welcome pictures, video links, and of course, ideas: Write to us.
On behalf of the MFS Board, we wish you prosperity of spirit for the coming year.Robert Morris University

Juan Carlos Hernandez Pacheco’s immigration case gained national attention as President Donald Trump’s administration clamped down on immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. Residents of West Frankfort, which solidly voted for Trump, rallied around Pacheco. He was released on bond in March after being detained by immigration officials.
The (Carbondale) Southern Illinoisan reports that Pacheco’s last appearance before an immigration judge was in November to establish a case timeline. He’s due in court in April 2021.
Letters of support came from the police chief and others. Pacheco ran La Fiesta Mexican Restaurant for years.
His case is among more than half a million pending in U.S. immigration courts.
Information from: Southern Illinoisan,The strategy of guerrilla warfare has been raised to the level
of a "principle" by the Castroites. With last Januarys publication of
Régis Debrays Revolution in the Revolution? the
Cuban bureaucracy formulated the Guevarist strategy for militarily confronting
imperialism into a doctrinaire recipe to be applied to all Latin American
countries (except, oh yes, except to Uruguay and Mexico, countries not quite so
hostile to Cuba). The recent Organization of Latin American Solidarity (OLAS)
Conference in Havana put Debrays formulations into resolutions, approving
the general line of "armed struggle"; amidst colossal billboards depicting
Bolivar, Guevara and Castro, the Conference also heard glowing, if highly
inaccurate, reports of guerrillaisms successes and future.
The Castroite road, and the brazenly elitist ideas expressed by
this Cuban variant of the Maoist road, are such crude and explicit repudiations
of Marxism that even official Maoist organs, such as the U.S.
Progressive Labor (Nov.-Dec. 1967) and World
Revolution (Winter 1967), have been forced to put on a facade of
"orthodoxy," bitterly attacking Castroism in general and the Castroite
ideologues such as Debray. However, the Castro bureaucracy is simply following
the old Maoist recipe for rural warfare, although, as Debrays book makes
clear, with Castroite "innovations." For the Maoists, to fight in the
countryside and develop a "peoples war" was a principle in itself, the
"mass line" in action. For the Castroites, elitist "rural war" is supposedly
not a principle, but simply a result of the repressive political situation in
Latin America. But it quickly becomes a principle also.1 Anybody who is not for the Castroite
version of "armed struggle" is labeled a "bourgeois," a "provocateur," an agent
of the CIA, etc. That goes for the Venezuelan CP, the Latin American Maoist
leadership, a thoroughly urban breed, the "Trotskyites," and all those who work
in the cities, regardless of the political programs of those organizations.
They must all obey the "principle" of rural safety; that is, they must all
search for the jungles protective womb. Here the Castroites draw their
"blood line."
Unfortunately, the argument elaborated by Debray and others
about the "safety" of the countryside is nothing but a marvelous
commonplace. The liquidation of Guevaras Bolivian guerrilla
group and the resulting murder of Guevara himself by the Bolivian military and
U.S. CIA apparatus reveal once again that guerrillaism is not the way for the
Latin American socialist revolution. The jungle is no less dangerous for
revolutionaries than is the city. This, however, is not the point. Marxists
begin their struggles basing themselves not on impressions, opinions and
suspicions about the repressive apparatus of the ruling class, but on the
objective developments in its organic contradictions which periodically rock
the entire bourgeois society. And those contradictions, violently visible in
the class struggle, manifest themselves predominantly in the cities, where the
proletariat works in the factories, the heart of bourgeois society.2 This is why Marxists should strive to
remain in the cities, with the proletariat. Their struggle can recognize
tactical retreats, exiles, etc. But Marxists should neveras the Maoists
and Castroites docapitulate to the unfavorable situations in the cities
by cooking up "innovations" about the "socialist" countryside.
(Though we fundamentally disagree with this escapism to the
countryside, we recognize that deaths such as Guevaras show that many
guerrillaists, who are dedicated and courageous fighters trapped by a
reactionary conception of revolution, are nevertheless prepared to struggle and
die if necessary for their convictions. One can sharply contrast this devotion
to the smug caution of the Pabloites, notably in North America and in Europe,
and the wild, but empty, bombast of coffee shop guerrillaists such as Professor
John Gerassi. Rather than preparing for the coming proletarian revolution here,
these gentlemen prefer to safely "cheer" for the Guevaras from the
sidelines.)
The following thesis was first published in Espartaco,
Bulletin 2, April 1967, as Tesis sobre las Guerrillas.
Excerpts from it appeared in Der Klassenkampf, No. 2, July 1967.
The present version has been expanded into a more historical and general study.
The original Tesis put forward numbered observations about
various types of guerrilla warfare and peasant movements. In the present work
we trace the historical development of a guerrilla struggle confronted with the
most favorable conjunction of circumstances. (Because the Castroite bureaucracy
has set up the Cuban experience as the model to be followed by all Latin
American revolutionists, we have abstracted the Cuban experience in order to
appraise its development. The Cuban experience contains most of what is
essential to the other guerrilla take-overs.) Then we analyze the class content
of guerrillaism, i.e., its social basis, leadership and program. From these two
corresponding appraisals we show that the guerrilla warfare
strategyregardless of its intentionsis impotent to terminate, from
any historical standpoint, the root of world-wide oppressionthe
imperialist capitalist system.
Guerrillaism today is a petty-bourgeois reaction to the absence
and delay of proletarian revolution. In those countries underdeveloped by
imperialist exploitation, the proletariat, lacking Leninist parties, has
suffered innumerable defeats at the hands of nationalist swindlers and their
Stalinist partners. Before, during and after the Second Imperialist War,
Stalinism internationally betrayed the socialist movements by harnessing them
to the native bourgeoisies and to the "democratic"
imperialisms.3 This "popular
front" strategy dismantled many revolutionary opportunities not only in the
advanced capitalist countries, but in the colonial and semi-colonial countries
as well. The betrayals of the popular front were not, of course, the first
Stalinist crimes. They had been anticipated by the mass catastrophes of the
"third period" (1928-1934) when the Comintern called for ultra-left adventures
for "power." Just as in Germany where third period adventurism facilitated
Hitlers coming to power, so in Latin America it served to erode and
confuse entire Communist parties.4
These zig-zags of Comintern policy, designed for the narrow purpose of
protecting the interests of the Kremlin clique, served to physically annihilate
or totally disorient thousands upon thousands of proletarian cadres. Thus, the
Comintern policies not only forestalled successful proletarian revolution at
the time, they also conditioned to a great extent the circumstances for future
defeats.
The colonial and semi-colonial petty-bourgeoisie, much of it also
oppressed by imperialist exploitation, has been thrown into a frenzy caused by
the growing limitations on its cultural and economic possibilities. As a
result, the most disgusted sections of the urban petty-bourgeoisie and its
intelligentsia struggle to lead the peasantryitself a huge
petty-bourgeois massagainst the imperialist domination of their country.
But, lacking historically a decisive relationship to the means of production,
the petty-bourgeoisie is impotent to close forever what Marx and Engels called
the "pre-history" of humanity. A residue of the past, of waning feudalism and
diverse pre-capitalist social strata, the petty-bourgeoisie cannot decisively
carry out Marxs call to "expropriate the expropriators." A
petty-bourgeois leadership may oppose the imperialist expropriators and may
even "expropriate" them domestically. But, having expropriated them, the
petty-bourgeois leadership cannot consistently safeguard the new property
relations deformed within the limitations of a national economy.
If initially a guerrilla movement, led inevitably by the
petty-bourgeoisie, partially destroys the imperialist grip on its country, the
succeeding political convulsions at best may force the new
government to consolidate a bureaucratically deformed workers state5 like Yugoslavia, China, Cuba, politically
and economically related to the USSR; the more likely outcome is that the
country will remain under imperialist control (as happened in Algeria with
regard to French imperialism).
The example of the Cuban Revolution, a revolution which resulted
in the unique development of a deformed workers state in Latin America, shows
that victorious guerrilla movements can do no more than hasten the creation of
a temporary vacuum in the bourgeois state. When such a vacuum appears, the
movement usually first attempts to prop up a coalition with the "patriotic"
bourgeoisie. After the government oligarchy and the political and military
lackeys of imperialism leave the country, whole sectors of the old bourgeois
apparatus favored by the guerrilla leadership (now in the cities), are absorbed
wholesale into the "new" state bureaucracy. However, imperialism may be
temporarily confused and the native bourgeoisie too weak as a whole to accept a
coalition with the guerrilla movement. Thus the guerrilla movement under the
impetus of its victory in a civil war may be forced to establish itself in
Bonapartist fashion as the sole ruler of the country.
Clearly, great masses of peasants and considerable segments of the
proletariat will support a guerrilla leadership that has been forced to
dissolve the old army and police apparatus and to clash openly with imperialism
in the country, with latifundistas, absentee landlords, etc., and with other
economically backward elements of the native bourgeoisie. In order to keep this
support, the newly established bureaucracy must oppose further imperialist
aggression with more confiscations, nationalizations, formation of militias,
etc., attempting at the beginning to answer blow with blow.
If the actions of the guerrilla movement completely force
imperialism to release its economic hold on the country, the old basic property
relations collapse. The economy of the country must then be reordered. If it is
to be competitive in the world market, centralized planning based on state
ownership of the means of production becomes an absolute necessity; however, it
can only be inefficiently superimposed on an economy based principally on the
export of one or two raw materials or agricultural products. The dependence on
the world market for the import of manufactured goods does not end, regardless
of all the bureaucratic planning. In order to avoid the restoration of
imperialist domination, the newly consolidated state bureaucracy must tie
itself to the bigger and more powerful bureaucracies of Russia, the East
European bloc and/or China.
None of these actions flow from a Marxist understanding of class
forces but from the bureaucratic and opportunist reactions of a petty-bourgeois
leadership, struggling for survival, maneuvering to keep the support of the
masses. Under these tremendously contradictory conditions the groundwork for a
deformed workers state is established.
In order to solidify its own power, the bureaucracy cannot allow
the proletariat any independent voice or independent organs of power. At the
same time, in order to maintain "popularity" it is forced to resort to
demagogic semblances of mass support. Thus we see the masses being called to
gigantic meetings during which they magically "participate" in the "collective
decision-making process." Usually such democratic "decision-making" parades
have long since been preceded by a silent and thorough disarming of the masses.
The trade unions have also been "disarmed": "unreliable" trade union leaders
and militants are purged and replaced by the stooges of the bureaucracy and
then the whole trade union apparatus is thoroughly absorbed into the state
apparatus. At the same time, the former guerrilla leadership, a Bonapartist
formation from its military inception, hardens its own rule by solidifying its
independent army and entrenching more and more "privileged" strata into the
state apparatus.
The Bonapartist clique controlling the state apparatus becomes the
worst internal enemy of the bureaucratically-planned and state-owned
economyno longer capitalistof such a deformed workers state. The
non-capitalist mode of productionplacing on the order of the day
workers control of productionis basically incompatible with the
political rule of the bureaucracy. The new social system, though deformed and
unstable because of its origins and national limitations, objectively poses the
necessity to advance toward a new revolutionary society with proletarian
internationalist content. Though revolutionaries should unconditionally support
all progressive measures taken against imperialism by a victorious guerrilla
movement, they should never forget that the guerrilla leadership,
bureaucratically and uneasily ruling over the state, threatens to return the
conquests of the revolution to imperialism. Therefore, revolutionaries should
incessantly strive to make the proletariat, whether of a state remaining
within the bounds of imperialism or of a deformed workers state, aware of its
independent political tasks. The struggle for the accomplishment of these
tasks, which requires the indispensable formation and steeling of a Leninist
party, finds one of its greatest obstacles in the reactionary stratum balancing
over society.
The bureaucracy defends in its own way the states
non-capitalist economy from the dangers of capitalist restoration. But the
measures and mechanisms it bureaucratically employs to defend the economy in
the present become in the long run accumulated liabilities against the very
social gains of the revolution. From this deadly grip of social impotence
created partly by itself, the bureaucracy cannot and will not escape. Its
reactions against imperialism will always be limited, half revolutionary,
fluctuating from the most brazen cowardice and opportunism to the most cynical
and callous ultra-leftism. It will measure its actions only from the standpoint
of the "fatherlands" defense (which is, at bottom, the defense of its own
privileged positions). For these isolated and deformed workers states, the
proletarian overthrow of the bureaucracy combined with successful proletarian
revolutions in the advanced capitalist countries is the only permanent
guarantee of defense and extension of the gains of the revolution. If these
social and political revolutions are not effected, the bureaucracy will
objectively aidas it does every minute of its existencethe
influence of imperialism and will help the imperialists drag its society to
capitalist restoration if not directly to barbarism. In the present long drawn
out period of imperialist decay, the two outcomes will become increasingly less
distinguishable.
Even the most favorable circumstances which a guerrilla movement
might confront (i.e., those which allow it to consolidate a deformed workers
state) can, short of an internal proletarian revolution, lead to nothing more
than the ultimate restoration of capitalism and imperialist domination. And as
those "favorable circumstances" become less likely, the more probable outcome
at this juncture of a successful guerrilla struggle will be like that of
Algeria, Laos or many of the African states in which the struggle for "national
liberation" has not impeded the continuance of imperialist domination or the
existence of a native comprador bourgeoisie.
It should be clear that the Russian, Eastern European and Chinese
bureaucracies will tend to enter into deeper political crises; internal
contradictions within these bureaucratically dominated states will be partly
hastened by the growing political and economic decay of the world imperialist
system. As long as imperialism survives in the world, the restoration of
capitalism in those countries remains a possibility, threatening in various
degrees. Because it is precisely upon these bureaucracies that the newly
created deformed workers states would have to depend, both militarily and
economically, in order to survive, these crises will have their effects on
developments in the "Third World." The following contradiction will become
intensified in the colonial and semi-colonial countries where guerrillaism
looms: although opportunities for guerrilla takeovers will be greatly
facilitated by the protracted imperialist decay, this flies in the face of the
sharply lessened likelihood that new deformed workers states can be
consolidated from any origins such as a guerrilla victory.
How this can happen, how the heroic and voluntarist guerrilla
struggles can lead only back to capitalism is a mystery only to those who have
never bothered to critically analyze from the Marxist standpoint the historical
development and class basis of guerrillaism. Guerillaism, like all
manifestations of political life, represents class interests. Anybody
who does not understand this is condemned to cross class lines regardless of
all his phrase mongering about guerrilla "socialism."
The "national liberation" armed-struggle programs of the guerrilla
movements are not at all socialist.6 Certainly, they start out as
"anti-imperialist" and even "anti-capitalist." However, as a guerrilla movement
grows, the petty-bourgeois need to attract "influential" allies and to
compromise with the "progressive" bourgeoisie against the military apparatus
defending imperialist property will tone down the guerrillas
"anti-capitalism."
The nationalist reformism of the guerrilla movement will be more
blatantly portrayed in its actions and program when it has gathered enough
strength to pose as the sole protector of the "fatherland." Such a program at
best promisesbarring the destruction of the guerrilla movementa
reordering of the national economy through the state infrastructure, and by no
means the socialist reconstruction of society. (Whether this "reordering" will
be effected under the auspices of a deformed workers state or a statized
bourgeois regime depends on future local and international events.)
One of the reasons that a guerrilla movement is forced to
represent the interests of segments of the "patriotic" bourgeoisie is its own
concomitant property-hungry peasant base. It is true that at the beginning the
Castroite foco, or guerrilla band, stresses absolute "freedom" from the
rural population. But if the foco is going to grow and if more focos
are going to be formed, it is inevitable that the ever-growing guerrilla
movement must rely on the peasantry. Thus, the "rural war" becomes a peasant
war, i.e., it becomes what it potentially was from the very beginning.
When a strategic "rural war" is seen for what it is, a peasant
war, certain opportunists immediately jump onto a different bandwagon: the
discovery of a somewhat "socialist" peasantry. This magnificent discovery has
been passionately defended by various "Third World" ideologues such as Frantz
Fanon. In their impotence to explain social facts, these ideologues prefer to
invent them, or, rather, to hide them. Certainly there are many different
social variations of what is generally called "peasantry." But Marxists should
vigorously reject the pseudo-anthropological "discovery" of a "socialist"
peasantry in all these different peasant strata. It is the material relations
of the peasantry, its inter-relationships with small property, penetration of
capitalism or its presence in the countryside, and the peasantrys
aspirations to be a propertied class which determine how the peasantry will
actand not basically its wretched condition.
It is absolute nonsense then to speak of "rural war" as if it were
something other than a petty-bourgeois form of struggle. "Rural war"if
not quashed in the bud as it usually has been in Latin Americamust
increasingly tend to become a territorial peasant war, a war which can be
influenced by the bourgeoisie included in the rural popular front. A guerrilla
leadership will be forced to fluctuate between the pressures of influential
segments of the "patriotic" bourgeoisie and those of the small propertied
interests of the peasantry. There will be moments for instance when the
guerrilla leadership is forced to expropriate hostile landlords and carry
through a land reform for the peasantry either distributing plots among them or
legitimizing their spontaneous expropriations. This will however, strengthen
the more influential segments of the middle and rich peasantry, who will in
turn exert political and social pressure on the guerrilla leadership. Moreover,
once a land reform has been carried through, the peasant masses will be quite
satisfied with the small plots given by the guerrilla leadership; the peasantry
will not care for more "socialism." On different occasions, the guerrilla
leadership will have to rely on the financial backing of "patriotic" bourgeois
and landlord sectors. These and similar pressures reinforcebefore and
after the seizure of powerthe need for the guerrilla leadership to be a
highly militarized, Bonapartist clique answerable to nobody in particular,
completely ruthless and determined by all means to stay in power in spite
of the possible hostility coming from the classes it balances over.
When the peasant wars in Middle Europe during the Reformation
hastened decisively the downfall of the waning feudal order, they became
"critical episodes" benefiting the bourgeoisies long struggle for power.
The bourgeoisie, each time more economically and even politically powerful,
rammed the peasantry (and in the 19th Century, also the proletariat)
against the remnants of the old order. Peasant upsurges marked the birth pangs
of the then revolutionary bourgeois class.
Four hundred years later, in its death-agony period, the senile
bourgeoisie will increasingly benefit from peasant uprisings that, remaining
rudderless or propped-up by guerrilla movements, dislocate or postpone the
proletarian socialist revolution, thus objectively helping the continuing
stabilization of imperialism and the survival of the bourgeoisie in the world
arena. In this manner, continuing peasant movements, if unchecked by an
alliance with the revolutionary proletariat, rather than being "critical
episodes" will qualitatively transform themselves into social manifestations of
sharpening cultural decay. The proletariat, unable to develop economic power of
its own in the propertied and political manner that the bourgeoisie could
before and after the English and French Revolutions, cannot benefit from the
results of peasant wars as long as its own crisis of leadershipthe
fundamental crisis of human cultureremains unresolved.
Marxist revolutionaries, in the imperialist countries and in the
underdeveloped colonies and semi-colonies, must root their struggles in the
proletariat. Without the proletariat, Marxists can only be, and become,
petty-bourgeois revolutionists; their "Marxism" will then too become an
ideology in the shape of false consciousness, not the revolutionary
theory of the proletariat. And ideologies become in the last analysis
shibboleths (like the Castroite "the fatherland is America"). With no way to be
concretely implemented by the proletariat, shibboleths are easily glued to
shields defending different class interests than those of the revolutionary
class.
Isaac Deutscher, in a rare attempt to transcend his scholarly
eclecticism, "insulted" many Stalinist sycophants and "café
guerrillaists" in his 1966 address to the second annual Socialist Scholars
Conference in New York. This is how the worshippers of the accomplished fact
were "insulted": "You cannot run away from politics," Deutscher told them. "Men
live not by politics alone, true enough. But unless you have solved for
yourselves in your own minds the great political problems posed by Marxism, by
the contradictions of capitalist society, by the mutual relationship of the
intellectual and the worker in this society, unless you have found a way to the
young age groups of the American working class and shaken this sleeping giant
of yours, this sleeping giant of the American working class out of his sleep,
out of the drugsout of this sleep into which he has been drugged, unless
you have done this you will be lost. Your only salvation is in carrying back
the idea of socialism to the working class and coming back with the working
class to stormto storm, yes, to stormthe bastions of
capitalism."
These words, which for months caused shrieks and barks from the
worshippers of "new" realities, will retain their full validity until those
bastions are stormed. Revolutionaries in the advanced capitalist countries and
revolutionaries in the colonial and semi-colonial countries can fuse the
struggles of the international working class only by preparing Leninist parties
and by basing their strategies and tactics on the generalized expression of the
totality of the historic experiences of the working class. This successful
combination, this fusion of Marxist theory and organizational capacity on the
international level, will force all the "new" realities of our impressionists
into a frenzied stampede back into the archives of pre-Marxian radicalism from
whence they issued.
1. Castroites even go so far as to advise the
proletariat to strip its own centers: "¼ the best cadre of the
proletariat, those more politically developed, will fulfill their revolutionary
duty by integrating themselves into the guerrillas¼ " (Informe de la
Delegación de Cuba a la Primera Conferencia do Is OLAS, La Habana,
1967 p. 72)
2. The growth of the urban proletariat in Latin
America has spurted ahead in recent years. The unionized working class totals
between 15 and 22 million, depending on the source. Nearly 45% of the total
labor force is industrial proletariat and agricultural labor. Nearly half of
this figure is industrial proletariat. (América Latina, Problemas y
Perspectivas do la Revolución, Prague, 1966) In 1950 the urban
population was 41% of the total; in 1960, 48%; today, 57%; in 1970, a projected
60+%. (United Nations statistics.) This is how "half-feudal" bourgeois Latin
America is.
3. For example, the Cuban CPs Juan Marinello
and Carlos Rodríguez served in a Batista cabinet in 1940; the Ecuadorian
Stalinists helped create and formed part of a Bonapartist junta in 1944. In
1936, the Chilean Stalinists entered the Popular Front. When the Popular
Fronts candidate, Aguirre Cerda, became president in 1938, the Stalinists
reaffirmed their "inviolable and exemplary fidelity to the Peoples
Front."
4. In 1932, the El Salvador CP attempted to "grab"
power without any preparation for a head-on confrontation with the Salvadorian
bourgeoisie. Such an adventure ended in mass slaughtersaround 25,000
killedof peasants, Communists and workers. The terror was extended to
Guatemala and Honduras. In 1935, the Brazilian CP, headed by the Stalinist
rogue Prestes, attempted another, though belated, third period action combining
it with popular front tactics. Needless to say, this schizophrenic "deed" ended
in total debacle.
5. The Spartacist League has previously stated
(Spartacist No. 6) that ."
6. In an interview the Venezuelan guerrilla leader
Douglas Bravo was asked about the program of the FALN. He answered: "In brief,
the FALN has the following objectives: to achieve national liberation, liberty
and democratic life for the nation; to rescue the patrimony, the integrity and
the national riches, to establish a revolutionary government; to safeguard the
carrying out of its laws and to support the authorities constituted by the
Revolution; to protect the interests of the people, their property and
institutions." (Desafío, May 1967)
In its 1964 Manifiesto y Programa Agrario Guerrillero, the
Colombian FARC proclaimed: "
we call on all the peasants, on all the
workers, on all employees, on all students, on all the artisans, on the small
industrialists, on the national bourgeoisie willing to fight imperialism, on
the democratic and revolutionary intellectuals, on all the political parties of
left and center that desire a change toward progress to [join] the great
revolutionary and patriotic struggle for a Colombia for Colombians, for the
victory of the revolution, for a democratic government of national liberation."
(Colombia en Pie de Lucha, Prague 1966, p. 18)
The complete program of the Guatemalan FAR seems to be hard to
come by; second hand reports, however, are abundant. MR, V. 18, N. 9,
contains three reports on the FAR by MR contributors. From the first
one: "They envisage four major stages in their revolution. First, nationwide
organization of the peasants, workers, students, and professional people into
disciplined and ideologically informed units. Second, armed revolt, culminating
in the taking of power by the people and the repulsion of imperialist
intervention. Third, establishment of a national democratic government with the
participation of various sectors of the population. Fourth, the transition to
the construction of socialism in Guatemala." This mechanical "stages" nonsense
is combined with the most spineless opportunism. "
FAR," the third report
tells us, "was largely instrumental in the electoral success of Méndez
[the present butcher-lackey ruling Guatemala], for it considered that a period
of relative tranquility would benefit it, ¼ "
The fact is that during the Méndez election swindle the slaughter of
FAR-PGT-MR-13 was increased. Today a Méndez-led bloodbath reigns in
Guatemala. From now on, the "first stage" of FARs Menshevist vision of
revolution should probably add: "a nationwide organization including bourgeois
presidents and other lackeys of imperialism."
The Vietnamese NLF latest 14-point program does not even mention
the word socialism once. It rather promises to: "Build up an independent
and sovereign economy, rapidly heal the wounds of war and develop the economy
to make our country prosperous." The state will: "Guarantee to workers and
employers the right to participate in the management of enterprises." The state
will also: "Establish freedom of enterprise profitable to the nation" and look
after "the interests of small merchants and small proprietors." For the
peasants, the state will: "Place the lands of absentee landlords at the
disposal of the peasants so that they may cultivate it and enjoy the fruits of
the harvest." But the state will also court landlords: "The question of an
appropriate definite solution will be studied later, taking into account the
political attitude of each landlord." Further on we are told that the state
will also: "Settle differences between employers and workers by negotiations
and by the mediating role of the national and democratic administration." (For
complete program see National Guardian 21 October 1967.)

There are many things we can say about the high quality of service we provide to our home seller and home buyer clients, but probably none would be as credible as reviews from some of our recent clients themselves.
So please take a moment to read the following reviews below or click on this link to view our online Zillow reviews. hope they indicate our experience and integrity, as well as make it clear how much we enjoy helping people with their real estate needs.
"Pamela and John Subry clearly differentiated themselves from the other real estate professionals with whom we met in the first several weeks of our search. Their ability to quickly understand exactly what we wanted saved us many hours of searching. Their expertise in short sales and foreclosures got us the home we wanted at a price that we would not have bid based upon our (lack of) knowledge about such transactions in today’s market. And their willingness to support us in several aspects of the transaction that had nothing to do with the traditional role as a buyer’s broker demonstrated a true commitment to our needs. We trust and highly recommend Pamela and John Subry for real estateservices."
Joe & Karen Vance
"Thanks so much for helping us purchase our "First Home". We are so excited to have a place of our own. We are very greatful for all of your time and patience."
Dana & Seth
"I cannot even begin to stress how thankful I am to have had Pamela and John on my side of the table. Pamela was able to sell our townhome and help us acquire our new home. Pamela went above and beyond the call of duty and I will be a life long referral. Thanks for helping us get into our dream house! Best team EVER!"
David & Kim
"John did an excellent job of finding us a home and working with our lender to make sure everything went smoothly. John really went above and beyond to help us get the house we wanted at a price we could afford. I would highly recommend John and Pamela Subry to all my friends and family! We are now in the home of our dreams because of everything John did. He not only helped us negotiate price with the sellers but he also made sure everything that was mentioned on the inspection was in good condition before we moved further. He provided us professionals to give us opinions on the home and even sent out professionals to repair minor issues to insure our loan would be processed. John even recommended a home insurance company that so far has been fantastic! Without John we would not be in our new home!!! Thanks!!"
Stephanie & Heath
"We had an extraordinary experience with Pamela and John. We spent more than two months searching for our new home and put down four offers before we finally found one. Pamela has been very patient throughout the process and she is very knowledgeable and professional. She also made sure that our interests were well presented during the negotiation. We would highly recommend her to other home buyers!"
Yuying & Wentao
"We were very impressed working with John Subry in the purchase of our current home. After loosing my first agent (and later, my friend) from cancer many years ago, I thought I wouldn't find another agent like that again. I had a few disappointing agents after that and when I found John, I was very relieved that someone was really looking out for me, addressing my concerns and questions quickly, and assisting me along with his years of experience in his field. I believe I expect a lot from an agent, as the purchase of a home is a critical and very important transaction/decision to make, which can be stressful, and John made this process stress free."
Margie
"John showed us at least 20 homes in Broomfield, Thornton, and Westminster. He was very patient with us as we figured out what we really wanted. He is very honest with his opinion of different houses and neighborhoods. This is very helpful because he makes you think about issues that you wouldn't likely think about till after you have bought a house. He worked around our schedule and was quick to respond to emails and phone calls. Working with John is NOT like working with a salesman, it is like working with a friend. You won't end up in the wrong house with John!"
Ben & Allison
"Pamela is a real go-getter, spent hours finding the perfect house for us. John was on call for anything we needed. Their recommendations for remodel contractors was invaluable. We will recommend them to all our friends. If we ever move again (I hope not) we will use them again."
Dewey & Janice
"Pam was the best I have every dealt with, She not only was a very wise woman, but she was very professional about everything she did. Every time there was a bump in the road she handled it, she got it done, I have never in my life been so grateful to a person as I have been with Pam, She worked to sell my house untimely, never had a bad thing to say, I was just at aaw at how things worked out, Would I recommend them, You bet!!!! , would I every use them again, you bet. Every time I had to call, she responded very fast, did not have to wait two or three days to hear from hear, she called me back right away."
"John and Pam Subry were very professional and dealt with my sensitive situation with the utmost courtesy and confidentiality. I would not only recommend them to someone but I plan to use them again."
Dennis & Lisa
"Details, Details, Details. Every detail is noticed and addressed. The team of experts that are associated with the Subry Team is the best in the business."
Rhonda & Steve
"John is the best I have ever worked with. He understands the business and the market. He listened to my needs and desires and found properties for me to consider quickly. He is very organized and able to answer my questions. John will be involved in all of my future real estate deals. His professionalism and customer service is first rate. I highly recommend him."
Lori & Clay
"We have known Pamela and John for many years. In this time they have acted as a realtor representative for us in the sale and acquisition in three homes. Each sale was done in a professional manner. The Subry's did an excellent job with solving any issues in the course of the transaction. I would highly recommend the "Subry Group" in buying or selling a home."
Dean & Julie
"John and Pamela Subry have been an incredible asset to my real estate business. They are one of the primary reasons I have been successful. I began investing in real estate three years ago, and was referred to John from a friend. Since then John and Pamela have helped me purchase four investment homes - three foreclosures and one short sale. John and Pamela have an intimate knowledge of the foreclosure and short sale process, which has helped facilitate each successful purchase. They are both extremely hard working and honest people, and use/leverage each other to help me and their clients succeed. They would never hesitate to take extra time explaining something to me, or offer extra assistance to ensure I was successful even if they didn't receive any benefit. John and Pamela are professional realtors and professional people. I would rate John and Pamela Subry six stars!"

Victorian England. There are many secret societies and one of the most powerful ones is the Aegolius Club. James and Charlotte grow up in the country side but James leaves for London to get education and stays there finding lodging with a young aristocrat. When Charlotte does not hear from him for a while she travels to London to find out where he is. There she discovers a hidden world of creatures facing their own troubles. Between the dark alleys of London and the mysterious society of the Aegolius Club there is a lot of politics in which all characters eventually get involved whether they want it or not.
I did not see that coming... a few weeks ago I read a post by Shannon @ River City Reading about preparing yourself for the next book. I never look for information about the next book being afraid to find spoilers. I check the star rating my friends give a book and I read the blurb and that is it. With that information this book is full of surprises. Obviously you know something is going to happen but you do not know what. If you are like me and love surprises you might want to stop reading this review around here.
That were a lot of characters in one story. I am horrible at separating them at one point specially when the one is called Edmund the other Eugene and a Lil and a Liza and help!! So eventually I got James, Charlotte because we started with them and Howland as he was becoming a key figure too. It took me till halfway to get Mould in my head despite him having his own chapters and all the others running around only confused me. I hate it when this happens because I will not really connect with the characters any more when I get to confused. If I don't like the book it is not much of a problem bit I did like this book.
The atmosphere is great. I could see the dark streets and the crowds. The people running around. Even with just a little description it simply worked. The idea of the undead and investigation about what they can handle and how they are is not the most original but it was put together in a great way. Reading the new discovery for Mould that holy water and silver do hurt them made me feel his happiness even though my mind told me I know that since forever and could have told him. I did not really like the first set of Mould his notebook chapters early in the book. Though they give an insight on his life there are to many things missing to keep the story fluent with the information I had at that point in the book. I was glad when I got passed them and the story began to move on again. There were a lot of interesting things happening there with underworld politics and research and creepy characters. This story is tied up nicely but there are some open ends for involved characters that might frustrate a reader who likes everything closed.

Ohh great!Reply
Well well well, I was trying to tell you that I also enjoyed the book. I thought I couldn't like "another" book about these creatures, but I did indeed!
I was very surprised by "the surprise"; I was expecting a totally different book about perhaps a gay relationship. I didn't have trouble with the names, I think, and I loved some of the secondary characters: the librarian who travelled the world, the father and fianceé of the boy who was locked in that room, etc.
ConversionConversion EmoticonEmoticonIn Darfur, radical Muslim militias have taken to slaughtering Christian and Pagan farmers for fun and profit. Since radical Muslims elsewhere in the world are generally a peaceful lot, Ban Ki Moon has wisely seen that it must be the weather setting them off.
Then yesterday the news break that an underground water source has been found in Sudan: AP / Scientists Find Lake Remnants in Sudan. I cannot help but quote:
"Much of the unrest in Darfur and the misery is due to water shortages," said geologist Farouk El-Baz, director of the Boston University Center for Remote Sensing, [...] "There have been two long episodes of drought during the past 20 years, each lasting for about seven years," the scientist said, adding that the drought aggravated tensions between Darfur's ethnic African tribesmen and nomadic Arabs.
This month the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) released a report on the issue: 'Sudan Post-Conflict Environmental Assessment' (full report in PDF | website | summary at PeopleAndPlanet / 'Environmental decay a root cause of Sudan strife'). Also, AP recently delivered an article on the war-resource link (Experts: Darfur Faces Environment Crisis) in which it is concisely explained how droughts triggered the war and how the war worsened the environmental crisis in return.
To date, I haven't noticed any right wing nutcase blogger crack jokes at the actual problems at play, let alone any actual right wing politician addressing them. What they haven't figured out is how to profit, I suspect. But perhaps now water has been found and the experts have been so outspoken on the loose-loose situation there, the neocons will have to find other issues to spin for the next "anti-terror law" or whatever.
PS: Sorry for being a bit more cynical and political than I originally intended to be at this blog. Couldn't help it in this case. Guess that Mac Johnson guy got to me.Greetings,

Electric vehicles owners can sign up for energy from 100% clean sources
Eon has today launched a new tariff for electric and hybrid vehicle owners in the UK that uses energy sourced from 100% renewable electricity and green gas.
The Eon Fixed One Year Electric Vehicle is a dual rate tariff, which offers customers access to a competitive day rate and a night rate 33% below the day rate.
The tariff also matches 100% of both the electricity and gas used with renewable energy guarantees of origin and green gas certificates, Eon said.
Eon residential managing director Chris Lovatt said: “For many electric or hybrid car owners, choosing the right energy tariff may be the last piece of the jigsaw in helping them lower fuel emissions and energy costs.”

REMEMBER
THE FLORIDA 'CHAD' FIASCO?
By
Jon Christian Ryter
June
21, 2006
NewsWithViews.com
The
Election of 2008 promises to dredge up all of the Freddie Kruger nightmares
of the 1990s�Hillary, Bill and the ghoulish reincarnation of Al Gore,
Jr. Only it isn't Nightmare on Elm Street�its Nightmare on Pennsylvania
Avenue. For that reason, and because the voters of the United States
have such short memories, one-by-one�one sin against the American people
at a time�the American people need to be reminded, over-and-over again
between now and Nov. 4, 2008, that the American people had three very
dishonest people at the helm of the USS United States for 8 years. And
rather than run the risk having either Hillary Clinton or Al Gore, Jr.
in a position where they could steal the authority to steer the ship-of-state,
(since neither could win it honestly) it is important that the voters
of the United States have their memories jogged at every opportune moment
between now and Nov. 4, 2008.
Even
before the polls closed in Florida, on Nov. 7, 2000, the Democratic
National Committee hired a Texas-based telemarketing company, TeleQuest,
to take a push poll of every registered Democratic Palm Beach voter
to find out if they were confused by the butterfly ballot. The purpose,
of course, was not to find out who�if anyone�was really confused, but
to line up potential claimants who would agree to sign affidavits that
not only was the ballot confusing, but the voter was convinced that
he or she had accidentally voted for Pat Buchanan. There had been absolutely
no complaints initiated by voters that the ballot was confusing or misleading.
The
DNC provided TeleQuest with a script. "Some voters," the script
read, "encountered a problem today with the punch card ballots in
Palm Beach County. These voters have said that they believe they accidentally
punched the wrong hole for the incorrect candidate. If you have already
voted and you think you may have punched the wrong hole for the incorrect
candidate, you should return to the polls and request that the election
officials write down your name so that this problem can be fixed."
Gore
didn't like the DNC questionnaire. Neither did his campaign manager,
Big Bill Daley. Hastily, they constructed a second one. It was much
more personable, and made it appear as though friends of Gore were calling
the voter. On Nov. 9, those called on the 7th and 8th were called again.
"I
understand you were called yesterday by the Florida Democratic Party,"
the script began. (It would not bode well for the voter to learn that
they were actually called by a telemarketing sales firm whose job it
was to persuade them they had voted for the wrong person.) "I am
following up today on behalf of the Gore-Lieberman Campaign. Would you
be willing to answer a few questions?" If there was no objection,
the telemarketer secured the voter's name, address, phone number, age,
and just about anything else the voter was willing to share.
"Did
you intend to vote for Gore-Lieberman, but think you may have voted
for someone else?" The baited hooks was cast into the recently stirred
waters of uncertainty. If the voter was not too alarmed, the next question
was guaranteed to create doubt where none had previously existed. "Did
you: punch the wrong hole, punch more than one hole, or was the ballot
difficult to punch or mark?" And, finally, the crushing question:
"Did you think to bring the confusion to the attention of a poll
worker?"
Voters
who weren't having a problem would not have brought the matter to the
attention of a poll worker since they were unaware that a problem might
exist. By November 9, hundreds of people who had voted for the candidate
of their choice began to entertain serious doubts about whether or not
they had voted correctly, or that they had properly dislodged the chad,
thus possibly disqualifying their vote.
Within
an hour or so of the polls closing on November 7, 2000 TeleQuest telemarketers
were already laying the groundwork for the butterfly ballot flap that
would start the Chad Dance in Southeast Florida. In a single 45 minute
period between 7 p.m. and 7:45 p.m., over 5,000 registered Palm Beach
County voters were contacted. The sales people from TeleQuest convinced
over 1,000 voters that they may have voted for Pat Buchanan. By 10 p.m.,
every Democratic voter in Palm Beach County who could be reached had
been contacted, and over 2,400 of them were persuaded they had accidentally
voted for the wrong person. The groundwork for the Chad Dance was done.
Gore was going to demand a recount. He needed to find 1,785 votes and,
he decided, the best place to find those votes was in the counties that
had voted most heavily for him.
There
was only one thing wrong with Gore's plan to recount selected precincts
in Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade counties. He could not legally
do it. And, what's more, he knew it. The laws of the State of Florida
allow the loser of a contest within the State and/or counties to request
a recount only if evidence of fraud could be proven. In any statewide
race in Florida in which the defeated candidate lost by less than 1%
of the vote a machine recount is mandated.. With 6+ million votes cast
in Florida, Bush won the State by a margin of 1,784 votes-some 5 thousand
votes short of a clear and incontestable victory.
By
law in Florida, hand recounts are allowed only if there is evidence
of mechanical failure or malfunction in the voting equipment-and, then,
only when the sample hand recount reveals an error of sufficient magnitude
to justify a hand audit. In the case of Gore, the established standards
were obliterated, and the bar dropped so low that any finding in favor
of Gore was deemed to be sufficient evidence that some type of malfunction
or deliberate fraud had occurred.
In
other words, intense pressure from the national Democratic Party level
was applied on the county political machines to give the Gore team what
it needed-enough votes to steal the election. When America's voters
woke on Wednesday, November 8, Gore's TeleQuest campaign to confuse
the voters in Palm Beach County was already in play. The Gore team and
the media jumped on the manufactured confusion that not only did over
3,000 retirees of Palm Beach County accidentally vote for Pat Buchanan,
3,400 of them voted for both Buchanan and Al Gore, and another 15,000
of them cast ballots for both Gore and George W. Bush. In reality, what
was happening was that someone was prepunching ballots before giving
them to the voters.
The
confusion about the butterfly ballot was so rampant that DNC spinmeisters
tried to convince the nation that over 26 people per minute were so
confused about the butterfly ballot that they voted twice for President.
There were 19,200 double-punched ballots in Palm Beach County. There
are approximately 100 voting precincts in that county. The high-error
rate was concentrated in precincts controlled by Democratic voting officials.
Uniquely,
the 4.14% double-punch rate in Palm Beach County was four times larger
than it was in any other voting precinct in the United States using
a punch card ballot. The double-punch rate in the presidential race
in the rest of Florida was 1%. The double-punch error rate for the US
congressional and senatorial candidates nationwide and in Florida was
also 1%. What is even more strange is that in the precincts which experienced
the 4.14% double-punch rate at the top of the ticket, the double-punches
for the congressional and senatorial candidates mirrored the national
average of 1%. The only explanation for the 4.14% double punch rate
at the top of the ticket is that precinct workers were pre-punching
the ballots before giving them to the voters. In Palm Beach County,
Pat Buchanan did not have any supporters handing out ballots to voters
standing in line to vote. All of the double punched ballots had a vote
cast for Gore. There were no double-punched ballots for Buchanan and
Bush�only Buchanan and Gore or Bush and Gore.
When
the automatic recount added 643 Gore votes in Palm Beach, the Gore team
was convinced that finding 328 more Gore votes would be fairly easy.
When the sample hand count turned up only 4 additional Gore votes, the
Gore team needed to buy more time--enough time to amass the support
they would need to demand full recounts not only in Palm Beach County
but Miami-Dade and Broward, the three liberal strongholds in southeastern
Florida. Gore was convinced that in those counties he would find the
votes he needed to win the election. The Chad Dance had officially begun.
After
an electronic recount and one hand recount in the three heavily Democratic
counties, the Gore team knew there weren't enough legitimate miscounts
in the entire State to give Gore the votes he needed. Those votes could
be gained only if the canvassing boards were allowed to discern the
intent of over 6 thousand non-cast votes for president.
Gore's
talking heads argued that nobody goes to the polls to vote in a presidential
election and then declines to cast a vote for president. The simple
truth is that 2% of the American people do just that in every presidential
election�in every city, county and State in the nation. What Gore's
spinmeisters were counting on was that the American people didn't know
that.
And,
the American people didn't know. Gore's talking heads successfully spun
the perception that 2% of Florida's voters were denied a voice in naming
the next President of the United States. Gore was going to unselfishly
contest the Election of 2000 to make sure that every vote was counted.
Since Gore already had a machine recount and a sample hand recount in
three Florida counties, the Vice President needed to make sure the American
people did not realize what he was doing as he tried to revote the ballots
in three Florida counties.
Even
though several hundred Floridians stepped forward to angrily protest
that they had deliberately voted for "none of the above" by declining
to vote for any of the presidential choices on the ballots, their voices
fell on deaf ears. The talking heads shouted louder. The media was too
busy defending those the invisible few whose votes may not have been
counted to listen to those whose non-votes were about to be altered.
The Chad dance was on, playing to the tune of Madam Butterfly. Change
partners.
"I
think we're setting a bad precedent," Supervisor of Elections Jane
Carroll told Judge Robert W. Lee when talk about discerning voter intent
first surfaced. The canvassing board, she told him had "...no business
deciding whether a voter really intended to vote [for one candidate
or another]. That's the reason," she concluded, "that I've never
been in favor of this sort of thing before."
Lee,
a very partisan Democrat, reluctantly agreed. Carroll and Lee both knew
that it was one thing to look at a ballot and see a partially dislodged
chad that should have been counted but had been rejected by the machine
counter. It was another to look at an un-voted ballot and decide if the
voter actually intended to vote for a candidate he or she obviously
had not inteded to vote for simply because a chad might look dimpled
or, if held at a certain angle, a sliver of light might be visible.
What troubled Carroll most was not that she was being asked to discern
the voter's intent, it was that she had discerned Gore's intent. And
it had nothing to do with counting the votes. It had to do with
re-voting
them.
Most
troubling of all was that the canvassing boards were entering a realm
in which there were no written guidelines since the provision in Florida
law concerning voter intent (Section 102) were written prior to the
advent of the machine ballot and dealt entirely with handwritten ballots.
Since the voter was required to make a mark of some sort on a ballot,
discerning voter intent was not difficult. If the voter intended to
cast his or her ballot for a particular candidate, a mark of some sort
would necessarily show on the ballot. For example, if the voter used
a blue ink pen instead of the soft black lead pencil provided by the
precinct, the scanners which read the ballots would not see the blue
ink, but a hand counter reviewing the ballot would. Or, if the voter
was told to color in the entire box but marked it with an "X" the canvassing
board member looking at the ballot would still be able to easily determine
that the voter intended to vote for that candidate.
But
along the Gold Coast, the canvassing boards were being asked to apply
Section 102 to a ballot that did not exist when the statute was written,
and to use pencil standards to determine voter intent when the voter
used a stylus to punch out chads that theoretically remained intact.
They were expected to discern voter intent by sheer guesswork.
And,
guesswork alone was what was used-not exactly what the State legislature
had in mind when the Electronic Voting Systems Act of 1973 was
enacted. As each day passed, the standards for determining if someone
had voted for Al Gore were lowered, until it reached the point if the
canvassing board member could see a glimmer of light penetrating through
the ballot on the Gore chad, it was a vote for Gore. Detached chads
on the Bush slot were largely ignored unless contested by Republican
observers. Ballots were twisted and manhandled to the point that the
floor around the board members examining the ballots were littered with
dislodged chads. The longer the board members examined the ballots,
the easier it was to find a Gore vote in the non-voted ballots.
On
Saturday, November 11, 2000 James A. Baker III held a press conference
to announce that Texas Governor George W. Bush had filed suit in in
US District Court to block any further attempts on the part of Vice
President Al Gore to seek any additional recounts in the State of Florida.
Baker reminded the media that Gore had promised the American people
that he would concede if the automatic machine recount confirmed Bush's
victory. It did. He didn't. Second, he told the American people that
he would concede the election if hand sampling supported the machine
count. It did. He didn't.
Even
though a majority of Americans polled by the various news agencies wanted,
and expected, Gore to concede at that point, the Bush team knew Gore
was in the race until he ran out of legal options or until he had recast
enough votes to be declared the winner. This race was not coming down
to the checkered flag. It was only in the second lap. And Bush, who
was less than a car-length ahead, knew it.
Gore's
lawyers had already initiated legal action to push back the State-mandate
certification deadline to give him time to recast undervoted and overvoted
ballots in Palm Beach, Miami-Dade and Broward Counties in search of
the votes he needed not only to overcome the paper-thin lead Bush held
on the 12th, but to overcome what the Gore people knew would be an avalanche
of Bush military votes on the 15th. It was a herculean task, but Gore
was up to it. As he told his aides at that time: "I am destined to
be the leader of the free world�I will prevail."
Enter Your E-Mail Address:
The
telemarketing sales people at TeleQuest had done their job well.
Their sales pitch on the unsuspecting people in Palm Beach County started
the Chad Dance as the Democratic machine attempted to revote the Election
of 2000 for a man who was "talent-spotted" by the People's Liberation
Army in 1988 as a potential American president. After bowing out of
his exploratory campaign to grab the Democratic nomination in 1988,
Senator Gore began his quest for the 1992 nomination in 1989 when he
accepted the invitation of PLA Chinese operative Maria Hsia to visit
the Fo Kuang Shan Buddhist Monastery in Kiaoshung, Taiwan to
received wisdom�and, it appears, a little cash�from Master Hsing Yun
and the People's Republic of China. (According to Edward Timberlake
and William C. Triplett in their 1998 book, "Year of the Rat,"
the Fo Kuang Shan Buddhist Monastery was a PLA spy stronghold.
Most of the espionage carried out in Taiwan by Beijing was done by the
"monks." Master Hsing Yun created a money conduit to Gore through the
Hsi Lai Buddhist Temple in Hacienda Heights, California, wiping out
another Gore myth that the Vice President thought his visit to the Temple
in the summer of 1994 was a community outreach visit, not a fundraising
event where nuns who had sworn vows of poverty contributed $50 thousand
to the Clinton-Gore reelection campaign.).
There was only one thing wrong with Gore's plan to recount selected precincts
in Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade counties. He could not legally do
it. And, what's more, he knew it.Fashion

With a tiny little sigh and a big smile, Erin Wasson acknowledges the general skepticism about models who become fashion designers. “Look, I’m not a pattern maker. I don’t know how to drape fabric. I didn’t go to design school. I’m also not trying to reinvent the wheel. I’m just working to create great-looking clothes within the parameters of an affordable, mass brand. There are no Parisian ball gowns here.”
What is in her Fall/Winter 2010 collection, her fourth for RVCA (pronounced roo-ka), is a series of soft, easy pieces — tees, tunics, long dresses, leggings — that are eminently layer-able. And, as she notes, “they’re clothes that are easily integrate-able into any girl’s wardrobe.” Palette-wise, Wasson “started at white, then moved into sort of muddy greys and a little black.” The collection’s only patterns are some muted black-and-white marble-ization and muted tie-dye effects. Beyond RVCA’s surf and skate DNA, this Texas-born runway regular and international cover girl drew design inspiration from the music world. Somehow, a long loose silvery grey tank dress emerged from a remembered image of “Mick Jagger in a crazy white suit.” And she laughs that she was having “a Stevie Ray Vaughn moment” when she conceived a particular pair of pleated white pants.
Okay, designing the collection is one thing. But what about mounting the fashion show? How does she, as a still-sought-after model, deal with casting and then directing other models? “During casting sessions, I actually think I am more sensitive and empathetic than most. I mean, girls walk in who probably shouldn’t even be models, but I always take the same time with them, give them the same attention before I thank them and send them on their way.”
Her pre-show routine, she says, always includes telling the models how awesome they are. But she also has strict instructions when it comes to the walk. “I know a lot of girls want to do a sexy walk, all pose-y and hip swing-y. I tell them to walk the runway just as if they were walking down the street — with conviction, and having fun, but not as if they’re trying to seduce every guy they pass.”

One specific question was "Does one's online religious identity have to be connected to a specific offline religious tradition or group to be seen as truly "authentic"?" This is a question that I was interested in and wanted to explore
One example that I was able to find was NewSpring Church. This is a type of Church that we talked about in class where there is one main campus and many Satellite churches where the sermon is broadcasted. This church also offers its sermons, lesson plans, and music online.
Here is the info paragraph from the website-
"We are NewSpring Church and we exist to make the name of Jesus Christ famous, one life at a time. You can join us on Sundays in Anderson, Charleston, Columbia, Florence, Greenville, SC, and live online as God moves us forward to spread His Kingdom."
In this sense, I believe it is possible to attend an online only religious service and for it to be completely and totally authentic. The online viewers are seeing the exact same thing that the physical members are seeing. If they are watching it live, they are even seeing it at the same time! This is just one example of how an online community can substitute for a physical church community..
Clear messaging
I often see banners that deliver a wealth of information across multiple, animated frames. These banners are hard to read and the full message is not delivered to the users in the short period of time that you have their attention. Clear, simple and single-minded communication is the key to effective online advertising.
Think carefully about what you want to communicate on the creative and simplify as much as possible. Split the messaging into different banner variations if you need to, but make sure that your message comes across clearly.
Actionable call-to-action
This is something that all digital media are familiar with, but is possibly one of the most important. Every piece of digital media that you release into the wild needs to have a strong call-to-action. If your banner does not ask the customer to engage in some way then you can bet that they won’t engage at all.
Your call-to-action should be prominent, clear and informative giving the user a reason to engage with your creative. If possible try experimenting with several different call-to-actions and then optimise based on the most effective one.
Delivering on the promise
Your creative message and call-to-action builds up a level of expectation for the user. If you showed product A and asked the user to “buy now”, when the user clicks on your banner they expect to be taken to a page where they can buy that product. Logical, I know, but you would be surprised how often advertisers get this wrong and end up sending the user to the homepage instead. Make sure that your landing page is relevant and delivers on the promise that you banner creative has made.
Improving the user journey and ease of user not only provides the user with a much better experience but also increases the effectiveness of your campaign by minimising drop-off and increasing conversion ratios. Make sure that you spend time planning your campaign architecture and thinking about how the user interacts with each stage. Getting this right will determine the difference between success and failure.

Thanks Matthew, can never do with enough reminders on these points, considering the little and distracted time that consumers have for advertisers and products.

SOLYNDRA INVESTIGATION
Published 4:00 am, Saturday, November 5, 2011
Caption
The White House on Friday strongly rebuffed a subpoena from House Republicans seeking all communications about Solyndra, the failed Fremont already have turned over 85,000 pages of documents on Solyndra Inc. The company filed for bankruptcy and laid off 1,100 workers after receiving $528 million in federal
Ruemmler said those documents show no wrongdoing or political favoritism by the administration. She added that curiosity alone is not a justification to encroach on the executive branch's long-standing confidentiality interests.
House Republicans have used Solyndra to highlight what they see as President.
The White House announced last week it had ordered an independent review of similar loans made by the Energy Department. The review by former Treasury official Herb Allison will assess the status of more than two dozen other renewable-energy loans and loan guarantees made by the Energy Department program that supported Solyndra.You may notice some bright red signs up around school, they have been produced by DM & Co.

It is a marvel of athletic ability in George W. Bush’s part to have dodged both shoes. I wonder if he learned from watching the Matrix movies.
But the worst part was that the journalist is being held on charges of attacking the Prime Minister of Iraq. What???? The PM deflected the shoe, he wasn’t attacked.

Pair bonding
‘Pair bonding’ is unusual in insects and not clearly defined, but there are reports that adult males and females of the Thorned Devil (Eurycantha horrida) from New Guinea, probably the LHISIs’ closest living relative, form bonds if kept together for a period. The FAQ website sites the example of “when a pair of adult New Guinea stick insects that have been particularly close, living together as adults for a year, and then one dies [sic]. In these situations, when one dies (of old age) the surviving stick insect not only stays with the other stick insect as it dies, gently touching it, but remains with the corpse for a few days afterwards. Sometimes the survivor refuses to eat or drink and dies as well. This behaviour is not seen in New Guinea stick insects that are not in close bonds.”Subject: Order cancelled without permission

“Yes, we are targeting to complete 100 years and set a new world record,” Sony TV’s CEO Soni Sharma told Faking News, “The only challenge we had were actors getting old, as there was no other challenge.”
Soni said that the television channel was least concerned about generating new stories or scripts for thousands of new episodes that were scheduled till 2098.
“We just need to ensure a few things like laash (corpse), darwaaza (door), microscope, etc. and we can get a script for every episode,” Soni said, “In fact, we are working on a software that will generate scripts having these elements.”
With script or story not being a problem, as is the case with Salman Khan’s movies, Sony Television’s next challenge was to get Salman Khan i.e. the actors.
“We realize that one of the key reasons why this series is still running is because of almost unchanged cast and crew,” Sony claimed, “We don’t have the luxury of changing actors i.e. we can’t make ACP Pradyuman meet an accident, get his face charred, get a new face with plastic surgery, and replace him with a new actor; as we do in other serials.”
With the life expectancy in India not being over 125 years, Sony TV has decided not to take chance and get the actors cloned so that they have the same actors for the rest of the 86 years.
C.I.D. fans and television viewers in general have mostly welcomed the step as the TV series has become a part of their lives for many of them. However, they have asked the authorities to ensure that this doesn’t become a trend in the Entertainment industry.
“We don’t want Anu Malik judging Indian Idol for another 100 years, or Emraan Hashmi kissing all the girls for all these years,” Romesh, a resident of Andheri said, “Or God forbid if KRK clones himself.”The kitchen is one of the most valued spaces in one's home.

Unfortunately, many people don’t save a backup copy of their files, so they feel that their files are gone forever. There are actually several programs that are available to help recover any kind of file formats on Mac OS X. Successful data recovery is based on how the files were deleted or what you have done after the file loss. In most cases though, the files can be recovered. With this software, there is an opportunity to recover 500+ file formats.
Recover Any File Formats on Mac OS X with Data Recovery software for Mac
Sometimes when a file is deleted from a Mac hard drive disk, or storage device like SD card, USB drive, camera, camcorder, etc, people believe that the files are irretrievable. There are actually ways to trace the files and restore them. Even if you can’t find the deleted file in the trash bin or anywhere else on the hard drive, you can still retrieve lost file. When a file is deleted, the system will not erase it, but only free up the space on the hard drive so that there is enough space for storing any other file formats you store on the hard drive. At this moment, there are opportunities for successful data recovery with useful programs like iSolve Data Recovery for Mac.
Based on the high-tech scanning skill and powerful recovery ability, this software can make the difficult data recovery task a simple process for Mac users. No matter how much data you’ve lost, no matter how much knowledge you have with technology, this software offers an excellent user experience by recovering all lost files successfully. This software only requires a few clicks, and the process requires no technical skills. Also, it will do absolutely no harm to your original files.
I Want iSolve that Helps Me Recover Any File Formats on Mac
Recover any file formats that you can think of like PNG, JPEG, AVI, MP4, MP3, MOV, DOC, XLSX, PDF, MPEG, etc on your Mac OS X.
How Can We Recover Lost Files from Mac OS X
In the past, the process of data recovery has been considered a very difficult task that usually needed the help of professional data recovery experts or repair shops. Things have changed dramatically. Based on the powerful techniques of underlying codes for searching and recovering files, iSolve Data Recovery for Mac makes everyone, even computer novices, able to perform the Mac data recovery process without stress.
It’s an easy, fast, and safe solution for recovering any kind of file formats for Mac OS X such as PNG, JPEG, RM, RMVB, MP4, MP3, WAV, DOC, XLSX, EMAIL, PDF, or any other file formats when facing accidental deletion, formatting, improper operations, and many other reasons.
How to Recover Any File Formats on Mac OS X
Open iSolve Data Recovery for Mac on your Mac OS X. You will see your drives (including a hard drive or storage device which you plug it in with your Mac) shown on the interface.
Users don’t need to worry because this software makes the complicated process easy with just a few steps. You just need to follow the guidance in order to perform the whole data recovery operation.
No matter what file format you lost, this software can help you to find it out. Based on the deep scanning process, you only need to choose your drive and start scanning. The software will collect tiny piece of files and then show them to you in a new list on the left side of the screen. You will see almost all file formats in which loss occurred on the left side of the screen once the screening process has begun.
When the scanning results are being previewed, you will see that many file formats are in the results list. Simply choose one of your target file formats to preview (only photo files can be previewed), and make a decision and determine whether or not you need to recover the files. After this, simply click the “Recover” button in order to process the Mac data recovery operation.
After Data Loss Happen: What Should be Done or What Should Not
After data loss occurs, the first and the only thing suggested is to stop using your Mac (or storage device) that contains the “deleted files.” As said above, only the deleted file space is erased. The actual file is not completely erased. If you keep using your device, new files will take the space of the “deleted files,” and you will lose the best chance to recover lost files on your Mac (or storage device). You should stop using your device immediately until you find ways to perform data recovery.
Some users will find a solution to process the data recovery operation on their own. If the method is approachable, then it is an acceptable means of recovering lost data. If the method is not successful, most of the time, the files will become overwritten and the “deleted files” will become irretrievable. Overall, you should not do any more operations before you access a successful and highly rated data recovery software system.
2 thoughts on “How to Recover Any File Formats on Mac OS X”
First of all, thanks Charles, I tried like a dozen programs and methods which I found on Google but seems not of them worked for me. I lost many formats of my files like pics or MS office files. I thought I was going to lose them forever because I also tried to restore from backup, but I can’t find the suitable backup. But the solution in your article actually help me to get back most of the files. I have to say that you and your team do a good job!
This post was the only thing that worked for me to recover my data. Totally worth a long time to wait for the scanning process (around 2 hours). I thought i had a time machine back up on my macbook pro and had my hard drive re-formatted. when i found out i didn’t have the back up i proceeded to frantically search for a way to recover my data. This solution saved me and my files!Wednesday, January 10, 2018
NYC: Anatol Kovarsky New Yorker Gallery Show at the Society of Illustrators January 2 - March 3
Above: an Anatol Kovarsky rough courtesy of his daughter, Gina Kovarsky.
NYC: New Yorker cover artist and cartoonist Anatol Kovarksy (1919-2016) is the subject of a Society of Illustrators gallery retrospective: "Kovarsky's World: Covers and Cartoons from The New Yorker" which began on January 2, 2018 and runs through March 3, 2018. The reception is Friday, January 12, 2018 from 6:30pm until 10:00pm.
Mr. Kovarksy's daughter, Gina Kovarksy, has been kind enough to send on some scans of his work. These are, so far as I understand, not to be seen in the show. But what with dozens of covers and over 300 cartoons sold to The New Yorker, there will be plenty there to gaze upon at the Society of Illustrators.
Please enjoy these "unseen Kovarksys."
Here is a rough of a trusty Saint Bernard dog offering a holiday glass of egg nog. This was drawn as a holiday greeting card for friends.
Another ink sketch on thin paper. This was also a Christmas greeting card for friends.
"Reading the morning papyrus." Another unseen Kovarsky drawing.
If you are lucky enough to be in New York City this Friday, then you can attend the reception. His daughter, the co-curator of the show, will be there and it promises to be a wonderful event with some great cartoonists and illustrators in attendance.American flag in front of Hallandale Beach Water Tower on S.

Simpson enlists in the pinup wall of fame
By César G. Soriano, June 30, 2005
By César G. Soriano, June 30, 2005The shoulder parrot
and the wooden leg
are gone
No more dangling earrings
or swashbuckling swords
hanging from belts hoisting
tattered old shorts
Bare chests are still in vogue
however, eye patches
are all but forgotten
The Jolly Roger has gone
There are no tall ships
made of timber
and driven by enormous sails
filled with air,
or terror
depending on your view
Pirates sail little dinghies
and carry big guns
They call for ransoms
rather than scuttle
the ships of the scurvy dogs
The pirates of 2009
are big business,
charging millions
for a single transaction
however,
they never see it that way
preferring to cling to a romantic idea
an excuse
for their behaviour
Not much has changed
but everything has
Calico Jack, Anne Bonny and Mary Read
went down in history
however, who hijacked
the Maersk Alabama?
Jack would not have lost the ship
then fled
shadowed by warships
hiding in a life boat
that looked more
like a death boat
as each hour passed
Imminent danger
snipers on the Bainbridge
all over in seconds
Captain Richard Phillips
survived the hero
though calling himself
‘The by-line’
The pirates
dead
we will forget
There will be
no history books for them
No romantic memory
or campfire story
Easter Sunday
the pirates chose death
over justice
The hunter must become
the hunted
the seas once again
a battlefield
for justice

ManagingSingapore is a strict country, yes we know. You cannot spit, cannot chew gum, cannot do this cannot do that. Fines and even jail sentences will come if you don’t comply. Or worse, face the rotan! Even a US President can’t help you as in the Michael Fay case twenty years ago. So what about the illegal workers? Well, they are not above the law of course.
According to the latest Employment Act, it is illegal to work part-time even if you are holding a certified work pass, S-Pass. You can only work according to the job destination and employer stated on your work pass!
Some job agencies admitted that some workers have been misbehaving and will try to go against the law. And that’s because they are mired in debt having borrowed a lot of money to come to Singapore. Back home, they will pay a substantial sum of money to a middleman in the hope of getting a good-paying job. So, in order to speed up the process of reducing their debt, they will work part-time!

Operators use these ovens to roast and bake a wide range of menu items, including meats, poultry, fish, stews, vegetable dishes, pastries and breads as well as pizzas, which these ovens can produce in as little as 90 seconds. Operating these ovens, however, requires a certain skill and the learning curve can be somewhat high. heat is retained by brick or stone blocks and dispersed evenly. While traditional Italian oven interiors use volcanic rock or stone, the majority of units have adobe, refractory fire bricks or refractory concrete that is heat resistant to hold onto. Modular units come with either concrete block or steel frame assemblies.
Modular units are designed for pre-existing operations where it would be difficult to bring in large equipment. In contrast, pre-assembled ovens are easy to install, require less space and are lighter weight. Some ovens come with expanded clay for use as a natural insulating material around the oven and with refractory cement for grouting and for setting floor pieces. Some kits also include an opening arch, a metal door with thermometer and a flue.
Pre-assembled and downsized ovens are designed for use in metropolitan areas, where restaurant layouts are most often small and/or irregular in shape. Pre-assembled models generally offer interior cooking spaces ranging from 230 to 640 inches in diameter. When not pre-assembled, wood-fired ovens can be built-in or freestanding. In the case of ovens that create negligible external heat transfer, operators can choose to decorate these units in almost any way imaginable and situate them in the back or front of the house.
Wood-fired ovens can reach cooking temperatures from 500 degrees F to 800 degrees F. The coal bed typically gets as hot as 1,200 degrees F and temperatures can rise 100 degrees every 3 inches from the floor to the top of the dome. Because these units generally do not have a door, they have natural convection.
Installing purely wood-fired ovens, however, is an issue in most urban settings and large buildings. In major cities, it becomes almost impossible for a foodservice operator to use a solely wood-burning oven with these units. Softer woods, such as cedar and pine, will cause residue buildup throughout the oven’s exhaust system.
Some models come with a variety of burner and fuel configurations. Operators can choose to omit any or all of the radiant burners to accommodate wood.
Traditionally available options include a ledge near the cavity door that provides additional workspace and a box for storing wood. A metal dolly can provide a safe way to move and store wood ash. Other options include digital or dial temperature gauges, moisture meters, tools sets, granite shelves, stainless steel flue adapters and custom finishes. lights and wind cowls.Lately there seems to be a bit of a ‘battle of the boxes’ with subscription boxes popping up everywhere, but what about a box that really delivers when it comes to getting your money’s worth?

The Pakistani company Axact behind these scam websites raked in tens of millions of dollars for worthless degrees. Every one of the website claims were false.
The Times reports that sales agents in Pakistan makes false claims, including impersonating American officials, to promote fake online diplomas to unsuspecting customers. The diplomas come to be worthless to colleges and employers.
“Customers think it’s a university, but it’s not,” said Yasir Jamshaid, a former employee of Axact who spoke for the Times. “It’s everything about the money.”
Online schools include fake testimonials and fake accreditation from websites that Axact creates to fool customers into buying fake online diplomas. Axact even went up to now as to create fake LinkedIn profiles for supposed employees with their online schools. The FBI commented that Axact’s system of internet sites was the buy college diploma operation they had seen.

There, I studied animation at CalArts, which has completely opened my eyes as to what I may pursue as a career. I've become a much more outgoing person, as well as a crazier artist. Here's some photos I took:
I absolutely loved the creative, insanely artistic people I was surrounded by at CSSSA. I loved meeting students in other departments, which were music, film, theater, visual arts, dance, and creative writing. This is a picture from "the sublevel" of CalArts, which is an entire floor of art-covered walls.
I loved going to the sublevel and seeing how it was constantly being painted over by someone else. Unfortunately, I didn't paint / draw something in the sublevel, but many of my friends did. I should have :-/
mother monster :)
One of my friends painted this. I met a lot of fellow Whovians. It was magical.
In one dorm room, a post-it Mario suddenly appeared.
One of my super cool roommates and me.
There were several field trips offered by CSSSA, including a trip to Disneyland. We also saw Les Miserables and went to the Getty Museum.
I'm pretty sure I was saying "oh crap" at this exact moment on the ride. (I'm wearing the pink/red shirt in the back)
At the Gettyyyyyy lookin at stuffffffff.
More Whovian amazingness.
The animation department went to Olvera Street in LA to draw everything we could. We drew tourists, street vendors, and the awesome architecture. I found this amazing Last Supper / Scarface painting for sale, but I stopped myself from buying it. I should have bought it.
BUNNIES
A cute lil snail.
A fellow animator drew me. :)
Another fellow animator drew me. I like modeling. :)
Some of my artwork from one of the first life drawing classes.
A paper puppet of a 50s gurrrrl.
Some cut out frames from my final animation project. I put them all together and it made a super cool effect. Don't worry, I'll post a video of my final project. Eventually.
Walkin all togetha.
We totally look like we're in an ad for Urban Outfitters.
Sunset in the background. I miss y'all dearly :)
CSSSA, YOU'RE TEARING ME APART!!!
Stress + Insanity + Love + Fun + Art = CSSSA

Terrariums are making a big comeback in interior design. If youre interested in adding some greenery in your home or office these terrariums are a wonderful option. Terrariums are self-contained little ecosystems that are chic, affordable, and low maintenance. Feel free to get inspired by these fun, tiny little scenes housed in glass containers. You can make your own or buy one at a florist. All youll need to do once every two weeks or even monthly is give it a simple water spritzing! Below are five of my favorite terrariums to make. Keep an open eye next time you head to a floral shop.
1. Mini lightbulb terrariums:
What a great idea making these little lightbulb terrariums, I also like the air plants inside the lightbulb. A DIY project I found from blog The Moody Fashionista.
2. Hanging glass terrariums:
These terrariums are From West Elm. Another terrarium that also used air plants (tillandsia) and succulents. West Elm has a great selection of terrarium vessels to pick from or you could always find whatever you have around the house or at a local floral boutique.
3. Wall magnetic miniature terrariums.
A sweet DIY project from Kangsiro. These metal can circle terrariums would look great in a desert home.
4. The common terrarium containers:
Weather you decide to make your own terrarium or buy one they help add a nice decorative touch to your home. West Elm has a great selection of glass terrarium vessels to choose from or you could always find whatever you have around your house or find a glass vessel at a craft store or even a local flower boutique.
5. Mason jar pendant light terrarium:
Another brilliant terrarium. These pendant light terrariums make for a unique DIY lighting project. What a cool idea. Image from blog Oh, So Darling.
Do you have a cool terrarium DIY project youve made or found one you came across that you want to share? Im always open to new decorating project and new creative ideas.

What are your thoughts on all white appliances?
Stainless steel kitchen appliances have been big in interiors for a few decades now and Im sure will they last a few more decades. White kitchen appliances are making a comeback, so it can be difficult deciding whether or not to upgrade or wait til white fully makes a comeback. Ive been seeing more and more interior design blogs talking about all white appliances and how they are making a comeback, so the time may be now! I think this is nice having the option for consumers to choose either stainless or white. If you

A few months ago I wrote a post on small foyers. I finally got around to making my floating shelf in my entryway and it looks fantastic!
Above is the photo that inspired me to make this DIY project. He: Its much easier getting what youre looking for if at Home Depot if you ask for help and it takes so much longer in the store if youre uncertain on the materials needed. For me, when Im on my DIY decorating missions I want to get out of the store in a timely manner and not be in the store longer then I have to.
Once the paint dried I glued the corner wood piece to the end of the shelf and wiped off the extra glue with a rag. Allow the glue to dry over night.
The Power Grab glue worked great for holding the two pieces of wood together.
Voil the finished floating shelving in my small foyer!

Happy Friday everyone! As you might already know, Ive been obsessing over mint this season but when mixed with gold its a whole new level of greatness! So whether youre looking to try a new paint color in your home or office, change up your wardrobe, or maybe host a party, this color combo is a wonderful option to keep in mind. Lastly the mint & gold combo can go modern, vintage or completely retro, just something to keep in mind.
What are your thoughts on this color combination? Are you obsessing over mint & gold or do you completely dislike this look?

1 day Marrakech Tour
On this privately guided Marrakech medina tour take in the vivid Red City, its monuments & carousing life of trade & fun! Accompanied by an experienced &, & take a walk through the famous souks of Marrakech.
Tour HighlightsForget all the happy talk in last night's post about getting her to sleep at 10:30. At about 3 AM, Gregg woke because he heard a noise and looking at the video monitor, noticed she was not in the bed. Apparently, she was on the futon that is in her room "la-la-ing" into a toy microphone. Yes, not only does she wake up but announces it to the world.
She ended up back in bed with us, which means of course it's time for gymnastics class. Bed jumping, tumbling, kung fu grip neck hugs, all the best moves until sometime around 5. I'm not sure he even got back to sleep, because that's about when he gets up for work. I on the other hand happily hit snooze until I was late for work. Miss Thing? Woke up chipper and happy. I'll put a stop to that tonight.

LOL! i am for real cracking up over this... !!!
Too funny...
Christopher didn't really wake up in the middle of the night unless he was sick, but we had a hard time getting him to stay in bed at nap time and bed time.
Tips? Take all toys out of her room.
Hmmmm...I suppose duct taping her to the bed is not an option?
Bedtime sucks sometimes. :P Is it wrong to feel happy because I can relate and I want others to share in my misery? :P
Is it bad that I'm laughing over here?? LOL
I hope tonight is better than last night!

Every time I try to take a picture I get: "write error" message. The memory card is OK I've tried it with another camera
Answers :
Without more info and suggesting something useful for you, you might want to try a new or different card in your camera. Make sure the card is the generation of card that your camera wants to use. Consult the owner's manual and online. Is this the same card that came with the camera or otherwise worked for you before the trouble? The only other thing (obviously) is that the camera itself might need servicing. Good luck.

She got to sit in a big chair just like Nana
This doll was actually a birthday present for Paisley… lucky for Elizabeth, Paisley has a short attention span and forgot it was her own doll, so now it’s Elizabeth’s most prized possession. He comes everywhere! She is really into being a mommy right now. Its pretty cute.
They tried their best to accommodate us with special cups for the girls, everything was going fairly well. I tried to explain that this was a restaurant where we needed to be quiet and still…. then Paisley’s lunch was placed in front of her. Said lunch was in her view of Winnie the Pooh on Nana’s iphone, not a good move. She decided to be a drama queen and looked at her plate in disgust. She shoved that veggie wrap the heck away from her and yelled NO WAY….. thanks Pais….. as she threw a major fit I tried to aggressively get into the washroom to calm her down as every single person at the surrounding tables turned and stared at us. It was locked, so I just hid under the table and pretended they were Krista’s kids. Come on Krista get your children under control! Geesh.
Then she ate my entire meal…. this is called the mommy diet, its very effective.
We decided today was an indoor day at home, so far I have managed to wash my hair…. and write this blog post. YAY!Wow! I haven't written one of these posts in quite a while but I really felt like doing a chatty post so here we are :) I have all these thoughts running around my head and instead of doing little blog posts on them separately I though it would good to just get them all out.
My Rabbits
On my birthday weekend when my husband & I were away my two rabbits got in together (they are male & female) which means I am pretty sure they are pregnant and I am SO EXCITED! They should be due from this weekend onwards and she usually has her bubs 4 weeks from the date. I can't wait and I'll be sure to put pics up if she does have them :)
This month I subscribed to +bellabox Australia and received my box on Monday! I have decided that I will stay subscribed for at least 3 months and then decide whether I want to continue. I thought every month I might do 2 posts for each month's box. I want to do a post that shows all the items I got in the box and then another one with swatches and reviews. This way I should be able to get the open box post up quite quickly and then have time to test the products and do review post after I have had time to trial the items properly.
Sorry I haven't had time yet to get the Open Box post up for February's box yet but I should have it up this week and then hopefully the review post next week. It was so exciting to get the box at my door and I can't wait to bring it to you!
Healthy Eating
Ew! I hate those words :) It sounds so "fad" like but for me at the moment it isn't. I've started having breakfast daily, not snacking all day and sticking to a meal plan that works. And I am so so proud of myself! It's been nearly 2 weeks and still going strong. In fact it's getting easier. I'm not getting as hungry during the day which is a massive plus because it means I don't get as many cravings anymore. What I want to work on is going for a walk/run at night after tea and also not eating a snack with my coffee at night.
My Skin
My face is so dry at the moment and I know why. I will do a seperate post on it but a while ago I was using 2 sample Neutrogena products together I got terribly dry skin. I had thought it was due to using the 2 products at once but now I realise it was just one of them. So I have stopped using it and am slathering my face with cream every night trying to make it better. I hate dry skin!
Holiday Plans
A few months ago I wrote a post titled "America" about my plans to go to America at the end of the year and this is still in the works. It's the first overseas holiday my husband and I are planning entirely on our own and it is stressing me out! I have no idea where to start when it comes to getting decent accomodation for a reasonable price in a good location. I have no idea about anything really apart from the fact I want to do flights through an agent and I want to go to Disneyland/world :)
If you have planned your own overseas trip I would love any tips you might have as I am so lost!
Future Posts
I am planning to try and post at least twice a week with the occasional bonus post. I have finally got myself a box where I have put products I need to review for you guys so those posts are coming. Not only that but I also want to continue with my makeup collection series. I was also thinking of doing a few receipe/cooking posts and maybe even organisation/home posts. 2014 is looking exciting for me & my blog so I hope you enjoy it!
Let me know if you have any ideas on posts you'd like to see. I love tags and life posts but also I am keen to review new beauty/body products for you!
Hope you are all having a good week!!Middle School News

BlackPlanet is a registered trademark of Interactive One, LLCOh yeah, the second split of the duck season — really on all migratory waterfowl — begins Saturday and runs the balance of the 60-day season in the state’s three waterfowl hunting zones.
And if the tens of thousands of duck hunters across Louisiana expected to see more ducks than the smattering here for the first split — and who wouldn’t expect to see more after the onset of the seasons’ first major frigid blast? — then don’t get your hopes up, not yet.
Phone calls around the state produced mixed reports, the worst of which is there appears to be so few ducks through the central part of the state, from just south of Alexandria through the Atchafalaya and to Terrebonne-Lafourche parishes marshes, that two hunters said they’re ready to pack it up at their camps and beg hunts from friends in the southeast and southwest marshes.
“Been driving around the afternoons after work and haven’t seen much between (highway) 71 and I-49,” Donnie Blanchard said. “It doesn’t look good. A few ducks, no geese, and that coming after what, for us, was short on action in the first split. Yeah, we did well on opening weekend (of the first split), but it was hit and miss, mostly miss, after that.”
Folks watching the skies in the southwest marshes have seen more ducks during the past week, but continue to see what they call “bluebills,” the lesser scaup most Louisiana hunters call “dos gris.”
It’s a migrant usually seen in big numbers east of the Mississippi River — and there were loads of dos gris rafted on Lake Pontchartrain during the past three weeks — but a bird that made up sometimes as much as half the birds in the bag for hunters from Pecan Island west to the Cameron Parish marshes and flooded agriculture fields.
Down in St. Bernard, eastern Orleans and Plaquemines parishes, migratory watchers are hopeful for more water in areas east of the Mississippi River for their morning hunts, and pray they'll be free of fog in the early hours.
There were hunters’ complaints about the 2 p.m. close on public lands. Hunters cited fog curtailing early morning access, then a late rising tide that left some areas dry and without birds through the midday hours.
But the eyes-on-the-skies report is there are more teal, pintails, gray ducks and spoonies filtering in the area on the latest cold front, and could be more arriving on an approaching front that will push morning temps into the low-50s Saturday.
Adding optimism is a partly cloudy Saturday with a southeast wind that could push water back into some areas before rain sets in Sunday and Monday in advance of another, weaker cold front early next week.
The State Waterfowl Study team is flying this week for the December aerial survey to give the latest estimate of any increases in duck counts for holiday hunting.
Give way
Just another note for fishermen about giving the duck hunters time at the launches and in the marshes before running into these areas for a day’s fishing. The trout and redfish, and in some cases bass, will be there at 9 a.m., so give our waterfowling brethren a chance to have their time in the blinds.
Oh, the snow
Asked the social media question about fishing in the snow, and old friend Donald Quick was the only guy coming back with a response from Calcasieu Lake. Seems Kevin Broussard at Cajun Paradise Lodge went out in Friday’s snow and, Quick said “caught three limits of reds and released another 50 here in Big Lake.”
Bass, redfish and trout showed up in boxes in the St. Bernard Parish marshes and areas off the Intracoastal Canal, and retired Air Force officer and good friend Tom LeBlanc reported the cold weather sent him back to Sulphur Mine Lake (from Bason’s Landing in Golden Meadow) and no fish.
Historically, this lake produces decent catches in cold conditions, and Tom and his crew worked areas along Old Bayou Blue and nothing there. On the way back to the landing, he reported catching 40 13-15 inch specks culled from many more small trout, and that two other boats there earlier caught limits.
Now is the time to consider fishing sunshiny days, when sunlight will warm the water and get trout and redfish to move to the flats to feed. Remember concrete and other rock structures help channel the sun’s warmth into the water. So do pipes and platforms, and trees help, too. If you don’t believe that, then why did the snow melt faster around the base of trees than anywhere else in your yard of in and open field last Friday and Saturday.
The highest barometric pressure next week is coming Wednesday.
Weekend conditions.The Senate EMP Caucus takes shape
Last week, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee tried to hold a hearing on the international nuclear agreement with Iran, but the discussion wasn’t especially fruitful. It was clear the hearing, such as it was, was pretty far off track when Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) asked Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, “Do you know what EMP is?”
Today, evidently, it was Sen. Ted Cruz’s turn.
CRUZ: Secretary Moniz, I want to turn to a different question. The single greatest threat to the United States if Iran acquires a nuclear weapon is an Electromagnetic Pulse. A nuclear weapon detonated in the atmosphere over the Eastern seaboard could kill tens of millions of Americans. On July 23rd in testimony before Congress,.
The right-wing Texan, apparently competing in some imaginary competition to become America’s Most Obnoxious Politician, said it was “stunning” to him that Moniz doesn’t know what an EMP is.
The Energy Secretary, who also happens to be a nuclear physicist and longtime MIT professor, tried to explain to Cruz, “Of course I know about the issue. I happen to know something about nuclear weapons; I know about EMPs; I know about various….”
Cruz, growing impatient, insisted that an EMP “could kill tens of millions of Americans” and demanded to know whether Moniz considered that possible. The cabinet secretary – who earned a PhD in theoretical physics from Stanford and is considered one of the top nuclear physicists in the country – responded by noting the importance of specifics.
The GOP senator quickly grew agitated and whined about Moniz “refusing to answer the question.”
The point of this nonsense is readily apparent. As Salon’s Simon Maloy explained last week, “The real purpose in … bringing up the Iranian EMP threat is to get people terrified about the nuclear deal with Iran.”
It works like this: Iran enters into an agreement that denies the country a nuclear weapons program; Iranians magically get nuclear weapons anyway; they somehow launch one over U.S. airspace; and the electromagnetic pulse knocks out our power grid, creating a dystopian nightmare and Mad Max-style chaos.
Ted Cruz is obviously worried about this. So is Ron Johnson. Mike Huckabee and Ben Carson have also recently raised the prospect of this dreadful EMP threat.
You, however, shouldn’t be worried at all.
As we talked about after Huckabee’s reference, fears of weapons with electromagnetic pulses are often a very big deal in right-wing circles. WorldNetDaily, the fringe conspiracy-theory website popular with Rand Paul and his followers, has published “dozens of articles over the years warning its readers of an impending attack on the U.S. – possibly by Iran, North Korea, or Cuba – with an Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) weapon that could leave ‘9 out of 10 Americans dead.’”
Simon Maloy’s recent piece on this is worth revisiting,:
The “exploded device” Huckabee mentioned is a nuclear weapon that some nefarious actor – Iran, North Korea, al-Qaida, ISIS, [insert other international villain] – has managed to detonate in the atmosphere high above the United States. The nuclear blast.This isn’t what you’d call a “likely” event, but it’s nonetheless on Huckabee’s mind.
As Maloy’s piece added, the point isn’t that the U.S. power grid is invulnerable. On the contrary, its weaknesses have been well documented, and when the White House makes the case for infrastructure improvements, this is routinely part of the pitch congressional Republicans ignore.
But such an attack is “not likely to happen because getting a nuclear weapon into the atmosphere above the United States is an insanely complicated and sophisticated task with a low probability of success.”
Or as Max Fisher put it last week, .”

Twenty-eight-year-old Cing Zeel Niang was born in Chin State but left home at an early age to attend boarding school in Pyin Oo Lwin and later studied medicine in Mandalay. Her parents felt that it was in their daughter’s best interests to be educated outside her home state, as standards are lower than in other parts of the country. Chin State lacks a single university - the closest is in neighbouring Sagaing Region – and it is the most underdeveloped nationwide in terms of infrastructure. Cing Zeel Niang - Rosy - graduated in 2012 and began working at a private hospital, but had long had plans to start a business in a completely different walk of life and one that was closer to her roots – selling Chin textiles online via Facebook.
“I hadn’t seen anyone try do it,” she told Mizzima Weekly.
Rosy explained that selling via Facebook is more practical than setting up a dedicated website, as slow internet speeds would make page loading difficult and frustrate potential customers.
However, Rosy was daunted by her lack of first-hand experience in running a business.
“No one in my family has any business experience and they weren’t at all familiar with online businesses. So I didn’t have any business knowledge passed down to me.”
In 2014, Rosy leapt at the chance to take part in a start-up business course with the social enterprise Project Hub Yangon (PHY). The six-month course was the first to exclusively target female entrepreneurs in Myanmar.
“The incubation programme gave me the skills to refine my business idea. If I didn’t take part in it, I don’t think I would have started my business,” she said.
Like many people in Myanmar, where bank loans are virtually unobtainable without collateral, Rosy lacked funding to back her bright idea. Fortunately, the knowledge she acquired through PHY’s programme helped her to develop creative solutions to counter financial constraints, which is an integral part of start-up business methodology.
While still working at the hospital, Rosy began selling Chin fabrics for a handful of Chin women. She photographed the fabrics and uploaded them to her Facebook page, Rosy’s Chin Fabrics, so that she received orders instead of speculatively purchasing anything.
“I also used my colleagues at the hospital, 99 percent of whom were female, to do market research. They were all interested in Chin fabrics and I got to know the price range they were willing to spend.”
She also quickly discovered that Myanmar women are eager to wear fabrics belongings to a different ethnicity.
“Bamar women have no problem wearing different fabrics. If the price is right, they actually prefer to wear tribal fabrics because it makes them stand out,” she explained.
Once she had a sizeable number of orders, Rosy began travelling to Chin State to source the fabrics.
However Rosy’s parents were dismayed to learn that their daughter planned to launch an online business rather than continuing her work as a medical officer.
“My mother wanted me to have a stable, respected profession. It took me six months to convince her that I wouldn’t give up my medical career entirely and that I could balance it with my online business,” she said.
By day, Rosy runs her online business and at night she works as a medical consultant for a parenting website.
Rosy has been running her business for 18 months now and has her family’s full support. When she gave birth seven months ago, her mother volunteered to travel to Chin State to buy the fabrics.
“My mother works with my second cousin, who belongs to a group of weavers.”
However, although Rosy and her mother know a great deal about the traditions behind Chin weaving, which is considered the most intricate of any ethnicity in Myanmar and requires at least two weeks to complete a single piece, neither know how to weave.
“My mother cannot weave and I also cannot, so it’s unlikely that my daughter will learn either,” said the 28-year-old.
“The number of Chin people who know how to weave is decreasing. Women my age don’t know how to weave – those who do are my grandmother’s age, which makes it almost impossible to pass on the information.”
If the tradition of hand-weaving were to die out altogether, it would be a huge loss to a fascinating tradition. Whilst Chin fabrics have more than an ornamental role, with shawls keeping its bearers warm in one of the coolest areas of tropical Myanmar, many are rich in cultural significance. Shawls are highly specific to each of the dozen sub-groups of the Chin people and are also used to mark significant occasions, such as marriage and death. Special blankets, historically woven by the bride, are presented to a couple to mark their marriage – and cover the corpse upon death.
A red shawl, which incidentally looks very much like Scottish tartan, is given to a male who in earlier times fought and killed an enemy from another village, or killed an animal that threatened the safety of his fellow villagers. The shawl is worn during the celebrations that follow, and other men who previously received the honour also don red shawls.
Women of certain Chin tribes receive a white, green and red shawl when they get married, and wear black and white shawls during periods of mourning. Orange is a popular colour for shawls worn by Chin people (who are also sometimes referred to as Zomi) in India, which borders Chin State. Rosy’s primary market is domestic but she also ships items to the United States, where a sizeable population of Chin people live.
Rosy said that new fabric patterns are created every few months, but added that Chin weaving is becoming increasingly rare due to the lack of livelihood opportunities it offers in modern times.
“My dream and vision is to inspire young women living in villages in Chin State to know that they can still make a living out of weaving,” she said.
While machine-made alternatives exist, Rosy steers well clear of them: every item on offer is produced by a handloom.
“This is a socially responsible business – products made using a machine simply won’t work for me. When everything is done by a machine, there’s no value in it. And machines cannot do the most complex work.”
Rosy is also keen to motivate other women to start their own businesses and follow their passions.
“I have always wanted to inspire other women to start something new and to follow their dreams. Even if there is a lot of pressure and a lack of support, just keep at it and eventually you will succeed – you will get somewhere if you put enough effort in. When I started my business I didn’t get enough sleep: I had to learn online skills and it took a lot of time. But finally it’s paid off,” she said.

Duval County Assistant State Attorney Stephen Kunz said Sellinger and Hartwig would be taken to Duval County today.
Kunz said Sellinger and Hartwig are charged with selling 28 pornographic video tapes to undercover agents in Jacksonville.
``These movies were filthy, lewd and obscene,`` Kunz said.
Sellinger and Hartwig were among 10 people arrested in Wednesday`s sweep, which concluded a seven-month investigation, Kunz said. The others arrested were from Duval County, he said.
Seven suspects were charged with racketeering, a first-degree felony, while the other three were charged with the sale or posession of pornographic material, which is a misdemeanor.
``They were delivering a significant quantity of obscene tapes into Duval County,`` Kunz said of Sellinger and Hartwig.
Kunz said there is a state law banning the sale of pornographic material, but that each community sets its own standards as to what is pornographic. He said he didn`t know whether Jacksonville`s standards are stricter than other communities.
``We try to be as vigorous as we can in the area,`` he said.
Kunz said it will now be up to a jury to decide whether the confiscated tapes have any ``socially redeeming value.``
In addition to the Duval County arrests, five people were arrested Wednesday on pornography charges in Clay County south of Jacksonville, Kunz said. He said three video stores were searched and five people charged with misdemeanors for selling obscene material.Schneiderman op-ed: Legislature can still pass ethics reform this session
Updated 6:00 pm, Tuesday, May 26, 2015
Corruption in New York State government is hardly new. The infamous William M. "Boss" Tweed was a state senator during the worst of his crimes. More recently, at least 30 statewide elected officials and legislators have left office because of criminal or ethical problems since 2000.
But the charges against the leaders of both houses of the Legislature in a single session have made this year truly stand out — even in New York's long and inglorious history of public corruption.
Remarkably, after the governor and the new leaders of the Legislature met May 13, it became clear that ethics and campaign finance reform are not even on the agenda as the legislative session draws to a close. This glaring omission — if not corrected — would do a disservice to the lion's share of elected officials who are honorable public servants, tainted by the misconduct of the few.
The people of New York — 92 percent of whom now say corruption is a serious problem — expect and demand government and elected officials to put the public interest ahead of all else. Now is the time for real reform.
More Information
Eric T. Schneiderman is the 65th attorney general of New York state.
There are only two paths to meaningful change: fundamental reform of the system, or more investigations, arrests and prosecutions that further erode public confidence.
In the last four years, Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli and I have partnered to prosecute more than 60 officials and their cronies all across the state, at every level of government, who have abused the public trust. But the parade of arrests will not stop until our leaders take bold steps toward comprehensive reforms.
Fortunately, there is still time before the end of this year's legislative session to get the job done. That is why I intend to send a program bill to the Senate and the Assembly that includes a comprehensive package of changes that reformers, good government groups and the people of New York are demanding.
The reform blueprint I am proposing — proposals attack a system that cries out for change every time the public interest is ignored in Albany. For every voter who is angry about loopholes and exemptions that make New York tax code look like Swiss cheese; or the inability to pass legislation to prevent irretrievable damage to our environment; or the countless New Yorkers who are working full-time jobs but still living in poverty — the time has come to channel that anger into bold reform.
No one can claim the ideas in this bill are radical or partisan, or that they require exploration and inquiry that exceeds the time remaining before legislators leave Albany for the year.
We know what needs to change. There are three weeks left in this session. There are no more legitimate excuses not to act.A New Orleans architect is looking to build small, affordable houses on thousands of irregularly shaped, empty lots that can be found throughout the city but were once thought to be too tiny to build on, the Uptown Messenger reports.
"Jonathan Tate's firm and developer Charles Rutledge began noticing a preponderance of these irregular lots like the one on St. Thomas Street in the Irish Channel, a neighborhood that over the past few years has skyrocketed in real estate value," according to the story.  team is working on their first home on an 880-square-foot lot in the 3100 block of St. Thomas Street.
"They bought the 16-by-55-foot lot on St. Thomas for $22,000. By comparison, a regular-sized lot in the area recently sold for $285,000, and that's not including the price of building a house on the lot," the story reports. "Houses in the area have sold for up to $400 per square foot. The team is hoping to sell their starter homes for around $200 a square foot."

Haha this is such a great track, the LP is sweet as well!Two 12-year-old girls brutally stab their classmate because Slender Man fictional character told them to do so (video)By Mason White 4:40 PM February 19, 2015
By: Mahesh Sarin
(Scroll down for video) Two young girls were arrested on charges of attempted murder after allegedly stabbing their classmate because a fictional character told them to do so, police in Wisconsin said.
The two 12-year-old girls of Waukesha County, were arrested after repeatedly stabbing 12-year-old Peyton Leutner.
Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier told investigators that they were just pleasing the fictional character Slender Man. A court was shown a mutilated Barbie doll, whose hair and limbs were cut and satanic markings were scrawled on its chest.
According to the police investigation, the two girls lured their friend to a park, where they stabbed her 19 times. Leutner barely survived the attack and one stab wound nearly pierced her heart.
The two girls told investigators that they had been planning to kill their friend. The girls were found near the Nicolet National Forest, where they thought that they were going to join Slender Man as they had killed their friend.
The two girls are facing charges of attempted murder. If found guilty, they face up to 65 years in prison.I’m an agnostic in the Merriam-Webster dictionary definition sense, “one who holds the view that any ultimate reality (as God) is unknown and probably unknowable” – a state that can otherwise be known as “hedging my bets.” I actually, probably lean more towards atheist, but I do like knowing about other religions and I do think there is a lot of comfort and good that come out of them. (And a lot of really bad too, but we won’t even go *there* for today.)
However, I like going to church because: (a) I like singing, especially with choirs, and there are some hymns that are just so gorgeous and heavenly in melodies and harmonies that you can be SO transcendently moved. Soothing the savage breast and all that; and (b) there is just a whole community of (somewhat) like-minded people who are there to care and support each other, working together all for the purpose of what I call (probably very blasphemously) “putting on the show.”
The church I go to is one of the more hippie, liberal Protestant denominations, pretty close to Unitarian as you can get. Not a lot of decorations and doodads, communion is open to whoever wants bread and grape juice that day, and usual Sunday attire runs more along the lines of jeans/khakis/shorts/sandals – both guys and gals. Even before our pastor left, we had lots of “lay” participation and people in the congregation take turns running parts of the service and teaching Sunday school to the kids. We have a very energetic choir director, so we always have a (relatively) large amount of people in the choir, and on an off Sunday, the choir members look like they outnumber the people in the pews. On a good Sunday, we might have 45 people in the pews, on a summer Sunday we might have 15-20. We have lots of little kids in the congregation, most of whom are under the age of 8, so during the service before the kids get to go downstairs for Sunday school, there is always chaos of little ones running around and playing with toys. (Ours is not a “sit-down-and-shut-up” church for kids.)
Why am I writing this? I’m not sure, but I’m going with it. It seems to be the story I want to share at the moment . . .
Anyway, there is always part of the service, after the weekly sermon, called “Joys and Concerns.” This is when people can share any of their own joys or problems that they’ve been having during the past week with the rest of the congregation. It can be as innocuous as “My anniversary was this week!” all the way up to people talking about recurrences of cancer, job losses, sicknesses and deaths of family and friends, and heavy-duty personal struggles. The pastor writes all of these things down and mentions them during the closing prayers.
It is always amazing how much people feel comfortable sharing with everyone during these times – just letting a lot of raw emotion come out that has been stored up all week, trying to be brave. It is hard to describe. Sometimes it is very draining, but there is a wonderful, healing things that happens, when everyone’s heart goes out to the person talking, and the person feels like s/he is not alone in bearing his/her burden.
However, for me, there always seems to be a downside to all of the sharing – one that makes me feel . . . well, left out and apart . . .
You see, hearing about everyone else’s problems, makes my problems and issues seem *not very important.* Having money troubles? Well, somebody couldn’t sell their old house fast enough, was stuck paying two mortgages for a long time and is horribly in debt. Angst about paying for school? Some people can’t afford their courses any more and they have to drop out. Angst about horrible conditions at work? Someone has been out of a job for months. Not that it’s all a competition or anything, but how can you compete with that? So I keep my mouth shut, because my problems are not, relatively, problems. Even though they are, and they make me very unhappy. But I feel like I have to suck it up. Which makes it less of a safe space for me. But . . . who can help me, really? Where can *I* turn when I’m feeling bad, without feeling like I’m whining?
So I’m reaching the point where I’m getting pretty tired of the stuff I’m doing. I just see miles more road to travel to get where I want to go and I’m sick of traveling, but I’m also tired of where I am. It’s nice to have the blog as an outlet, but then I actually have to take the time to write all this out. So here I am.
My joys right now: my friends and family, having fun Saturdays, being able to go see plays, taking my college class.
My concerns right now: My Army sister (who is having problems with her legs), my grandma (who really needs someone to look in on her once a week, since she’s living alone and is now taking a lot of medications due to a hospital scare two months ago), Mr. Random and his family (mom, grandmom and sister – all having issues), my job (more people leaving, office is unstable, and I am unhappy every single day), money (Mr. Random’s student loans, pressure because of job uncertainty and debts), school (taking one class a semester is not getting me very far, will take me at least 3 or 4 years at this rate, plus it adds stress in dealing with work).
What are your joys and concerns at this time? Let’s lift them up and share!

Joys and Concerns
Posted by Random Kath at 4:14 PM
5 comments:
Joys - My incredible kids, some very good things about the boyfriend, a home I love and a profession I find fulfilling.
Concerns - My sister's health, a little recent difficulty with the bf, my father, and the state of the world.
I will start off by saying I am a Christian and have been nearly my whole life. Bear this in mind whilst I write and you read! That time of sharing is spoken in churches I have been to for others to pray with and for you. Many studies have been done on prayer, and recently published, that when you are praying for someone else particularily, you do find peace and they also feel better, even if they dont know you are praying for them.
Additionally, the idea of your concerns being trivial compaired to others is not right in my mind.
and I hope to God's.
Joys for me-my grandchildren, my family, Christ in my life, a new home, job, the wonderful Fl weather, should I continue?
My concerns-my grandchildren, the house not sold in NJ, finances associated with that, my older dau progressive failing health, my hubby's health.
SO I'm gonna pray for your concerns and thank the Lord for your joys! Love momma nator
Please take heart that your concerns are not minimal or less important than any others. To me it is all relative; it concerns you therefore it is important.
As for me, my joys are my family and friends, my health and freedom.
My concerns are finding a job and a man to marry me who will make me happy.
hey you ok? havent seen anything new for a bit miss ya!The future of digital marketing: predictions for 2018
As the year draws to a close, Return asks its senior team to reflect on 2017 and offer predictions for 2018. Topics raised include programmatic and shoppable video, voice search, and shifts in online search and targeting…
Guy Levine, founder and chief executive
AI and big data will continue to be on the agenda for 2018, however the gulf will widen between the companies who know how to use it and those who don’t. When brands believe technology will mitigate their need to intimately understand their audience, they will undoubtedly lose in the battle for attention.
As search becomes more complex with a true understanding of voice and context being needed, surfacing content will not be the biggest challenge. The biggest challenge will be about creating an experience and narrative that people truly want to engage with.
Mellissa Flowerdew-Clarke, marketing director
Digital is now ubiquitous in all marketing strategies – even the industries that previously lagged behind are starting to see the benefits of utilising digital, to help future-proof customer acquisition in turbulent market places. We’ve seen a shift over the years from a mass-media centric, one-to-many approach, to digital enabling data-driven, one-to-one tactics. The next phase is, what Forrester calls, ‘post-digital’, where success will be determined by marketing’s ability to adapt to one-to-moment marketing.
To be successful in the post-digital era, marketers must become instrumental across the business – not just from a brand-build and lead generation point of view, but also in its ability to be the voice of the customer; working across departments to help influence customer experience all the way from the front-line, to product development and post-sale.
Marketers have struggled in the past to demonstrate its impact on the bottom line, but with an increasing focus on data-driven strategies underpinning strategic business objectives, and pressure being applied to form attribution models that prove ROI, marketing is increasingly demonstrating its worth, and its seat at the top table.
Andy Heaps, operations director
The goal of digital marketing stays the same. That is: understand who your ideal audience is, reach them at scale, and connect with them effectively and cost-efficiently. But the way we achieve it is changing. No longer can digital marketers work in channel silos. Ensuring consistent delivery of the right message, to the right person, at the right time, in the right place is critical to success, but only works at scale with a truly audience-first strategy.
So, digital budgets need to be channel independent, and those managing budgets across channels need to be more agile than ever. Audience behaviour needs to drive all multi-channel planning and optimisation decisions, so that at any point in time, regardless of the channel or medium, we can show the message most likely to provide the biggest possible step towards conversion.
The final piece of the puzzle, and likely the most difficult for many, is measurement. Google Attribution (due for release in Q1) will bring attribution capabilities to the masses, so there’ll no longer be any excuse to measure ROI on a last click basis!
Dan Beckett, sales director
I think 2018 will see a shift in clients from being overly focused on single channel delivery to a solution-based approach. They will be looking to engage with agencies in a more encompassing, partner-focused relationship, to ensure that digital specialism and support translates into wider business improvements.
Stephen Murphy, client services director
Next year, I expect greater movement of budget towards digital video in terms of focus, formats and platforms. Google will continue to evolve the YouTube proposition and enable more brands to easily curate and promote.
I am excited to see how Shoppable video formats progress, as I think, given the potential this offers, it has been underutilised in 2017, despite some notable brands using it well, such as Ted Baker.
Investment in programmatic video will grow, as will the use of video on the key social channels and YouTube. I expect more brands to see the opportunity to become content creators or be lead sponsors of digital only content, while others will start to more accurately target individuals online based on engagement, sequentially.
Lucy Davies, digital strategist
I’m predicting Amazon will continue to expand into (and dominate) new verticals – everything bar fashion. In many industries we’ve seen it overtake Google as the number one product search engine, and the 2017 push on its added-value services (Amazon Prime, Amazon Now, Amazon Grocery, Amazon Lockers, Subscribe & Save etc) will only continue to grow customer loyalty.
As a result of this, e-commerce retailers will need to adapt their attribution models to understand that new audiences gained on social media or display may visit the site, engage well with product, but then choose to buy from a retailer on Amazon – just because it’s easier/safer/more convenient for them.
Investment in, and optimisation of these top-of-the-funnel channels needs to acknowledge the increasingly fractured opportunities for consumers to buy, and not make strategic decisions from last-click data.
Victoria Blount, head of paid performance
During 2018, I think there’ll be an increased focus on personalised adsthrough Facebook & Instagram marketing.
Using robust analytics, CRM and social data to strategise a multilayered approach which identifies and understands how to intercept the audience in a micro-targeted way, with exact copy matching their buying signal.
Naturally, video is the mother of all content across all social media, but specifically with Snapchat & Instagram Stories – having native content like this which can be promoted through social will become even more crucial in 2018.
Rodica Lazar, head of organic performance
Voice search will become more important next year. Considering in 2017 that 55% of teens and 40% of adults used voice search, we expect the trend to become more mainstream. This will have a major impact on the way we implement keyword research and content strategies.
Engagement with your website will be more of a focus, with analysis of time spent on page, bounce rate and click-through rate becoming the important metrics to look at. UX will become an area of focus. Structured data isn’t a ranking factor, but it does influence CTR and experiments this year have shown that a higher click-through rate has an impact on rankings.
Understanding your customers – what they need, want and how they interact with your website at every stage of the buying cycle, is vital. As all of Google’s efforts go into providing the best search results, more focus needs to be placed on optimising for one-to-one, rather than one-to-millions. Links are now, and will continue to be, a major ranking factor – better link acquisition strategies and more focus on brand mentions help provide relevance and context for a brand.
Rachel Smith, paid search manager
In 2018, keywords’ importance will be fading out. Of course, they will still be there, but audience will be the main focus, more so than it has been in 2017. It is all about the user journey, not just typing in keywords and serving users with a basic ad.
The ads need to be tailored to that person at the right time in their journey, and their specific needs. Therefore, agencies and PPC really need to focus on their audience lists, and how to get specific and creative in targeting the right audiences for their brand.
Phil Norris, head of content
If your content strategy is based around identifying high-volume, low-competition keywords and creating articles or guides to target them, then it’s time for a change. Digital marketers are constantly preaching about putting the audience front and centre, but are failing to do that when they create content that’s targeted at keywords, rather than actual people.
For that reason, in 2018 we’re going to see a much greater focus on long-form content (specifically articles around the 1,500-word mark or longer) that tackle themes or subjects, instead of short to mid-length blogs hammered out in a couple of hours featuring various iterations of a key search term.
It’s the difference between an in-depth guide on the wider theme of ‘how to write a blog’, and an article that just targets the word ‘blog’ (and related terms) over and over again. The former may not hit as many high-volume keywords, but we can guarantee it’ll be more helpful to your audience, which means better engagement metrics and more shares.

Think about the meant use of each piece and whether that kitchen area table you have your eye on has a surface that will probably be damaged by kids doing their research on it. Putting wicker custom furnishings in the outdoor elements is a bad choice, however placing it beneath a covered deck is simply great.
When shopping for quality cushions, make sure they're nice and company, and have removable covers. In time, sound and firm cushions will use less. When you have detachable covers, you could turn over the cushions to make them wear out equally, which consequently makes them last longer. Any cover must come off with no difficulty, be washable, and be replaceable.
Seat legs must not be nailed onto the frame, they should be joined. Plastic and metal legs can quickly scratch or gouge floors so be on the lookout for this. If you're looking for a high quality piece of high-end hand-made furniture, search for a fifth leg in the center of the piece. Avoid buying pricey customized furniture without a 5th leg.

Tell us about yourself and how many books you have written.
I am an x teacher, a current nurse but I have an unrelenting passion for acting and writing. I have written ten children’s books and one adult book, but I much prefer the fun involved with kid’s books. I have two main series for children, ‘Game on Boys’ series for computer addicted kids and reluctant readers, and ‘Diary of a Wickedly Cool Witch’ Series about a good witch who likes to rid the world of bullying
What is the name of your latest book and what inspired it?
‘Sammy McGann and the Secret Soup People,’ for kids aged 7-11. It’s about a little girl who lives with her Mum. One day, she runs away and stumbles across a soup kitchen for homeless people. But what she finds is a lot more than what she bargained for
Do you have any unusual writing habits?
No, just lots of food breaks, usually involving chocolate, but sometimes I get up and lift a few dumbbells just to break up the habit
What authors, or books have influenced you?
I love Andy Green’s humor. I love Diary of a Wimpy kid books although I haven’t read that many. I can’t get past the cheeky sarcasm found in that style of writing; it’s me all over, but sometimes I get pinged for that from the parent’s of my readers who don’t like sarcasm.
What are you working on now?
My latest book is ‘One Day at a Time’ , for a slightly older, teenage audience, about a girl starting again after the meltdown of her former life
What is your best method or website when it comes to promoting your books?
I use Freebooksy a lot but it costs more. Fussy librarian probably the most for its affordability, and it does produce some results. I use facebook groups but I don’t think this is very effective actually
Do you have any advice for new authors?
Don’t think its going to happen quickly even if you have the best book in the world. Develop your following somehow
What is the best advice you have ever heard?
I’m still waiting to hear it
What are you reading now?
Judy Nunn’s ‘Centre Stage’ because I went and saw an author talk by her and she was rivoting. ( x actress from Home and Away )
What’s next for you as a writer?
keep writing, do my back exercises and yoga to counteract writers back, and GET A website!!!
If you were going to be stranded on a desert island and allowed to take 3 or 4 books with you what books would you bring?

Insecticide-Contaminated Food Kills at Least 22 Schoolchildren in India
Free Food Was Provided Under Government's Midday-Meal Program
NEW DELHI—At least 22 children died and more than two dozen others are seriously ill after eating food contaminated with insecticide at a state-run school in eastern India, government officials and doctors said Wednesday.
The children, aged between 8 and 12, fell sick Tuesday after eating lunch at an elementary school in Gandaman, a village about 65 miles from Patna, the capital of Bihar, one of India's poorest states.
The meal of rice, soybean and potato curry was provided under the central government's "midday-meal" program, which aims to ensure children at government schools get at least one free cooked meal a day. India has more food-insecure people than any other country in the world.

India is in the process of introducing one of the most ambitious food-aid programs ever attempted, with the aim of distributing cheap grain to about 70% of the country's 1.2 billion people. The National Food Security Law is likely to be approved when Parliament reconvenes next month.
Critics say the legislation, which is expected to swell the annual food-subsidy bill to around $20 billion, is an attempt by the ruling Congress party to attract support ahead of next year's national election, and that the money would be better spent on improving agricultural infrastructure.
The issue here is providing more food with less use of herbicides and insecticides. We spoiled westerners with relatively bloated salaries can look down our noses at these people while we pay 3 times the price to buy organic and donate to save the whales. But if you want to do more with less for people who need it most, then you need to be smart about how you grow, process, store, and deliver food.
GMO offers the potential not to have to use chemicals to grow food. Those chemicals aren't just lowering the sperm counts in our men - a trend seen worldwide. In some cases they kill.
We cannot know exactly where this particular food batch got contaminated. India has a crazy system of farm subsidies - not dissimilar to one in the US - whereby they buy food from farmers to keep the price up. Sometimes this food is stored for over 2 years before being used in programs such as these. But the general approach is simple. Do more with less, and do it without dangerous chemicals if at all possible.

The Tigers came into Lourdes Hall fresh off of a shut-out loss to the Tigers of Georgetown College, a team which the Patriots had taken to five sets just the week prior. Even with this in mind the Patriots were ready to battle the one loss Tigers and try to gain ground in the Mid-South Conference standings. Set one began slowly for the Patriots as they fell behind 14-8, forcing Head Coach Jason McDannold to take a time out. Out of the break the Patriots rallied, but were unable to overcome the early deficit, dropping set one 25-16. Set two seemed eerily familiar to the Patriots, as they fell behind 15-9, forcing yet another time out. However, the Patriots were able to muster more of a charge out of this break, striking two quick kills from Shauna Stone (Bardstown, Ky.). With the Patriots showing signs of life, forcing long volleys, the Tigers were scrambling for answers, but were able to capitalize on the errors made by the team in purple.
With two disappointing sets behind them the Patriots were ready for a change, and that change came off of the hands of the Abbey Sorrells (Elizabethtown, Ky.). During the third, Abbey was able to find ways to get the hitters involved, gaining the majority of her 26 assists during the frame. The highlight of the set came off the swing of Cat Hall (Louisville, Ky.) when she slammed down the decisive point to force game four. With kills coming in bunches for the Patriots (Casey Stone (9), Allie Southard (5), Cat Hall (6), Shauna Stone (8)), it seemed as if the Patriots had found a way to keep pace with the Tigers. As the fourth set came to a close the Patriots were unable to finish the Tigers, eventually dropping the set 25-18.
The Patriots’ week will continue Thursday at 7 PM in Lourdes Hall when the Lindsey Wilson Blue Raiders (14-0, 5-0 MSC) come to town.After scratch-made cheeses and a thick, creamy yogurt the likes of which I had never tasted at that time in my life. (This was years before Greek yogurt would become a US grocery store staple.) When I ate it, I was struck by how much more dense it was than the yogurt I’d grown up with. And how much less sweet.
Fast forward a decade or two and I’m a mom to three kids living in Roanoke, Va., challenging myself to make as many foods as I can from scratch, to feed my kids as healthily as I can and to combat the pervasive presence of sugar in nearly all commercially prepared foods. It occurs to me that I can make my own yogurt, which dovetails nicely with these goals. I think back to my traveling days and I wonder — can I make yogurt that tastes as amazing as my Albanian mom, Drita, made for me all those years ago?
A bit of research, a few weeks of experimenting and I’m there — marveling at the amazing process that transforms my local, full-fat milk into the thicker-than-pudding yogurt I remember from Albania. It has the same creaminess. The same tang.
And honestly, there has been a jar of homemade yogurt in my fridge ever since.
There are many reputable recipes for how to make your own yogurt from the likes of The New York Times, The Kitchn, Epicurious, Martha Stewart. Most of them have you mix whole milk with a couple tablespoons of commercial yogurt (it’s important it’s made with live cultures), then find a warm place for your jar of milk and cultures (some people place it in their crockpot) and leave it to set for 6-12 hours.
I did not have good luck with this (perhaps the temperature of my house is not consistent enough?). In the end I purchased a (not very expensive) yogurt maker. I also purchase packets of shelf-stable yogurt cultures from my local Co-op. For me, this makes a process that’s a bit more touchy-feely than most recipes let on, a little more uniform. The yogurt maker comes with a large class container (some have single-serve glass containers, as well). We typically finish one batch, wash the jar and start a new batch the same day.
On occasion, we will mix vanilla, honey or jam into our yogurt, but always after it’s been scooped into a bowl. I’ve never made, say, a whole batch of vanilla yogurt. It’s just too good plain. This yogurt works perfectly in smoothies and can be a lovely topping for soups or Indian. But again, we mostly just eat big spoonfuls of it stirred around with a little fruit and homemade granola.
I’ll include the recipe that comes with our yogurt culture below. Whatever method you use to make your own yogurt, I wish you great success. Because once you’ve got it, I promise you’ll be hooked. And breakfast will never be the same again.
Plain Homemade Yogurt
Recipe from Cultures for Health
Ingredients
- 2 quarts whole milk (the fresher the better)
- 1 packet of starter culture
Instructions
- Slowly heat milk in stainless steel or enamel pot (no aluminum) until it reaches 180°F (you’ll want an instant read thermometer). Turn off the heat and let the milk cool to 115°F.
- Pour the milk into a glass jar. Add a packet of yogurt starter and mix thoroughly.
- Cover and culture at 105°F to 112°F for 7-8 hours. (This is what your yogurt maker does for you.)
- Once the yogurt has set, cover it and allow it to cool for 2 hours at room temperature. After 2 hours, refrigerate yogurt for at least 6 hours before eating. (I often keep mine in the yogurt maker for more like 8-9 hours; let it cool on the counter for only a half-hour or so, then stick it in the fridge. That has worked for me. You can tell the yogurt is set when it appears thick and pulls away from the side of the jar. I often shift the jar a bit to see if it seems solid enough; if too liquidy, I give it more time in the yogurt maker.)
- After its time in the fridge, your yogurt is ready to be eaten or used in recipes.

I too have converted to making my own yogurt. I use my crockpot so I can make close to a gallon at a time. After cooling, I drain it through cheesecloth to get a thick, greek-style yogurt. It’s so good, so inexpensive!
I’ve been using Fage as my starter, but may try the powdered next time. Thanks for the tip.
March 30, 2017 at 8:06 pm
So good to hear this, Sharon. Sounds like your yogurt is super thick! Glad to know another convert. 🙂 Thanks for your comment.
March 30, 2017 at 4:58 pm
Yum! This has been on my to do list for a while. I’m wanting to try making it in my Instant Pot. All the blog posts I’ve read say it isan easy process, so once we get settled, I’m going for it! Hold me to it!
March 30, 2017 at 8:08 pm
I was thinking of you as I wrote this post, Jamie. 🙂 Yes, the Instapot sounds like an easy way to go. Definitely give it a try and let me know what you think! Best of luck settling in. Sounds like you are on the fast-track now. (So happy for you!)
March 31, 2017 at 5:55 am
Christina, does your yogurt turn out thick like commercial Greek yogurt without being drained? I’ve been making our yogurt for years with lots of experimentation but I’ve never produced a yogurt that didn’t have to be drained to be thick. I may need to try the packets of starter culture!
March 31, 2017 at 1:38 pm
Lisa, thanks for your comment. So, my yogurt is thick and creamy but not super dense. Between using Homestead Creamery whole or cream line milk and the culture packet, my yogurt come out the consistency of, say, Stonyfield’s Thick and Creamy yogurt but maybe not as thick as some of the Greek yogurts on the market. Hope this helps!
March 31, 2017 at 10:23 am
I go through phases of yogurt making, time to get started again. Will give the starter packet a try this time. Just returned from a food tour of Portland OR, inspired by a dreamy yogurt I bought at Zupan’s. Ellenos is made in Seattle and sold in prepacked containers or over the counter – gelato-style by the lb.
March 31, 2017 at 1:27 pm
Mmmmmmm. Sounds delish, Lisa. Jealous of your food tour. Here’s wishing you some lovely homemade yogurt!
March 31, 2017 at 12:51 pm
I really want to make homemade yogurt. A friend brought it to me this week and I fell in love. My Instant Pot has a yogurt setting so I think I’ll give your recipe a try!
March 31, 2017 at 1:26 pm
Hope you do, Sarah. And I hope it turns out great! Let me know how your Instapot does with yogurt…
April 3, 2017 at 8:42 am
I want to make homemade yogurt for ages! But I don’t have starter culture. Here in Latvia, it’s problem – you just can’t walk in the shop I buy it. Maybe there are some shops in Riga, but I’m too far away from capital city 🙁 I thought to buy one via the internet, but wasn’t sure if winter freeze does any harm to culture. Now it’s spring and I might try 😉
April 5, 2017 at 9:15 am
Ilze: I hope you do give it a try. The yogurt cultures I use do not require refrigeration and should be able to be shipped no problem. Good luck!
April 14, 2017 at 6:11 am
I love to make yogurt at home but it is hit or miss for me. Perhaps I was using the store bought yogurt as a starter. Will switch to cultures. Is there a good yogurt maker you would recommend? Thanks for the lovely share Christina!
April 17, 2017 at 6:05 pm
Zeba: Sorry for the long delay in responding…. We use a YoLife Yogurt Maker, but I hear that your Instapot can do the job well if you’d like a machine that multitasks. Hope this helps! Thanks for reading…
April 18, 2017 at 5:21 pm
Love this post Christina as my hubby who had an Indian upbringing (=homemade yoghurt) also makes our yoghurt from scratch twice a week. We use our Miele warming drawer which heats nicely on a stable low temperature. Also we have just started to experiment with unhomogenised milk – and after a failed attempt we have it working!
April 18, 2017 at 7:49 pm
So jealous that you have a native yogurt maker in the house! 🙂 Do you notice a difference in your yogurt taste/texture with the unhomogenised milk? Thanks for stopping by!
April 19, 2017 at 1:02 am
Ask me again in two days Christina – in yet to taste the first batch of unhomogenised as just finishing the last of the previous batch!Related styles:

You know what's worse than realizing the holidays are over? Resigning yourself to the fact that it's time to take down all of your favorite seasonal decorations. In the days after Christmas, you'll need to untrim the Christmas tree, take down all those lights, pack away your Santa figurines and box up those sparkling snowflakes. Sigh.
But instead of going at the job haphazardly and setting yourself up for a headache next winter when you unpack all that stuff, why not make your life a little easier? Forget those flimsy cardboard boxes and use these tips and tricks to organize your holiday decorations so they'll be ready to go next year. When you pull out a perfectly neat circle of working Christmas lights next year, you'll be glad you did.
Store ornaments carefully
There's nothing more frustrating than finding out that your favorite ornaments didn't survive the trip to and from the attic, garage or basement. To make sure your keepsake ornaments and fragile balls aren't smashed to pieces before next year, you'll need to do some careful packing.
Your best bet is to keep the ornaments in their original boxes or containers, which will keep them protected and make it easy to find certain favorites. If you don't have the originals, your next best move is to find some boxes with built-in dividers. You can find these at plenty of stores or get resourceful and use wine boxes. When you're putting the ornaments away, wrap each one carefully with tissue paper, newspaper or paper towels. Keep similar ornaments together to make decorating the tree a snap next year.
Keep displays together
Reader's Digest magazine pointed out that storing each Christmas display in the same box will help you set up your decorations easily next season. For example, if you always use the same items to jazz up your mantel, from holiday candles to strings of garland, pack all of those things carefully in the same box. Label the box with the name of the location and you'll spend much less time trying to piece together your displays next December. If you really loved the way your displays turned out this year, take a picture to pack in the box so you'll have a reference to help with setup.
Prepare Christmas lights
Next year, you won't have to deal with broken bulbs or frayed cords if you take a little time to double-check your lights before you pack them away. Plug each strand in one last time to ensure that they're all working properly, and go over the wires to make sure they're in good condition. Like you did with the rest of your Christmas decoration displays, it's a good idea to keep all of the lights from the same area in one container. For example, put all of the lights from your front porch into their own box, separate from the ones you used for the Christmas tree. That way, you won't have to frustrate yourself trying to figure out which strand of lights will fit where. Label each box so you know where the lights will go. Don't forget to wind the cords up into neat circles so you don't need to untangle them later on.
Save the wrapping
Gift wrapping is a shame to toss out, not just because it looks pretty, but because it's easy to reuse some of it. Save the gift bags that are still in good shape so you don't have to buy more next year, using one large bag to hold smaller ones and keep them organized. Everything else, like wrapping paper and tissue paper, can be reused as packing materials, Real Simple magazine suggested. Run the paper through a shredder and use it to fill in empty space between your ornaments and other special items.
If you've still got a mess of wrapping paper, tape, ribbons and scissors to deal with, now's a good time to figure out a better way to store them. This Old House had the great idea of using a hanging or under-the-bed storage system if you don't have the space for a permanent area to store crafts and gift wrap. You'll have plenty of compartments where you can put all of your supplies for next year.
Designate storage space
Save yourself the hassle of searching through a maze of boxes to find the ones labeled "XMAS" next year. Instead, designate a specific area of your attic, garage, closet or basement to house all of your holiday items. If you don't already have shelving, it might be a good idea to purchase a shelving rack or hang shelves so everything can be neatly organized and arranged. You'll be avoiding a messy storage space and making the decorating job easier for yourself next Christmas.Homemade Recipe

Let me share to you one of my favorite recipes. I call this "Creamy Chicken Curry". This recipes oftentimes served during our family's special gathering. My friends as well as relatives have been asking how to cook the same. This time I will reveal to you my humble and simple recipe. The instructions may not include the minute details like how many minutes it should be prepared because I don't usually count or observed the same that is why the term i used is "few minutes". I hope you'll like my recipe too...
INGREDIENTS
2-3 tbsp oil
1 kg. chicken, cut into serving pcs.
3 tbsp curry powder
1 pack Del Monte Quick 'n Easy Gata Mix
1 pack 250ml nestle all purpose cream
2 cups water
1 medium onion, chopped
1 thumb ginger, cut into strips
2 to 3 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
3 medium potatoes, peeled, sliced or quartered
2 pcs. carrot, peeled sliced or quartered
2 pcs. bell peppers, cut into strips
green onions
salt to taste
ground pepper
INSTRUCTIONS
In a large pan, heat oil then saute the garlic, ginger and onion. Add the chicken pieces and cook for few minutes, stirring continuously until lightly browned and tender.
Add the curry powder and stir for a minute before adding the Del Monte Quick 'n Easy Gata Mix dissolved in water.
Add the potatoes, carrots and bell peppers then simmer for few minutes until the potatoes and carrots are tender. Season with ground pepper and salt to taste.
Lastly, pour in the NESTLE All Purpose Cream and stir for few minutes until sauce starts to thicken. Serve hot.Amazon has a pretty good special offer for the next couple of weeks. If you buy the upgrade version of Windows 7 before July 11th, there’s 50% discount. So for Windows 7 Professional it’s $99, you’re saving a whooping $100 off list. Windows 7 Home is $70 off- it’s going for $49.
So how do you know which version to buy?
Well the rule of thumb pretty much has to do with your networking needs. If you want to join a domain, or do business with your home computer, then professional is probably the choice to make. If you only have one computer in the house, or a few with minimal networking needs (ie maybe a file and printer sharing), then you can save a bit of money and go with the home edition.
So Microsoft’s sales of Vista have been disappointing. Many IT professionals (us included) recommend using Windows XP instead of Vista on corporate networks. Our reasons primarily have to do with compatibility. Microsoft has been listening to our feedback, in fact the new version (pro only) has an XP emulation mode based on virtual PC, which means that if it runs on XP, it should run on Windows 7. That’s a good feature to include, and they’re much more likely to get several more early adopters as well as become of the project upgrade lifecycle.
From a home user point of view, the rule of thumb is that if you’re computer runs Vista, you can run Windows 7. If you’d like to confirm that, you can download and run the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor. From all reports the beta testing has gone quite well, and most of the IT professionals who support Microsoft are quite pleased with this release.
So what’s new? Well there’s jump lists, which is similar to recent documents on steroids. You right click an icon, and you may see your recent documents- or you might find frequent commands, like start a new email. There’s improvements in taskbar management, and things like aero peek, which allow you to see your desktop underneath a running window. There’s also some hardware based improvements- such as windows touch, which allows you to use a touch screen instead of a mouse. All and all it seems to be a polished and well thought out release- after Vista MS has plenty of room to makes folks happy with the new OS. Windows 7 seems to fit that bill nicely- and at 50% off it’s a good time to buy.Details

1.The Body Shop Lip Butter
I tend to have dry lips, especially in winter, so I really wanted to find a product that will hydrate my lips. I came accross this lip butter about a year ago and it is amazing. It hydrates my lips and makes them smoother, which is what I expected it to do. Plus, it smells amazing and it is affordable. Definitely worth it.
It is available at The Body Shop stores and you can also get it here, for the cost of 6.00$ CAD.
2. L’Oréal Velvetty Full Coverage Lip Color (shade 102) and L’Oréal Shiny Full Coverage Lip Color (shade 201)
These lip colors are great. They are very pigmented and very full coverage. I personally use them as lip liners and as a base for my lipstick, but they can also be used as regular lipsticks. They come in different shades but my personal favourites are 102 She’s so matte and 201 Lacquer-Y Charm. They are affordable, especially for a product that can be a Lip liner and a lipstick at the same time.
These lip colors are available at Walmart in Canada and in the U.S. and they cost 8.96$ CAD.
3. Maybelline Color Sensational lipsticks
These lipsticks are my favourite lipsticks at the moment because they are very pigmented and their shade range is very wide, so you can be sure to find a shade for every makeup style. My favourite shades are 665 Lust For Blush (Matte) and 235 Wake Me Up.
Also very affordable, they can be purchased at Walmart in Canada and in the U.S. and they cost 7.96$ CAD.
4. Revlon Ultra HD Matte Lipcolor
I love this product because it doesn’t dry out my lips. However, this product does not have a matte finish, it is rather glossy. They come in several shades but my personal favourite is the shade 630 Seduction.
They are pricier than the Maybelline Color Sensational lipstick at 9.96$ CAD at Walmart. It is also available in the U.S. at Walmart at 7.97$ US.
5. NYX soft matte lip cream
I absolutely love this product because it feels like butter on my lips. Unlike the previous product, this does have a matte finish that doesn’t dry out my lips; it actually softens them. They come in a variety of shades but my favourite shade is SML04 London.
They are available at NYX stores in the U.S. and on their website, at the cost of 6.00$ US. In Canada, they are available at Shoppers Drug Mart. In Québec, they are available at Pharmaprix and Jean Coutu, at various prices. On nyxcosmetics.ca they are available at the expense of 9.00$CAD.

Then on the first one I hand cut the scalloped border along the top of the patterned paper, added some ribbon and lace, and a few buttons. The second card is pretty simple as well. I used 3 different patterned papers, a border punch, ribbon, a charm, and a rub-on sentiment.

We know from The Case for Animal Rights by Tom Regan (University of California Press; 1983) that nonhuman animals are “subjects of a life” and are therefore entitled to moral rights, including most notably the right to respect. But how to turn moral rights into legal rights? As editors Woodhall and da Trindade write in their Introduction to this anthology
In short, many within the movement have begun to consider whether the traditional ethical approach to nonhuman issues is adequate. As a result, some have begun to turn to political theory in order to provide traction for the movement and better aid for nonhumans. (pp. 2-3)
As an animal rights activist and theorist with more than 40 years of personal commitment as a vegan and professional involvement with the international animal rights movement, I reflect upon the idea of a “political turn for animals” in my contribution, “Are We Smart Enough to Know When to Take the Political Turn for Animals?”, to the Ethical and Political Approaches to Nonhuman Animal Issues anthology edited by Woodhall and da Trindade.
In my book, Growl (Lantern Books; 2014), and elsewhere I have long made the case that the single greatest challenge the animal rights movement faces in achieving animal rights is in embedding the ethical values of animal rights. Theory is only as good as it is in practice. The political turn for animals has to be more than just theory; it must be also about the practice of animal advocacy. I conclude in my chapter that
animal rights is still principally framed as a personal lifestyle choice issue–a moral crusade. Animal rights is not a mainstream political issue alongside others such as the economy, defence, and civil rights. (p. 298)
I go onto propose six action steps which briefly are: engage with local community; join political parties; join animal-related state lobbying organisations; quiz candidates for office; attend political conventions; and stand for public office.

Microsoft doesn’t have a lot of goodwill left in the PC gaming community, thanks especially to the disastrous “Games for Windows Live” service from a few years back.
This isn’t just ancient history, though. Games for Windows LIVE still taints some PC games sold on Steam today, and helps explain why so many people are so skeptical of Microsoft’s PC gaming plans. Microsoft even had its own PC gaming store, just like the Windows Store today.
The Beginning: Bringing Xbox LIVE to Windows, Including the Subscription Fee
Games for Windows LIVE debuted with Windows Vista. The first game to use Microsoft’s GFWL service was Shadowrun in 2007, followed by Halo 2 two days later. Both games only officially supported Windows Vista, but were later cracked to work on Windows XP–they didn’t actually need the latest version of Windows. Microsoft wanted to encourage gamers to upgrade to Vista, just as Quantum Break and Gears of War: Ultimate Edition are designed to encourage upgrades to Windows 10 today.
Shadowrun featured cross-platform gameplay between Windows Vista and Xbox 360 players. This was one of Microsoft’s big promised features a decade ago, just as cross-platform gameplay between Windows 10 and Xbox One is today. However, cross-platform play was left by the wayside. Universe at War: Earth Assault and Lost Planet: Extreme Condition Colonies Edition supported cross-platform multiplayer around that time, but developers–even Microsoft’s own developers–avoided using it again. Even Microsoft’s own Halo 2, which GFWL practically launched with, didn’t support cross-platform play.
Microsoft also announced that a “Tray and Play” feature would be part of GFWL before its release. This would allow you to insert a game on a disc into your PC and immediately start playing while it installs in the background, like you could on a console. Tray and Play never actually appeared in any games, and became vaporware.
Games for Windows LIVE was tied to Xbox LIVE. Everyone started with a Silver account. You could pay to upgrade to a Gold account, which cost $ 50 a year. A gold account was required for playing GFWL-enabled games online, just like Xbox LIVE Gold is required for playing Xbox games online. Luckily, if you were already an Xbox user, you already had Gold–paying for either GFWL Gold or Xbox LIVE Gold got you both. But many PC gamers weren’t Xbox gamers, and this meant GFWL games has a subscription fee for the same multiplayer features other PC games offered for free. In 2008, Microsoft realized it wasn’t getting anywhere with this strategy and gave up on the subscription fees, making online multiplayer free for everyone in GFWL games.
As it was tied to Xbox LIVE, GFWL games only fully work in the 42 countries where Xbox LIVE is available. Try to play a GFWL-enabled game in another country and it won’t work.
Games for Windows LIVE Never Really Improves as Microsoft Neglects It
Worse yet, Games for Windows LIVE didn’t work that well. It was annoying, and it still is annoying today if you play any games that contain GFWL. But the annoying interface is the least of many people’s concerns. GFWL is famous for corrupting save files. Those save files are encrypted to help prevent gamers from copying them and easily getting worthless achievements, so you can’t copy them to a new computer as easily. I’ve personally had these problems with various games.
Even if you were an Xbox user, GFWL’s Xbox integration could be annoying. If you were playing a GFWL-enabled game on your PC and someone powered on your Xbox 360 in the other room to watch Netflix, you’d be in trouble. You couldn’t be logged into the same Xbox profile on both your Xbox 360 and PC, so something as simple as watching Netflix while you play a GFWL game was forbidden.
GFWL did have some unique features, of course–GFWL games could have achievements that give you points towards your Xbox “gamerscore” so you could increase a completely arbitrary number only Xbox gamers really cared about.
In 2010, Microsoft updated Xbox Live’s voice codec, breaking cross-platform voice chat in Shadowrun and other games that used it. That’s a pretty clear example of Microsoft giving up on its cross-platform promises.
Bugs, Bugs, Bugs
GFWL also introduced a variety of other issues and bugs. It was far from the easy PC gaming experience Microsoft wanted to promote–in fact, GFWL games are still more work to play than other games. I haven’t had any issues with games on Windows 8 or 10, except GFWL games.
In fact, to get the screenshots for this very article, I launched Steam and installed Grand Theft Auto IV on Windows 10. When I launched it, Windows 10 informed me that Games for Windows LIVE was no longer supported on Windows 10 and may not work properly–a message I haven’t seen when trying to launch any other game.
I pressed on and the Rockstar Social Club window appeared. I clicked “Play” and nothing happened. I tried several more times–nope, nothing, not even a process in the Task Manager. I searched the web and discovered I needed to manually download the latest version of Games for Windows LIVE from Microsoft, as it doesn’t automatically update itself. After I launched the game and reached the GFWL overlay that wanted me to sign in with a Microsoft account, I found I couldn’t click the buttons in the overlay or the game window would minimize itself. I tried several more times before realizing that I could use the Tab key to navigate the interface and Enter to activate buttons.
There are probably more problems here, but I quit after that–I’ve suffered enough at the hands of GFWL and had enough screenshots.
This is what using GFWL is like: problem after problem. I’ve played games released in the 90’s and early 2000’s on Windows 10, but Grand Theft Auto IV–released in 2008–is apparently too old and no longer supported. Microsoft’s own gaming platform seems to be the least compatible solution.
Games for Windows LIVE Included a Failed Steam Competitor, Too
In December 2009, Microsoft released Games on Demand. This was a desktop application that provided a way to purchase GFWL-enabled games and DLC. It was Microsoft’s answer to Steam.
It wasn’t very successful. In October 2010, Microsoft rebranded it as the Games for Windows Marketplace. In July 2011, about a year and a half after it was originally released, Microsoft announced it would close the new Games for Windows Marketplace and merge it with the Xbox website. The Games for Windows Marketplace application just opened the Windows section on the Xbox website. In August 2013, just over two years later, Microsoft announced the “Xbox.com PC marketplace” would close, and closed it just seven days later. This was just a footnote in a larger update about the Xbox 360 marketplace.
Unlike Steam–but like Xbox at the time–Microsoft’s store didn’t use real currency. It used “Microsoft Points,” which you had to purchase in packs and only served to obscure prices. It sometimes forced you to purchase more points than you actually needed to spend on an individual purchase, too. That doesn’t seem very gamer-friendly.
Microsoft’s store also supported cross-platform purchases of Xbox and PC games, a feature Microsoft is now beginning to promise once again.
Game Developers Finally Flee GFWL
Over the years, Microsoft kept encouraging developers to use GFWL, regularly promising it was dedicated to PC gaming, and sometimes telling game studios to implement GFWL in their games if it had a say. But, aside from that, it didn’t really do much to actually improve GFWL or deliver on the many promises that were made before its release.
In August 2013, a support article appeared on Microsoft’s official website stating that GFWL would be shut down on July 1, 2014. Microsoft deleted this article and then refused to comment on its plans.
This triggered a wave of gamers asking developers to drop GFWL and developers issuing updates to remove GFWL from their games. In June 2014–days before the previously announced shutdown date–Microsoft announced it had no plans to actually shut down the GFWL servers, so games would continue to function normally. Microsoft failed even here, leaving PC gamers wondering if GFWL’s online features would stop working for nearly a year before it announced this.
Such a server shutdown could cause serious problems, even for single player games. Bulletstorm, for example, must be activated online with GFWL before it can be played. A server shutdown would make that particular game–and probably others–unplayable. Bulletstorm actually vanished from Steam after Microsoft’s planned date to shut down GFWL become public. It silently reappeared later. This suggests even the developer expected Microsoft would shut down the servers and wanted to avoid dealing with angry purchasers.
Once again, Microsoft is promising it’s completely dedicated to Windows PC gaming–something spokespeople continued reiterating as GFWL fell into shambles. It’s also saying it believes in cross-platform play and Xbox and Windows becoming closer–something GFWL tried and failed to do. It’s pushing its own marketplace with the Windows Store after failing with a PC game store a few years earlier.
Microsoft may or may not be serious this time. We’ll have to wait and see. But it’s no surprise that PC gamers are skeptical and the limitations of Ultimate Windows Platform apps are drawing so much ire. Heck, even DirectX 12–the only really big news for PC gamers in Windows 10–seems to have only come about in response to the announcement of AMD’s Mantle, which laid the groundwork for the cross-platform Vulkan. We hope Microsoft will do it right this time. But so far, we aren’t holding our breath.

According to Blue Cross Blue Shield insurer Wellmark, there was a patient in the state's Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) exchanges who required $1 million a month in care.
This staggering $12 million in care each year was distorting the insurer's exchange business and forcing it to raise premiums across the exchange rapidly.
While the identity of the patient has not been revealed — rightfully so — a Wellmark executive did tell a Rotary club meeting that the person was a teenage boy with hemophilia, a genetic disorder that prevents blood from clotting, according to the Des Moines Register.
The story is heartbreaking, but it also has implications for the insurance market in the state.
The Wellmark executive told the meeting that the high costs were causing the insurer to raise premiums for the broader system, and the case reportedly was one of the reasons that Wellmark decided to pull out of the Iowa exchanges for 2018.
On a broader scale, this one case also shows why Obamacare's exchanges are facing problems — and why they have been saviors for many sick Americans.
Needed changes
This particular case is special, according to the Des Moines Register. The cost of care for most hemophiliacs tops out at $1 million annually (which is still incredibly costly). This case is an extreme example of the problems facing the Obamacare markets.
Obamacare mandated that insurers cover people even if they had preexisting conditions that insurers previously could use to deny coverage. According to Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the nonpartisan health-policy think tank The Kaiser Family Foundation, this naturally led to problems.
"Of course making insurance more accessible for people with preexisting conditions has also created challenges for the stability of the individual insurance market," Levitt told Business Insider. "Covering the cost of very expensive patients raises the potential need for a reinsurance pool of some sort that existed in the first three years of the ACA and is part of the [American Health Care Act]."
Reinsurance is a policy that provides some federal funding to offset insurers' higher costs incurred from covering a sicker pool of patients.
The Iowa case also fits in with the trend of an increased number of older and sicker people signing up for ACA plans than originally expected since the exchanges came online.
In turn, premiums increased dramatically and insurers suffered substantial financial losses. Losses were so great at some insurers — especially those who mismanaged their plan structures — that they decided to leave these markets.
Levitt also said that a smaller market like Iowa's is even more problematic because there are fewer healthy people in the risk pool to offset the cost for an insurer such as Wellmark.
While these issues certainly need to be fixed in order to provide a more stable market for everyone in the exchanges, the story also gives a strong example for why Obamacare has been a success as well.
Success story
It is apparent that, from the insurer's side of things, the structure of the Obamacare markets presents a substantial issue when facing such high expenses. From the patient's side of things, however, the ACA is likely a godsend.
As pointed out by Levitt, some of the regulatory changes in Obamacare most likely saved the patient's family from serious financial stress and possibly serious health consequences.
"An expensive patient like this would have faced any number of challenges getting and affording health care before the ACA," Levitt told Business Insider on Thursday. "Such an expensive condition would be a whopping preexisting condition, and no insurer would have offered him insurance."
The community rating, a provision of Obamacare, obligates insurers to price premiums the same for people of the same age in the same area. This prevented people with preexisting conditions from being charged more than healthy people and getting priced out of the market..
"Annual and lifetime limits on benefits were common in the individual insurance market and in employer plans before they were prohibited by the ACA, and this patient would have blown through such limits quite quickly," Levitt said.
So, pre-ACA, the massive financial burden for this patient would have likely fallen on the family.
The Iowa case serves as a reminder of the real human impact of policy changes made in Washington at the same time the Senate deliberates on its own version of a healthcare bill.Publish your thoughts

It depends on the situation. If my son refused to allow me to see, he would have his phone confiscated and be grounded from internet time except for his schoolwork when I can fully 100% supervise him (as well as grounded from other activities in his life). It isn't just the not giving up the passwords I would take issue with, but the act of defiance too.

I am with Dove. I have the passwords to their items and they know at any time I can read what they have typed. I like Dove do not read everything, but they are aware that at any time the possibility is there. I have also told them that if they are open and share with me when I ask them questions I am less likely to read their texts.
I feel we are the parents and we need to parent. In todays world that is much different then it was when we were growing up. When I was a teen we did not have cell phones or even a cordless phone. My parents could hear our conversations and know what was going on. I also think it is important to respect their "privacy" Just like my parents were not sitting right beside me listening to the phone conversation I am not right there reading every text. If the trust is broken then so is the privacy. The phone, ipod, etc. are all privileges and can and will be taken if misused.

My kids don't have a Facebook yet (they are under 13), but do have a cell phone and are well aware that I can read any and all texts and if they delete anything or don't let me read it.... the phone is gone. IMO, these are rules that need to be established prior to the privileges being allowed and if the rules are followed... they suffer the consequences.
I actually DON'T read everything, but they know I can and will anytime I feel the need.Subscribe to newsletter for chance to win t-shirts and other cool weekly prizes. Also receive weekly blog summary and deal notifications.

Under the so-called "special consent order," Duke will pay $4,000 each for 21 seeps at the three plants. And it agrees to finish draining the plants' coal ash ponds within the next few years - Rogers by March 31, 2020; Allen by June 30, 2020 and Marshall by March 31, 2021. Under state law, Duke has until 2029 to close coal ash basins at the three plants.
DEQ says the fine is comparable to those issued for similar violations, such as those at the Riverbend plant in Mount Holly.
'PAVES THE WAY' FOR CLOSURE
A Duke spokeswoman says the deal removes a key barrier to closing the sites.
"The Special Order by Consent provides clarity on how natural or un-engineered seeps from ash basins will be monitored and it paves the way for the state to issue nearly a dozen permits that the company must have before it can continue to de-water [drain] and close ash basins," Duke spokeswoman Paige Sheehan said Tuesday.
The agreement doesn't cover what are called "engineered seeps," which are allowed under other permits. It also says Duke can't be fined for new seeps discovered after Dec. 31, 2014.
DEQ and Duke say they expect to reach similar agreements for eight more coal plants in the state.
Duke already has the permits it needs for three of its 14 plants - Riverbend in Mount Holly, Sutton in Wilmington, and the Dan River plant in Rockingham County.
The agreement must be approved by the state Environmental Management Commission. The DEQ is accepting public comments by mail from Wednesday through Feb. 14. A public hearing is planned Feb. 13, at 6 p.m., at the Warren Citizen Center in Lincolnton.

By Gurmukh Singh
Toronto, Nov 8 (IANS) Presidents of 15 Canadian universities embark on a seven-day mission to India Monday to woo students from the second fastest growing nation in the world.
It is the biggest mission to India by Canadian educational institutions after the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding on higher education during Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s visit here in June.
Though more than 150,000 Indian students go abroad for higher education each year, Canada gets only about 3,000 annually.
Thus, Indian students account for a fraction of more than 90,000 foreign students who enrolled in Canadian universities last year.
With foreign students paying more than $15,000 in fees each and collectively pumping more than $6.5 billion into the economy, Canada is looking to a big jump in enrollment from India.
Organized by the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada (AUCC), the Canadian education mission will travel to Pune and Delhi for meetings with educational institutions, the private sector and administrators to usher in new era in ties in this sector between the two nations.
Its major engagements in India include a roundtable with Indian university presidents, which will also be attended by Indian human resource minister Kapil Sibal and his Canadian counterpart Gary Goodyear.
The mission will also participate in the higher education summit being organized by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI).
“This mission is a way for us to get to know India and its needs more deeply - and to make sure that when Indians think of research and higher education, they think of us,” said AUCC president Paul Davidson before the mission’s departure for India.
“Educators and business people in India need to know that Canadian universities are open to building successful partnerships that will enrich experiences for students, strengthen links between our countries and advance international research collaboration,” he said.

When his funds grew short, he replenished them by stealing here and there. His victims dragged him to the nearest oracle to establish his guilt. Many times he was acquitted, as often convicted. When he came to power, he neglected those gods who had found him innocent, and cultivated those who had correctly found him guilty.
This selection features the imperfect tense, describing customary behavior, and using the particle an . It has some entertaining words, and as usual is full of participles. Note the perfect tense used for possession, with the omission of the initial kappa.
They say that when he was a private person, Amasis was a drinker and a joker, and by no means a sober man. When, while drinking and having fun, his means failed, he went around stealing. Those who said he had their possessions led him denying guilt to the nearest oracle. Often he was convicted by the oracles, often acquitted. When he ruled, he did this: whichever of the gods had acquitted him of being a thief, their temples he never took care of, nor gave a thing for repairs, nor sacrificed regularly, since they were unworthy and had false oracles. Of those [temples] of the gods who had declared him a thief, being true gods and furnishing true oracles, he took the best of care.
Return to Pharaoh

Last revised 10 July 1999Dear Friend,
Before you make an important first impression at a job interview, client meeting, family function, or in any other situation in which you want to present your best image, do you usually...
- Bathe or shower and either shave or apply makeup? Of course.
- Scrutinize your clothes and and fix your hair? Always!
- Give yourself a final once-over to make sure everything is perfect? Absolutely.
But if you're like 99% of people, you neglect one major image enhancer. And it turns out that it can absolutely make or break the impression you want to make, the deal you want to close, and the job you want to get.
There's one part of your "public self" that makes a faster, more powerful, and longer-lasting impression than any other. Yet, unlike your appearance, it's something you probably don't give any thought to at all.
Before I tell you what this crucial element is, consider this brief story:

A well-known multibillion-dollar Wall Street financial institution had just experienced the best quarter in its history. The CFO was set to announce this news in a speech he was delivering to a group of shareholders, executives, and analysts.
The CFO painstakingly prepared the content of his speech. He memorized it thoroughly and practiced it for hours. And because he had nothing but great information to share, he was anticipating an excited, enthusiastic response.
But what he got was just the opposite.
When he finished speaking and began to take questions, he could tell that something had gone terribly wrong. It was clear that the audience felt he was hiding something, that they were suspicious of him and believed there was some sort of "bad news" he was covering up.
He was stunned by this turn of events. So stunned, in fact, that he decided to call in an expert to help analyze the situation - a world-renowned vocal coach whose training and techniques are the secret weapons of some of the most popular, persuasive communicators around.
The vocal coach was flown in immediately, and the two men sat down to discuss the problem. The CFO had a videotape of the speech that he had planned to review in the meeting. He reached for the videocassette and stood up to put it in the VCR, but the consultant stopped him. "Don't bother," he said. "I don't need to see it."
The CFO was shocked. "What do you mean? I brought you all the way here to tell me where I went wrong in this speech. You need to see it if you're going to figure out why it flopped!" The consultant shook his head. "No, I don't. I already know why it flopped. I knew it the moment we started talking."
When it comes to important communication, most of us are like the CFO. We, these opinions can be extremely difficult to change. Even when the words you're saying completely contradict the message your tonality is sending.
That's why even the most carefully worded, painstakingly practiced speech, presentation, or conversation can go completely awry if you have not mastered "Vocal Power."

I just want to thank you for all the time, passion and dedication."
- Adriana Gisel "Zoe" Monja
Finally Found Guidance
"Dear Roger, I am an 18-year-old-law student and perfecting my oral communication has become a personal objective for me.

- Thomas Cheam

Changed His Life
"I took vocal lessons when I was a kid and several other times over the years. It's astounding to me that none of those teachers ever had a clue what to do with me. I'm generally a very confident guy, except when it comes to my voice. Now I feel like I finally get it, and that it's all so simple. I appreciate you, and studying your methods has changed my life."
- Mark Schulman, motivational speaker

Up(Date)!!Barcelona coach Luis Enrique was not looking for excuses after his side were held to a goalless draw at Malaga on Wednesday.
Barca are yet to concede a goal in five Liga matches this season but they were far from their best against Malaga, failing to register a shot on target for the first time in the league since 2003-04.
But despite his side’s uncharacteristic performance, Luis Enrique remains confident.
“We lacked precision in the final metres. But at no time has [this] jeopardized the outcome,” Luis Enrique said post-game.
“We need to develop more plays. We have been too direct in many occasions.
“Malaga have played well and had a very high intensity level. It’s a game that has cost us but it’s clearly a successful one for our rivals.
“In some ways they were better than us. The result is fair.”
Luis Enrique added: “We must continue. Players are not machines, you must understand that every three days we are competing.
“Much work remains, we are in the right line, we have known suffering, it is finding solutions and not excuses.”

Anyway, Hanna, I appreciate your concern for his privacy. He is totally okay with it, even thought it was strange of me to ask. I am a bit concerned with your phrase "if a parent has a problem with the school". I want to be clear that it is Jesse who has a problem at the school; so, of course, I am concerned. For me, this is very different . We do not have a problem with the school. We love it! Since the issue is so model-related, and not of a personal nature, the approach of posting seemed appropriate and was quick and easy. It's also always good to hear all the responses, and various perspectives.
That said, thank you for providing me with this clarity in procedure. Sounds good. It's not so easy being a Sudbury parent and knowing how to "do it right". When he asked me for help, my first response was that I don't think I'm supposed to. This is our 6th year, and I'm still learning.
We'll be contacting you, and thanks again.

Subject: [Discuss-sudbury-model] what should I do?
I am a staff member at Sudbury Valley School and I'm stunned by Ann Ide's post. I have an excellent relationship with her son, and my experience with him is that he is not shy at all. However, if he happens to be reticent about this particular need, I think that Ann should ask him what he wants her to do. Does he want her to come to school for a conference, to help him figure this out, or does he want to do this himself?
I wonder how comfortable her son is about having his problems discussed on the internet, and I wish that Ann had talked to someone at school, with her son's permission, before she put her question to the public. The "Textbook picture of the model" that Ann refers to respects the child's privacy above all, and if a parent has a problem with the school, the best way to deal with it is to discuss it with the child and come to someone in the school and work it out.

Jalal Uddin, 64, was found with serious head injuries at a play area in Wardleworth on 18 February.
It is thought he was on his way home from dinner at a friend's house after attending evening prayers at the Jalalia Jamé mosque in Trafalgar Street. He was taken to hospital from the scene, in South Street, Wardleworth, but later died.
Mohammed Hussain Syeedy, from Rochdale, was arrested and charged with his murder. He pleaded not guilty during an appearance at Manchester Crown Court via video-link from prison on Friday (27 May).
He also denied a second charge of conspiring with others between 1 August 2015 and 19 February 2016 to murder Uddin. A trial has been set for 31 August.
Uddin's death led to warnings from authorities over potential ethnic tensions in the area. The chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation, Mohammed Shafiq, said at the time he was shocked by the news but urged the community of Rochdale to stay united.
"We pay tribute to him and his unique contribution to our community in Rochdale," Shafiq said. ."AboutA drawstring waistband on the lower hem in the front makes this t-shirt with long sleeves very special.

(569 views)The time that registered nurse Susan Furr recently spent with a patient left such a positive impression that she wrote a thank-you note on the white board of her hospital room.
“Unwanted stays in the hospital are never easy,” the note said. “But the skills you possess and the compassion and professionalism you showed made my stay more pleasant. Just remember: Medications are synthetic; memories are forever.”
Furr says the kind words meant a lot. “I like making things better,” she said. “I like making a difference.”
For going above and beyond the call of duty, Furr has been recognized as a Johnston Health Ambassador of the Month.
Never miss a local story.
During a presentation, chief executive Chuck Elliott read aloud some of the comments shared in Furr’s nomination. “She excels at communicating with patients and staff and believes that it’s the key to the organization’s well-being,” he said.
“She also understands that helping a patient heal is more than administering medications or talking about test results,” Elliott said. “It’s also about taking the time to listen and to show genuine concern.”
Furr works nights on third floor at Johnston Health Clayton. It’s the shift she’s always preferred, she says, because the pace is less hectic, and she has more time to talk with patients.
“I like teaching them about a new diagnosis, answering questions about their medicines or disease processes, or helping them process what’s happened during their day,” she said.
Furr grew up in Durham and knew from a young age that she wanted to be a nurse. During her 28-year career, she’s worked in every hospital area except the operating room and emergency department.
Although she’s lived in Clayton for the past 20 years, she’s worked in hospitals as far away as Virginia and New Bern. She said she jumped at the chance to join the third floor staff in February 2015 after the hospital opened its patient wing.
Furr and her husband, Shawn, have three grown children, one of whom is a nurse.- Submit Form

You might want to add that you have to have permission if using art from sites like deviantART, Epilogue, etc... as those are sites where professional (and hobby) artists post to.
Sorry to have spent so much time away, but I brought something back with me.
If you go to Google Image Search and type in "site: art," and select "Medium images," you will be treated to a wonderful tour of card art that has been featured on MagictheGathering.com. Great for tokens!

For Superhero pics for all comics go to ComicVine.com
It says my account doesn't have permission to view the mtgsalvation forums thread. =/

That thread was taken down. The reason? Artists who were in it complained about people using their art without credit and/or permission.

I don't know if these would be as welcome as galleries of art, but it might also be worth listing some tools to make your own art. I have used and recommend:
-Terragen, a freeware landscape generator, could work perfectly if you needed a bunch of landscapes, but also for the backgrounds of cards. Runs under windows and mac, also, works well in wine (so far).
-GIMP, the GNU Image Manipulation Program, is an powerful (open-source) image editor. I use it to compose images from multiple sources and to touch up images, but it also has reasonably good tools for starting from scratch (IFS, basic shapes, etc). GIMP for Windows is available here and for Macintosh here.
-Inkscape, a powerful (open-source) vector image editor. Although I'm very fond of it now, if can be hard to get used to, I recommend this tutorial and this manual to learn.
A warning though, these programs were all created for different styles of art than people generally associate with magic, so the art may not "work" or "fit" for you. I recommend trying them anyway, you may discover you like them.
I'm sure that many people have seen these before, but they could be worth listing, particularly terragen. Examples of terragen output (which may be considered galleries in their own right), are listed here.
I am concerned however, that if I composite images from multiple sources (and obviously only if the license allows it), there's barely enough room to credit them properly. Is there a way to store card metadata, such as comments or extra credits?
[edit]: I apologize, the terragen galleries I linked to are mostly gone since the last time I looked, but I'll leave the link because some of it's still there, and the Internet Archive might have some more.
If the tools are under the right liscense and you created the content the artist credits go to you AFAIK, so that shouldn't be an issue.

While not exactly sure what you mean by "card metadata", but there is a "Notes" field associated with every card, always visible in the editor.
Thanks, I just didn't remember; I haven't used the program in a few years and I haven't got it to work again yet. But that should be fine then.
This isn't the place to discuss it, but if you're having trouble getting the editor to work again, please feel free to contact me or start a thread on the matter, and I'm sure several of us will do what we can for you.

I'm looking for a piece of art where the land is changing a landslide is taking place.
EDIT: Never mind.
One source that can be a great help in making humanoid creatures is HeroMachine. Using the easy color selectors, part selectors, and image editors, you can make a quality piece of creature art in minutes. Currently, 3 versions export to a JPEG file, and a fourth can also handle PNGs.
Note: The last three links are to functions hosted on UGO.com. Some sections of that site may be NSFW, but the HeroMachines don't have any such conteent on them.
HeroMachine 3 - Great at creating any character. This is the version that can export to PNG.
Modern Day Warrior Creator - Better at creating modern or futuristic characters. This version, as well as Lordi and Zombie, do NOT include backgrounds you can edit.
Lordi HeroMachine - Better at making fantasy characters, but some more modern elements are available.

I'm having a hard time finding good art for blue spells like counters and draw spells. Any advice on search terms or sites with lots of blue instant/sorcery style art?

Anyone have good sources for Eldrazi-esque creatures (Cthuluhu inspired maybe?) and/or Gideon Jura fan art?
Also, I'm needing something very specific... a picture of a bricklayer/stonemason for use on a white creature.
Anyone have any suggestions? Been looking through the typical channels but so far not much.
I can do the bricklayer up tonight, if you'd like, and I can do the Eldrazi-esque creatures if you'd like, if you have more of a description.
I found a ton of images that would work great for the Eldrazi, but if you can put something together for the Bricklayer I'd be very much obliged.
Do you have a gallery out there somewhere?
I don't have a gallery of stuff that would be suitable for magic cards, if that's what you mean. I've got a site with some of my designs and such on it, but it's not really a good place to get card art. So much so that it's not worth spamming y'all with the link.
I've been playing around with new software for digital painting (To get a more Magic-ish look to the cards), and my roommate has been distracting me, which is why the bricklayer isn't here yet, but it is in the process of being made. Sketches are done. If I can't get the software working right/can't get good enough to my satisfaction in it, I'll just do a less Magic-ish look.I'm totally not been long time not to update this blog since the last post in past few weeks (maybe)

0 people say:Finally the much anticipated Windows Phone 7 has been unveiled officially.
Well, as far as the first impression is counted, WP7 is expected to give both the Android and Apple iOS 4 a tough fight. The LG-E900 itself bears the excellence. Well, its light infrastructure and solid with a metal back with a svelte 11.5mm delivers a very good
sensation. The Volume controls are located on one side and the other includes a dedicated camera shutter (which activates the 5MP camera from sleep mode) and micro USB port. So, what have we in common with all WP7 handsets? Obviously, the keys dedicated to Windows, on the front of the phone are three buttons. They are — Back; the Windows button you press to return to the start screen; and the magnifying glass that launches Bing search. Our only gripe with the build is the Windows button, which doesn’t feel solid when you press it.
The LG Optimus 7 Interface
The most amazing thing with WP7 is that Microsoft has totally overhauled the interface. Though It indeed is the same old Windows, but far slicker than we’ve ever seen it before and totally unrecognisable from previous incarnations of Windows Phone. Windows now gives you a coice between a white or black background and a vivid range of colours to use for ‘hubs,’ which are basically tiles that populate the start screen and are displayed in a list which one can scroll through vertically. The phone flaunts a selection of six hubs: People, Games, Pictures, Music and Video, Market Place and Office. To begin with, the front screen happens to be fully customisable, one has the liberty to access the full list of menu options by tapping the right arrow, press on a feature and select ‘pin to start’ to add it to the Start screen as a hub.
About the Hubs:
LG Optimus 7 hubs aren’t just shortcuts for you to launch an application; they’re interactive, with a host of information within easy reach. As an example, suppose instead of opening Open Office and having to delve through menus to open a document, just flick the screen right to access Documents and flick again to access Share-point. Quite interestingly, unlike some phones where you have to scroll back through screens, the screens are on a loop.
The Optimus Browser:
The browser that comes bundled is quite expectedly the Internet Explorer. Over a WiFi connection the highly trafficked T3.com loads in around 26 seconds and same goes for BBC.co.uk in 17 seconds, which is respectable. The phone also comes along with tap icons at the bottom: Add as favourite, access favourites and Add a new tab, which lets you swap quickly between browser windows.
Multimedia:
The Optimus phone’s 3.7 inch screen responds quite as expected, with full multitouch support including pinch to zoom, while a double tap realigns the text. Watching YouTube videos though becomes a issue as you need to download the video player from Zune Marketplace, which isn’t available in this region yet. Games, links through to Xbox Live and so the services are vague. The gadget also delivers easy Email and Social Networking Services.
Specifications:
- 3.8-inch WVGA display
- 1GHz processor
- 5-megapixel camera with 720P recording and 360-degree panorama photo support
- Dimensions: 125 x 59.8 x 11.5mm.
- Internal Storage: 16GB of on-board storage
- Other Features: GPS with digital compass, accelerometer, light and proximity sensors, Bluetooth 2.1, WiFi
Well, one can give this gadget a shot, what say?

David Bakke writes about money topics like saving money, planning for retirement, smart shopping, and building wealth on the Money Crashers personal finance blog.
If your employer offers an individual 401k retirement plan, you should be contributing to it unless you fall into a very small exception category. The only time I would advise against participating in a company-sponsored 401k plan is if these contributions would interfere with your ability to pay monthly bills or get out of debt. Don’t invest in your future at the expense of your current situation. But if you can afford to make even a small contribution to the plan, go for it. Now that you're considering your personal retirement planning, let's address a crucial question: How much should you contribute to your 401k fund? Is 1% enough? Should it be 5%? Or 10%? Should the amount of your contribution depend on your age? Consider these five key factors.
1. Your Company Match Offer
Many companies will match your 401k contribution up to a certain limit. If possible, contribute at least as much as that limit. This company match is completely free money and you should take advantage of every penny of it. If you don't, you're leaving money on the table. The match limit varies, so check with your company to find out whether or not you are making the most of your 401k investment. Also, make sure you read the fine print: Don't be surprised if your company only matches half of your commitment. Many employers also require a minimum amount of service before their matching contributions are fully vested. If you want to consider contributions that exceed your company match limit, the benefits of your higher percentage contribution begin to drop significantly. At this point, you need to weigh the value of the additional 401k investment against the importance of funding other aspects of your life.
There is a limit on how much pre-tax income you can contribute to your 401k retirement plan. Maximum 401k contribution limits fluctuate from year to year, but currently, the limit set by the IRS is $16,500. Your employer may even opt to set a lower limit than that, and employer limits vary from company to company. I've seen them go as high as 20%, but normally, most companies set it around 10%. Some professionals advise that you should contribute the absolute maximum allowed under this rule. Find out your company's restrictions before you make a decision.
Some say that the younger you are, the more you should contribute to your 401k. In essence, the contributions that you make at a younger age are more valuable than the ones you make as you grow older, thanks to the power of compound interest. However, keep in mind that money contributed to a 401k is less accessible than money invested in say, a Roth IRA account, where you can withdraw your contributions at any time without penalty. At a younger age, you may have greater need to spend money to further your education, buy a home, or make other stage-of-life investments. The value of liquidity is an important factor for you to weigh against the benefit of compound interest. Personally, I think your contribution level should depend more upon your current financial situation than on your age. Your actual income level, your current level of debt, and your plans for upcoming life events (and corresponding need for money) should all play a far greater role in your decision-making process.
Since your 401k contribution percentage has a lot to do with your personal situation, you owe it to yourself to consider your mindset toward your money and risk, and other more subjective factors. There are two schools of thought to consider when determining the right contribution percentage. According to one philosophy, you can begin with a large contribution and scale your percentage back as you see fit. Alternatively, you can start small and raise your percentage as much as you can over time. There are two reasons I prefer the first method. First, it's human nature to set something in motion and then forget about it. When it comes to your 401k, by starting high, you choose to commit a significant portion of your income to your 401k plan and receive the maximum benefit from your company match program. In the event that you never tweak it again, you will not lose out on potential gain because you forgot to ramp up your percentage. Second, while some employers will allow you to change your percentage at any time, others will only allow it at certain times of the year. As a result, if you go with the "start small" plan, it might take you a long time to work your way up to your peak percentage because of limits on how often you can change this allocation.
The benefits of a higher contribution are easy to see in purely mathematical terms. I've spent a few minutes with an online 401k contribution calculator to illustrate this point for a sample situation. Here are the parameters:
1. $50K salary
2. Age 35
3. Retirement age of 65
4. 8% return on investment
5. 25% tax bracket
In this example, increasing the contribution by just one percentage point would drop your monthly income by a mere $31, which is about $8 per week. Since you would be lowering your taxable income, your annual tax bill would decrease by about $125. So on an annual basis, roughly one-third of your increased 401k contribution would come right back to you at tax time. Are you ready for the big number? If you continue to make that additional monthly contribution until you retire, those contributions of eight dollars per week could grow to over $56,000, based on the 8% return on your investment. Say that a few times over in your head: fifty-six thousand dollars.
In the end, you can make this decision only after reviewing the facts of your current financial situation. And more importantly, as your life changes, you should reevaluate your contribution accordingly. There may be times in life when you’ll have to lower your percentage, but hopefully there are just as many times when you can raise it or maintain a target level. Take a few minutes out of your day to think about your own 401k. Do you know your percentage contribution or how to change it? It's up to you to plan for your future, and although retirement may seem like it's a long way off, there will come a day when you'll be glad you did.You likely won’t have to go carpet shopping too many times during your lifetime. If you do, and if you do it right, you might find yourself having purchased a quality carpet that suits your lifestyle so much that you won’t have to replace it for a very long time. With proper maintenance and cleaning, you can double your carpet’s life and make it last for years, making that first shopping trip well worth the effort of proper preparation and consideration before making that purchase.
Factor in the Household Lifestyle
So, what do you look for when shopping for a new carpet? A lot of it has to do with your lifestyle. Do you belong to a large family with kids, pets, and a lot of foot traffic, fur and potential dirty stains getting on your carpet? Stick to a neutral color, a carpet that can withstand a lot of wear and tear, and one that is easy to clean.
On the other hand, if you are living a single lifestyle, in an apartment you have all to yourself, you can probably afford to look at more showy carpets. Just remember to keep in mind the potential stains and dirt you might end up spilling on the carpet, and purchase according to the ease of cleaning. You’ll save yourself a lot of aggravation in the long run if you keep these things in mind.
Go for Quality Each Time
Not all carpets are of the same fiber, even though they may look alike. And while all the different factors that you have to consider when shopping for a carpet might make the process more confusing to some, a careful consideration of each one of them, and all of them taken together will go a long way in the kind of purchase decision you make.
As an overview, remember to ask about carpet density, fiber twist, and the type of fiber used in the carpets. And don’t forget about the carpet’s face weight, which is the weight of the carpet pile per square yard, which goes a long way to determine how tough and sturdy your carpet is.
There are also different styles of carpet, and depending on your lifestyle, you can select from a wide variety of them: berber, frieze, Saxony, for instance, which are the most common.
Remember the Underpad
This is the lesser-known side of the carpet, and the side that is less visible. So, you might be wondering what makes the underpad so important that you need to factor it into your carpet buying process?
Well, the underpad can go a long way in determining your carpet’s lifespan. The thicker the underpad, the better able your carpet is to withstand all the foot traffic and other wear and tear that comes from having carpet that constantly treads upon. So, if you want your carpet to last long, don’t skimp on the underpad. Not only will this minimize the wear and tear on your carpet, but it also feels very comfortable, too.
Have a Professional install your Carpet
When you purchase a new carpet, you will also have to hire the services of a professional in installing the carpets. Sure, you can try to do it yourself, but – and this is especially true if you are attempting to cover a large floor area with irregular corners, you might find that it’s cheaper to just hire others to do the work for you.
This is because there are a lot of things to factor in during installation, as well: carpet measurements and cutting, upholstery work on your stairs or railings, and having the proper kind of installation that warranties stipulate.
Yes, carpet warranties may require that your carpet be professionally installed, otherwise the warranty is voided. This is because carpet manufacturers who do offer these warranties know that the carpet’s life may also be directly dependent on how it is first installed in your home. Poor installation can lead to rips, loose carpeting, and unsightly flooring. If you are carpeting a particularly wide floor area, the work of installation itself might be so prohibitive that it would be cheaper for you, not just in terms of money but also in terms of resources, expertise, and energy investment to hire professionals rather than doing all the work yourself. Atlanta Carpet Cleaning Care – a company who does carpet cleaning professionally have access to appropriate tools that can do the job more thoroughly and a whole lot easier than if you did it yourself. So, save yourself a headache and leave the installation of that new and expensive carpet to the professionals.Business Directory SearchAffordable, clean and spacious apartments located in Amherst, MA conveniently near the University of Massachusetts Amherst.16G Brandywine Dr.Amherst, MA 01002

Today we’re kicking off a new programming cycle, The Open Prep cycle which will take us through to the end of February. It’s all in the name: the purpose of this block of training is to prepare you for success in the CrossFit Open which starts on the 25th of February. We strongly encourage you all to take part. The CrossFit Open is, without doubt, THE CrossFit event of the year. Last year more than 250,000 people took part from all over the world: young and old, beast and rank beginner. The online competition runs for 5 weeks with one scored workout each week. You guys will do the events at CrossFit City Road where you will be judged. You’ll then submit your scores online to see how you compare with other CrossFitters around the world. Not taking part will result in the instant loss of bro points. And you don’t want that do you?
What does this mean in terms of the new programming cycle? Here’s a rough template for the programming for the next 8 weeks:
Monday – Structured Conditioning (EMOMs or intervals) + Strength Element
Tuesday – Structured Conditioning (EMOMs or intervals) + Strength Element
Wednesday – CF Open WOD (short to medium duration)
Thursday – Low intensity mobility, gymnastics & recovery work
Friday – Snatch or Clean & Jerk + Barbell Cycling work + Squats
Saturday – CF Open WOD (longer duration)
We will be testing previous years’ Open workouts on Wednesdays and Saturdays. These will be the ‘Game Days’. We expect you to really go after these workouts which is why they are programmed without any additional strength or conditioning work. We’ll warm up, look at some specific relevant skills progressions, talk strategy and then get after it!
Mondays and Tuesdays will be more structured. The EMOMs will emphasise gymnastic skills relevant to The Open. That means lots of chest to bar pull ups, toes to bar and handstand push ups. We’ll also use these structures to test your capacity in these movements under metabolic fatigue (i.e. combined with rowing or burpees etc.). The intervals will focus on engine work. Beyond technical efficiency, one of the main capacities you need to do well in The Open is the ability to push hard for extended periods. In order to improve on this we’ll use moderate duration intervals (2-4 mins) with relatively low skilled movements to target your work capacity in that glycolytic energy system.
Thursdays will be low intensity but please don’t think this means they are any less important! This is your opportunity to recover and recuperate. This is your opportunity to improve your mobility and range of motion. And it’s also a chance to ‘play’ with some unconventional movements like rolls and hangs. Honestly, I think everyone should come to this class if they can.
Fridays will continue to emphasise improving your snatch and clean & jerk, but with a twist. After a shorter specific weightlifting element, we will move on to some barbell cycling work. What this means is that we will be practicing higher repetition touch and go snatches and clean & jerks, both power and full squat versions, where the bar does not rest on the ground for the duration of the set. This will be a challenge both in terms of skill and in terms of endurance. Nothing gets you breathing like high rep olympic weightlifting! We finish, of course, with SQUATS.
ENJOY! Oh, and happy new year… How are those resolution coming along?

Taking the Red Eye Home
A personal story about the Lake Erie & Northen
interurban.
Al Howlett
About 1948 I was working at the Galt Printers off Main
Street in Galt and the means to get home to Glen Morris was by way
of the Lake Erie and Northern interurban train. After work I would
head two blocks East up Main street to the station. On the way I would
pass Nagies grocery store where the front window contained the doughnut
machine. I had to pass quickly so not to provoke a hunger pang as
I could only afford to buy one now and then. It was always interesting
to watch the mechanical machine whip up chocolate or caramel coated
ones. The plain ones were also good. (same price).
Next came the station an attractive red brick with bay
window and a large waiting room with row seats of sturdy oak in a
standard CPR design. The walls had the ubiquitous CPR prints showing
the wonders of train travel in the mountains. Settling into one of
the seat's you could listen to the ticking of the station clock that
had adjustable red letters on the face stating how many seconds slow
or fast it was. Or there would be the occasional clatter of the telegraph
sounder that had more to do with train operation on the parent CPR
than the LE&N. The station agent was a lady who wore large pearl
earrings and would take train orders from the Preston dispatcher as
well as selling tickets. She had a nervous condition and would shake
her head as she went about her work. I would have a book of paper
tickets because it was cheaper to ride that way. They were punched
when purchased and the conductor would tear one off on the train.
I don't recall the ticket price this many years later, but it was
probably reasonable fare. The station toilets were at the South end
of the building and were quite modern compared to the ones at the
stations out on the line. The big brass knobs on the doors had a slot
for 5 cents to open the door to the stalls. The message is, don't
get caught short without change. I wonder what big brass in Montreal
came up with that idea ?
Going outside on the wooden platform you could look
around the back of the station at the big wall of the PW Gardner Company
advertising the windows and doors the company manufactured. The noise
of the working machinery in the factory could be heard producing wooden
windows and doors. Mill Creek flowed past next to the mill and there
was a track leading across a wooden trestle over the creek to service
the plant as well as the McDougal pump manufacturing works further
on. Just across Main Street you could see the CPR freight house with
tracks containing boxcars with men loading and unloading freight shipments
with handcarts.
Canadian Pacific Electric Lines station Galt, Ontario.
Out on one of the two tracks in front of the station
an electric interurban car may have arrived rather silently and the
conductor would come in and announce "This car for the CPR"
Passengers from downtown would take this up to the Galt CPR station
for destinations such as London, Toronto or almost any other place
in North America. The Southbound cars would come in on the 2nd track
over with a destination sign in the window Brantford or Port Dover.
Then it was time to climb on board and find your favorite seat usually
on the West side as the train was going south. Sitting down in the
quiet car you could see the Newland's factory and if the windows were
open you could hear the looms and carding machines at work. Suddenly
the quiet would end, as the air pump under the car would start with
a "kling-a-kling" noise to charge up the air brakes and
then shut off abruptly. In the winter the electric heaters below the
seats kept things nice and warm. The electric lights with fancy shades
would be all aglow. The anticipation of the short train ride home
would keep me awake for the events to follow.
At 5:25 pm the conductor would bound up the steps into the car announcing,
Paris, Brantford, Waterford, Simcoe and Port Dover. These electric
cars were speedy and the stop at Glen Morris was only about 17 minutes
away. Port Dover 51 miles away was only one hour and twenty minutes
including stops in between. wo pulls on the communication cord down
the center of the car we would start the trip. Next the conductor
would open the rear door and pull the trolley pole from the overhead
wire. The car would lose power and the lights would go out for a few
seconds as the trolley was moved to another wire. The wires did not
have wire frogs to guide the trolley wheel to another line so this
was an ongoing event throughout the LE&N whenever the trains moved
to another track. If the conductor was a little slow making the connection
it could prompt a cheer from some of the young folks. When the electric
line was built it was planned to install pantographs that did not
need wire frogs. However this never happened, as it was cheaper to
use trolley poles.
A few minutes later the car would reach Concession street
where it was required to stop before crossing due to the office and
yards of the Muir Coal Company that blocked the view for pedestrians
and vehicles. Quickly accelerating past the CNR station and freight
house on the right and then across the CNR diamond Water street and
the mighty Grand River came into view. I and another young passenger
would commence one of our high-jinks as the conductor was up ahead
collecting tickets. Working in the print shop small strips of cardboard
were used for spacing between the lines of lead type. These bit's
of card and a rubber band made an excellent finger sling shot. The
idea was to hit someone on the back of the head sitting ahead of you.
Most people rode facing the direction of travel. So when they looked
around to find the culprit you would be admiring the scenery in the
Grand valley or the overhead lamps. I would not direct a shot at someone
who I did not know in any case.
On one trip after engaging in the head stinger game
the conductor called us to task. You boys have got to stop this, as
I want you to see the damage you have done. A man was sitting at the
back of the coach with his hat pulled down over his face. Lifting
the hat revealed a beautiful red shiner. It was decided that a new
form of entertainment should be found henceforth. Our little game
had not created that gentleman's situation for sure. It's still a
mystery many years later, but maybe he disserved the poke. That conductor
was a diplomatic credit to his profession and liked by all of us.
The Glen Morris station was one of the most unique stations
on the LE&N. Built sometime in the 1840's as a stone dwelling
for a tailor shop. When the LE&N was built in 1914 this former
home was adapted for use as a station. My Grandfather and family occupied
this home in 1907 when my father was born here. Standing on the platform
I watched the big electric car head south. With two red marker lamps
on the rear shining brightly, and inside a red eye shining brightly
as well. Destination "Paris, Brantford, Waterford, Simcoe and
Port Dover" plus flag stops in between. Riding the LE&N was
fun and this is probably one of the reasons I became a life long railroad
buff and a lover of plain doughnuts at Tim's.

One of my friends is a young man with a wicked sense of humor that brings joy to those blessed to know him. Not only does he see humor—especially irony—everywhere and in everything, but he often sees the humor that the rest of us miss. Happily for us, he not only sees the humor, but loves to share it with his friends, making the worlds a brighter place for us.
Because cerebral palsy impairs his speech, my friend communicates primarily through gestures, such as a well-timed rolling of his eyes or shaking of his head. And once he gets you laughing, he’ll join in with the best, most wonderful, raucous laughing imaginable.
One sunny afternoon when we were first getting to know one another, we meandered around the neighborhood, he in his motorized wheelchair, I walking beside him. Toward the end of our outing as I finished telling him a little about my life as an Episcopal priest, we came to a rough patch of broken sidewalk. As he carefully maneuvered his motorized wheelchair between two potholes, a wheel suddenly slipped and fell into one of the holes. I shouted something unprintable, terrified he was going to fall. Fortunately the heavy machine didn’t fall over, and he managed to drive out of the hole. Once the danger passed and my heart rate returned to normal, I said to him, “Way to go… you made the priest swear!”
And he laughed and laughed and laughed—that wonderful, raucous laugh. Which made me laugh too.
That’s what Grace looks like.In an EMERGENCY, call 911.

BC Zenit – BC Nizhny Novgorod. Prediction for the match 01.02.2017
Tournament: Eurocup
Venue: Yubileiny, St. Petersburg
Match date: 01.02.2017 20:00 (GMT)
Within the next round of the basketball Eurocup TOP 16, St. Petersburg’s Zenit on your site will make BC Nizhny Novgorod. Team at a group stage have already played four matches, while the best position in the standings, the team from the Northern capital of Russia, in addition, the factor is on the side of the Zenith, so the choice is the bookies favourite-the future owners more than obvious.
While others
After 4 rounds in the Eurocup, Zenit managed to get hold of two wins and two defeats. Victoria was recorded over Hapoel Jerusalem, and on the Lietuvos Rytas. Both the first and the second win happened at the site of Zenit. In turn, the destruction is from BC Nizhniy Novgorod and Hapoel, both away. At the moment Zenit is located and the third line in standings of group G.
While the fourth
BC Nizhniy Novgorod after four rounds played in the basketball Competition, having scored only one victory, which happened in the first round against Zenit. After that Victoria, volzhane lost twice to the Lithuanian team, Lietuvos rytas, and was weaker than the Israeli Hapoel. For BC Nizhny Novgorod upcoming game is the last chance to catch hold of the two strongest in the qualifying group G.
Prediction
BC Zenit stronger than BC Nizhny Novogorod, but something the bookies certainly do not respect the villagers, exposing them as a weak team. If BC Nizhniy Novgorod on the platform managed to beat Zenit, and will give this team a fight and if I lose, it is not devastating. Our free forecast for the meeting:
Victory for BC Nizhny Novgorod with a handicap of +13

I live in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. By choice. It is a great place to live, and I could probably live anywhere in the world I choose, but I met an incredible woman who is Vietnamese and did not want to leave. Having traveled around this country for the past 4 years, I learned why and really love Vietnam for the fascinating cities, countryside, and amazing sights and people I see everyday on my travels inside and outside of the city.
I hope to comment from time to time about life here in VN, and will try to refrain from commenting too much on events and politics in my native country, the USA. I see I can include photos, so I’ll do that too from time to time. Nothing like a pic to brighten up a website, right?

For now I have to write a letter for my sister-in-law. She was recently denied a visa to return to America to put her autistic child back in the special education program in the Texas school the girl was attending. In 4 months the child went from being mostly a hyper-active babbling vegetable to a busy, bilingual five year old who is showing a lot of promise to become a talented, articulate artist. The transformation is amazing and the girl, who is an American Citizen, is being denied an education and family life if her mother cannot accompany her back to America. That is wrong, and we will be working to rectify this.Former Gov. Kathleen Blanco, who recently revealed she is suffering from a form of liver cancer without a known cure, called for University of Louisiana-Lafayette graduates to embrace civility in a commencement address Friday.
She acknowledged that the speech, which she delivered on what happened to be her 75th birthday, could be her last public address.
The disease is one more fight for Blanco, who recalled facing dozens of opponents in political campaigns, including her early runs for the state legislature and the Public Service Commission. Along the way, she said, she treated opponents with respect, and many of those opponents became dear friends as a result.
“It’s made a huge difference in the quality of my life,” Blanco said. “There is a new intensity coming out of Washington today taking the country into a difficult place.”
At the same time, Blanco didn’t mince words when recounting a part of her mixed legacy that has garnered praise: her relentless struggle to squeeze recovery money from a Republican-controlled federal government after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Blanco said she was frequently met with insults from “haters and obstructionists,” who seemed much more keen on helping the Republican governor of Mississippi, Haley Barbour.
Blanco said she eventually bypassed her partisan nemeses to appeal directly to President George W. Bush. That appeal, Blanco said, yielded an additional $4 billion on top of the $6 billion Congress initially provided. Still, it wasn’t enough. Louisiana would need an additional $3 billion, she said, and she was becoming angry.
“Every time I would go back, I had to steel myself,” Blanco said. “I thought, ‘How much more do we have to take?’”
But the 2006 election had shifted the winds in Washington, and Blanco said she experienced an abrupt difference in the treatment toward her. Suddenly, everyone wanted to help.
“I thought I had died and come back (as) Gov. Haley Barbour. Now I know how he felt,” Blanco said, adding that she considers Barbour a friend.
Blanco remained adamant that Republicans treated Louisiana unjustly in the initial recovery funding rounds, but her description of Washington fickleness illuminated her larger theme: that partisanship and ginned-up anger are harming Americans everywhere, of all persuasions — except those who profit from it.
“Someone, somewhere is profiting off that anger and outrage. They don’t care about us. They are cashing in on anger, and its big business,” Blanco said.
People have a choice, she said, to succumb to anger or to seek “peaceful serenity.”

It’s just unbelievable that a so-called mother can sit there and watch her stupid children treat small puppies as described in the letter. What a pity that she was not identified.
Our concern is: are they safe and well and being looked after now, and do you need any donation to help? We are so distressed, so please advise if there is anything we can do to assist.

Thank you for printing the lady from Grahamstown’s letter - by doing so you brought to my notice - and that of many other lovers of God’s precious voiceless creatures - the actions of this mean-hearted lady sitting on the rocks at Coney Beach, watching her daughters abusing two Jack Russell puppies.
They must be as mean-hearted as their mother! Hopefully and prayerfully the animal anti-cruelty league will step in and fine her. May God direct them where to find her.
In Jesus name I pray. Thank you for printing my letter. May God bless you. Amen.

Play what you enjoy playing most! Even if that is healing – there’s nothing wrong with healing 🙂 And bugger what anyone else thinks. As long as you’re having fun that’s what counts.
Other than that to boost your confidence, read some blogs, look at some similar guilds world of logs reports and see if your spells differ. Check out other characters to see if you’re in the right area for reforging, gemming etc. Remember to check people that are raiding the same thing and level as you – I read something from a priest doing 25 man HC DS whose reforging was completely different to mine, but it was down to the sort of healing they did rather than my getting it all wrong (although I did panic for a couple of nights).
Have fun and relax – I’m sure the numbers will go up to follow. OR join the light side and come heal with me! I work all day with numbers so don’t bother with how much I’m doing – as long as the tanks and a few dps don’t die and the boss does then ‘team heals’ are winning!As the summer moves along, venues for our fall professional development sessions are coming together.

Published April 6, 2016

This meeting, which happens twice a year, has replaced the old format of parent-teacher conferences at Pittsfield Middle High School, a rural New Hampshire campus that takes a “student-centered learning” approach to schooling. With this model, students are given more freedom to connect their individual interests to their academic learning and future goals. Teachers are considered collaborators and coaches, and students are expected to shoulder more responsibility for their school lives—including organizing all the details of these twice-yearly conference with parents and advisers.
Pittsfield began shifting to this student-centered approach after being rated one of the state’s lowest-performing high schools, and qualifying for a federal School Improvement Grant in 2009. It’s also part of a coalition of 13 New England schools that share another $5 million federal grant, and was awarded $2 million from the Nellie Mae Education Foundation in 2012, specifically to foster student-centered learning.
“Kids have to be honest with themselves and I think that’s fantastic,” said Paul Strickhart, who teaches math at Pittsfield and is Colton’s faculty adviser. “They have to own up to why they’re not passing a class, or, if they’re doing well, they have to be able to identify what’s contributing to that and how they can keep going.”

If not for our DTs, I would be somewhat worried about the whole of our interior defense. I think we could still be vulnerable to slant routes, given our inside linebackers and mistake prone safeties.
Preview.
Our safeties are extremely athletic and fairly experienced. They were very highly rated recruits and are now seniors.
On some former teams, we would be talking about these safeties being the top (or one of the top) units on the team. Its just that pretty much every unit on the team this year is loaded.
I think 4's for our safeties is definitely a good ranking. This is a damn good unit.
I have no idea where this degree of concern is coming from. Have you looked at other safety units even on teams like msu and osu...i feel just as good about our situation too.
The only question mark for me is how well they handle the new system. Safety is the position that got the biggest step up in degree of difficulty with Brown's system. But, that goes for anyone, even if Wilson had another year of eligibility. Both guys certainly have the physical tools to do the job. I agree with Brian's assessment that variance goes up this year, but the bad will be offset by an increase in positive plays both as a result of an upgrade in athleticism and scheme.
I haven't really thought much about the safeties. With the talent at DL and CB/Peppers, it's pretty easy to think that LB/Safety play won't be super important. I can definitely see some big plays occuring because of Safety/LB mistakes. I don't think it'll happen too often, but it's something to watch for.
position is important. A great DL may cover up for deficiencies against good, average and bad teams, but not so much against great teams (with great coaching).
Yep—if you have a weakness anywhere it'll get exposed. Good example of how that happens at safety was the South Carolina game, where they just called 4 verticals all day against Wilson (who was a pup back then) and Kovacs (who wasn't cut out for running with those dudes).
but safeties are usually the last hurdle before an offensive player has an open field to a TD. A bad pursuit angle, a mis-played pass by safety when he's helping and boom, all of a sudden a 15-20 yd play can become a huge play.
If you're blitzing a lot (which Brown is known for a bit) it puts some more responsibilites on the safeties to make sure a decent sized play doesn't turn into a back breaker.

Unless you'd like to go to a subscription model (which I doubt anyone wants), Brian & Co. need to sell ad space.

I have never had Comcast myself, as we are in an area with a monopoly by a local provider that coincidentally is also awful. Buckeye Cable. Who would have thought that something named after that team in Columbus would be awful? /s
If Brian will take this as an excellent excuse to link Mr. Hudson's highlight real.
*Checks article*
Yes everything seems to be in order here.
I feel like I've been lead to believe we don't even NEED deep safeties... I mean, with our DL and then all the blitzing Brown is known for, opposing QB's will be lying on their backs about 0.32 seconds after each snap. There literally will be no difference, in terms of what our deep two defenders will be doing, between "defending an opponent's forward pass" and "fielding a wobbling wayward punt."
Do I have that right?
I please get more Peppers?
Oh...and I also gotta have more cowbell.
I like the link demonstrating how Delano Hill's tackling saved first downs on third and medium.
Some big time DT and S recruits in 2017 would be nice.
And the attempt to make light of it with "bolded alter-ego" is just making it worse. You can't be a site that rails against cable companies for years, then puts it as a sponser, and has it feel alright. I mean, I get free money, by all means, take that free money. But do it in an add on the side. Putting XFinity as the header for the post within the post text as the lead image for an article just seems.... yucky..
I appreciate you responded to my comment on it, and not the others (included those from the other day). It doesn't surprise me because you still have some internet bone to pick with me because I disagreed with some of your football analysis. Still, I get that it's "free money" in the middle of the week. I get how the site works, with ads. I even said in my post that I'm fine with their being an XFinity add (sic by self admission), just that it felt odd as the header within the text of the post, I said as much in my post.
But I get it. I'm an ass because I think it being there feels "yucky". Like I said, by all means take free money, it doesn't make it not feel yucky. I'm fairly satisfied where I stand on the "ass" spectrum though when I tried multiple times to reach an olive branch out to you, I've contributed to this site, and in return... well the best you've returned is silence.
By all means, I enjoy the content on this blog. The previews this week have been generally great. Keep that up. Increase the ad content, all for that, especially with how much content you're currently putting out. And keep calling people that contribute input into the comments an "ass" if you want. You'll do fine either way.
Either way, I don't typically make snide comments in the post. I probably shouldn't have this time, that was my mistake. Oh well. I'll live with it.
Also, a friendly suggestion -- you dig a bigger hole with every reference to "free money." You seem to be missing the point -- unless you consider your paycheck "free money" too?
Over what they would otherwise be making, free as in it costs them nothing to make that money (the content would be here either way). And no, I'm not wounded by any of this. It's a blog and a blogger doesn't like me and has not accepted an olive branch I've accepted; generally that has little impact on my life other than acknowledging that hey, at least I tried to own up to my side of things and apologize.
The content might NOT be here either way since Brian might have gotten another job instead to support his kid. You post some insightful stuff, but Brian doesn't owe you a cookie for couple of front board posts and the occasional comment. You are being an ass.
The "free money" comments are especially disrespectful. These guys have put hours on top of hours on top of hours into their business and passion to get it to the point where a major company like Comcast is buying ad space. Nothing is free about all those hours they've put in.
Aaaaannd I see you have a monetized blog on Wordpress, so maybe a little hypocritical on top of all that?
I honestly meant no disrespect by the term "free money". Brian has always put out great and extensive previews prior to the first game, "free money" - which I had associated with getting additional money for doing the same amount of work - was only intended to mean "I understand trying to get additional money for the content he is putting out this week. I thought that was common vernacular and usage, but I appear to be wrong on that. My bad
Do you get all-22 tape for UFR? If not I imagine it's a headache to grade safeties.
All the violence on Khaleke's highlight tape! Never gets old.
Can't find the link to his explanation, but Brian has acknowledged his results-based charting weighs defensive line players more favorably than the secondary BECAUSE he's using a standard football broadcast to judge players. A +4 day for a safety is a great day, while a +4 day for a defensive lineman is just okay...
Then Kovacs came along and kept scoring above +6, so it may have changed.
sitting through that Kahleke Hudson video just makes my joints hurt.
There's going to be an on-field assault warrant out for him next year. He just rocks people and it's amazing to watch.
Easily Jabrill 2.0 in my book.
I have no quarrel with the ads. I do have a quarrel with giving away grabby-hand secrets of our secondary to the refs and blowing the teams cover. First pass interference flag is on you.
We will be super solid up front and on the outside defensively; but the inexperience and lack of speed of the linebackers, coupled with the troubling mistakes of the safeties, will leave us very vulnerable in the middle of the field.
I expect quite a few big chunk plays against us where the linebackers get sucked in on play action or misdirection and the safeties take bad angles or miss tackles on the ensuing pass over the middle. This may be exacerbated by even bigger holes when Brown blitzes from the middle or with a safety.Going Up! – Beach Houses Development Update
Things are progressing quickly at Beach Houses! Block work walls on the unit to the south of the Model Home are complete to the roof slab, while foundations have been cast for the northern unit. Project Manager, Steve Constable shares an update:
“On the southern unit, blockwork walls are complete to the underside of the roof slab and the decking installation has commenced,” reported Constable. ” The roof slab is currently scheduled for concreting in two weeks.”
Following this, the service installation will commence and then cement render to the blockwork walls. Inspection of the electrical earth bonding has now been completed by local authorities which will allow structural work on the pool to continue.
“The foundations of the northern unit have been cast and blockwork walls are complete to the underside of the ground floor slab,” said Constable. “We expect to cast the ground floor slab in mid-July, with blockwork being completed to roof level by early August.. am wondering if there are other Friends practicing holistic/alternative therapies. Has anyone been led to start a group? Have you offered your services through your Meeting? Have you held healing sessions in your Meeting house? Could such a thing be an extension of Pastoral Care, or would it be a ministry in its own right?
Eileen Cain
Thanks for starting this Eileen. I have been wondering the same thing. So many people are confused about the choices out there and don’t know where to begin or how to connect. During sessions, I heard Christie’s vision of like minded people, including businesses, connecting, and I immediately thought of the Quakers who provide healing services and those who need healing. I was a pharmacologist in research for 11 years, but now use that knowledge in investigating and eliminating the causes of chronic diseases and helping the body detox. I use other means of healing, but officially I use an ionic footbath or personal saunas. There is an acupuncturist at my meeting who may also be interested.

John Aubrey: My Own LifeRUBRIK CEMAT INDIA CeMAT India – Intralogistics showcase, embedded in industry Growing at an anticipated 7.5 percent in 2016, the Indian economy continues to go from strength to strength. A lot has happened since the “Make in India” campaign was launched in 2014. By investing in the country’s infrastructure and lowering corporate tax rates, the Indian government has succeeded in attracting a growing number of international investors. Today, India stands not just for services and IT, but also for a commitment to modernizing the nation’s industry, with the goal of ramping up domestic production. Visitors to CeMAT India (1 to 3 December 2016 in Mumbai) can get an initial impression of the competence of Indian industry, with well-known enterprises like Carlstahl Craftsman Enterprises, Kompress India, Nash Robotics & Automation, Rajdlari Storage Systems, Godrej & Boyce, Cascade and Jungheinrich as exhibitors there. Embedded in the WIN India trade fair, these exhibitors will be demonstrating the key role played by intralogistics in automated systems. Manufacturing industries currently constitute only 15 percent of India’s gross domestic product, with a concomitant huge potential for further development. According to the latest information supplied by GTAI (Germany Trade & Invest), private consumption in India is growing fast, resulting in above-average demand for the types of machines needed by consumer-related industries like textiles, chemicals, automotive and packaging. Not surprisingly, online retailing has also been growing in India the last few years. Whereas in 2013, Indian consumers bought some 10.7 billion US dollars’ worth of goods, one year later the figure had gone up by 34 percent, for a total of 16.4 billion, according to pwc. In 2015 sales had climbed to 22 billion dollars, with the curve continuing to point upward. This growth also means higher demands on the supply chain – which brings us to the intralogistics providers showcasing their comprehensive solutions at CeMAT India. The organizers of WIN India are expecting a total of some 200 exhibitors and more than 10,000 visitors at the upcoming event, where there will also be a wide-ranging program of forums on the latest challenges and developments involving the supply chain. The first day of the show will feature a discussion on the topic of “The Supply Chain in a Digital World”. On the second day, presentations and discussions will include techniques and strategies for minimizing supply chain risks, as well as the role that state-of-the-art technologies can play in the modernization process. I wish all of you a successful trade fair, with numerous successful leads, inspiring talks and outstanding business.

Product News User-friendly like a smartphone The MX-1000 series terminals from Cognex offer companies a new way to record data during inventory management and logistic processes, amongst other things. The mobile data recording terminal combines the user-friendly design, low costs and flexibility of a smartphone with a robust, portable unit with an integrated barcode scanner. Stat Control now internationally certified Statistical inventory counts offer significant advantages compared with full inventory counts. They reduce the counting effort and therefore the costs and warehouse closing times, as well as error rates. Stat Control GmbH, a company specialising in inventory software, now has separate certifications for Germany, Austria and Switzerland for the first time. Alongside inventory management, companies are increasingly focusing on monitoring stock during the year. In contrast to value-based inventory counts, stock controls are risk oriented and designed to secure processes, which is where the systems currently offered by Stat Control provide manifold support. The Software Starwarp, for instance, can carry out a riskbased ABC analysis, which uses various factors to categorise stock items into risk clusters.

Sorry to read this, Tracey! I've introduced a number of friends, NZ-wide, to this website. Any chance of your column being picked up by another paper in NZ? Or even Sunday Star Times?
I'm not so great with the network blog system, so will keep checking this site for your very pertinent observations and comments.
My only reason for opening Kapiti Observer has gone with your ceasing to publish your monthly astrology column there. I have enjoyed your writing style all those 14 years, and admire your knowledge and words of wisdom.
Onwards! JanN
hi tracey, well, i for one am super sorry about that, as i thought you had a brilliant column. i also thought it brilliant that the little paper had someone with such talent for their astrology feature. please do monthly blog reports still. they are amazingly valuable to all of your fans. good luck on whatever you do, i know you will be great.
Thanks everyone for the support and your kind comments - it's this kind of response that inspires me to write.
I have a Facebook page too if you are on FB. Just search for Planet Report by Tracey. Otherwise, I will continue to write on this blog.

Tracey, so very sorry to hear the news. I also have put friends in touch with your column and will miss you enormously if you don't manage to continue! (No pressure mind...) What can we do to encourage you further?? I for one would be happy to contribute in some meaningful way if that would assist - I value your insights and interpretations!

Hi Tracey,
I am an avid reader of your monthly horoscopes that were published in the Observer. Can I get a whole 2012 forecast. Obviously I am willing to pay you for this. I am so disappointed they have stopped publishing your planet reports in the Observer, and really hope there is some other way I can get to read them.

I love the planet report. I don't live in NZ but read you online. I hope there is a way for you to keep writing and sharing your amazing insight.

Hi Tracey! I agree with all of the above, and can't even be bothered reading the contributor in the Observer who appears to have replaced you. Their report has neither the relevance nor the pertinance which yours has always had.

Hi Jan, is there another contributor?TOKYO — Nine people were found dead early Monday after their cars were crushed by slabs of concrete that fell from the ceiling of a tunnel in eastern Japan, severing a major highway leading to Tokyo..
The concrete crushed three vehicles, including a van carrying six people that caught fire, filling the tunnel with thick, black smoke. Only one of the van’s occupants, identified as a 28-year-old woman who worked at a bank in suburban Tokyo, was able to escape, the police said.
Firefighters found the bodies of five other people from the van after putting out the fire and determining that the ceiling was safe enough to permit rescue efforts. They also found two other vehicles, one a truck whose driver’s body was found in the cab, the other a sedan carrying three people who were killed.
The truck belonged to a wholesale company, the police said. The 50-year-old driver had called the company right after the collapse to ask for help, but was not heard from again, news reports said.
The collapse caused a long traffic backup on one of the main highways into Tokyo. Television news reports showed smoke billowing from the tunnel entrance as motorists abandoned their cars or tried to turn in the other direction.
Drivers and passengers who got out of the tunnel told the local news media that they had escaped on foot, some leading children for half an hour before they got outside. Sasago Tunnel runs through a mountain near Mount Fuji in Yamanashi Prefecture.
Some of the survivors said that they could hear cries from the trapped cars, but that smoke and fears of another collapse prevented them from trying to help. The bank worker who escaped from the van identified the other occupants as her boyfriend and two other couples, all in their 20s.
“I could hear voices of people calling for help, but the fire was just too strong,” the woman said in an interview with public broadcaster NHK.
The highway’s operator, Central Nippon Expressway Co., said supports made of concrete and metal suddenly gave away, causing a 350-foot section of the ceiling to fall. The company said a routine inspection of the tunnel in September failed to find any signs of danger.
In a news conference at its headquarters in the central city of Nagoya, the company apologized for the accident.
The accident will close a section of the Chuo Expressway, which connects Tokyo to western Japan, for an undetermined length of time. Local news reports said officials would direct drivers to alternative routes through the mountains until the tunnel is cleared and repair work can be completed.
The accident raised questions about whether other tunnels and highway infrastructure built during the construction boom of the 1960s and ’70s are growing too old and need to be strengthened or replaced. Long tunnels — usually lined with smooth, white concrete — are common on highways in the mountainous island nation.
In 1996 a tunnel in Hokkaido in northern Japan collapsed and falling rocks crushed cars and a bus, killing 20 people. Officials said a huge shard of rock weighing about 21,000 tons smashed through the Toyohama Tunnel near Yoichi in western Hokkaido.
In that accident, police referred highway officials to prosecutors for investigation of whether the deaths resulted from professional negligence, but investigators determined that the rock fall could not have been foreseen.
Large earthquakes are common in Japan, but none was reported in the area Sunday.Material from the Associated Press was used in this report.Preorders for Latest HNB E-Cig “Lil” Hit 10,000 in 2 Days

-30-The question of which is the better aircraft is one that has been bandied about ever since the two were designed in the late 1930s. Before the reader consigns this blog to the unread pile thinking 'More of the same' I will dispense with any further preamble and state that, rather than immediately state a preference, I think the wrong question is being asked. Wrong in the sense that one side of the discussion seem to be answering one question, whilst the opposing side are providing answers to what seems to be a different question. Therefore before I go any further I'd like to clarify both questions and attempt to answer them.
At this juncture I would also like to advise the reader that I am 41, a fulltime wheelchair user, and have never piloted an aircraft in my life. I am not a professional historian, thus the source material I base the following statements and conclusions on are the works of those who are professional historians, such as Leo McKinstry, Len Deighton, Patrick Bishop as well as those who actually flew the aircraft; Peter Townsend, Pierre Clostermann, Paul Richey et al. I will not be smothering the following in references for one simple reason; If the reader has got this far (to a degree if they have been interested enough to click on the link to this blog) I am assuming they have a similar knowledge base to myself - if not greater. They will therefore be familiar with all the literature on the subject, and indeed may have authored some themselves. I do however have a lifelong interest in aviation, and history, the two marrying quite successfully in my resulting interest in aviation history and therefore the RAF operations in WWII. My profession is in IT and I hope to bring the logic and analysis I have gleaned from that field to the discussion.
Now to specifics: The first question 'Which is the better aircraft?' would seem to be simple to answer, assuming we judge 'better' in terms of aesthetics, performance, easy of handling etc. In those terms we can quite simply compare the Spitfire and Hurricane's performance and say the former is 30 mph faster than the latter, it has cleaner lines and pilots who flew it say it was a dream to fly. Detractors will point to issues such as the difficulty in taxying due to the long nose necessitating 'fishtailing' the aircraft on the ground as the immediate view ahead was obscured. However this is not a flying issue, and we are talking about an aircraft. Thus we could from this conclude that the Spitfire is the better aircraft. Incidentally throughout this blog I will be using the present tense as flying examples of both aircraft still exist, past tense obviously when referring to wartime events.
In many discussions I have read it seems to me that Spitfire pilots are answering this question.
We now come to the second question, the one which I believe the Hurricane pilots are answering, and to answer this I will be going into the issues in much greater depth. This question is 'Which was the better warplane?'
I would first like to look at the designers of each in brief. At the outset I will state categorically that both R J Mitchell and Sidney Camm were among the best of their generation, and alongside the likes of Roy Chadwick, Barnes Wallis et al formed the bedrock of British engineering which helped see us to victory in the war. Therefore no slight of any kind is intended towards either in the following, and if any is inferred by the reader it is accidental and I offer now my apologies.
Let us start by looking at the problem they were set. Specification F.7/36 produced by the Air Ministry. Without any actual knowledge I am going to suggest what seems logical given the subject, that this was Fighter specification no. 7 produced in 1936. A minor point it may seem but one which may become relevant as you will see. The outline of the brief was to produce a monoplane single seat aircraft 'capable of carrying eight machineguns and a top speed in excess of 300mph'.
R J Mitchell's pedigree was in high performance aircraft - most notably the Supermarine seaplanes which won the Schneider Cup trophy three times in a row for Great Britain thus allowing us to keep the trophy. Upon release of the above specification he set to work and ultimately produced the Spitfire. I mention his pedigree in design as it is germane to the discussion, and I think it is logical that he may have brought all his experience to bear producing a high performance aircraft which could carry guns. Therefore the design emphasis was on performance.
Sidney Camm's design heritage stretched back to WWI in having a hand in designing some of Britain's first fighter aircraft which served in the RFC. In the inter-war years he continued in this vein. Thus when specification F.7/36 was released he set upon it bringing all his experience to bear. However in his case in contrast to R J Mitchell, I think it is likely he prioritised in a different manner, seeing it as a question of 'How do I fly eight machineguns at 300+ mph on a single seater aircraft to the target?'
Thus by having two entirely different ethos' as their basis both designers came up with solutions which, while superficially similar, were in concept markedly different. I think this is encapsulated in the view of one pilot who said 'The Spitfire was a racing car, the Hurricane was a tank, and I know which I'd prefer to go to war in'. The pilot in question was, as you may have guessed, a Hurricane pilot. However I think the point is made quite succinctly.
In terms of 'fitness for purpose' there can be no disagreement that both aircraft performed their function superlatively well, no better illustration can be seen of this than the Battle of Britain in 1940. Some may argue that the Hurricane shot down more German aircraft, however I think I am right in saying that if you factor in the numbers of each type in service at the time, the number of victories was proportionally almost identical (I think about 60% of fighters were Hurricanes, and that's about the same proportion of victories attributed to them).
Another factor is in the more mundane, yet vital, area of maintenance. The Spitfire was (and is) a more advanced and complicated aircraft to build, thus expending more of the scarce resources available to wartime Britain. This however gave it the edge in performance versus the Hurricane. However once constructed it is self-evident they would need maintenance, not least of which would involve refuelling and re-arming between sorties. In this I submit that the Hurricane had the edge not least in two basic areas; to rearm the guns of a Spitfire involved four panels on each wing, these being on the top and bottom taking valuable time. The Hurricane by contrast only required one panel per wing to be opened, on the underside of the wing. As it transpired in the heady days of 1940 this would come to be a vital issue. At some point of course aircraft would need to be transported to an external base for repair, this of course being carried out by road. With the Spitfire this necessitated transporting the wings and fuselage on lorries to the repair establishment. In the case of the Hurricane it was a different matter entirely. The Spitfire's undercarriage was mounted on the wings, a consequence of which was that removal of the wings meant the fuselage had to be transported as a static weight. By contrast the Hurricane's undercarriage was mounted on the fuselage and therefore the wings could be removed and placed on a lorry, and then the fuselage with undercarriage deployed could simply be towed behind it, a much simpler and faster process.
A brief segue is, I think due at this point. The Russians requested assistance from Britain in the form of Spitfires, yet what the British supplied was a squadron of Hurricanes. Initially disappointed by this, when Spitfires later became available to be supplied to them, the Russians apparently responded that they would actually like more Hurricanes. The thought occurs that this may be due to the simplicity of the Hurricane mirroring the Russian design philosophy which dictated - and to an extent still does - function over form. They prized capacity to fulfil the function higher than aesthetics. Also it is likely that the more rugged Hurricane fared better in the harsh Russian climate than the Spitfire would have. That would seem to bear out the maintenance issue. Added to that the preference of Hurricanes in the, albeit brief, Norwegian campaign with their greater rough airfield capability and the Hawker aircraft seems to edge ahead on ruggedness.
Survivability is a key component of a fighter aircraft. The WWII ace Peter Townsend has said 'The Hurricane was composed almost entirely of non-essential components.. I know because I've had all of them shot off'. This suggests that the Hurricane, due to its' simpler and more rugged construction, was better able to soak up battle damage than the Spitfire.
I mentioned earlier that the Spitfire clearly wins on performance, however in the context of combat flying that is not entirely true. In the era of propeller driven aircraft, combat between aircraft was not the modern concept of 'Fire and Forget' missiles, but the much harder to master machine-guns. In this the aircraft had to be pointed at the target whilst firing the guns and crucially stay on target for the duration of the burst. Obviously when I say 'on target' I mean 'in a position where the burst of fire will hit the target' which in terms of deflection meant shooting slightly ahead of the target. One failing of the Spitfire in this was the positioning of the machine guns on the wings. On the Hurricane wing they were evenly spaced in a lock of four on each wing; however on the Spitfire they were unevenly spaced, and this combined with the thinner wing gave rise to a wider spread of bullets, itself coining the phrase 'a spray of bullets' or 'spraying the target..
There has also been much made of longevity of each type. By the end of the war the Hurricane had been superseded by the Tempest and the Typhoon, whereas the Spitfire continued on in service into the early 1950s. Proponents of the Spitfire point to this as proof of its' being superior. However, there is a counter to this argument.
As we know, regrettably R J Mitchell died before his creation even entered service with the RAF, much less before it saw active service in the war. In some ways I think it does him a disservice to suggest that in the next almost two decades that he would not have produced better more advanced designs, building on the success of the Spitfire. Rather than simply produce a stream of modifications to an already extant design, it is my belief that an innovator of the calibre and quality of R J Mitchell would have looked at what other countries - most notably Germany of course - were doing and come up with better ideas of his own. In his absence however it would appear that nobody designed a complete new airframe being content to continually upgrade the existing design. A contemporary example of this is Apple; since the death of the driving force behind Apple's innovation, Steve Jobs, they seem to have been content to tinker with existing designs rather than create anything completely new.
At Hawker, Sidney Camm does not seem to have taken the same approach and his course of action is one which I think R J Mitchell would also have taken had he lived to see it through. While the Spitfire started life as a fighter and - with a minor segue into aerial photographic reconnaissance - ended its' life as a fighter, the Hurricane saw its' path take varying guises; fighter, fighter-bomber, tank-buster, a ground attack role with rockets, and even in use protecting merchant shipping convoys as a catapult launched fighter. I have excluded 'carrier borne fighter' from both as I am not aware of any instances where either type were specifically borne aboard aircraft carriers for the specific purpose of defending the fleet (The Seafire although derivative being a different aircraft to the Spitfire). Thus it proved not only more than adequate in its' original role. but uniquely adaptable and versatile for other uses. However Camm saw what was happening in military aviation and could see when the Hurricane had reached the end of its' life-cycle, at which point he replaced it with the Typhoon and Tempest to keep pace with the enemy's progress. In Leo McKinstry's excellent 'Hurricane' he points out that Sidney Camm had a hand in the Hawker-Siddley Harrier, and I have little doubt that R J Mitchell would have similarly been at the forefront of aviation innovation for decades to come.
Finally, I do not want this blog to read as though I prefer one aircraft over the other, but as an even-handed appraisal of the two. In summary I do think the Spitfire is a better aircraft, but for combat purposes - after all was the whole purpose of specification F.7/36 was to design a fighter aircraft - I think the Hurricane edges it.
Lastly this is not related to performance or indeed how good each aircraft type is in a particular context. It is related to the justification for the Air Ministry initially ordering twice as many Hurricanes as Spitfires. Britain being an island relied on imports for some materials, while for others supply was very much finite, as was labour. The Hurricane took 5000 hours to construct, the Spitfire 13000, and in Germany the Messerschmitt bf109 a mere 4000. Given that in practice the Spitfire and Hurricane were approximately equal in number of aircraft they shot down in their first real test - The Battle of Britain - I do wonder at the thought processes which accepted an aircraft - the Spitfire - which took almost three times as long to build, with a consequential increase in cost and delay in production. This at a time when both money and resources were at a premium. Surely cost and simplicity shoud have been part of the brief? Curious.+ Free Slots: these are online slots you can play for free. ..

"How are you losing weight before the wedding?" With my wedding six months away, I'm mentally prepared for the day when someone asks me this and I'm mentally committed to giving it - always the topic, maybe sometimes the person - a big screw you.
I've seen more than a few perfectly thin and fit women struggle to answer this beast of a weight loss question and I had no idea how to help because I was busy picking my jaw up off the floor. It's a question that circulates freely- at engagement parties, dress fittings, bridal showers, and it's perfectly comfortable living in sync with basic wedding prompts like where are you registered? It's a theory that is totally supported with runway shows and photo shoots where model brides are bone thing (but never smiling); it's a topic that has about 132 million google searches between "skinny bride" and "wedding diet."
The expectation is that you should prepare for the happiest day of your life with a good dose of weight loss. And being totally crazy in theory, it yields totally crazy behavior in reality. Brides taking weight loss pills, brides eradicating calories, brides deteriorating in physical and mental form before the wedding.
I am by no means above bridal pressures. I just had my first dress fitting and felt as nervous as I would going on a first date simply at the thought, "this dress took months to come in, and now, it might not zip up."
But, there's a difference between feeling all these bridal anxieties and letting them take over. I'm not going to celebrate this highly happy engagement by talking about losing weight or by trying to lose weight. They don't mix. The topics should be divorced.
What I'll support with a whole hearted yes: the idea of feeling as amazing as I can on my wedding day, and leading up to it. Which for me means eating first and foremost, but also maintaining my common sense, which knows that...
- Eating healthily gives me the energy to work full time, workout, blog and plan my wedding, as well as gives me the bandwidth to enjoy the journey.
- Doing yoga gives me a clear mind and stress relief.
- Drinking green juice in the morning makes me feel great for the rest of the day (thank you Kimberly Snyder).
- Having a great red wine at night...but not every night and not a whole bottle... is awesome
- Getting 7-9 hours of sleep is key because I'm unfortunately very much like an 8-year old girl on the sleep front and get grumpy when deprived.
- Getting stronger and toned with cardio and weights in torture-free, rewarding workout classes makes me happy. Thank you Barry's Bootcamp and Recycle in particular.
These are things that make me not just healthy and fit, but the best version of me. And at the end of the day, my fiancé fell in love with that. Not a skinny bride.If you want to learn everything there is to know about bugs, become an entomologist.

Your child has a developed self-awareness by now and is beginning to understand that she is a person in her own right. She develops preferences, realizes that certain rules govern the world and begins to understand the scope and limits of her control and the impact of her behavior.
The ability to influence the world and cause things to happen directly affects your baby’s self-esteem and development. As your child begins to discover her power, and learns to use it, she will make demands – that you read her a book, push the swing, or give her a cookie. All this is accomplished non-verbally, but the message is very clearly communicated!
Baby's connection with her mother or primary caregiver intensifies at this stage. She feels that she is at the center of the universe and expresses jealousy when she isn't the main focus of your attention. On the other hand, baby asserts more independence and confidence. The mother or caregiver becomes a secure base from which she explores her world and expands her horizons, and to whom she returns to get a "refill" of encouragement. During this period, separation anxiety manifests itself strongly.The Family Floor has been designed with two individual rooms equipped with two double beds sharing a common area with a sofa set and a table along with an LED TV.

Tag: Palermo Foodie / Foodie PalermoDespite talks and debates of SEO being outdated and no longer useful, it is still relevant and can be synchronized with social media for attaining desired results. The increasing inclusion of social media within search engine results reveals the importance of social media in influencing decision making. Also, this implies search engines too, concede to the fact that social media is crucial.
For higher visibility in search engines, it becomes inevitable to infuse social media within the framework of your SEO strategy and enjoy viable traction. Today, SEO has evolved beyond keywords and link building while steering well optimized content across a diffused based of viewers across diverse platforms.
Higher viewership statistics across various social media platforms imply better traffic and high chances of conversions. This makes it imperative to gain/acquire high level of insights about the product/service in offering in midst of the social media viewer base
How to sync social media strategy from the SEO perspective –
Content
SEO Perspective – Even today, content is the king, be it SEO friendly website content or posts uploaded across social media channels. Remember, the content should have a high ‘instant connect’ factor. Of course, it should be reader friendly and as relevant as possible.
Social Media Perspective – Valuable content can be and has to be shared. Your website should have in place social media share buttons for Google+, Pinterest, Linkedin, Twitter and even Facebook enabling readers to click on them and share the content they found useful with others.
Also, remember your focus should be on the number of ‘shares’ and ‘retweets’ rather than on ‘likes’ garnered. To put it simply, social media has taken the place of word of mouth marketing which was quite prevalent before the ecommerce era. For more tips on how to increase content related shares and retweets, you can check the following post (please add our post) 6 Ways to Create Content Your Readers Will Share.
Images & Videos
SEO Perspective – Though images and videos fall in the content bracket, they have to be considered separately and emphasized upon greatly. If images and videos are creatively made and optimized they rank well in the search engines too. Ensure they are named well as per SEO parameters viz. filename, text surrounding image, image linking, alt text and keywords making them visible in relevant search
Social Media Perspective – Make sure the images/videos you upload are not only informative, relevant but even practical in approach. They should be capable of generating interest and encourage shares amongst viewers. It makes sense to be proactive and share them across multiple image and video sharing sites such as Instagram, Flickr, Pinterest, TwitPic and so on. Also, remember to upload images/videos in formats which are compatible across multiple devices.
Finally, it makes sense to keep the end user in mind when finalizing the images or videos, after all they are the ones who will be viewing. To be on the safe side, use creative images and videos but avoid highly abstract ones which are likely to be misconceived by the viewers.
Profile and Engagement Quotient
SEO Perspective – Each one of us knows Google’s (major search engine) affinity towards quality content. It is advisable to set up your authorship profile complete with the required information especially real name and a high quality image of yourself.

SuperFreakonomics touches on many subjects, describing interesting studies on things like altruism, suicide bombers and global warming.
First, let me state that I enjoyed the book. It contains plenty of good insights, and makes use of economic reasoning in a way that is often thought-provoking and inspiring. The anecdotes and studies are interesting, and the conclusions — as in Freakonomics — sometimes surprising and always different than the “mainstream view”.
Basically, if you enjoyed Freakonomics, you will enjoy SuperFreakonomics. It is essentially more of the same, which is not a bad thing. However, given the plethora of similar books on the market, it is not as surprising or fresh as Freakonomics was when it came out. Tim Harford and Steven Landsburg (and others) have written excellent books in the same vein, and I am starting to feel that the genre could do with some innovation.
The chapter that stands out is the one on global warming. It has gotten some critique from the religious part of the environmental movement for being overly skeptical — a critique I would argue misses its target. The authors take the problem seriously, but propose technological measures rather than political. It’s a much needed perspective. Perhaps I’ll come back to the issue in the future — it’s a topic that deserves a series of blog posts rather than a summary statement in this space.
In conclusion I’m happy to recommend the book, especially if you haven’t read too many books in the genre (or, like me, can not get enough of it!).

This bar and bistro has been on my radar for a while, not only are the reviews great but my cousin is great friends with the head chef so I was over due a visit.
Nestled back on the pavement on Clapham Common this little place is pretty unassuming from the outside but once you step through the door you feel like you are entering the dinning room of a great friend or relative.
All the tables are laid with pretty plates and odds and ends of cutlery, no fork or knife matches but it adds to the perfect uniqueness of the atmosphere The Dairy has.
You are greeted as though you are long lost friends and given the menu.
Divided into categories, Land, Sea and Cheese you are presented with a selection of tempting dishes. Most of the veg, alongside the honey come from the rooftop garden and bee hives on the roof - pretty impressive!
We decided to go for the Tasting Menu. You don't have to opt in for this but I would highly recommend it.
For £45 per head you get a really feel for all the dishes and flavor that the head chef is trying out at the moment and don't have to fumble around trying to pick the best combination of dishes on your own.
(photos are now a little grainy, my phone was all I had!)
We oooed over the menu with a couple of the house cocktails, I went for a Dill Gin & Tonic, he went for an apple concoction. Both were delicious and decidedly quirky.
First up were deep fried anchovies with Lemon gel. A little morsel of crunchy deliciousness
Next up was, Cheltenham Beetroot, Hemp Seeds and Kalamata Olives...
Then Hay smoked curd with Jerusalem artichoke and Chanterelles..
The bread course followed. This was an excellent part of the meal. Each table gets a little loaf of sourdough, that you tear and share and spread with the marrow butter, chicken liver mousse and salumi.
Crispy chicken, celler kimchi and burnt kale...wonderfully crispy and tangy too.
West coast turbot, scorched plumbs (these were delicious) salsify, cavolo nero and cobnuts.
Next up was smoked cod, charred leeks and sorrel.
The meat course next...The photo for this was really just too grainy so my description will have to suffice. Presented on a warm marble plate we had tender venison with game sausage and melt in the mouth celeriac.
Really delicious and just the perfect amount. Leaning back and rubbing filling bellies had begun but we still had a few courses to go...
Of course we opted in for the cheese course (always room for this).
Brie smothered over walnut bread with lashings of truffle on top.
A real must for the tasting menu, nicely separating the savory from the sweet courses up next.
Just look at those lashings of truffle, and gooey brie... ^
The first sweet on the menu, Russet apple sorbet, chia seeds and sorrel ice.
Last up, a fantastic final dish... Salted caramel, drizzled over cacao and chocolate crumb.
This place is really a fantastic lunch time treat. You will have a feast of flavors and certainly not be disappointed.

Now for one of my latest dilemmas. I had to write a journal for technical communications, and in the assignment, it indicates that my first paragraph is to be a summary of the short story I had to read. A summary... I've spent the past five years or so getting pounded with anti-summary demands. I feel a little... shocked. I sat for so long with ms word open - trying to type - and I couldn't seem to write a summary knowing that I was about to analyze the story. It just seemed so wrong. No worries. I got it done.

I've been in a rather dreadful mood since Sunday night. I played basketball - lots of running - and I'm not sure if you're aware, but I hurt my knee at the end of December. Running seems to irritate it, and I think that might be partly why I'm grouchy. It hurts pretty bad, so walking or riding my bike also can cause pain. Whatever though. I'm sure I'll be fine. I just wish I could be in a good mood again though. I don't really know how to fix it.When he started cutting hair 10 years ago, Tom Archino knew that one day he would open his own business. That day has arrived. Archino on Oct. 1 debuted ThomasDavid Salon in Paynters Mill in Milton.
â€œWeâ€™re focused on everything having to do with hair: cuts, color, perms, texturizing, keratin smoothing treatmentsâ€”you name it,â€ says Archino , whoâ€™s been a stylist for more than 10 years. â€œItâ€™s everything that I do well.â€
In addition, the salon plans to offer skincare services, including facials performed by an esthetician.
Formerly a stylist at Bling and Bad Hair Day, Archino saw a need for offerings that are both affordable and approachable. Cuts start at $40; color services start at $45.
â€œWe want to appeal to people who want high quality services but donâ€™t want to pay resort prices,â€ Archino says. He points to young parents with children who are watching their budgets.
He chose the Milton location because itâ€™s convenient to neighborhoods both east and west of Route 1 and north and south of Milton. The salon is easily accessed from the highway but far enough from traffic to serve as a peaceful retreat.
The 1,800-square-foot space is open and airy with room for six stylists at contemporary-looking black stations, some of which are freestanding. Guests are greeted at a custom-made desk with sleek Apple computers, which are outfitted with a software system that lets guests book online.
Featured products include the Enjoy Hair Care, Coppolaâ€™s Keratin Complex Hair Smoothing System and Natrique Hair Color, an ammonia-free coloring cream.
